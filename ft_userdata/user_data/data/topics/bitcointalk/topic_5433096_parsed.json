In crypto, anything like hack is no more a surprise. Hackers are moving from hacking exchanges to DeFi but exchanges are still also hacked.For crypto custodial, not your key not your coin is no more a lesson.",

They have native token that is not trade-able even though it has a huge market cap. This is a mediocre exchange with fake high volume. But if you are looking for a high tier exchange then Binance or Huobi is next in line. Binance is being target by US government,  I’m they will not gonna let CZ run freely. Huobi listed scam PI token in IOU, this is the most shittiest listing since they are scamming user on listing scam token in IOU form.",

It's going to be like a sequence just as what happened last year. We don't know what exchange is going to be next or any crypto firm that's into business that will follow these bail out that came from 2022 and up to early this January 2023.Quote from: talkoncrypto Official on January 05, 2023, 09:11:34 AMCrypto firm Juno urges users to withdraw after ‘uncertainty’ with custody partnerThese exchanges should stand on their own and not too dependent on their custody partners.

This is very unfortunate, closing their business because of too much relying on its partner due to its uncertainty of whatever reasons it is. We're just talking a single partner here that cost too much (closing) for the business. Well, good thing they care to their users and announce before its doom.",

Although, there seems to be an awfully constant trend of centralized exchanges going bonkers so I wouldn't be surprised if one of those gets \"hacked\" again.Hacking, bankruptcy, etc. can happen to any central exchange platform, regardless of its strength, so users have to be wiser because they are the first losers if some disaster happens. The FTX platform has now ended its story and its currency died and in turn, affected the crypto market and millions of users lost their funds so yes this is a harsh lesson and it can be repeated in Juno and other centralized exchanges, for me, I relieve my mind of anxiety by paying some fees to buy a hardware wallet and hold my cryptocurrencies in complete safety in an offline mode without holding them on an exchange platform which is liable at any moment to fall and collapse, this is the simple solution",

Huobi listed scam PI token in IOU, this is the most shittiest listing since they are scamming user on listing scam token in IOU form.My opinion of the listing of PI is that Huobi did not make a mistake. Since all exchanges manupulate the market and identify scams early, Pi, a token with no solid use case, won't surprise me if news gets out that the exchange holds more than 70% of the tokens with the help of a few whales and will good money from the coin. There is only one advantage to the exchange, which is its limitation in the part of the world that uses it. In my opinion, Binance will not have it easy with the United States government, and I hope he succeeds.",

This is a very dangerous indicator.Huobi also canceled all employee bonuses and reduced the salaries of other employees, forcing them to take their salaries in fixed coins instead of fiat.I don't know but there is a lot of bad news and mysterious things going on in Huobi, so I don't rule out that it could be the next exchange unless they find a solution to all these problems.",
