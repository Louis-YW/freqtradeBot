According to this news, 3rd Oct: Quote from: https://guardian.ng/news/cooking-gas-scarcity-looms-as-price-hits-n1000-per-kg/amp/The Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM) had in August 2023 said there is a possibility of a surge in the price of cooking gas due to the hike in the foreign exchange rate and activities in the international market.The association said rising international prices, high tax rates, prices of vessels, forex scarcity and naira devaluation were some of the reasons for the price review.Speaking on the long-term effect of the scarcity on Nigeria’s economy, Emmanuel said: “The long term effect of scarcity because of the shortage of bulk storage terminals, companies in the midstream importing product are hoarding for the purposes of price speculation and FX volatility, is that prices will continue to rise per KG.”But as naira continue to depreciate should most likely be known to be one of the reasons. Scarcity and companies that are hoarding it have been parts of the reasons.",

I never try am sha but I go like make all of una try check am. Lastly, we should all add Nigeria to our prayers everyday because this country will not grow if we just sit down and don't do anything.Please stop blaming the government over mediocre stuff. First lets do some review on how gas price surge to this level.We need to understand that the government don't subsidized cooking gas as they does back then with petrol, so the marketers import the LPG(Liquified petroleum gas) and sell slightly above what they bought at the international price, they can sell at any how price because there is body that regulate sales price for all the marketers. The reason why we saw increment in sales of price of gas was because the price of crude oil has increase and that makes all the refined product from crude oil to increased in price as well, not only the price of gas that has increase, the petrol has increased as well but there speculation that the federal government has resume subsidizing of the petrol and that is why the price has remain the same, the marketers are not fools to sell at loss.From the chart, you can see the price of oil was trading around $94 towards the end of September and that was when marketers raise their prices, the price went down to $84 but now it is currently trading around $87 as of today, so expect the price of petroleum product to reduce a little. This is not the first time price of gas does fluctuates, it goes up and down, its not a static market.In addition to the price increment, the dollarization of the country is getting to an edge where solution need to be profound before things go out of hand, the naira has been depreciating against dollar which is also bad for people that import goods to the countries, if they sell gas in local currency and dollar increases, it means they will add more money to their capital before they can buy anything.Various alternative means to get gas has been carried out and many research has been done but they have been abandoned. Do you know why?That's because:1. Cost of production energy might exceed the throughput.2. Not readily available for masses.3. They are not as clean as the LPG gases, there is possibility of more treatment after extraction of those gases because home gas is not a pure butane but propylene + Isobutane+ propane + butylene and butane. It's possible that other sources might not have these constituents or might even have an effluent which need adsorption to remove the contaminants.The cost of gases might become affordable for poor man if the government interven and subsidize it but I doubt if the current government has any plan to do so right now.",

I never try am sha but I go like make all of una try check am. Lastly, we should all add Nigeria to our prayers everyday because this country will not grow if we just sit down and don't do anything.If it is about the economy of this country, it is going from terrible to worse and most of the decisions the government is making are affecting the people and they are not bothered what irritates me the most is the fact that all these unions are not doing or saying anything I believe there will come a time when the people will have to take matters into their own hands at least when everyone decides not to go to work then they will listen to people labor has planned for a strike but once they greece there palms they will keep quite. According to statistics from 2020 to now, 5kg of gas was around 1000 nairas, and now 5kg of gas is going for 5000 nairas, with plans to raise it to 1200 per kg. What a country, the only solution I see is to switch to other methods of cooking, such as firewood or coal, because how do you expect people to survive? and you making use of the alternatives also means you planting trees.",

If one does not have to experience the current high price themselves, they would think we are making a fuse about the high prices and the rate at which a dollar now exchanges with the Naira.We will survive Las las o!",
