I checked to see if their presence is registered here but none and they have no representative here to answer for them whatever the case maybe. Members have been advised to do with casinos whose presence are registered here for easy conflict resolution but it seems  as the day  goes more cases of unpopular casinos pop up here waiting for urgent settlement. Another is the issues of evidence. It was stated somewhere in another post by a participant that members should always take a screenshot of their Winnings and also any process that seems fishy displayed by any casino they identify with so as to have records because of the actions and inactions of casinos of lately. The issues of account suspension and Lock down as a result of winning is getting out of hand.",

This you should know to get registered with casinos whose presence are noticed here so as to be in the safe side. It is also advised that you should always do a thorough research on them before getting registered and as well check for reviews about the casinos so you could know people's views about them that will also give you hint on their activities and too their customer care service.",

OP brought the complaint here as a result of him been scammed. If he was not scammed would he have brought it here? Would he have even opened an account to  make a complaint. Here is not the right baord for his complaint and accusations as it has to do with scam. The casino presence is not registered here as it is an unpopular casino. That is why members are advised to only deal with casinos with presence here onboard this platform so that when issues arises, it can be amicably resolved.",

That's a piece of nice advice, and unfortunately, I just found an online community to which this casino belongs, (I.e Askgambler.com) and they have a minimum of 2 days to respond to complaints. So I think if O.P can forward his/her complaint to this forum, there can be positive feedback.

Is it the welcome bonus? Because that seems like the only reason which can explain this behavior, and if that is the case then gamblers need to learn to ignore those bonuses as it is simply not worth to try to get them when you have to risk your money and even your personal information in this way.",
