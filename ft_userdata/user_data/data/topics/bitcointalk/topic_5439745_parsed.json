      "body": "Valentine’s day is a day of love that has been around for centuries, through time Valentine's Day has become the \"Hallmark Holiday\" for marketing purposes. From kids passing chocolates or little valentine's day note cards to their classmates. To teenagers purchasing a single red rose to give their crush as a secret admirer. To adults lavishly spending big bucks on an arrangement of flowers to diamonds, and maybe a proposal in a fancy restaurant. I can only imagine how much profit, for example a chocolate company or diamond company brings in celebration of Valentine’s Day. To my opinion love is celebrated on a daily basis and giving gifts for love can be given any day out of the year.",
