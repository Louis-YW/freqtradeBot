Proof Of Stake is centralized and it never been a good protocol due to centralized.True, it's been years of discussion, even prior to the pandemic, we have heard about ETH 2.0 and it's numerous delays and roadmap. But still the high ETH gas fees was not resolved. And on the other hand, it become more centralized that ever.Quote from: Apocollapse on August 05, 2023, 09:01:56 AMThe best undervalued crypto right now is Bitcoin.It is because we are still in the bear market.

It's the believed of Vitalik that Ethereum will be more secure if they go POS. That was his statement 4 years ago, before this whole mess with the exorbitant gas fees. But looking back right now, it just make Ethereum worst and more centralized, so there is a trade off the Vitalik is referring to, security vs centralization.So you will be the judge whether he achieved something or not.As for the undervalued crypto, it's a guessing game right now. We could recommend something but it might not be big in the future.The best approach is to really do your own research.",

I too am not optimistic about the future of Ethereum as a utility token. They have been trying to fix problems for years yet the chain is still unusable with large fees and congested networks. Newer alternatives provided better performance and efficiency in low price. And with interoperability and use of similar languages to code, there's no lack of experience. We'd see ETH lag behind on coming bull.",

Not all opinion can be the same for every developer out there. Plus why can make only one if there is freedom to develop their own version. This is likely the case since every project developer out there wanted to point out flaws of others and feels like they can do much better. Since its a decentralized space, we could see more of this being combine and created a sophisticated network.",

ETherereum community will continue to hide under the radar of gas fees, they have dodge that question multiple times because of it sensitivity because they know that Ethereum chain can't scale without rewritting the code from beginning and doing that is just like abandoning the chain and starting a new one entirely, we have seen countless hardfork of in the past and there is no improvement and that makes me think that Ethereum cannot be scale without the interaction of sidechains as the layer 2 and this is why Ethereum has remain the same in development except for DEFI but seems to be more interesting on other chains.Many people will claim that Ethereum chain is more secure but I think that was when it was still in proof of work, you can't tell me that Ethereum is secure when it is now centrealized more than ever, if one of the biggest validator should exit and commmit fraud, it will affect Ethereum price by 50% but they are all blind with the believe of commitment of previous people who held into proof of work. Because a dog is mad and silent doesn't mean it cannot bite the owner one day.Lastly, asking for suggestion of alternative coins to ETH is like asking for a financial advice, that will lead you astray and the chance of making something great from there will be difficult. I will advice you do your own research like the way you mount up good effort in finding Ethereum chain, you will do well in other layers that are undervalue in the market, you can get a coingecko app on your own phone and see for the list of coins in the market.",

But no one ever said that changing the consensus itself would fix the problem. The commission problem in the ETH network can be fixed by sharding and rollups. The only thing that has changed since the consensus change is the level of centralization and censorship of transactions. The network has become much more censorable. In general, so far, except for promises, the ETH network does not show anything good, if we are talking about scalability and commissions.",

There's one inherent issue that both Bitcoin and ETH suffer and that's the inability to scale the networks when the demand for computing resources peaks. ETH thought it could solve this problem but it's an ongoing problem that is yet to be fixed (the blockchain trilemma). L2 are simply scaling ideas that are yet to make a huge statement.For other altcoins, the best bet over the years has been getting newer tokens which are hyped as the next best thing and dump it when it has gotten to peak price.",
