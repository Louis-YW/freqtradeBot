      "body": "It's going to be hard to trust a new, small PPLNS pool. Especially after what happened with mmpool. To mine via your own pool is to risk waiting years before a block is found, and to potentially pay for electricity during those years, with no guarantee of the longevity/stability of your pool, and no guarantee that you will pay your miners for the block. What would I do if I pay my electricity during 2 years and your pool become offline for example ? Probably being f..I like and support small pools. I only mine with kano and ck.solo pools. But what's the point of a miner joining your pool? The kano pool already offers everything you do, a PPLNS pool, but with the guarantee of being stable, safe, trustable and you know who you're working with. I think could join kano almost anytime on his Discord server and he would help me if I had any issue. Even with the average 20 PH/s on his pool, the last block was found like 600 days ago. It is a very unlucky situation, but at the same time, very common for all the pools (a 300% of work done until block). What would happen if you have like to wait 300% of work done until your pool find the first block ? It will takes years, with only such small hashrate.Otherwise, your site doesn't even give any contact details in case your miners have a problem, and you don't even mention the location of your nodes.What's with this \"every two minutes\" payout? A block is found on average every 10 minutes, so what's the point of a payout every two minutes? Just want to understand the logic behind this.I understand the fact of wanting to build your own pool, it's an interesting thing to do and it's satisfying. On the other hand, I don't understand those who would take the risk of mining on this pool, without wishing to sound harsh.",
