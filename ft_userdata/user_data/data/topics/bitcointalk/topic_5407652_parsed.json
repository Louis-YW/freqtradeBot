      "body": "Is a war in Europe possible? Yes. But I doubt the US would be pushing for it because that would ruin their economic status as they are dependent on what globalization offers, and it offers much more than they are willing to sacrifice. The world is much more globalized and dependent on one another than it was at the time of WWI when the US took over the global economy.",
