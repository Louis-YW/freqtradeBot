  "content": "DApp | Discord | Twitter | Medium | Crew3Demmi messenger was created to provide the possibility of confidential communication of Internet users. Any currently existing messenger, even if there is some kind of encryption, in any case works through centralized servers. That is why you can send a complaint to a user's message, even by accident. Thus, the user can absolutely accidentally send confidential information to the moderators for verification. There is no need to talk about any anonymity here. Moreover, the messenger account is usually linked to the user's phone number. Indeed, it is possible to register an account on a virtual phone number, however, this virtual number will also be provided by a centralized service that can send all the information somewhere. There are a lot of ads on the Internet for the sale of user data. Thus, under a good pretext, the information does not go where we are promised. The Demmi messenger does not have any servers, it works on the Binance Smart Chain, all encrypted information is stored in transactions.How to use: https://discord.gg/yTagWc7BjR",
