May I know which one? On mycelium mobile wallet, it has fee auto-set according to your priority. Also, better use a native-segwit (bech32) type address than the typical legacy one.The current average bitcoin transaction fee is: 0.000048 BTC ($0.817) Edit: Wow, 462 activity and still a newbie (no merits), seems like you are not interested in anything in the forum except bounties ðŸ˜‚",

In wallets, you have the leverage to set and adjust your fees either by numbing it to meet the memory demand for a speedy transaction but on an exchange, its always determined by the exchange which is often relatively high. A $10+ but, your certain of a speedy confirmation time.From your raised concern to be receiving your rewards on BSC, that's customary to binance which is an exchange.If your concerned about the fees, you can as well swap coin to your preferred alt and process with a less fee. Not the best of advice though but it works at times. Better still, use a Bitcoin wallet where you can set the fee you want and bump and broadcast the fee as you want to get a faster transaction.",

I did some research and found out that I can move my btc private key to another wallet, But I don't know if it's safe or not, I can use this and wait for my other btc payments and then move.How many BTC payments have you received so far?Because each of those inbound transactions are saved as separate \"unspent txn output\" (UTXO) in the blockchain.And when you need to send all of your funds, the transaction will have to use all of those UTXO as input;each added input increases the total size (in virtual Bytes) of your transaction.The higher the vSize, the higher the absolute transaction would be, for example:If your transaction's size is 10000 vBytes for having a lot of inputs and your fee rate is 5sat/vByte, the total fee will be: 50,000sats or 0.0005 BTC.On the contrary, if your transaction has a low size of 200 vBytes, the total fee for 5sat/vByte will only be: 1000 sats or 0.00001 BTC.",

That is one of the reasons it is advisable to send the coins entirely to an open source wallet before believing the coin safety.",

Also try coin control features and wallets that allow you to decide fees instead of getting stuck in a wallet that asks you to pay a fixed fee.This is very important when planning to transfer your Bitcoin into another wallet and also, this.I usually used mempool upon checking the Bitcoin network status, it's fine to pay $0.2 or $0.3 in a single transaction because it's expected that you need to cover your fees when transferring your Bitcoin. Â Using Electrum as suggested above is the best option because you can manually input the fees even if it's 2 sat/vB which at this moment it cost $0.05. Â But the problem is it might take a couple of days before it will confirm but unlikely it will not be stuck forever.I assume that you need to transfer your Bitcoin on an exchange platform to trade it into fiat or altcoins. So your problem now is to transfer your Bitcoin into the exchange with a less fee. Â You can set your transaction into 1-5 sats fees, but don't expect your transaction becomes quick, luckily if it will confirm within 24 hours if the mempool isn't congested because you're in a low priority.",
