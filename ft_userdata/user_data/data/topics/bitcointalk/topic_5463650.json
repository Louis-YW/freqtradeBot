This move has further set BTC price to dangle on the precipice because as at yesterday, the digital currency was trading at $28,565.28 but fell sharply to $25,392.05 Thursday night before rebounding to $26,685. In the space of 10mins, it's price falls down to levels only experienced since June 20!  Although, there's no clear cut reason as to why he did it, this is just a bad time for him to develop cold feet and sell because it could trigger other institutional investors to follow suit.I wonder if this move was borne out of a lack of confidence or just a temporary move by Space X because Elon Musk's moves can be flaky sometimes.https://www.investors.com/news/elon-musks-spacex-news-sends-bitcoin-tumbling/",

Also, it could potentially impact the market sentiment and the price of Bitcoin, depending on the amount of Bitcoin they hold and the market's reaction.",

Hopefully as many have said, this dip is temporary and hopefully everyone here can get buy bitcoin while it's still in this state.",

Perhaps they were liquidating the position because they lacked cash for subsequent flights? maybe they needed liquidity for something else? Selling off a big player does not always mean that the market is doomed to fall. By the way, this is what I saw on twitter today:https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1692295710962483253Chatgpt:Quote\"wrote down\" means that SpaceX officially reduced the value of their owned Bitcoins. In this case, the term \"wrote down\" refers to the action of decreasing the value of assets, such as Bitcoin, in the company's accounting records. This might indicate that the company recognized that the value of their owned Bitcoins has decreased since their initial purchase.In short, SpaceX officially decreased the value of their Bitcoins in their financial documents, likely due to the decline in the value of Bitcoin since their acquisition. However, it's important to note that this action doesn't necessarily mean that SpaceX sold their Bitcoins; it simply means that they chose to lower their value in their accounting records.So they bought higher, now it's cheaper, they recorded a paper loss of $ 300 million in the books. They did not sell bitcoin for $ 300 million. There is no proof they sold even a single bitcoin.So its all one big fake news made by market manipulator to help close big short, that triggered this massive dump, on profit?",

It may be because of that small sell off of 373 million usd worth of Bitcoin. This is not the first time we saw a dip in price of Bitcoin, there were more sever Blood bath Bitcoin has seen till date. May be its good time to accumulate some more Bitcoin but many of us will start speculating that Bitcoin will go further down and its not good to buy Bitcoin right now.",

All of them have been referring to the sale of $373 million worth of BTC by Elon Musk's company and using Space X's official statement to back this up.Nonetheless, it should baffle anyone how the worth of just $373 million plummeted Bitcoin price that much, yet the psychology behind it isn't far-fetched. The truth is that the economics of the market works differently with different psychology and sentiment. Ordinary rumour could cause a ripple effect in the market, not to talk of action, while some actions are often overrated by speculators.With yesterday's deal, it's not about the worth but the person/company behind the sale. Elon Musk has been kind of idolised when it comes to cryptocurrency, if his words could move the market so much, how much more is his action?",

      "body": "-     In my understanding of that article link, this is said to be the reason for the fall in the value of Bitcoin in the market. Because the 371M$ worth of Bitcoin is said to have all been sold. But the problem is that it is still unconfirmed, you know that in these times, what people always read in the news are just headlines. And the journalists, they need to exaggerate the headlines to get more attention.So without verifying the actual fact, people will panic sell the public companies because they release public documents on their public activities and that's where the profits and expenses of the companies can be seen. in 2021 because Elon Musk acquired an announcement about the public firm certain amount of Bitcoin during these times. That they plan to buy this time 1.5B$ and this also caused the increase of Btc during these timesBut this 2023, the sold worth of Bitcoins will be around 184M$, although this is not a big bad news in the market. It's not like Saylor dumping Bitcoins. And it is also not clear why this report came out and why only now? Because the market structure is already bearish and if negative news hits it, it will fall even more, that's as simple as that to understand.",

But the strange thing is that this news has been revived and is said to be the cause of this bitcoin dumping. It's too easy for people to believe what the media says without doing any research. Moreover, $ 373 million is not too large a number to make the market fall into such extreme panic, with the naked eye we can also speculate and realize that is not the real reason. Why don't we make our own deductions, but only believe what the press reports? Are we too easy for someone to manipulate?I found this news from social network X and according to the Wall Street Journal, SpaceX has been selling these bitcoins since Q1.",

The price of Bitcoin has no reason to fall, especially now that too many rumors are circulating in the community so we might catch the wrong news.So it's better not to think too much about what is causing the Bitcoin price to fall so deeply right now. If you are a long-term Bitcoin investor, you shouldn't care about price movements but will see when your opportunity comes to buy lots of Bitcoins. And the opportunity has come again to you and it's up to you to decide to buy it now or still want to wait again.There is a possibility that the price will remain like this until the weekend. But that's just conjecture and there is also a possibility that the price of Bitcoin will fall even further. What's important is that we can be prepared to buy more Bitcoin if the price does drop further.",

The Wall Street Journal article literally said that SpaceX has not reported to own bitcoin anymore, which means they sold before the WSJ came to know about it, right? This means that they sold last week, or the week before, or at some other, earlier date. There's not a single proof that could confirm that the recent slide was caused by Musk!2. The market lacks liquidity and is prone to manipulation. You could see it as some exchanges were crashing to 25k while others reported 26k. This means the price is not the value and there can be a temporary trading price and a real price derived from the weekly or monthly averages. If you see the price much lower than a 30 day MA, it shows the asset is undervalued at the moment and you shouldn't sell. 3. Someone is manipulating the markets by spreading fake news, just like they were doing in 2014 when China was banning bitcoin every single month... People never learn. 4. Bitcoin Magazine sucks.If you have some money it's a good idea to get more BTC. You'll thank me in a few months",
