Did you reffer to the amount to put in each utxo?Well in that case it depents of how much are you willing to spend in the future,  for example right now 100 USD are like  ~296000 satsSo if you are going to expend less than 100 USD  you can use utxos less  around that amount, And maybe some 1 or 2 utxos with some x2  or x3 of that amount, just to get some options at the spending time.All of this is upto you and you are going to receive a lot of mixed opinions, so try to read all of them and form your own opinionQuote from: Charles-Tim on October 27, 2023, 05:02:11 PMBluewallet wallet has coin control.

This figure seems to be  consistent with the  current Bitcoin distribution. Quote from: https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin-distribution-history.htmlLarge-sized UTXOs add threat  to privacy   due to 1) keen interest in addresses that hold them 2) the substantial  size of  possible change if such UTXOs are  in transactions. On the other hand, too small UTXOs may result in increased transaction cost due to the fee needed to cover  the extra inputs",

Therefore it may be prudent to have UTXOs of a decent size for cost savings but not large enough to reveal meaningful holdings.I think you could solve it in the following way: Try to imagine what kind of transactions you will do in the future? For example, lets say you have 10 BTC total. I dont think there is any problem to consolidate your UTXOs, each containing 1 BTC. Most of your future transactions will probably not exceed 1 BTC in value. This means that when you use one UTXO, you will not immediately expose your entire stash, and on the other hand, you still enjoy the benefits of low transaction fees. If you have to spend more than 1 BTC at once, I dont think you will have a problem with a slightly higher transaction fee.So, in short, I would recommend dividing your total stash into tenths and using only one of those UTXOs for small transactions.",

Thank you for your opinions.UTXOs are what you receive from incoming transactions or as left-overs of your past sending transactions. Are you able to control number of UXTOs in your wallet?You can and you can not.You can because you can consolidate your inputs (UTXOs) as your preparation for your outputs later.You can not because you can not control what people send coins to you, the more time you receive coins, a more UTXOs you will have if you don't consolidate them.To save fees for consolidations and for sending transactions, you should pick times when mempools are clear to enjoy low, cheap fee rates.[Guide] Consolidate your small inputshttps://mempool.space/https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),24h,weight[Telegram Bot] Bitcoin Fees - fees and tx tracker",

Yes, just like when you want to buy an item of $50 with a $100 bill, the seller would return a change of $50 back to you, but they know at that moment that you have $50 in your pocket.

      "body": "I would use CoinJoin to consolidate your UTXOs for a couple of reasons. 1. When you use CoinJoin to consolidate, you will increase your own privacy as well as the privacy of other users in the CoinJoin. The more people that use CoinJoin, the greater the anon set becomes and everyone has more privacy as it becomes more difficult to know for sure who controls which addresses. If you consolidate all of your sats into one UTXO of 10 bitcoin, then you will give away a lot of personal information about your holdings to everyone that you spend with in the future as well as create one massive peeling chain as you spend it over the life of the UTXO and all of the change UTXOs that you create.  2. Whirlpool has fixed UTXO sizes. The most common ones are 1,000,000 sats and 100,000 sats so not only do you have more privacy after you CoinJoin but you also have UTXOs that are nice round numbers. That you can spend in the future. If you send all 10 bitcoin into the 1 million sat UTXO pool, it will take a long time to CoinJoin it all but you will have ~1,000 UTXOs that are all 1,000,000 sats each and when you spend, you can just spend one at a time or maybe use a few of them to make larger payments. If you don't spend any bitcoin until the price is $500,000 per coin, then a single 1,000,000 sat UTXO will be worth $5,000 and I don't know anyone who walks around with that kind of money in their wallet. You could send a single 100k sats UTXO to your wallet for most of your daily spending and use a 1 million sat UTXOs for larger things like buying cars, or making house payments and the like.  If you decide to consolidate some UTXOs, I would strongly encourage you to use Whirlpool to CoinJoin to increase your privacy, the privacy of others, and have UTXOs that are all consistently sized so you can spend them easier in the future without giving away personal information about your holdings by creating a massive peeling chain as you slowly spend large UTXOs over a long period of time. I hope that helps you make the best decision for you.",

I am sure the answer is different for everyone base don their preferences and needs, but am wondering what people think. Thank you for your opinions.The first step is to separate anonymous UTXOs (with coins that you obtained without providing any personal information) from so-called KYCed coins (coins that came from platforms requiring providing documents and other personal data). This step is not necessary for privacy but rather for adhering to the principles of financial literacy: you should always remember that money loves silence, which means you don't want your employer, for instance, to know you have other sources of income. The second step is to understand what you need cryptocurrency for, the sizes of your UTXO and their quantity will depend on your personal daily/monthly/yearly expenses and area of interest. While assessing these parameters, you should also take into account the continuous volatility and especially the growth of Bitcoin's price. For example, if you pay for a monthly subscription to some service with Bitcoin, you have two options: you either prepare a certain amount for each month or you create a big UTXO once and then gradually reduce its size. In the first case, you need to track the price and prepare the exact amount to send (you don't want to create a bunch of small UTXO with change), and in the second, you don't need to do anything.",
