I am sure if there was some fault it would of been discovered long ago.Yeah that would be like someone offering to pay $1M if someone could crack the private key of one of Satoshi's early mined blocks. Basically its pretty much impossible and hence the $1M reward would never be paid and would be a big waste of time for anyone attempting to crack it.",

I am sure if there was some fault it would have been discovered long ago.There is a little difference, SHA256 is not an encryption but rather a hash function which is a one way algorithm that is almost impossible to reverse because the computational power needed to actually is not something that can be done soon. ECDSA is an encryption algorithm, specifically an asymmetric algorithm which uses two keys which is the private key for encryption and the public key for decryption, this also requires a higher computational power to decrypt the original input. But as science would have it, there is nothing that they see impossible, we have heard or seen other algorithms that were first developed to be impossible to be broken get broken. But this wouldn’t happen overnight so before it would actually poses threat to the algorithm (like this hash used today gets broken) we will would migrate. Here is satoshi response to a hash 256 getting broken in future Quote from: satoshi on June 14, 2010, 08:39:50 PMSHA-256 is very strong.  It's not like the incremental step from MD5 to SHA1.  It can last several decades unless there's some massive breakthrough attack.If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest block chain was before the trouble started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function.If the hash breakdown came gradually, we could transition to a new hash in an orderly way.  The software would be programmed to start using a new hash after a certain block number.  Everyone would have to upgrade by that time.  The software could save the new hash of all the old blocks to make sure a different block with the same old hash can't be used.",

Now some of you maybe heard about That a repeated R value in two signatures of the same public key can lead to disclose the Private Key... well that is the same if you KNOW the relationship between two signatures if you that K1 is X value +/- K2 or some other weird relationship them the Private Key can be solved easily.About that i did a real puzzle in: Second small puzzle about ECDSA and other computers topicsQuote from: Zaguru12 on November 03, 2023, 06:14:25 AMHere is satoshi response to a hash 256 getting broken in future Thank you for the satoshi quote about it.Do you imagine that? if Sha256 is broken, the entire bitcoin mining industry will be collapsed by a single machine with a proper algorithm... And not only that most of the security of internet that depends of sha256 will be compromised in someway.",

I misunderstood it because the asymmetric encryption is similar, that is creating two pairs of key with one been an encryption and the other to decrypt it. QuoteIt takes a higher computational power to reverse the private key to public key operation or compute private key from signature.I think it’s a typo mistake here, reversing or decryption of this key pair will actually be public key back to the private which is the encryption",

This is irreversible. Or in another words you need an impossible amount of computational power to reverse the \"private key to public key\" operation.In technical terms that is to solve Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem or ECDLP for short.You are also using the term \"decryption\" wrong. Decryption demands a cipher text (encrypted message using a password).",
