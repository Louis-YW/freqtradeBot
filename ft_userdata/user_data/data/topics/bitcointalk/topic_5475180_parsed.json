Nobody shares their secrets.The secret is that we are here to support Bitcoin, not try to \"make a career\" here.  If you are here for Bitcoin and do things to help Bitcoin, success will find it's way to you.  If you come here trying to earn a profit for yourself off the backs of others, you will probably end up wasting whatever time you dedicate to this place.  Everyone here has a common interest.  Bitcoin.  My advice is to focus on ways you can provide value for Bitcoin instead of focusing on ways to leech some money from the community for your own gain.  That's the secret.",

Although it's not going to be as easy as it was 7 years ago when you can easily earn bitcoin from faucets.Now you have to do the following; Stop being negative and bittered. Spend each day to discover what you like about the forum. Stop dwelling in the negative side. Is there some services you can render and be paid in BTC, you can list them in the service section. You are a Snr member, if your account was not marked with red, you could earn weekly through signature campaign( if only you don't see them all as scam) Just try your best to be an ordinary good user of the forum, besides the forum promised us nothing and as such owes us nothing.",

I didn't want to read them, but in every post they had the word \"Ch*pm*xer\". These monkeys did everything to attract attention. So Ambatman it's a big question who was trying to attract whose attention hereThen I realized that these monkey earning its money by promoting that word \"Ch*pm*xer\"But when I tried to find out how to join their sect, it turned out that they take monkeys who will actively spam and flood everywhere. I refused.Quote from: Ambatman on January 08, 2025, 09:50:57 PM This is the end for him in BTT but he still has time replying messages in the thread. People are increasingly realizing that the forum is not what it used to be. I am no longer interested in your forum. This is more the end for the forum than for me as a user. Quote from: KingsDen on January 08, 2025, 09:46:26 PMIs there some services you can render and be paid in BTC, you can list them in the service section.I can participate in discussions and fairly resolve disputes, without paying attention to any DT authorities who sometimes cover for their protégés. I am not afraid of any accusations from these monkeys and I am not afraid of anything at all. I can identify and expose falsifications and fake votes in competitions, I have already studied their methods.I can advertise your tokens (but not scams or shitcoins). But only in free form, without requirements for the number of posts. I am for organic growth and against spam and floodingI do not know how else I can be useful. Do you have o job for me?",
