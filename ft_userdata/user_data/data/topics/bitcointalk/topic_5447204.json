  "content": "I want to talk about the US government selling 51,000 Bitcoins, why are they doing this. Is Bitcoin going to be trashed let's talk about all this stuff and more this came out yesterday and a lot of people were talking about it what happened to these 51,000 Bitcoins.Everything is connected to the Silk Road so when the silk road closed According to reports the government has sold roughly 10,000 Bitcoins for 250 million and this was on March 14th 2023. So it looks like we had a little Spike and then dropped back down so we're up to 26,000 back to 24- 2 and then boom the market reacted by going up so did the sale of 10,000 Bitcoin really affect Bitcoin the answer is no.Heard that the government doesn't sell everything at the same time now, if they decide to sell 51,000 at once maybe Bitcoin will be affected more but they plan to sell gradually. so later in the year they'll probably finish another ten thousand another ten thousand another ten thousand something like that so right now they have 41,000 Bitcoins left.so it's a bit surprising that they did this i thought maybe they wanted to throw it all away to cause more problems around Bitcoin but they decided that they would spread it out roughly so they have 51,000 Bitcoins to start with now. they have 41,000 Bitcoins left so that's the reason why they're selling this basically they've been saving this for a while and they felt this was the right time to sell it. should we be afraid that this incident will affect the price of bitcoin?Source:https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-government-plans-to-sell-41k-bitcoin-connected-to-silk-road",

Would the bitcoin blockchain crash? No! Bitcoin would continue to work properly. We would only see a flash crash that would be eaten by marketmakers and those waiting for a dip to buy (bitcoin broke the 200 WMA and many investors just wait for a dip). The only thing they would achieve by selling like this is to sell $1.4 billion worth of bitcoins for $1 billion.",

Even they dumped their coins which through an auction, market wouldnt be affectef much considering that this isnt a spot sell market on exchanges.

He basically did some exploit back in the day where he sent like 1000 Bitcoins to his deposit address at Silk Road and then immediately did 5 withdraws of 1000 Bitcoins at once and basically sent 1000 BTC and got 5000 Back, so made a profit off 4000 BTC.I am pretty sure its these coins which they are selling. The caught the guy recently, about a year or two I believe. There is an article somewhere on twitter about how it happened.

As @stompix already wrote, it is not about selling 50K BTC, but only a part of what has seized two years ago. And the fact that they (the US government) sell BTC means that they informally recognize it as something that has value, and you could only worry if they destroyed all the seized BTC and thus showed the middle finger to everyone else.What you see as a problem is actually a good thing, because the US government promotes Bitcoin by doing so and also puts it back into circulation - and in return it gets what it loves most, its dollars.",

There should be a question mark at the end of that sentence. I don't understand your concerns. Governments all over the world auction off seized property and assets all the time. Houses, apartments, cars, equipment, machinery, and in this case bitcoin. Why would you assume bitcoin would be treated differently? There will be an auction, people will bid on what they are interested in, and the highest bidders win. The government agencies care about the bitcoins they have seizes as they care about any other items in their depots. They don't. They want to sell it all at the best possible price and fill their coffers.",

The sale of these 41,000 Bitcoins and the timing of which they are being sold is a strategic move to keep Bitcoin down for an extended period of time. At the end of the day, the US and its US Dollar is at war with Bitcoin! In terms of the long term and how it's positive....distribution! Less power for the US and distribution to more holders only expands the free market. It also removes a holder who entered the market at a very low price point and turns that into a new range of holders who are entering at the 20-30k mark. EXTREMELY good for Bitcoin economics. All of a sudden you have a single holder of 51,000 Bitcoins who entered the market for free at a price point of $10-$200, changed to many individual holders who entered the market at 20-30k!I knew something was coming to hinder the growth beyond 30-40k...This news is it. After the US is done selling these seized coins and have exhausted any other means of hindering price, the bull run begins. I can't wait for 2024",
