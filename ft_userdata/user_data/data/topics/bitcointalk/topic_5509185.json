I'm from Mexico.Thanks for reading this. You mean bank account? If the bank account is blocked, how can you withdraw the money? Maybe you should try to unblock it first.Also, if the bank account is blocked, how can you use the fiat balance in it to for trading purposes? You should provide more details about your issue.As far as exchanging crypto to fiat(and vice versa), you should check out Bestchange. It's a Russian platform that lists multiple crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto exchangers. Beware of scammers, every crypto exchange platform has them. There's a review system in Bestchange, so maybe you should go with the exchangers that have the most positive reviews.",

There is a popular Fiat digital wallet in Russia (I forgot it's name) which almost everyone uses. All you need to do is to find a non-KYC exchange in a directory like Bestchange and then create an order.You send the money to the Bestchange account in Russia and they will swap or for Bitcoin or other supported cryptocurrencies, which will be easily moved to anyone in the world. I won't name the specific service which was used by my friend to pay for services of the Russian artist, though, I would rather you do your own research and find the platform which suits you the best. Good luck and be aware of scammers, they are everywhere.",

I think you will get better response here if only you can be transparent and emphasize more.When you say \"block\" I guess you mean \"restrictions\" that means the transaction you want to process is not permitted due to regulatory order.Is the fund in the fiats or bitcoin? What is the feasibility that bitcoin is the only option to make this withdrawal?",

If bank does not allow you to withdraw money, how is it possible to use your account for purchasing Bitcoin?The answer is pretty simple.OP can't move money to another bank located outside Russia due to sanctions, but could use banks and services within Russia. This means that if he wanted to use that bank account to pay someone in Russia, he can, same with buying stuff in Russian stores. He could use a local bitcoin exchange, also physical since they also have those and then transfer bitcoin to any wallet, located in Mexico, or anywhere else.",
