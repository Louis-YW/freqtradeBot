Keep in mind that some signature campaigns are paid via altcoin, so the thread linked above might not cover all of them. Most of them are not worth it though.There is no need to roast newbies if they don't ask something trivial. If your post is interesting no one will roast you.",

I know that No one will tell but I want to know so that I might work hard to get at point. By the way I know, mostly members will roast me cause I have seen that in bitcointalk that they roast newbies mostly. As pointed by mk4, the values range from $4 to $300 per week, paid in btc. You can find campaigns paying in altcoins but they are usually not worth.This advertisement is important for crypto related companies because casinos/mixers/etc cannot pay for sponsored links in Google/Facebook/etc, due to those companies policies.You already have a few merits and a nice post/merit ratio. If you are willing to participate in campaigns, you will start small (with like $4 per week). It is a long road.

But in order to receive $300 a week, you will need to go a long way to this goal. When you will meet these criteria to participate in such a program, you need to remember that there are many such participants worthy of wearing this signature on the forum and you will have to participate in the competition, proving that you are the most the best.",

I would agree with bitmover here and even suggest that you join a signature campaign when you reach the minimum rank. in the beginning it may be an insignificant amount of money, but you will learn a lot and acquire a routine when using the forum. Of course, if you want to stay here.  Quote from: fennic on October 04, 2022, 01:39:29 AMBy the way I know, mostly members will roast me cause I have seen that in bitcointalk that they roast newbies mostly. it is a myth created by some arrogant newbies because they were rejected for some very unrealistic demands. mostly no one here is against new members.",

But it's just a matter of time for somebody who's actually contributing something relevant and new in discussions. So while those ranks are goals because there could be money from them, first things first. You need to participate in discussions and make your contributions. Quite frankly, based on my observations, newbies are indeed easily roasted. But that also happens to me and other high-rank members. Just take this as a cautionary warning in making posts. Don't commit the mistake of opening a tutorial thread, one that suppose to guide or advise, if you don't know what you're writing about. Also, search first before creating a thread. Finally, read and follow the rules. Good luck and welcome aboard!",

I want to get knowledge from this platform too.  It is a decent amount of lunch money. I would encourage you to learn how bitcoin works and how to secure your wallets and how to use exchanges before jumping into a campaign. Besides you would need to rank up to a decent member rank in order to be able to join most campaigns. So you have to start working on your posting quality and engaging in discussions. It is not always possible but you should try your best.If you are living in a country where bitcoin can be freely used to buy goods and articles that you need, then defenitely signature campaigns are a good side earning, but try your best not to make them the reason why you are here.",

I want to get knowledge from this platform too. Let's be honest here: you didn't come to bitcointalk for knowledge but for money. I mean, Newbie account that wrote his first post a couple of days ago already asking how much can he earn from signature campaigns. And to add on that, your very first post on the forum was one one of those \"proof of authentication posts\" in altcoin bounty section. I may be wrong in your case (even though I doubt it), but that is not a behavior of a legit newbie account and instead of someone who already has some experience here and probably has a couple of accounts doing in bounty campaigns.",

Although you can say it may, in indirect way, because of SEO (for google) but nothing much due to different reasons. One is because of wearing or removing signatures in just a short period of time as SEO takes effect at least 2 months or so.",
