Lots of issues reported for all the different miners along with results of the people trying to get them resolved. Read about them and reach your conclusions.Frankly, using published 'reviews' of any given miner's reliability is highly questionable due to the writers personal biases and/or lack of experience with the brands being ran in widely different environments..",

You can engage with experienced miners and ask for their opinions or recommendations based on their real-world mining experiences.You can also try social media groups on Reddit, Facebook, Telegram, etc. and manufacturer forums or support channels.",
