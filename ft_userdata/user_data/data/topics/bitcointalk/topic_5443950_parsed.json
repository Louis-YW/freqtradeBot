  "content": "The owner of the social media platform Twitter said during his conference on March 7 Here, that he is optimistic for his company becoming cashflow positive. Although he didn't directly stated that he won't be integrating crypto currency, he wants his social media platform to offer powerful finance system that is more superior than PayPal.On his interview last year, he said that he slowly shifted his focus from crypto to AI, and stated that blockchain based twitter isn't possible. Due to his inconsistent behavior and doing things on a whim, we are left here thinking what crazy things he will do next. As previously, he was the one hyping about cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Doge, and SHIB.Source: https://cryptoslate.com/elon-musk-has-ambitions-of-making-twitter-the-worlds-biggest-financial-institution/",

He is willing to spend a lot of money to be able to take over Twitter and make it not only a social media platform, but also a financial platform whose users he can \"squeeze\" indirectly is something that I think is quite greedy. I'm not a rich man, so I can't guess how rich people like him think, but I think this is the real capitalist.",

As we could see clearly by his attitude, he is somewhat telling that he could offer or provide better services compared to those leading/pioneer payment system. As much as I hate it because of his nonchalant attitude, he also has a tendency of hyping things, and when he gets bored he will shift his attitude 180°. Although we cannot judge him due to his ability to stir up things and actually do it because of he is rich, he's like teaching younger generations to join trends just because it it hype. Even if we say it's none of our business, it will still have an impact on the economy. We'll just have to wait and see what he will do next.",

However, if it's one thing I have learnt from him taking over Twitter, it is exactly like you said...He does everything off of a whim. He's not evil, he does not fore-think or scheme. He's just a (rather intelligent) child-like billionaire who is having fun treating the world of business as his playground. I can't disrespect that after realizing it. I suppose he earned it (despite his deeply buried transgresses, but what businessman does not have those?). I think that turning Twitter into a financial institution could keep the fiat wheel peddling just a little bit longer. It's a very smart idea from a business perspective, if done correctly. I can't say whether or not it'd be good for Bitcoin though.",

He made Twitter Blue a business for people who were really trying to gain influence or build their status on Twitter. Now, implementing a paid system is much different when Twitter is owned by Jack Dorsey. Today many people who are not artists, important people, and companies can have status on Twitter. This has also become a reference for Facebook, especially Instagram, which will implement a paid verified account system.",

To me, Twitter is just fine the way it is (I don't really know how site creation and programming work), but if he wants to develop a payment platform that would be more superior than PayPal, then it should be a different platform that he may only need to integrate with Twitter, letting the social media aspect of Twitter remain unchanged.",

The man took advantage of the moment to probably make a lot of money in the way that he was once an ordinary crypto shill, and considering that he was already under investigation for his abuse of position and authority regarding the shares of his companies, there is a more than clear methodology by which he achieves his goals.He'll probably be happy when he's sitting in his office on Mars and controlling people via some kind of AI linked to chips that will be implanted in their brains.
