I don't have anything much to talk about bitcoin because the news is everywhere and since bitcoin price reached six digits, it has attracted a lot of investors. If you want to get rich in future, just keeping on stacking your bitcoin portfolio with DCA irregardless of the price of bitcoin, because bitcoin is currently the only asset that can give you bigger profits in future compared to any other asset.",

Tell me a story about your experience with Bitcoin so that newbies can learn something about Bitcoin from you. Bitcoin is a revolutionary monetary system. It removes trust from financial activities, allowing us to pay directly someone else, without using intermediaries.For me Bitcoin is perhaps the greatest technological invention, because it attempts to fix financial injustice. And, in this life where everything is about money and corruption exists, Bitcoin feels like a dream.",

Tell me a story about your experience with Bitcoin so that newbies can learn something about Bitcoin from you. Bitcoin is a currency that promotes freedom. It is a tool to invade financial restrictions placed by the government to control the people. It is a financial instrument that increases privacy by its pseudonymous transaction. It is also an asset that appreciates in value thereby giving Bitcoin investors from all locations the chance to make profits.My journey in the Bitcoin space started when I was introduced to this forum. From the information I have read here, my knowledge about Bitcoin has kept increasing. I will  recommend newbies to stay in bitcointalk.",

In my own understanding, bitcoin was to buy and sell things online and that where the p2p comes from. You buy something with bitcoin, pay the person with bitcoin and the seller accept it then you transfer the coins to the person according to the value of the product. But because of the inflow of the coin. People started bto hodle it too make it scarce and it becomes value in store. So those who want to sell it, sell it in higher price and the price started to go up and it becomes the bull market in the investment. This is how I see and understand bitcoin.",

Tell me a story about your experience with Bitcoin so that newbies can learn something about Bitcoin from you. Bitcoin has been able to cover up the gap of an intermediary to bridge our money with. We don’t need a third party to access our money, we can get in touch with it at anytime and anywhere without waiting for an approval from another body. Bitcoin has brought about decentralization which is something everyone adores in their financial life. Let alone, it is also an investable asset that overtime has proven to be a worthy choice for investors to invest into for the long time. The aim was to serve as an alternative to the fiat currency, but overtime it has also been a pathway for investors to have a very good return on investment while still having full access to their money in the period of investing to opt out at anytime. It’s advantages it’s way much above the disadvantages and that has brought more about its adoption rate today.",

      "body": "Bitcoin shaped how I view trust. It made me wonder why central banks and politicians set money terms. I saw 3 AM Reddit threads about people panicking because the price hit red. The real message behind those charts and hashtags is owning your decisions without a middleman. My personal experience includes questioning everything once the market crashed. Perhaps I was holding onto an illusion. I stayed due of the self-sovereignty feeling. You realise how much you depend on institutions that can change regulations suddenly. Bitcoin makes you question if we should always trust centralised power or try something freshI'm not suggesting Bitcoin solves all financial problems. Not so. However, a bond is formed when you immerse yourself in it. You discover how people think, how hype drives markets, and why resilience matters. Learning and sharing ideas are valued in this society. Newbies focus less on price predictions and more on participating in a transformative financial era - no handshake needed",

If you ask me, my personal thoughts of bitcoin in future is that it’s too late—not really too late but it’s very risky to buy now knowing that the price of one Bitcoin is already at $100K USD. However, if you make sure to always buy low and sell high, then you’ll be very safe. Just never sell at a loss. Control your emotions, as they say. Unless, of course, you really need to sell because you have no other choice and urgently need the money. Remember this Bitcoin will surely last longer compare to our lifespan .. lol",

Bitcoin is completely free and independent, where you do not have to borrow from anyone for transactions, and you can do whatever you want while protecting your privacy. The reason why it is popular at present is that anyone can use it. You do not need anyone's permission to use Bitcoin, you can do whatever you want on your own, and no one has any hand here. Its popularity is increasing daily, and in the near future, people have confidence in it; something good will happen.Where you can do everything freely and independently will become the only thing you like.

It enables the unbanked to move funds boundlessly.  This I believe is the most important thing about Bitcoin as a currency.  It is also enable us to be our own bank, away from the monitoring eyes of the financial institution due to its pseudo-anonymous feature. As long as we do not connect our address to any centralized KYC exchanges, we can keep our identity secret.These are the reason why Bitcoin is important to me.  I also believe that Bitcoin is yet to show its real potential, and the Bitcoin future in the current event is bright since government are taking notice of its importance and is making their move to adopt and even planning to make Bitcoin as a reserve.",

It means that Satoshi, who used to prevent financial exploitation of humanity, teleported it into Bitcoin and gave people financial freedom.

Everyone in the world has come to know that there is no better investment asset than Bitcoin. It has the potential to give you huge profit margins in less time as compared to other assets... Besides that it's also important for me to have Bitcoin because in today's era it becomes a difficult task to make a financial touchdown without Bitcion.

Even if there's 1% chance that you may need independent money one day, money that cannot be confiscated at the airport and can be moved to another part of the world within minutes, wouldn't you want to own it as a precaution?
