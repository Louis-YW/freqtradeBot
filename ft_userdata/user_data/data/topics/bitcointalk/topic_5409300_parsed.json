Also a bit tired of the drama and manipulation that is seen by users when it comes to DT. I may change my mind later but for now my trust list is empty. My distrust list still exists for now.Not making this thread because I feel any of you care or need to know, but if someone goes looking at DT and wants to know why here is your answer.Quote from: dkbit98 on August 09, 2022, 01:27:51 PMI think we should all mass drop out from DT membership, that would force theymos to make some needed changes and reduction of DT1 members.",

Very fast and simple.  QuoteI can tell you, I don't have to deal with a LOT of bs that I used to for whatever reason, as I don't always have the time to play the role I felt I needed to be for being on DT1 if that makes sense ....It is probably because some members want to be in DT1 and spots for DT1 are limited. So drama occurs because they want to get in. For me, neither DT1 nor merit source is my dream.Your contribution makes your name, not any role like DT1 or merit source. Obviously, such things can unofficial raise your role and importance (somewhat) in the forum so someone might like this and want to get it.They forget the fact that being a DT1 or a merit source does not make them have better quality, more contribution or being more important than other members.QuoteMy life is much simpler here now.It simplifies the way we use the forum.  Quote from: Little Mouse on August 10, 2022, 02:05:26 AMDid you mean DT1 selection? It won’t because to be eligible for DT1, you must have built your custom trust list which will have 10 users included Yes, it is prerequisite to be in DT1 selection list by theymos each month. After you have a call from theymos, whether you are in DT1 or not will depend on inclusion lists of other DT1 members.QuoteFor DT1, theymos blacklist from the selection but DT2 isn't selection.Therefore, if you are sure that you want to get out of DT1 forever, let send a request to theymos for blacklisting you from DT1 list. I could be wrong but maybe there is no case asked theymos to change from blacklist to whitelist (including into DT1 selection list) again. It's funny. I am doubtful that theymos will approve such get out - get in again request.  If you just want to get out temporarily, do what yahoo62278 do (wipe out your DT inclusion list). You can customize it later and get in DT1 list later.",
