As we dey come of age small small dey understand things we don experience something similar during GEJ regime when them remove fuel subsidy and that was in January wey be say people wey travel go flex Christmas & new year no come get money for transport to return back to their base. But this year own tie rapper. It started in december with fuel scarcity, then enter gear one with naira scarcity, hike in transport fees and foodstuffs follow, now e don enter gear 2 and small small the masses don they react as we dey see on social media how a man undress the cry for bank make them give am him money, how people break into a bank in broad day light and vandalize cars, ATM machines, security doors, computers etc. I just hope say our yeye government don get the message and make them do something about it very fast make e no get to another level like the ENDSARS protest.",
