Members here should know by now that nobody is going to waste their time with reports or accusations without without solid proof, and nobody is going to help you check deeper for that proof, if you feel someone has faulted the rules, then you bring the proof, even if you do so with your 10th account, at least do so with meaningful evidence.

In my case, yes, I am an alt. I created this account because I already have an account on the forum and I thought about making a second one, as many people have. In the future I might say which is my main account, or maybe not, or maybe I won't get very far because I'm not sure I have time to manage two accounts, combining them with my daily activities. In any case, I am not obliged to say so. Yesterday I was looking for a thread of interest to comment on and I saw the other one about Bitlucy.I have nothing against Royse777, but after what has been said, I think the following:1. I think it is more likely to be Royse777 who is behind the Casino Critique account than Darkstar_, as explained in the other thread. 2. Without more data, we cannot be sure. I think the OP is probably a shitposter who was tagged by Royse777 and that's why he talks like that.3. The two escrows know who is behind this account. 4. If it's Royse777, dkbit98 knows it too and in this case what he has written in this thread would be completely dishonest. The fact that he talks about balls, pussy and conspiracy theories, without clearly stating that it is not Royse777 who is behind the account makes me think even more strongly that it is him.5. If it's Royse777 and some people on the forum know about it, I don't think it's honest for them to hide it. I understand that after what happened, they want to give him a second chance, but we are talking about a lot of money here. The reason for not saying who is behind it is clear, many people will think twice if someone who was involved with Bitlucy is behind the project, no matter how much the community has forgiven him.This last point applies, even if the person behind the account is not Royse777. Most likely it is someone who has had reputation problems on the forum, and therefore does not use his main account or does not make it clear, either with a neutral tag or by explicitly saying so, that it is that person who is behind it. Hiding this is not honest with potential investors.",
