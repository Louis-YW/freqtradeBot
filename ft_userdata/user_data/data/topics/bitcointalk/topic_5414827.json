  "content": "INTRODUCTIONCryptocurrency is essentially a digital currency exchange and digital payments platform that uses blockchain technology. The technological and digital revolution over the last few decades has meant that innovative payment systems have been created and utilised, and cryptocurrency is one of the major breakthrough payment systems for business and personal finance use.Although there are over 2,000 cryptocurrencies on the market now, Bitcoin is probably still the most known form of cryptocurrency in the blockchain market, and was the first cryptocurrency coin to go mainstream but there are other cryptocurrencies entering the market.For Muslims across the Islamic world, the question arises as to whether crypto payment platforms are deemed to be halal or haram in the eyes of Allah and in accordance with Shariah principles, and whether as a currency it prevents money laundering.CRYPTOCURRENCYOne of the defining aspects of cryptocurrency is that there is no central authority such as a Government that authorises it or records it.Ultimately, it is the duty of every Muslim to be seeking knowledge, and this guide will address the use of the cryptocurrency market and its intrinsic value. We will consider whether crypto currency is permissible as a form of actual money under Islamic laws and in the Islamic world. We will consider the views of Islamic jurists and scholars on this emergence of what is considered to be new money addressing the question of is cryptocurrency halal.ISLAMIC SCHOLARS INTERPRETATION - IS CRYPTOCURRENCY HALAL?A comprehensive Islamic law interpretation, one that sparked a massive rise in Muslim investment in Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2018, was provided by Sharia advisor Mufti Muhammad Abu-Bakar (former advisor to Blossom Finance) who looked at the question of is cryptocurrency halal as a money supply. He argued that Bitcoin is permissible under Islamic principles.ISLAMIC SCHOLARSAnother reason Islamic jurists and scholars from Muslim countries argue that cryptocurrency is halal is that the concept of the blockchain and other cryptocurrencies are inherently anti-interest when looked at from a money generation source or perspective.Islamic banking laws are also anti-interest so the technology, pricing, and buying and selling of cryptocurrency money is deemed halal by many Islamic scholars who rely on the teachings of Prophet Muhammad PBUH when seeking guidance about permissibility (ultimately, only Allah knows best).Source: https://www.qardus.com/news/what-is-cryptocurrency-and-is-it-halal#:~:text=As%20cryptocurrency%20money%20is%20deemed,as%20a%20form%20of%20currency.",

Islam has 4 main guiding figures as a reference approach to making laws regarding new, more modern matters, especially in the field of finance, which they call \"madzhab\". Southeast Asian Islamic countries have different laws because of the above, for example cryptocurrency in Malaysia is halal while in Indonesia it is the opposite.",

In addition, in the discussion, one member who was obviously from Turkey confirmed that many do not respect this ban and continue to accept cryptocurrencies (restaurants, shops...)I respect all religions, but I have not yet read anywhere or found out in any way that any other religion expressly forbids cryptocurrencies, except of course Islam, with which this issue has been associated for years.

However, if you want to use it for exchanging it to fiat currencies, goods, etc. you will have to care of local laws.Even it is not legal yet in one nation, you can still use VPN or Peer to Peer trading to buy or sell it.

Other countries that rejected Bitcoin years ago Base on region in their land are now looking for way to make it legal for their citizens and to create a good environment for the bitcoiners in the land. I believe, with time  they will break the Islamic rules to allow their citizens to have access to Bitcoin and to acquire the knowledge of Bitcoin so that they can grow well like the way other countries that made it legal are growing in their land.",
