Sad to know, it's an indication that centralized entities are still in control of most of the bitcoin circulation.Some of these addresses with high bitcoin might belong to whales but we can assume that the majority of them belong to centralized exchanges. This sad reality also shows that many people have not learned the lesson of not your keys, not your coins. People have not learned much from the fall of Ftx and others.",

This is another good point. But there are also addresses with good amounts of Bitcoin whose keys have been lost, especially from the early years.

The funny thing is that the bitcoin in exchanges belongs to individuals who choose to use the exchange to keep their coins due to the inability to keep their bitcoin safe. However, one can't really tell whose addresses are those addresses,maybe a corporation or an exchange since then owners can't be known. This shows that some bitcoin investors hasn't understood that bitcoin is decentralized and exchanges are centralized, which is the opposite of bitcoin and they don't have that security that bitcoin gives to its user by elimination of third party for transaction.",

I'll expect more addresses in the 50BTC region as well.However, note that a lot of the addresses can be change address. If you were to send 0.99BTC, you would have a change address of 0.01BTC. With that in mind, you would have a lot of people having the coins separated in this manner.In addition, a lot of the services tends to move their coins to another address rather slowly. I imagine that would be a non factor.",

However, I would dare to say that this number is even lower, because we all know that CEX always manipulates numbers in order to show liquidity, so it is a similar story as in the case when speculating about how much BTC is actually irreversible or currently lost.What is certain is that the number of BTC that are on CEX is decreasing over the years, which is really good news and I hope that it is not only related to the fact that we are still in a bear market.",

Majority of such Bitcoins are lost as owners never cared about the wallets. Second type of active wallets are the one whose owner took Bitcoin serious in early days of Bitcoin and that's why they are called whales today. Still Bitcoin is very much decentralised as compared to fiat financial system.",

I think it doesn’t matter if we look at it based on an address and it’s holdings. Since the data is representing in what slot that particular resides it is fun to watch it and understand the distribution over great range of Bitcoin holdings. In my case it straight away tells me that I’m in the lowest possible category and comes in 7% range (or virtually below that, Lolz). This is ok data for studying various holdings. Hope so there is also another data set where they will segregate the entire entity holdings as well as individual holdings. Though it seem impossible to do and may compromise the integrity of holdings.",
