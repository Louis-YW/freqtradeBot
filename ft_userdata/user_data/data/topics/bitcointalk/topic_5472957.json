  "content": "Hi BitcoinTalk!I have re-posted mdayonliner [Eng: Tutorial] PGP Signature - Encrypt/Decrypt message - Fingerprint because the images of main thread was broken and the author is not active anymore. As Husna QA suggested, I decided to write a tutorial for Linux users.QuoteImage source: encriptados.io➥ More PGP Tutorials:▶ [Eng: Tutorial] PGP Signature - Encrypt/Decrypt message - Fingerprint -mdayonliner- English▶ [Tutorial] PGP/GPG (Mac OS X) - Husna QA- Indonesian▶ [Tutorial] PGP/GPG (Microsoft Windows) - Husna QA- Indonesian▶ [Tutorial] PGP/GPG (Linux) - joniboini- Indonesian▶ PGP Tutorial Bangla - Windows- Learn Bitcoin - Bangla➥ Install Gnupg and gpa:Let's get started!Open your terminal and paste this command line Code:sudo apt-get install gnupg2 gpaIf you have given the root privilege already, it won't ask for the password. If you haven't, please write your system password, and it should install gnupg2 and gpa. Look at the screenshot below; Quote➥ Generate Key:Paste this command line in your terminal Code:gpg --full-generate-key, and it will ask what kind of key you want to generate. RSA and RSA are the default, and I will generate the RSA and RSA one. To generate RSA and RSA keys, type 1 and enter. RSA keys can be from 1024 bits to 4096 bits long. 3072 is the default one, but I am creating 4096 here. So write 4096 and hit enter. See the image below;QuoteNow, you can set the expiration date of your keys. 0 defines the key won't expire. I am going with 0. Write 0 and hit enter. Write Y and hit enter again.It should ask for your real name (You don't have to write your real name, of course), email, and comment. I am writing mine. Then, write O and hit enter again. It will ask for your passphrase, write your passphrase, and it should generate your keys. See the image below;QuoteNow paste this command line Code:sudo gpaIf you do not get any errors, please skip the next part.If you get the error Code:failed to load module canberra-gtk-module it could be a reason for being unable to create your keys even though it shows the keys were generated. If you are on an Ubuntu or Debian system, first apply this Code:sudo apt update and then install Libcanberra  Code:sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module -yAfter that, again try Code:sudo gpa, and it should open the GUI of GNU Privacy Assistant, and you can create your keys from here. I believe you already know how to do that. Ok. I have generated my keys already, and you can see them below;Quote➥ Export Public Key: To export your public key, right-click on your key and select Export keys...QuoteSelect your destination and write a name with .txt extension.

However, I have customized the interface a lot and now it looks like a Mac. LOL. Yes, I am using Linux with dual boot. Running on a virtual box is not recommended. You can still try if you want. The customization is done by my best friend. I do not have any freaking idea how the hell he did them. I barely know these commands and the installation process. So, I won't be able to guide you.",

RSA and RSA are the default, and I will generate the RSA and RSA one. To generate RSA and RSA keys, type 1 and enter. RSA keys can be from 1024 bits to 4096 bits long. 3072 is the default one, but I am creating 4096 here. So write 4096 and hit enter.

My bad. Yes, it is a 3072-bit RSA. I do not understand the difference between the 4096-bit RSA and 3072-bit RSA. But when I try to import another key generated by OpenKeyChain, it shows the key is 3072-bit RSA. This app doesn't give me a choice to pick 3072-bit RSA or 4096-bit RSA. So, 3072-bit RSA is generated by default from Openkeychain.

It is also true that I didn't use GnuPG before the day I installed it. As I already said, I am new to Linux and have never used macOS. I have used Cleopatra in Windows for PGP and OpenKeychain for Android. I was already happy with Cleopatra, but as you can see now, I have tried these OS just because I wanted to write a tutorial and try Linux for security purposes.
