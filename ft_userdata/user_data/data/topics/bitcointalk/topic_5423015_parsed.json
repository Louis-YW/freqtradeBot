I have read about a similar topic a while ago, where some (but not all) users were surprised that they were unable to carry out their transfers using Metamask on the browser, and it seems that users from certain regions such as Syria and some countries that suffer from international sanctions have been targeted. Users indicated that a malfunction message appears to them every time they want to make a transfer, and this was the first indication that developers have the ability to change settings and set usage limits.Metamask wallet is considered relatively safe, but it is preferable not to be completely reliable.",

They claim that they don't collect user information and wallet seed. After years of operation, there is no detection or complain from community, users about that but maybe there are things hidden behind their statement. Who knows?I am sure your IP addresses can be collected easily by Metamask.They are non custodial wallets and you have access to wallet seeds but you only don't know whether Metamask owns it too.A good non custodial wallet is an open-source and you can download, verify it and use it offline. Offline means you can create your wallet offline, without Internet connection.",

I think what you are saying about collects data is the transactions being process and can be seen in the explorer correct me if I'm wrong, with the ip address if you are familiar with layers of the network this have process and it travels through servers until it reach its destinations and its very important and there is no way to hide it, starting from your local network going outside there is an information being process so its normal, connecting to other networks with alter information that might be dangerous because there are exploits for example in metamask if you want to change network because of a certain coin that needs to be setup that i think you need to double check carefully, and also careful with your metamask wallet, and the key, don't just connect to unknown and new networks just for free coins or airdrops.",

If this is true then there is no point using this wallet at all and people who don't know should stay away. Unless someone prove me wrong. There is no such concept as a decentralized wallet because it is just a code, a piece of software that is being developed by a centralized group of people. If these people stop developing and maintaining Metamask, it is highly unlikely it will continue to exist as a reliable wallet. However, the process of development can be somewhat decentralized because you can organize this process and set the rules about who can make changes and under what conditions they can be made. The problem with Metamask is that it is built for a centralized blockchain, where the number of full nodes is extremely low. Even if your wallet is non-custodial and is being developed in a decentralized manner, you still rely on data provided by centralized entities. Given that these centralized services are the only source of information that makes your wallet work, it is in their power to tell you what to do, which transactions to block, and what data to collect.",

If this is true then there is no point using this wallet at all and people who don't know should stay away. Unless someone prove me wrong. If you worry about the IP address, why you don't install metamask through TOR as the extension (use firefox add-ons)? But, that makes you a bit busy because TOR will delete all cookies and cache after you closed. Then when you want to open Tor and Metamask again, you must insert the mnemonic seed again, just simply like that.",

If this is true then there is no point using this wallet at all and people who don't know should stay away. Unless someone prove me wrong. Yes, this is true, as MetaMask will collect the IP addresses and the addresses of the wallets when making transfers via the default RPC on the wallet, and the RPC data is the data that you enter when adding a new blockchain network to the MetaMask. Frankly, this contradicts the nature of decentralized wallets that give users high privacy. In my opinion, after collecting this data, it will be easy to reveal the identity of the users, especially if they are users from European countries because they use the static IP, so the solution is to use a VPN to change the IP and use RPC information from a third party that does not collect this data and replaces the default Ethereum blockchain information on the MetaMask wallet.",

They don't have anything to do with privacy, it's just up to the wallet that want to offer privacy or not.If you think VPN will solve this issue than you're wrong, VPN will give you a low privacy and as long as you're still connect your wallet to central server (not run in full node, although it's impossible in ETH or BNB) your privacy can still leaked.",

Where are the people when they ban or censor users within a specific country, didn't they think somehow they already had those capabilities way long ago?IMO, the main problem of ETH is that ecosystem didn't think thoroughly about the consequence of centralization, this causes, and also makes most users won't bother running their own node. If someone did not want their privacy taken up, they must use their own controlled nodes or RPC to connect to the network. Even if you choose another third-party RPC, there isn't any assurance they won't secretly log an IP.",
