  "content": "AI is the next big thing in the tech world and many big enterprises are beginning to welcome it with open arms. Following the rise of AI, ChatGPT has cemented itself as one of the most sought after AI tools in the industry. Well... I've got some bad news for users of the popular ChatGPT. According to a report by the Group-IB IS company over 101,100 account credentials are reported to have been sold on the dark web marketplaces between june 2022 and may 2023. According to the report, Indian ranks number one with 12,632 stolen credentials, while Pakistan and Brazil occupy the second and third positions respectively. A geographical distribution statisticsQuoteInformation stealers have become popular among cybercriminals for their ability to hijack passwords, cookies, credit cards, and other information from browsers, and cryptocurrency wallet extensions. \"Logs containing compromised information harvested by info stealers are actively traded on dark web marketplaces,\" Group-IB said. Additional information about logs available on such markets includes the lists of domains found in the log as well as the information about the IP address of the compromised host. Typically offered based on a subscription-based pricing model, they have not only lowered the bar for cybercrime, but also serve as a conduit for launching follow-on attacks using the siphoned credentials. QuoteTo mitigate such risks, it's recommended that users follow appropriate password hygiene practices and secure their accounts with two-factor authentication (2FA) to prevent account takeover attacks.Although, Group-IB feels the parent company OpenAI shouldn't be blamed for the exploited logins. But on a more serious note, I think we should be mindful of how we share our data because of the harm that can be done to us if it falls on the wrong hands.Source: https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/over-100000-stolen-chatgpt-account.html?m=1",

They never had any kind third party verification tool on their login page. If this news is correct OpenAI would get a bad reputation and they will implement more security measures to improve their reputation. I some how feel it has happened then it couldn't have been done without the help of someone from the organization.",

      "body": "OpenAI, ChatGPT are not available for registration at all countries globally so we know there are dark markets to buy and sell ChatGPT accounts. Such accounts and markets are favorite by people who are living in countries that is restricted by OpenAI and ChatGPT.Like all other account sales, it is risky and you can lose your money but can not get your ChatGPT account to use. Or you will lose your ChatGPT accounts later when the sellers reclaim their ownership on those sold accounts.I did not know reasons and procedures of this account sale on Dark Web but I am not surprising.",

      "body": "Well this is no surprise for me that ChatGPT credentials are being sold on dark web. It is not allowed in every country so people will want to break the law and buy other peoples information so they can use it. It is a very helpful tool so people will break the laws to have credentials.Â  It is a surprise for me that ChatGPT is illegal in Italy. I did think it would be legal there because it is a first world country. And I think there is alot of tech there so there has to be a reason for it being illegal to use. China it makes sense to me.",

Some AI were helping to keep serving the patient by providing some little help, like giving them their drugs and water, while others were sending food. Those are the kinds of AI I like.",
