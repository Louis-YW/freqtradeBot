And it's good that they made the decision to go back to work because having many millions, all the time in the world and being bored can land you in a detox clinic, or even more, dead from overdosing.In the end the good thing about being rich and being able to retire is that if you feel like it you can retire for a season, like a long vacation that can be a year if you want. Then when you come back you work in what you like, what motivates you and with the schedules you set for yourself. It is very different to work for someone else on a fixed schedule that they impose on you and because you need money to eat than to work on something you like the way you plan it yourself.",

Our time to retire will come when it's time for us to go into this world.",

Unfortunately, many people who do not have to work (for some reason) and have a lot of money, often do not know what to do with themselves, which can be a big problem.I think that many people dream of early retirement because they do jobs they don't want to do or hate those same jobs from the bottom of their souls, while others you can't force into retirement even when they have to do it by law. However, many see their workplace as something more than making money, whether they enjoy the work they do or the people they are surrounded by.I think it is important that a person has a goal and an interest in life, and then it is not a problem if for some reason he/she retires early.",

For instance in my country the legal age to retire is 60 years, but you can only work actively for 35 years before retirement.I've seen a lot of people even after retirement, they still feel the urge to work again, because as human being you need to keep your mind and your body at work. Sitting down idol may lead to thinking and depression, but I won't advise anybody to retire at a young age, not minding the kind of money you have,  Because the world still needs your experience and expertise. If you decide to retire at 40, what the heck are you going to do with the rest of your life, because going to work or engaging your self is another way of keeping your body and mind sharp.In my university for instance, lectures are allowed to work till they are 75 years old, except you insist you want to go on early retirement, the reason for that 75 years is that, they still need the knowledge of this lecturer's because there wealth of knowledge is second to none.",

Before I retired early I already knew I couldn't just vegetate doing nothing that would kill me eventually. So I'm doing some occasional side-hustles (not for the remuneration obviously but more like for fun) and some building/house renovation tasks and small repairs around the house. That keeps me busy and doesn't let my brain to idle a single moment. I'm also adding sports to the mix occasionally that also helps a lot.",

In your cousin case, there’s no guarantee that his earnings until 40’s will be sufficient enough to pay his illness expenses.At the end of the day, We will become sick and our generation has low life span. His choice of early retirement his the best for me since he enjoy his life while he is still young since it's brutal that you work your ass until 40's then get sick while you are just recently retired. It's such a waste saving money using most of you life span just to use it to pay for your illness treatment then become poor afterwards when you get old in case you survive the illness.",

You cannot equate everyone's desire to retire early because not everyone has the same job and there are many people who have more than one job. So if all of that has been considered carefully enough, I don't think it would be wrong for someone who wants to retire early as long as he doesn't feel any difficulties in his life.",

Retirement means that you're just reducing any work-related activities and you focus more on yourself and your well-being. Most retired people have an investment or businesses, so that even if they stopped working, they are still able to earn for their living. We should also take note that early retirement doesn't necessarily mean that a person is not happy anymore with their job. But it can be a sign that they have reached financial stability and independence that's why they retired. Remember that retirement takes a lot of planning and preparation and it was not an easy decision to make.

You have to be prepared if you planned to retire in the future, because the moment you do so, you cannot turn back and change your decision. I believe that retirement is a bold decision to make, because you need to consider various factors before deciding whether to or not to resign.",

Retirement is sweet when you have alternative to what you are currently doing if your investment has really matured to cover future expenditures and health insurance. You can't quit what you do for a living when your investment is yet to mature, its like taking risk when you know that the road is still blurry and to think his age, 35 is still very young to chase dreams and make more money.I laughed hard when some people in the forum say they would retire if they made some amount of Bitcoin but it seems they forget that wealth accumulation is a continuous process, there is nothing really wrong in having more money if the source is not taking much of your time, the money coming from that place will help you cover some bills. Like your cousin, had it been he didn't quit that his job, who knows the money from his job would have helped me take care of his health and his investment would have continued to grow without touching it.",

Yeah, I would like to call it a myth because many people really think that making enough money and getting retirement at an early age is better, but I have seen people get sick just because they stay idle and don't use their minds that much. Don't get busy with any hobby. And in the end, their health got bad. And that's so unfortunate. And talking about your cousin, I hope he will get well soon.I am living in a society where we don't have the concept of retiring and doing no work at all. Even in my family, I have one person from whom I take motivation, he spent 30+ years in a foreign country earning money, and when he came home, he had enough funds to retire. But he did not do so, instead, he started to do work in the field. He started to cultivate garlic and kept himself busy.The point is, he is almost 60+ years old, and he is still working in the field and has now opened a shop too.I have seen many people in their 70s who are working, not because they have no funds to retire, but  they don't want to stay free and want to be of some use in the community so that they can contribute to the economy too. And we all should not think of retiring at an early age. And to be honest, I am quite amazed to see that your cousin retired at the age of 35. I mean, people in my country start to do work at this age (some stable work).",

      "body": "I didn't really think about this as I've always thought in my entire life that retiring early means I can explore the world but what if you've got bored or don't feel accomplished at it  you'll be back working again? No matter how much money you save if you are getting bored in your retirement instead of enjoying it that is probably a sign that you'll be back at work.It is still not clear and I can't digest this thought right now as I do want to have an early retirement and just relax in life but it is really better to work hard so that you won't need to work again at your old age because you don't have enough money.",
