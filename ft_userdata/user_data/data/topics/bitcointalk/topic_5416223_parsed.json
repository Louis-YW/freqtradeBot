      "body": "Why you're nowadays forced to reveal your identity to purchase bitcoins, and how you can get the balance of your wallet are two different questions.Simple answer to the former is: Because of bureaucracy. Bitcoin exists 13 years now, regulators couldn't have not put their dirty hands on it. Mandatory request of personal information means there will be more control over to who buys what, and less tax avoidance, both of which are priorities to them. To opt out (from this central point of failure as well), utilize Decentralize Exchanges (DEX): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5393961",

Quote from: teosanru on October 06, 2022, 07:38:09 PMand you can access it by logging in with your public and private key together in any bitcoin thin client. Again wrong. For accessing your wallet, your private key is enough. Your public key is derived from the private key.",

I think the problem is from your end because you don't ask any questions on this forum about the so-called exchange before you choose to buy crypto on their site and apart from that, buying crypto on a credit card is not a good idea from my own understanding unless you don't care about privacy and unauthorized use of your credit card.i will advise you to make use of Kycnot in the future for no KYC trading of crypto.Quote from: r111 on October 06, 2022, 06:51:13 PMHow can I see the funds I have in a paper wallet created in bitaddress ?

This is possible having a non custodial wallet and finding a trader who is ready to exchange bitcoin in exchange for gift cards. You can buy gift cards and use an escrow for the transfer of fund.

Moreover, if this is on the top exchange, KYC is commonly required. Many people try to search for other alternatives for buying Bitcoin using credit cards or another type of payment.I read about Paxful, this is popular enough to buy Bitcoin without any verification.
