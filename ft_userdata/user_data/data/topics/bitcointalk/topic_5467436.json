There is no doubt that Bitcoin has a strong potential to reach a higher price.I would slightly disagree with you that a large number of Bitcoin and Bitcoin holders are not looking forward to this season.There is no doubt that Bitcoin has a huge impact on prices in all crypto currency markets,and the entire pricing structure is tied to Bitcoin.It is considered as the king of all crypt currencies in the crypto currency market,but that doesn't mean that people who have Bitcoin or are buying Bitcoin aren't waiting for bull season.Rather, all those who bought Bitcoin in the bear season are definitely waiting for the bull season to reap good profits. A strong Bitcoin position doesn't mean you should hold it forever, but sell it when you get a good profit,because there is always the chance, that when the prices go up, they will go down again, where you can buy Bitcoin at a low price again, because after every bull season comes the bear season.The bottom line is that we all always invest to get a good return.",

I agree that the halving was a strong catalyst for the past bull seasons, but it was not the only factor driving the uptrend.  you're right, we're facing a lot and it's difficult to say what the next bull season will look like.  the halving cannot guarantee us anything, but people are relying solely on it and ignoring other factors. But as for calling bitcoin the father of them all, I would probably agree with the OP on this since bitcoin is still dominating almost 50% of the market cap, it is still the main determinant of existence of the cryptocurrency market.",

I couldn't find precise info about the margin of error there, but I think it's in days, maximum a few weeks. As for the price, it's not something that can be accurately predicted at all, unless we're talking about very generic predictions (for example, it's highly unlikely Bitcoin will cost less than $10k in 2024, and it's also highly likely the price will not be above $500k).As for Bitcoin being the father of the crypto market, I suppose you could say that, considering that other coins appeared later but based on the same technology, but I don't think this metaphor means much to me because fathers can be different, Bitcoin did not take part in upbringing of other cryptos, etc.",

Well it's because of how effective Bitcoin price will be to the crypto market entirely.The movement of the price of altcoins solely depends on Bitcoin. Many altcoin holders believe that the Bitcoin halving will also have a positive impact on the prices of altcoins. It is vital to know that it is not certain that the Bitcoin halving will lead to a pump in the price of all altcoins. The bull run is always the season of increase in scam shitcoins.  Hence, people who are hoping to make huge instant gains should be careful.

Unless I read it wrongly, but the non bitcoin holders are interested in the bitcoin bull run, because they'll benefit as well. They'll be a huge movement in the price of their altcoins. It's fine to sell during the bull, for profit reasons, but regrettable when selling at the wrong time. And that's why hodlers must stay observant to correctly indicate the beginning of bear season after the bullish run.  On the other hand, are we just trusting on the halving season as a bullish moment because of past positive reactions of bitcoin price after halving. I mean isn't it speculation or prediction. Is they any algorithm that backs the trust of having a bullish run after halving. However, if the price of bitcoin goes up others follow, and it makes it the father indeed. Because bitcoin is talked about in media, a lot of TV stations and financial blogs always discuss bitcoin during bull run, and it helps the growth of cryptocurrency market in general.  Despite the risk involved many people will invest or look for altcoins with small prices to invest, hoping for huge profits during the bull run.",

But it also conveys the message. I really liked your enthusiasm about BTC and how much belief you have in the halving (scarcity) factor that will increase the price of BTC to new heights. But you should not take it for guaranteed and only invest with what you don't fear to lose. This means that would not affect your practical life and your mental health. Most people with such a mindset think that if the market is really going up then why not just invest it all and when the new ATH is made then we will book the profit or we will book the profit when we get the chance at first hand. This idea seems good but it's not that easy to hold, accumulate BTC, and then time the market to book the profit, while you can fall prey to market sentiments on the way. I am not trying to scare you instead I just wanted to warn you that, don't take things for a guarantee as in crypto we don't have any guarantee.",

The halving might play a vital role in this as, it’s a major event not just for bitcoin but, within the cryptospace entirely.The halving basically brings about an explosive publicity for bitcoin thereby, brining in new and huge investors who/whom hope to take opportunity of the innovative awareness which creates more buy pressure on circulating coins (remember: many of these coins are still been hoarded in various wallets) and the block reward continues to disintegrate.So, there is an inverse relationship that exists here which is,The disintegration of block reward, followed by the increased population of investors. This creates the conditions for scarcity and as such, price appreciation.",

Halving leads to decrease in miners rewards, the price increase should have something to do with that and not because bitcoin is going to be scarce, it will not be scarce even at that period. More purchase of bitcoin at that time could lead to high price that time but this cannot still be quantify or even related to what actually halving is all about.
