If not you can simply reject their purchase or tell them to pay using another method other than their shitcoin. It may be called a currency but it's still up to YOU, the business owner, whether to accept said currencies as payment or not. Can't even find the damn coin in coinmarketcap, says a lot about the coin already just from that. \\If you're that desperate though then you might need a change in your business model itself since you, as an owner, should not need to adopt the payment methods of your customers. It should be the other way around really, especially for an unknown coin like this, you shouldn't even bother asking what to do or not really, just decline if they want to force the payment using their shitcoin.",

From the sounds of the coin is obviously a shitcoin, would you accept something like this which you dont know if even have value? Its make sense that you avoid dealing with unfamiliar coins or tokens which seems to be suspicious especially if you are doing business.",

Prioritizing security and dependability is critical as a business owner, and it is prudent to use payment methods that are generally accepted in the business community.

But still it's up to you if you will accept but If I were you I don't want to accept it. Anyways in my own  that's shitcoin is not familiar yet in exchange so must better if we secure our side that we loss because of that.",

I’m not sure if there’s an agenda you are trying to push but it’s not welcome. Please don’t shill coins in a non sincere way. If by chance this is genuine then tell them you can’t accept this form of payment. I can’t imagine you will lose much business.",

Haven't heard of it, probably because there are hundreds of alts in the marker, but if you yourself doesn't even know what it is, then it's better keep your business out of it. If you're interested in accepting crypto payments to your business, then it's always better to just accept bitcoin, ETH, and a few common alts that is widely acceptable in the market today. But that TFC or whatever coin is that doesn't sound like it has a real value. If I assume there's more than one customer who wants to pay with that coin, correct? Encourage them to use bitcoin instead or any top alts that has low tx fees like Ltc.",

Therefore, you should be careful and not accept any unknown or unlisted tokens, and it is better to receive payment through BTC or the TOP altcoins in the market and the stablecoins, as suggested by members here. Also, you should not send your services to them first after completing it; even if they agree with you to receive top tokens, you must implement all the ways to guarantee your rights and make it difficult for others to deceive you.",

TFC is a name Im not familiar with even though I've been working with cryptocurrencies for a while. Your desire to please your customers is understandable, but its important to make sure you're not getting lost. Whats the point of going down a road with a coin that is probably not even on trustworthy exchanges?If you're really looking for a way to get TFC to pay out, you should first find out which markets list this coin, if any. Truthfully, you could be falling down a rabbit hole. You could also take mainstream coins if you really want to. We all know them because they're popular. A new coin doesnt have to change your mind. Make sure you stay alert and think carefully about every move you make in this unstable area.",
