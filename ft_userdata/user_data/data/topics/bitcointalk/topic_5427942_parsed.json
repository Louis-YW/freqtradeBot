The forum might use community consensus in some areas, but it is inevitably run solely by the admin theymos, and it's he who can determine that; he's the one who sees the data on mod action and which boards are not getting enough moderation.Editing the names of the inactive mods out from those boards would solve half of the problem, which is this topic being raised and discussed often. Anyone drawing attention to the news to recruit new mods then would be doing so based on them noticing delays in confirmation of reports on certain boards.",

So, instead of putting a name there that isn't active as mods while someone else does the job why not put the real user who is doing the job.

As long as the problem can be fixed and the inactivity of some of the moderators is not yet a problem in terms of moderation, then I don't think the forum need new moderators. But it would be great to get moderators so that the moderation can be more organized and reduce the burden of global moderator moderation.It is possible to add moderators to several boards or get replacements. But I think so far that moderation across some board is fine. Plus the merit system has at least made the forum seem reduce spam than before the merit system was introduced, so stay positive as long as it's not a problem.",
