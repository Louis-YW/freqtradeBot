So how can you be a Bitcoin supplier?Or you might be talking about trading related to exchange inflow and outflow but I don't see if the market is crashing look at the Bitcoin price chart for 30 days it continuously rising.Or I think you are offering something for a limited-time offer?",

If you're looking to pump BTC price, increasing the numbers of miners sounds good but they can easily quit if they don't find it profitable (even BTC price is sky high). And yes, everyone can mine regardless of where they live, and most of them don't need PayPal or something like that to receive the rewards. If you can't sell them, then store them and hold them for months or years. Not really an ideal choice if you want to get profits but better than trading it with shitcoin I guess.If you're talking about fiat conversion, if you live in a country where there is no fiat exchange, you can try P2P or sell your coins on the forum. If you're worried about the government blocking your money because it is related to mining or crypto, I guess your choice is limited to P2P trade with a privacy-focused platform. Another alternative would be moving away, but that is rather difficult for most people. That being said, I think most governments (around my region at least) don't consider trading crypto as a crime, at most you are not allowed to pay stuff with crypto.",

The only thing which is gonna change is the difficulty.More miners = More hashrate on BTC network = difficulty increasingIf you cannot exchange BTC with FIAT legaly in your country, you should have a look on Bisq for example, or Localbitcoin (but here KYC is needed if I remember well)Quote from: mutasim on February 07, 2023, 06:10:50 PMOk if i connect to multiple miners and offer a miner method how i can get profitable and the other miners and how is the limit of possibility of losing If you want to calculate how profitable you will be with mining, you have to know some things :-your kw/h price (is electricity cheap where you live ?) In general, you will need a kw/h price < 0.05usd to be profitable, but this data changes.-how much you have to spend on ASICs : when will you hit ROI ? If you buy used ASICs ROI is easier to hit, but your ASICs could be unstable or not working if you don't buy from a good seller.-how much taxes you will have to pay on your profit-how much taxes you will need to pay for customs if you buy miners from USA or China for exampleYou can add some other costs as : a place to host your miners, they are ultra-noisy and creates a strong hot temperature in the room they are. + is it legal in your country to mine cryptocurrencies ? I mean, it will be difficult to hide this kind of electrical consumption from the governement / electricity provider.",
