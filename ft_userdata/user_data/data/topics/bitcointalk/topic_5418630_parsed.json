By looking at the market today, full of scammer roaming around, and countless unsavoury characters and get rich quick scheme, jobless highly educated youth. I conclude buyhouse is not only a “forced saving” but also a “save yourselves”. We often heard about a lot of highly educated youth had no jobs, underemployed, which is very bad today and getting worse day by day. What they often failed to see is it has been norms in the past, do you not know every scientist is borderline poor and bloke, Albert Einstein is not rich, Newton Isaac is bankrupt poor on south sea bubble, Wright brother is poor, we often read about how great are scientist on the textbook who create useful invention to improve life, but there is a catch, the textbook conveniently never mention the scientist personal wealth, it’s apparent textbook censor the information they do not want the kids to know all the scientist are living paycheck to paycheck and borderline poor, where they often has to wagecuck and sell their IP to the government to make a living, if they failed to create any IP they would be rejected just another bloke we often see on the street today, is homeless educated guy not often in the past? Friedcat of the bitcoin is the modern day jobless highly educated genius, he is often regarded as “genius youth who is living a frugal life”, despite awarded with scholarship, and secure the top spot in the top business school, the guy goes on and create very useful product, create the asicminer, but very quickly the guy just simply goes broke and fall into endless debt burden, his company is broken, life broken and going missing forever after he couldn’t pay the debt he owned, oh how ironically he is just the modernise Newton Isaac in disguise, such a nice addition, so guy listen, keep following the advice of go to school and study hard get good grade, get a good paying job with benefit, you would eventually made it in life, miraculously and magically you would be living happy ending life, it’s fine guy! Then I’m often getting bombarded with doubt “Do you have a better system than existing one? Do you?” Obviously I don’t have any and I would never come up with one, keep trying to beat the house and to realise how great/lesser a person you are.House price is soaring, but finance advisor telling me to debt maxxing on house loan 90% loan and 0~10% dp, and it’s fine. Because bank want to increase revenue, increasing house price is what the bank did, by increasing house price, guy would take more loan to buy house, that way bank can increase revenue by increasing house price and increasing the loan to buy house, then bank can charge interest on the house loan to make profit. But what I often heard is guy tell me to debt maxing on house loan, don’t care about saving, it’s a recipe to disaster to me. So guy today hope the house price to collapse and they can shop house on the bargain, that’s one wishful thinking, the bank cartel and house developer wouldn’t allow that to happen, reduce house price would make it bad for bank to sell more house loan, and bad for developer too, the blackrock would stop that effort, however as usual some guy would loss everything due to greed, if over leveraged on house loan, would loss everything.",

By looking at the market today, full of scammer roaming around, and countless unsavoury characters and get rich quick scheme, jobless highly educated youth. I conclude buyhouse is not only a “forced saving” but also a “save yourselves”. It's still speculation.I mean a house in the wrong use will not be able to provide any results, except for people who are married and need a decent place to live.Utilization of the house can be classified into several functions.1. Residence2. For rent3. BusinessQuoteWe often heard about a lot of highly educated youth had no jobs, underemployed, which is very bad today and getting worse day by day. This is a fact that actually happens, education does not guarantee someone can improve their standard of living for the better, because the function of education is not only about finding a job.Instead, we will be able to get out of the poverty line, when we have the skills and expertise in our respective fields.QuoteWhat they often failed to see is it has been norms in the past, do you not know every scientist is borderline poor and bloke, Albert Einstein is not rich, Newton Isaac is bankrupt poor on south sea bubble, Wright brother is poor, we often read about how great are scientist on the textbook who create useful invention to improve life, but there is a catch, the textbook conveniently never mention the scientist personal wealth, it’s apparent textbook censor the information they do not want the kids to know all the scientist are living paycheck to paycheck and borderline poor, where they often has to wagecuck and sell their IP to the government to make a living.  We are always faced with how to solve our own problems, depending on the government is a backward thinking system, they (the government) cannot reach all levels of society, so it is not right to expect full from them.That's why the skill and courage to get out of the comfort zone is the style of people who have a life vision for success. Bitcoin provides opportunities for anyone, depending on how we use it and everyone has the right to choose a way of life with their own pattern, but I think bitcoin is the solution to the problem you wrote about at length.QuoteThen I’m often getting bombarded with doubt “Do you have a better system than existing one? Do you?” Obviously I don’t have any and I would never come up with one, keep trying to beat the house and to realise how great/lesser a person you are. The choice lies in the way you move and think, technology is developing rapidly nowadays, everyone can learn about existing or new investment models.Personally I prefer investment ?1. Bitcoin2. Gold3. LandThe three investment models I mentioned can maintain currency values, regardless of inflation or not, and maybe you don't need to believe what I say, but technological developments provide a lot of information that you can dig into to make a decision.QuoteHouse price is soaring, but finance advisor telling me to debt maxxing on house loan 90% loan and 0~10% dp, and it’s fine. Because bank want to increase revenue, increasing house price is what the bank did, by increasing house price, guy would take more loan to buy house, that way bank can increase revenue by increasing house price and increasing the loan to buy house, then bank can charge interest on the house loan to make profit.  The biggest mistake people make is buying a house using a bank loan, did you know that the financial system has different interest rates, we are forced to take money from them, then told to return it at a predetermined time. Interest rates can ensnare us in new problems, because if we cannot cover the installments, then there will be a finality given, even worse when several times we do not pay the installments, the collateral we use is sold according to a predetermined agreement. Our lives cannot be controlled by others, there are still many ways to get out of the Bank system.Bitcoin can be a solution to the problems that people face, many people have managed to get out of financial difficulties by using bitcoin, but not everyone is successful, if they don't understand how best to invest in Bitcoin.Fluctuations and risk are two things that society will face, and it is important to know them thoroughly, so that we do not fall into fear and panic when bitcoin undergoes a correction.",

This is all wrong here.House prices are not soaring, it is exactly the opposite. Interest rates are high , less people can afford a loan because it is expensive now. So less people buy houses , less demand = lower price.Anyone should be careful about making debts now as interest rates are rising all over the world.",

Going broke and lacking the ability to provide basic needs is not a good experience and being in debt makes life very difficult and sometimes unbearable. But OP mentioned some notable inventors that were not rich because their main goal was not to make a profit. Most of them just had the intention to use their discoveries to bless humanity.In my country the mortgage sector is paralytic, hence we don't have a government sector or many private firms that can satisfy the mortgage needs of my countrymen. Most houses in my country are built with personal savings.Housing can be for personal use or business. Taking a loan to build your own house would be beneficial if the interest rate is low and it helps you to save money that would have been spent on rent. Also, the population of my country is growing rapidly and it has led to high demand for housing facilities. Taking a loan to build a commercial house might be a very profitable investment.",

At the moment it feels like we are hovering near record highs and a small correction to house prices should be coming in the next year or two. However it could vary wildly between countries, some countries might plateau, others might see a dip similar to the financial crisis where it took maybe 5 years to recover, but ultimately it seems buying a house is sound advice. What is the alternative? You will simply be paying off someone elses mortgage instead, so if you can get a mortgage and deposit together it seems very wise to make the leap into home ownership. However younger generations now seem further than ever from owning a house because they have risen so much in previous years and wage increases have not kept pace.",

I've seen a lot of houses -- or even lots -- go up in value even though other houses on other areas continue to decline. Location is king in real estate, and the more you are close with a lot of things, the better it is for you even if you end up having a hard time paying for its mortgage. You will also have a backup home if worse comes to worst. Maintenance would be hell though, but if you can buy a house, you most probably can afford its maintenance as well.",

Constructing a house for our long need is different, but constructing a house for pride with loans is bad decision. When it is applied to commercial purpose, atleast it'll bring some revenue. In third world countries people having a good house is rich and that too a reason why people prefer on house over stocks and other forms of investment.Cant really deny this fact on which whenever you do build a good looking big house then people's impression would be changing up or would be automatically tell to themselves that the one who owns it is rich.We know that we do have that pride or ego that being praised like that is something that could bring up some good feeling but its not really that right as this would tolerate you up with that kind of mindset which might cause up some unwise spendings or investments on other things which it would be more rather worth if you do put it up on something which could bring out more profitsrather than on buying things which doesnt generate income.Well, we do really have wishes and goals in life like having a good looking house and other things that will give out comfortable living but we should really be having those balanced means.",
