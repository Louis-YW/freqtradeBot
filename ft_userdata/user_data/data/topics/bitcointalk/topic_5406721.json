  "content": "The exchange starting asking me where do you get the funds,while I honestly maximum exchange like 800-1000 dollars monthly there.I told them about working online,providing them screenshots,also of my mining activity and I provided them also,now they want all kind of other transaction ID,where do you get the money,tell us screenshots of your miners (physically) not like I showed them that I own them by also providing screenshots of my own Bitcoin wallets as I have quite some for different purposes.Now they asked me for electricity bill and they say it would be highly appreciated,what the f is wrong with the world,more specifically the UK as they are based in UK which has not such law yet as of Binance and EU.Where to sell my Bitcoins then which can I withdraw to credit card,Binance not because where I live now there is a restriction for this country?",

Generally, exchanges like this need to be suppressed in a certain place so that they ease the unblock requirements, like this forum.Good luck.Thank you,I will keep that in mind as a last resort,I provided them all the details needed although there is privacy risk by doing so,I will use bestchange.com as the exchange,sure the commissions were somewhat high compared to other exchanges but they had some exchanges listed there that could do directly payment to my Credit Card so in the worst case if I don't go forward with Cex anymore and also I don't find a solution to my problem,exchanging some of my coins for USD then as a last resort I may contact the Cex account as suggested by you,for now I don't really care much about them.Locking thread for the moment.",
