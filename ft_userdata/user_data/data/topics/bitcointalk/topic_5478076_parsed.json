  "content": "Hello Everyone,  I am new to mining and been doing a ton of research of what to buy and what to look out for.  I'm looking to buy a ASIC miner, but really don't want to pay the mark up.  Eventually I would like to mine all the types of crypto, but have to start off with something.  For example, IceRiver looks good, but on their website they are sold out. If I look on eBay there is a huge mark up on them.  Any advice where else to buy?  Do I trust the https://www.asicminervalue.com/ telling me that Akminer, Nhash, Jingle Mining, ect are trusted resellers.  Is there some where I should follow when the latest ASIC is released or a mailer list to get on?  It appears to be ahead of the game is to buy as soon as it is released.  Looking at this a just a fun hobby. Eventually would like a ASIC for each of the different cryptocurrency's probably from all different manufactures.Thanks in advance.",

They buy ASICs in large wholesale, so their prices are much lower than on the official website.If you buy several ASICs, you will still pay a premium, and if your electricity is still expensive, then you can pay back the investment in 1.5-3 years if the ASIC does not break down first.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5473513.0",

      "body": "According to data compiled by TheMinerMag, a dozen public mining companies have made purchase orders for spot and future stocks of bitcoin miners totaling over 70 EH/s this year so far. Their miner investment commitments total more than $1.2 billion year-to-date, with approximately $750 million signed over the past two months. Some of those purchases have already been paid and some will be due in monthly batches over the next year and beyond. In total, public mining companies tracked by TheMinerMag have already spent $747 million in the first three quarters this year on property, plant and equipment.Chinese miner manufacturers are set to be the biggest winners from these purchasing deals. Of the $1.1 billion investment identified by TheMinerMag, MicroBT and Bitmain account for 56% and 42%, respectively, with Canaan accounting for the rest of it. https://theminermag.com/news/2023-12-07/miner-weekly-bitcoin-halving-investmentAnd next year it will be even more difficult to make profit in Bitcoin mining. Look for miners for altcoins.",

Aside from that, I can vouch from nhash and jingle mining as I've bought from them in the past",

I think It's better you find out how much tax might have to pay from the customs authority before you consider importing the mining gear.",

I think It's better you find out how much tax might have to pay from the customs authority before you consider importing the mining gear.Normally when you import miners from China there is often no duty 0 % duty. There is only VAT to be paid. If you are VAT paying company they will pass you these items without VAT so you basically pay nothing. Latter you need to deal with it in accounting but that is everybody own business.",

I won’t talk about large quantities of ASICs, but you can buy several ASICs for your home without additional duties. Check this with the supplier's transport company.",
