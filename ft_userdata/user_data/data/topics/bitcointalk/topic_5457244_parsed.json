The current pump is happening for more than a day and just reach the previous high before the SEC FUD started to affect market price. The current pump is also supported by a very bullish news so there’s no way that this is a bull trap since everyone is buying including whale and retail since we are confident that SEC will be less aggressive agains crypto market after the recent ETF filings by multiple company with notable filings by Blackrock.This pump might be the start of the real bull run because this is different from the previous run since it’s backed by a positive news that is worth believing to be positive on crypto.",

In fact, you already know that the market trend will go up and down, it doesn't it was a trap as it goes like that. If you're buying today and just hold when it dumps, you never lose any $$$ but if you sell them because of worries, that was your mistake. I encourage you to stop thinking about the \"bear trap\" but rather make you understand that it will come. All you need is to trust and give faith.",

      "body": "The current recovery is likely to be a result of Binance reaching an agreement with the SEC after several days of negotiations. During that time, a large variety of Altcoins that were declared securities plummeted in value. Only Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum managed to retain their ground. Some claim that the whole incident wasn't as serious as it was portrayed, especially if you take into account how quickly it was resolved in an attempt by the media, perhaps whales, and people of influence to manipulate the market.With that being said, the current upward trend is likely to be only temporary; without claiming that it'll crash again, such sudden growth in the market can hardly be sustained.",

An investor who sold his house all for BTC may really be the most upset person in the world blaming Blackrock.You just have to keep watching the market, you wouldn't know when they start dumping.",

I wasn't holding any specific amount I wanted buy during last dip but this came to me that the market could possibly go low so was still watching the market before it changes it direction to a potential Green which I think I am already left out of the race, that was why I asked if I could get into the market presently seeing that bitcoin taken another new dimension. The sudden change might be as a result of good news or positive sign for bitcoin growth.",

The market is getting better and its a good sign, but I can say that it will not be an easy pump after all and there will be corrections as well. If in doubt then wait for confirmation and don’t rush in the market buying, if BTC breaks another resistance, that’s a good sign of a real up trend.",

But I am a bit confused if this could be a bear trap, what do you think of the market is there any good analyst to give accurate results on what would happen next or to know if this is a bear trap.That would be literally every pump of any solid alt market. Honestly, if you were new to the market, you should've bought during the dip, not when it was going up already. Looking at the chart the market was generally on the positive through out the past half a year, heck it actually grew instead, so I wouldn't be surprised if it suddenly broke down. Seeing as it's a stable growth though and not exactly a sudden pump, there should be higher chances of it stabilizing instead. If you were shorting then it doesn't really matter whether it's a bear trap or not, you'd always adjust for what you need. If long, then just buy and maybe DCA. You're not thinking for the next few weeks or months anyway, it'd probably take a year at least before you come back and decide whether to sell or not.",

It doesn't matter if it's a trap or not, as long as we can make a strategy that is ready with various possibilities. If it's a trap, at least we've taken profits, even if a little. And later maybe do DCA again when the market is down. The point is, if we can take advantage of every moment to get profits, why not? Don't get too fixated on traps or not, but on what we can do at any time so that we get an advantage.",

I think, the opportunity to buy Bitcoin and hold is still there because the price is not too high yet which will allow those that missed the opportunity before to use this period to embrace it.",

Its like predictable movement this is the reason sometimes we shouldn't let ourselves to be in situation where we been hyped so much on the fast growth we see on the market.
