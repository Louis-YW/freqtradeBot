You registered on the forum on 9 December, wrote one post on that day, and you haven't written any more until today. I don't know if you expect merits to fall from the sky when it rains or something. Participate every day by writing constructively and little by little you will earn merits.",

Most times the post you think won't give you any merit end up with the  most merits, you know the forum is not a school that has a certain marking schemes that are used to access merit worthy post, it al depends on who is reading your post and how significant they find your post to be.",

Try to think about merits as a knowledge exchange: you give merit when you learn something new, you get merit when you teach something new, or you make other people think about something old in a new way. Once you progress in the knowledge you can start answering other users' question and solving their problems, or start contributing to  the forum providing new resources or tools, if you have the skills. Just try to figure out the best way to do so that suits your capabilities and resources.This is the best explanation of meritRead this as a guide for ranking up Ranking up is possible! 2900 Merits earned in less than 12 months!My 11 Hints!",

But before you start any discussion you should ensure that it will be beneficial to the forum community. Before responding to a post make sure you read the topic and other people's responses, if you have something different and helpful you can post it. You can also get information from other sources but ensure you reference them when you post them in the forum. Merits can be rewards for answering someone's question or adding to the person's knowledge. You can also get merits by joining competitions and doing a good job. Don't be desperate for merit, just be yourself, keep learning and enjoy the forum.",

You will set yourself up for great disappoint, depression and even ban.- Think quality posts and top reply always. Make great posts or answer the queries of other users that show that you are willing to contribute positively to the growth of the forum.- Read forum rules: They are a lot of them but it wouldn't hurt going over them in your spare time. You may ask questions where you are confused.- Participate in the forum fully. There was just the pie contest that ended a couple of weeks ago.- Lastly, develop a thick skin for the harsh comments you may receive.

I think the best way to earn it is be honest on your contribution and intention here. Also being a newbie means you need to study first everything you need to know here so that when you are engaging on some discussion you can ride with such technical discussion or response with confidence. Some merits could be gain and liked by others to those newbies who are showing persistence to learn.",

If I am right you should not post for merit that is not a good work if you want to hunt merit when you don't contribute in this forum. First try to learn and contribute through the forum and help members as much as you can. Then you may earn a lot of merits. So first learn by yourself about crypto, Bitcoin, this forum and help others. Also you can post about scams in crypto then you may earn merits. Best of luck for you.",
