If you aren't purchasing or selling things for Bitcoin that's even more true. Don't look at the price. I don't tend to look at the price often, and I've gone years without checking it myself. Usually, get the price from threads on here. However, recently I've just been enjoying the ride, and speculating (horribly) on what the price might turn out to be. Although, I have nothing really riding on those predictions as I have a relatively positive medium to long term outlook. As long as you understand why Bitcoin was created, and why it's considered revolutionary by some; you probably won't have to worry about it increasing in price in the future. Also, the fact that it's designed to be deflationary too.",

Not financial advice, this thought could be applied anywhere. I think your explanation is a common occurrence for investors and that in my opinion is a natural thing because basically the orientation of an investor will be happy because whatever profit the price increases, vice versa, they will feel upset or disappointed when the price decreases, the emotion will always be present within.But basically we have to be able to regulate our emotions towards rising and falling prices so that it doesn't become excessive panic and uncontrollable excitement.I think your view is more directed towards measured investors who are new to investing in bitcoin because those who are experienced in investing in bitcoin will not be overly exaggerated in any situation.",

But the bear market was so long that I kind of got used to it, and then nothing seemed impossible when Bitcoin finally recovered. So now I don't have strong emotions about the price, especially if we're talking about minor changes (below 15% within a week). I think the idea that helps me stay calm is 'this, too, shall pass' (whether it's good or bad, it's temporary, and that's the way of life). Another thing that helps is not having the amount in BTC that you can't afford to lose.",

There are some people who find it difficult to balance their emotions over certain things they do. for example, in the casino, some will play and win consecutively, but at a point if luck runs against them, they begin to have some mixed feelings, trying to bring their emotions into the game, which can trigger them to gamble off everything they win earlier on trying to recover their loss. @OP, I can attest to how happy someone I know was when Bitcoin hit $65k in 2021. The neighborhood heard his voice, but he was heartbroken during the downturn of the market in 2022.I often checks the market condition, but I don't get my mind worked off with 24h PNL, and that's because I am in to hold for a long term and I have other sources of income, so I am not too bothered.",

When you are a long term hodler of bitcoin and you have witnessed already its highs and lows, you wonâ€™t be thrilled anymore with price changes and monitoring the price often will never be your thing anymore. Instead, when the price drops rapidly and heavily, you may consider buying but the moment it goes up again, you wonâ€™t even care selling it, unless if it reaches its new ATH.",

This is something which takes time to get used to because even if you had experience in other markets bitcoin moves way faster than them, as an example lets suppose that you ride the most extreme roller coaster you can find, at first every single movement will put you on alert and produce all kind of emotions in you, however if you were to ride that roller coaster hundreds of times then eventually you will get less sensitive and only the biggest movements will have any effect on you, I see bitcoin in the same way, and the current positive movement is a great way to see how this is true, newbies are going crazy about the current positive movement of bitcoin, while experimented investors just look at it and while happy they do not think too much about it.",

Selling my Bitcoin and profiting from the sales would be a decision I have to take with my wife because she has been encouraging me to keep hodling regardless of the price. Within these few months her confidence in Bitcoin rose to a large margin. I am not emotional because Bitcoin have made me to be patient and disciplined.

Otherwise, when we put our emotions especially in bitcoin trading or investing, we tend to fall mostly on poor decision making and left us impatient seeing our portfolio is losing.
