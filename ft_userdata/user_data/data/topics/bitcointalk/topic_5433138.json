If they truly want to promote the use of crypto and add safety why doing so, they should make an effort by getting a hardware wallet which they can generate a QR code for the receiving address print and paste it around the shop, so that customers can just scan the address and make payment. their is no doubt that Binance Pay will be faster in receiving payment of its also too risky since they don't have the key to the wallet. \"Not Your Key Not your coin\"",

Another good move towards global crypto adoption. Hope much more companies start doing the same in the year 2023. This will be a great first step for crypto because previously ukraine has also tried to accept donations due to the war using bitcoin, so I think the ukraine government is starting to openly and understand if bitcoin and crypto have a bigger function than just investment, even though in the law has stated that so far Ukraine has not allowed transactions using crypto directly, but now after that the many benefits of crypto have been felt by Ukraine since the war occurred then I think Ukraine may soon follow in Salvador footsteps to adopt crypto or bitcoin globally in the country later.",

Then they can receive the products or pick them up at any of the chainâ€™s stores.It's also quite expected, I don't think a company in a war zone would be able alone to deal with direct crypto payments, so thinking of paying directly with bitcoin is probably daydreaming, but still, it's Binance, and I have a feeling they will again put their fake bitcoin and stable coins on top of the bitcoin payment option.Also, from the press release:QuoteAccording to Khomyakov, crypto payments via services like Binance Card do not conflict with Ukrainian laws because there is no ban on crypto-derived transactions in Ukraine. At the same time, local laws do not allow direct payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.This needs to change but probably Ukraine has 1 million more important things to do right now.",

The binance pay thingy in the whole story kind of takes the fun out of it, but i think people who already use Binance before now should go on and pay through this way if they want to use a crypto payment option, but they shouldn't forget that Binance is an exchange, and shouldn't be their self custody wallet. But for those who haven't already registered on Binance ever before, i wouldn't advise them to lose their privacy for this.Quote from: solehdavid on January 05, 2023, 03:42:56 PMI don't know the details but crypto is now a valid currency and not only pharmacies but all other institutions should have multiple payment options.Many crypto's do not have the utility or value to be a currency, they are mostly tools for Gambling. BTC is a valid currency though and the greater mass adoption gets, the more institutions would wanna have it as one of their payment option.",
