What am I doing wrong??ThanksI think you should try to provide some information to the program about what worker it should use. This information could include things like the worker's address, port number, and credentials.You should consult the documentation or user guide for the \"kaspa_miner\" program to learn how to specify a worker. The documentation should provide detailed instructions on how to configure the program and provide it with the necessary information to connect to a worker. Try to provide the program with a configuration file or command line arguments that specify the worker's information.",
