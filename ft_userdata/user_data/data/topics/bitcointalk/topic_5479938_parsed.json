The transaction fee is a concern, that is agreed in an age where congestion is normal. The reason being the devlopers wanted a challenge, ultimately they found a way to get the network spammed by Ordinals.The option you have now is to start learning about BTCLN. If you want to know more then search Google by typing Bitcoin lightning network as it is the only solution to these high transaction fees.",

I tried a few days ago to make a Bitcoin payment where transaction fees became $17 to make a $50 transaction. So how will we make Bitcoin payments and use it as a payment method? Most likely now, stable coins would be popular payment methods instead of Bitcoin due to the high fees. We always blame Ethereum for high transaction fees, but lately Bitcoin transaction fees surpass Ethereum transaction fees. I hope developers will find a solution for that. Still, LN isn't very popular worldwide.",

That thread is all well and good but there's no way we're going to concentrate all the discussion there. Every now and then topics like this will appear and nobody will be able to avoid it. Besides, as the thread gets longer, if you want to concentrate on what is happening at that moment, what you say on page 1 of a thread like this one has more visibility than on page 57 of that thread.Getting to the point:Quote from: The Cryptovator on December 31, 2023, 07:37:19 PMThe current network is congested because of BRC-20 tokens. This is the reason why Bitcoin is walking away from its real goal. I tried a few days ago to make a Bitcoin payment where transaction fees became $17 to make a $50 transaction. Probably with those percentages Bitcoin is the most expensive payment method in the world right now for those amounts. That's 34% of the fee you paid. I'm not going to make payments of those amounts as long as the fees continue to be that high.",

Like you said if the price continues this way Bitcoin might become a currency for only the rich. It might be used for only Investment, while altcoins will become more attractive for daily transactions.Quote from: BIT-BENDER on December 31, 2023, 08:16:51 PMMany people with their own opinion and thoughts about what's the reason for the high transaction fee but with the way this situation has lasted I wonder if there would be any solution in view.This problem has lasted longer than the past congestion I have ever experienced.

He might able to block BRC-20 tokens transactions, but there are many new tokens standard e.g. BRC 721, BRC 777 etc and it need to be improved from time to time. Luke Dashjr is also a miner, he can get benefit from that and if this censorship is agreed by other developers, we can expect more and more censorship because of majority votes benefit.I think it's not that the on chain need to be fixed, but sooner or later we will migrate to L2.",

It was quite annoying to see how the fees increased quite quickly and I had already made a transaction and was lazy enough to bump the transaction. This should be a concern for Bitcoin dev developers, because as the network becomes increasingly congested and there is no follow-up from developers to ban Ordinal, this will have an effect on users who want to make transactions but cannot because of unreasonable fees, and if it continues maybe it will hinder the adoption of bitcoin in the future.",

Then for hodlers this further strengthens them not to sell their bitcoins. It's better to just use another payment method, because no matter what, up to now there is no solution to overcome the transaction congestion that has occurred. There needs to be some new ideas that need to be offered to miners but we haven't seen them yet. Another large-scale impact may be its adoption to become a global payment method making bitcoin currently increasingly avoided.",

Regarding, banning brc20 tokens, I feel like it's running away from the problem (which is scalling issue) than solving it. I have said that before as well. We have seen congestion problems on Ethereum too due to use of certain dapps, did it ban those dapps? No. Solutions appeared in form of L2s. If Bitcoin devs bans the ordinals, I'd say it'll be pathetic, and it'll deserve to get dethroned from it's position as top cryptocurrency.
