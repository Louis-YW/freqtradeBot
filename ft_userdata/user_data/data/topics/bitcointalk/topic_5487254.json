  "content": "COPA - v - Craig Wright Litigation Case on Satoshi Nakamoto is illegal. Craig Wright fraudulently infringed Satoshi Nakamoto's  Bitcoin White Paper.   Also he is impersonating the inventor's Japanese pseudonym 'Satoshi Nakamoto'.  Satoshi Nakamoto has not file the litigation case against Craig Wright.  COPA  has filed this litigation case against Craig Wright is judicially illegal. COPA and non of their members are the author or co author of the Bitcoin White Paper. Therefore, COPA has no legal right to sue Craig Wright. Unless Craig Wright and COPA members mutually agreed to perform this litigation case for some secret motive. Craig Wright and his barrister Lord Grabiner KC could ask Justice Mellor to throw out the case because COPA has nothing to do with Bitcoin Inventor or the Bitcoin White Paper.  But the fact is neither Craig Wright nor his barrister Lord Grabiner  has thought about it.  In the mean time the report unfolded that :Lord Grabiner helped  Craig Wright's barrister Jonathan Hough in some extend providing with information and forged email. This is something interesting. What are the lazy blind reporters doing ?  They even could not find any clues of Satoshi Nakamoto even though everything's are public. If Craig Wright and his barrister Lord Grabiner now ask Justice Mellor to throw the case out on 12 March 2024 then Justice Mellor will be bound to throw the litigation case of COPA -v - Craig Wright. COPA must now find the true and real Satoshi Nakamoto the author of Bitcoin White Paper to win this case. Unless other wise even Justice Mellor make a judgement on the favour of COPA then this case will not be the end. Or even if Justice Mellor decided to give his verdict for the favour of Craig Wright by some unknown reason, then  there will be further more litigation case will filed the Court which all the barristers and judges wants. As Mr franky1  has mentioned that some one must file more criminal case against Craig Wright so he would go to prison.   Now, what are the matters going on and on over the last six years ?   Bitcoin Community and the news reporters need to stop reporting any story regarding Craig Wright and COPA. Where is James Bilal Khalid Caan ? He could play his role now as a Faketoshi ll  which the real Satoshi planned ahead for him to play a role in the Bitcoin Drama. Can some one ask him to appear in the Bitcoin drama please !",
