  "content": "So apparently Peter Thiel who's known among many bitcoiners for being an early investor as well as a venture capitalist contributing to several companies in the space, is now outed by one of his ex-partners as being an FBI informant. https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel-fbi-informant-charles-johnson-johnathan-buma-chs-genius-2023-10The story doesn't go in any detail about Thiel's involvement in crypto and if his relationship with the FBI might have had any effect in these matters, but him being a \"valuable informant for silicon valley\" should raise a few alarms. There are numerous widely used projects in which Thiel is a stakeholder. Him being an informant could imply a connection between his bolstered involvement with cryptocurrency. Anyone got more tea on this?",

I don’t like it, it’s dishonourable, it shows what type of man you are.It's such a weird story. The Business Insider reporters got to know from a partner of his that Thiel was INTRODUCED to the FBI, and then that same partner ratted him out. it's odd to know this series of events without context. What does a businessman have to gain from talking to FBI agents? Money? Connections? Leniency on getting caught? Who knows... Hopefully crypto wasn't affected by this because Thiel is a big stakeholder in many major projects.",

Look, I think that the type of man informants are in first place is the people who actually get into such a trouble that they have to become informants or else.But I think that there is so much shit in tax evasion / avoidance that is really difficult for companies to stay out of it so they are always in the hands of some dude that needs a forced informant.",

Like Trump, Thiel is a self-serving prick. Doesn't surprise me as trump according to himself \"knows the best people\" .I don't have any opinions about Thiel as a person, but i am certain he isn't the only one in the crypto space playing for FBI. This space is probably full of informants, as FBI seriously needs them to keep tabs.And not only FBI, there are for sure other organisations that can use cover ops, and probably literal spies as well because this is a perfectly build industry for corporate espionage. I would bet money that intelligence agencies have factions that are gathering cryptocurrency experts to covertly work for them. As intelligence agency, they have to stay ahead the game and know about state of the art tech.",
