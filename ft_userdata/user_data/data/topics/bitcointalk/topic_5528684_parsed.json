  "content": "Hey everyone,I’m looking for some recommendations on the best Bitcoin wallets and multi-chain wallets. I prefer open-source wallets, but I’m having trouble finding reliable ones, especially multi-chain ones.Some issues I’ve faced:I found wallets that support multiple chains, but they haven’t been updated in a while. The GitHub community is also not very active, which raises some doubts about the security or if anything has changed in the wallet.Open-source wallets are great, but I’m unsure if they’re still secure when they aren’t updated often.So, I’m wondering:What are some of the best open-source multi-chain wallets?How do you feel about wallets that aren’t updated regularly?Any risks with using open-source wallets with inactive development?",

I only use it for stable coins because I do not hold altcoins and I like the wallet. I have noticed that close source wallets are more good for altcoins except Metamask, unless you go for hardware wallet like Trezor which is also good for altcoins.",

You can recover your coins only in Blockstream green, you can't do it on other wallets.",

      "body": "Electrum is a great lightweight wallet for Bitcoin. It's also been forked for other Bitcoin chains (do be careful for fake electrum websites there are plenty around). For EVM chains, Metamask is my top preference, I personally think it's the leader among EVM wallets, and adding a network is as simple as adding the RPC information for that chain. Other wallets like Phantom are multichain and includes Bitcoin I believe though I do not think it's open source (it's become very popular though).",

      "body": "First of all I don’t advice the use of multi chain wallet for bitcoin, for me the best thing is to have a separate wallet only for bitcoin and my suggestion for bitcoin wallet is electrum and BlueWallet which both are open source wallet and do have regular updates. As for other chain, my suggestion is to go for unstoppable wallet or Metamask wallet, although the two wallets do no have all chains. This wallet suggestions are all hot wallets which are not advisable for long term and large amount storage. So for cold wallets I will advise you go for hardware wallet which are open source like passport and Trezor. Avoid wallets that do not have regular update for firmware and the rest even if they are open source",

      "body": "I'd recommend unstoppable wallet. It's non custodial, support multi chains and it's available to both android and IOS users. From your description of the kind of wallet you want, I think it ticks the boxes. Since launching, there have been numerous releases and the latest was Dec 25, 2024 (for android) and Oct 02, 2024 (for IOS), so it's being regularly updated. You can find information about this and more on the Github page: https://github.com/horizontalsystems",

I only use it for stable coins because I do not hold altcoins and I like the wallet.Yeah I think unstoppable wallet would be a good pick for a multi coin wallet basically sometimes I work with stable coins and most of the time and also make use of unstoppable wallet but just like you said I also notice they have a couple of syncing issues sometimes even with the Bitcoin network it sometimes takes some time depending on your network speed to sync with the blockchain.They are more closed source wallets for altcoins than you can find open source wallet. Nevertheless if it's just for bitcoin only I prefer and I also suggest ELECTRUM. I don't make use of metamask because it seems very vulnerable and many stories of phishing attacks I've seen are usually on metamask.",

      "body": "There are many many wallets that allow you to use Bitcoin. Best option for cold wallet Is Bitcoin core. Best strategy Is glacier protocolGenerally I would just suggest some generic rules. You must always verify what they are offering and how.Ready details and user experience.Dont be afraid to ask in doubt . Always double check what you are downloading.Its better you use more software since you can access to more functions. Avoid custodial wallet. Avoid codes not open source. GitHub not updated? For what i know It can be a \"neutral\" things. Just to understand why but in most of the case they dont need compulsory update of their repository.",

I use it from time to time. Many users consider it as a wallet for storing Monero (and it really works great for this purpose). Crypto enthusiasts who love Monero are by definition paranoid, seeking more anonymity and privacy. And this fact alone suggests that this is a pretty reliable cryptocurrency wallet. It has a very user-friendly interface and intuitive coin management. It also has a convenient exchanger built in. Another great wallet is Electrum. It is designed to store and manage Bitcoin, and it copes with this role very well. It is also an open source project that has been around for many years. Electrum wallet also exists in both mobile (Android, IOS) and desktop versions (it is very convenient). In fact, it has all the necessary features for managing Bitcoin.",
