Though there might be other countrymen wey join the Bitcoin Talk before them or within the time the above listed people joined but couldn't identify themselves as our country people.That being said, the ones you listed above I think deserves to be celebrated, respected and should be given special treatments in the forum because even though Oyibo people doesn't encourage such things in the forum, we as country people knows where we come from and why it is one of our known moral values to give honour to whom honour is due. These people paid so much sacrifices in the forum by working hard to make the forum a good platform for us all to come and learn about Bitcoin which is world's most prestigious crypto currency. Hopefully, more of our country people who are pioneers of this forum identifies with the Naija thread for us to know them.",

Though there might be other countrymen wey join the Bitcoin Talk before them or within the time the above listed people joined but couldn't identify themselves as our country people.Na true you talk, many Nigerians don dey this forum even before any body on the list joined the forum(except Leo of course), and maybe e get another Nigerian wey don dey here even before Leo, na that one i no con dey sure of.One i dey very sure of be say, there is this guys called Delemat, na through him i learn about this forum, that time, that was in 2015, he was an admin on the MMM group i belonged to, when MMM con flop, he con dey teach all of us about bitcoin, me enter google to find out wetin be Bitcoin, that was how i discovered this forum, i used the forum for several months without registering, on the 30th of july 2016, i decided to register after i discover one project wey i pick interest to invest in at the time, na that time i discover say that Delemat guy don dey for this forum since 2013.I don try search for that account but nothing dey come up, maybe Delemat was not the username exactly, but he later abandon that account, con create new account wey he call Dalecoin Dev, this na when he launch his own coin in 2017, e be like say the project no later succeed, so he kukuma abandon everything, both the project and the forum, i believe the nigga don make him money sha.This whole story na just to prove you right say indeed, some Nigerians don dey this forum before those wey Hatchy mention joined the forum.QuoteThat being said, the ones you listed above I think deserves to be celebrated, respected and should be given special treatments in the forumThe boss and the person wey deserve special treatment here na CryptopreneurBrainboss, na him be the Nelson Mandela wey Nigerians, and Africans at large on this forum get, this no be to undermine the efforts of other users, but Brainboss na im start the process wey make Nigeria get name for this forum today, other users came along and rendered their support, because the battle no be the type wey one person dey win, so two other users wey really try well well na igebotz and mpamaegbu, special tribute to them, and make we no forget Becky666(may the Lord rest his soul.)",
