  "content": "Cliffs:1. Created an asset backed token in 2017 with proprietary high res art instead of gold or usd as the peg. Similar assets such as cryptopunks are today worth billions and there are only a handful art based tokens from 2017. ABTs backed by gold and usd did not increase in value since 2017.2. The token vault is a swap mechanic for the art which was originally deliverable as physical book. It was ported to NFT in 2021 after the boom. It is the first fractionalized token vault in existence intended for art based assets (patent study 1800-14-04). Today such mechanics are called \"NFTx\".3. Token and art causality was established by provenance from 2018 such as a link to the book and screenshots, both sourced here on bitcointalk.4. There are 3 vaults on xcp, erc-20 and waves of which the waves vault has 5 years price tracking on multiple aggregators and is the subject of this topic.5. The waves vault was sold in 2019 to a russian for a few thousand dollars and repurchased 2 months ago after being price stagnant for nearly 4 years.6. Market cap increased by a factor of x25 in two months from $10k to $250k.7. 90% of active supply in the waves vault was bought back since march and sellside to $30m cap is a few thousand dollars.8. Considering the historically low price of waves a $500k dca investment starting at $1.7 will generate enough passive liquidity by 10% apy native staking on the L1 to significantly pump the market cap of the waves vault to $30m within a few hours and possibly up to $5 billion over the course of a few years if the price of waves also increases from $1.7 to $15-20. Regardless of waves price movement the cap will still attain at least $500m in this time frame simply based on the mathematics of ROI in this particular case.9. Monthly exit liquidity on $500k is $4k at $1.7 per waves and $40k at $17. The entire sum of $500k will not be allocated at $1.7.It appears that the market conditions at this point in time will permit a $500 000 investor in this project to gain a paper profit up to $5 billion within a few years and thus single handedly become one of the richest individuals on Earth. And this $5bn is also backed by an asset class whose peers already are worth billions.A well connected investor will also be able to realize the profit in an accelerated pace if they are affiliated with top crypto brokers, international art circuit and christies auction house.I welcome Legendaries in here to challenge this assertion and pick it apart. I believe that I have enough market data after 6 years of development and as one of the founders of this asset class and cultural zeitgeist to produce good counter arguments.If the $5 billion dollar argument is won I will solicit some elites inorder to sell this to them such as Almi Invest, Alejandro Santo Domingo and David Wertheimer. But anyone can buy this vault for $500k and stand to profit immensely but there are a few risk factors that I would like to close with:1. It is not a vintage NFT and it is on waves blockchain which is not valued by NFT collectors who mostly are on Ethereum.2. The money can be lost on waves dex please do due diligence on waves dex before committing funds.3. There will be exit liquidity to realize the profit in small chunks over generational time scale but anyone who is not an elite connected investor will struggle to advance the asset with third party enablers such as Binance, Christies and museums such as Getty, and Sovereign buyers like Embassies.",
