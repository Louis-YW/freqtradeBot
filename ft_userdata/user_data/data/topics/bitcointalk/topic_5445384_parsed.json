  "content": "Greetings all!I am stuck! I have a T17e that will just not work. It wouldn't accept firmware upgrade via the web interface or SD card. I learned how to SSH into it and whoa, there has been a massive file dump and 86% of the memory is full. I read up and found examples of this is the S9 type miners, where they were all able to get them running again using rm /core and clearing the core. The T17e doesn't have core. it has lost+found which is where all my space is being used. I tried rm /lost+found but apparently its a directory. when I list it, I find something called drwx------ which is where this massive file is, but i cant remove it. Advice would be much appreciated.Thanks",
