  "content": "So I was thinking.... A lot of people are hoarding their bitcoins and waiting for a spike in the price, so that they can sell for a huge profit. Let's say for argument sake that real inflation is 10% per year.... and you are not selling any coins. (I say \"real\" inflation ...because we know the inflation provided by governments are manipulated... and much lower than the actual inflation or living cost)Every year that you are not selling any bitcoins (as a commodity) ...the inflation that you have to beat with this investment... accumulates. Example : Year 1 = 10% / Year 2 = 20% / Year 3 = 30% .......and so on. You are also not gaining any interest on any of those coins... so they are dormant during the hoarding period. (When you eventually sell them, you have to divide the profit into the years that you hoarded it to see if you beat inflation) What strategy do you use to beat inflation with your Bitcoin investment? (I am saying investment... because a lot of people use Bitcoin as a commodity and not as a currency) How long are you willing to wait, before Bitcoin are not an inflation beating investment anymore?",

I also invest in some DeFi platforms that offer yield on my Bitcoin to help offset inflation. And the duration you're willing to wait will depend on personal risk tolerance, the market trends, and economic conditions. I'll just HODL until I reach my target price.",

      "body": "I think in the context of inflation Bitcoin at least beat Fiat and we should not compare it. Even though you have started this topic then I would love to add some factors which make BTC a deflationary one for the longer period of time. 1. Limited supply of Bitcoin makes it more scarce then any fiat. There is only 21 million BTC while if we talk about fiat the numbers are increasing day by day. 2.  Bitcoin is definitely a Deflationary coin because if we see at an average rate in every year price of BTC outperform Inflation. Means let's say you have $100 in your holding back from 1 January 2013. Will that $100 be having the same value as of today $100 but If you have invested that dollars in BTC then the value of your $100 will be 7.41BTC*current price. You do the calculation.3. Point being made in the point 2 is until the price of BTC is outperforming the inflation rate till then. And how long that be. Well till 2140 year BTC will outperform Inflation because that's the last year when there will be no mining as BTC will be mined totally and if the downfall will start then it might start from there.I am not a financial dude who knows or making the downfall assumption based on some facts but on the bases of mere knowledge I have.",

In theory, assuming ceteris paribus, if you peg Bitcoin to a fiat which has a higher inflation, you are going to have Bitcoin always appreciating against fiat; fiat becomes less valuable and Bitcoin becomes more valuable.However, that is contingent on the fact that Bitcoin is not currently overpriced. Based on recent and historical price fluctuation, Bitcoin is overpriced at most of the point in time. Hence, I'm not very much confident on Bitcoin always outperforming inflation or performing better than other investment vehicles for that matter.",

If I had a few stashes of Bitcoin, I would have booked some profit when Bitcoin last hit an ATH.If you look at bitcoin prices, there is no certainty that it will be at a price good enough for sale during does period, Although the market is always pumped or at bull whenever an halving period occurs. But due to some economic factors this price falls back down again. Imagine bitcoin at the a price of $69k in 2021 and then falling back to close $15k one year later (late 2022), now imagine if you had set you have set your taking profit time to that year, you will have taken a profit but not as high as you could have. So in my opinion it will be better to set taking profits target on price rather than year. For example put it that you will take half profit after the price might have done something like 3x your initial capital invested. This way you can at least take all or some of the profit and then accumulate more when the price comes down again.",

And if during the bull run,bitcoin didn't reach my target selling price,I will keep hodli till the next bull run. I believe with this method one will be able to beat inflation with his investment.

Taking out volatility, i.e. for example years when inflation is 5% and the price of bitcoin drops by 50%, if we look at the long term, as long as you hold your bitcoin for at least one cycle, you will be beating inflation. Whether you make profits by spending your bitcoin or exchanging it for fiat or not, it doesn't matter. If you still hold it without selling or spending it, you have an asset whose purchasing power has more than beaten inflation for the period you have held it.",

I do not know if this will continue, but there are bad years for bitcoin and there are good years. After halving, the first two years are years to make money from bitcoin, the following year is not good, while the last year to halving is good but not that good. During the third year after halving after bitcoin as fallen significantly, you can buy and hold it or start DCA.Another thing is that if you are not selling for a very long time, you can buy and hold. Even if the price fall, a year is coming that you will gain. In long term, bitcoin is a store of value. If you did not sell but see losses as unrealized, you will later be happy after bitcoin got to the price you bought it and increase above the price.",

That's the time I sell some of my Bitcoin which I find helpful cause not only that it could help you for your everyday needs but also for your future as well.

That's one of its main selling points after all, to remain valuable and a great store of value as the whole economic world plunges into chaos thanks to inflation and devaluation of assets. Don't get me wrong, bitcoin can still be beaten by devaluation, which will only happen if the whole cryptocurrency world swipes all their assets off the industry and into another. But not only is that a massive if. So yeah. bitcoin should be good for a while, it will continue to remain more valuable than your favorite fiat as it succumbs to depreciation brought about by inflation, only way it could be on par with bitcoin is if it adapts the same deflationary nature that bitcoin boasts of, which is not good for commercial assets like greenbacks.",

The reason is that while inflation increases with time when it comes to fiat currency because of money printing , Bitcoin's inflation rate is cut in half every four years, that is supply rate is reduced plus and minus volatility rate (bear /bull market) between those years.",

So it's clearly serving that role as long as price keeps increasing.  What people need to know is the right time to invest or buy to reap the maximum benefit. And the right time to buy, to be sure of a bountiful harvest in the future is when the price is low or when it looks like Bitcoin is underpriced/undervalued or cheap.. . basically when you notice massive dip in price, it's safer to buy there than when price is high.So, if you wish to beat the inflation, by let say, selling your $100,000 for Bitcoin, the best practice is to split the money into multiple pieces... maybe into four pieces, which will be 25,000 each. Use each piece (25,000) to buy the major dip in price rather than putting everything into Bitcoin at once... worst still is buying at high price with the 100,000... It's like planting at the end of raining season rather than at the end of dry season which is the beginning of raining season.",
