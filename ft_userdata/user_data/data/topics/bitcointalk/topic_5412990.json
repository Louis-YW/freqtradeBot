  "content": "Hi guys. Here I leave this link that you might be interested in if you’re a BTC long term HODLER and want to be on the smart side of the market to accumulate when it is more convenient: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrA3mm7bLxM. In this analysis they explain how HODLERS have been accumulating since the downturn market started in May 2021.  I have nothing to do with this company who publish these analyses and I do not have an account with them. I do not gamble or trade either. So, just for anyone who wants to access to relevant information in on chain trends, I think is worth the time.Remember, there’s no such a thing as “energy crisis” that will affect BTC mining. So BTC is saved and sound for many years ahead. Now, this Glassnode channel could help many to understand price volatility and oscillations. I have already demonstrated in other posts (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5412322.0) this is just an invented and convenient “crisis” made up to justify the sinking of the EUR, and the profits US is seeking by trying out a full war in Europe. Remember, my center argument is that the US was bankrupt at the end of the XIX century, and it accumulated 75 of the world capital at the end of WWII. So basically, the US made a fortune in barely 50-60 years in two wars that totally destroyed Europe. I do not think they did on purpose then, but I think they are now. Do no not forget Paul Krugman’s “joke” we need a war such as an “alien invasion” to come out from the 2008 real state mess. Well, the joke was only the “alien invasion”. Substitute “alien” by Russian, and there you’ve got it. Remember also that Nakamoto’s main aim and motivation to create BTC was to finish the fiat currency monetary system, and the Keynesian support to this total fraud, which Krugman’s is one of its main advocates. Once again, check this Chicago University professor John Mearsheimer lesson on how the West has provoked the conflict that has led us to this made up “energy crisis”:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4&t=2s. Oh, yes, how I could forget? He is a Russian agent, as me, Ron Paul, Tulsi Gabbard, and so on. What else could we be?",

      "body": "@JaimeAlejandroOnce again you are misleading readers! Your topic isn't about \"BTC on chain analysis\" at all! When reading your topic, people will find out quickly: it isn't about Bitcoin's on chain data because no on chain data ist presented! You are just adding an interesting headline but your whole text is just about downplaying Putin's war crimes! You are using your headline to present Russian lies.  Here's a beginners guide how people like your are used by Moscow as puppets to spread Russian propaganda: Luckily, Russian lies can be exposed easily because Putin's fascism is happening publicly. Putin is a dictator and he's trying to conquer Ukraine. But Ukraine doesn't want to be a Russian puppet state. Look like Putins occupation of Ukraine is failing: https://imgur.com/gallery/2Ay8NwuRussian occupiers are already fleeing: https://twitter.com/Euan_MacDonald/status/1568284610714570757?cxt=HHwWisDUheui1cMrAAAA         Because fascism will always be defeated. This time, it's Putin's Russian fascism (Rashism) which will be defeated. But you are defending Russian fascism! Your topic needs to be removed into Off-Topic or Politics and society because it is not related to Bitcoin at all. You are just using your unrelated headline to present your Russian lies in Bitcoin discussion. You have tricked me into giving you a Merit by your fraudulent strategy. But you will not trick me twice and I will keep exposing your lies! Your rashist mission will fail like Putin's war against Ukraine will fail. John Smearsheimer is a liar and his predictions are always wrong! Putin will be punished for his war crimes, while he occupied Ukraine and commited mass murder against Ukrainian civilians. Putin will be taken to Den Hague! Like Putin for his war crimes, you will look really bad, when you defended Putins war crimes! Stop abusing Bitcoin for your pro Russian fascism lies! And take your meds, vatnik!",
