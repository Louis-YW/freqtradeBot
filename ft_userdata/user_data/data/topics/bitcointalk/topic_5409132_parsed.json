I think it's the opposite, as you're aiming to beat inflation and you understand that the world is experiencing toughness economically with left and right increases in inflation. That only means that you're determined and inspired to do any hustle that you have and keep that grit.You work for someone during your daytime and do your business during your free time. But this is all about time management.Quote from: Queentoshi on August 08, 2022, 01:31:57 PMFrom evaluation around me, self proclaimed entrepreneurs are quitting entrepreneurship because of difficulty in maintaining a business and reduced sales due to reduced purchasing power from people, an effect of the economic situation.

Add it up that you can cut most of your expenses and stop buying things that you really don't need.",

About the hardships in finding buyers, social media is an open space where most people are hanging around buying everything 24/7. That the target for marketing the products. There will always be a way when it comes to business but being an employee for a company, there is no other way and going up in ranks is a difficult tasks especially when there's a lot of people aiming the same spot.",

I also do a good amount of customer connect during the weekends where I get their feedback to make my product even better.I agree that not all kind of business can be done alongside a day job.

Investing into cryptocurrencies may provide an extra layer of security as this may guarantee profit depending on its price on the market.Your analysis makes sense, according to all the experts in the field of business. Rather, the best strategy is the one that can reconcile the two.There is a basic principle in investment called \"diversification of income sources\" and the balance between working in a stable job and launching a private project is a good guarantee for a stable financial life. At an advanced stage, when the office job becomes idle in terms of time, it can be abandoned.I am currently working in a half-time office job and managing two small projects, one of them is a farmer and the other is on the Internet. This is in addition to my work in signature campaigns here on the forum, which provides me with a good weekly income, with which I can at least pay my bills .",

This buffers the point that diversification of income sources is the way to go and no man survives with just one stream of income. In the bible also, you see the great men being warriors , herders and farmers.In our present day life, the challenges are of various degree but if the government plays a good role to provide support to SMEs it definitely goes above employed jobs, despite the hard or difficult time being self employed is more profitable if you get into the right kind of business that is set up close to the customers in need or the need of the society.",

What do you think is the way forward?For most of us, especially in my country, one cannot survive with just one source of income. Working an office job is a secure source of income. Like the money will regularly enter your account. Unlike running a business, the money is not always there since most businesses have their slow days and their peak days. Unfortunately, most of the time, income from a job is not enough. For me, to move forward, keep a regular job if you already have one. And in your free time, use it to run or establish your business. I still strongly believe that to be able to achieve financial freedom, you need to have your own business.Â  Do this until your business can sustain all your financial needs. Then when that time comes, you can quit your regular 8-5 job. It will be exhausting and most of the time it will drain you but if you do not do this, you will be stacked in whatever you are in right now. If you want to move forward, you have to sacrifice something. And for young people, it is their strength, body, and time they can give to be successful.",

There's nothing wrong with me planning to set aside some of my salary for working capital gradually.Or apply for a loan as needed for your capital because you have a job that will be able to pay for it, but make sure the business is good and profitable.back to my job and business, besides my job, I have a food stall or basic necessities from work savings. Since I have a regular job I will not be doing my own business, there is still a wife or other family member who can help or run the business and get paid.so in my opinion both will be better and having a job is important because from work we can or are able to do anything including business, if not where will you get the capital from.",

The average worker could need to work days off and multiple jobs to retain their standard of living.There are rumors a high percentage of consumers are using credit cards to make purchases and even out inflation. This is a temporary solution at best.A good portion of focus in entrepreneurship or being an employee is opportunity. The biggest opportunities at the moment are lack of manufacturing and productivity. Hopefully whatever gaps and shortages appear can eventually be addressed through modern means. Whether its high fossil fuel prices or food shortages.A cultural shift towards relying less on corporations and the state is also greatly needed. People need to develop better relationships, organization and communication with community and family. See eye to eye with those in the same circumstances. And learn to cooperate.

As much as possible, you should find alternatives of other ways to earn money if your earnings aren't enough. You could do an office job while handling a small business at the same time. Proper time management will work for you. However, if there will be conflicts, choose one thing that you can't let go. Consider the salary and earnings that you could earn as well as the job environment that you prefer.",

All of this begs the question: Who exactly are \"they\"?Â  Are we talking about those presumptuous morons on Youtube who play-act as gurus, telling people all about how rich they got by being an entrepreneur (and in the meantime make more money through Youtube's ad revenue than they probably made through whatever business they may or may not have had previously)?Regardless, the fact is that not everyone can be an entrepreneur--and I'm defining that term to mean starting up your own business.Â  The reality is that most people need to be working those 9-5 jobs under someone else's management, else all of those public and private companies out there wouldn't be able to function--and that would be a nightmare.Take some consolation from me if you're a worker bee, though.Â  It's still possible to become wealthy if you invest wisely and earn a decent wage.Â  I even clipped an article from a few years back about a gas station worker who lived to be 90-something, and when he died it was discovered that he was worth millions and owned tons of stock that he'd bought consistently throughout the years.Â  So you don't need to strike out on your own and work 18 hours a day, putting all of your blood, sweat, and tears into a new business plan that probably won't succeed in order to become rich (if that's your goal).Â  That's a myth.",

Many entrepreneurs start young and have the ability to withstand multiple failures as they learn what works for them, but it really helps to have a supportive environment growing up. It can be much easier to start if you have family who might give you a little bit of seed money, you have free time and you have the resources (even just access to internet) that many people take for granted in more developed countries. Some youngsters in different countries are already doing different types of work by the age of 10 or even earlier, to help the family survive.",
