Because at this point you haven't given us enough information to discuss the with, e.g the name of the casino to see if any other members of the forum is playing on the casino.

If I get you correctly,  an online casino is asking you to set up an account with a bank to make deposits into the casino. If I may ask, why are you reluctant in using bitcoin for deposit when you have bitcoin as a deposit option and why should you even be reluctant to use Bitcoin and option ing to use bank wired transfer through a bank.",

Metrobank? isn't it a regular retail bank operating in United Kingdom? and online casino ask you to open account there to be able to gamble? I guess you need full KYC to open account there? It looks super suspicious. Avoid it. There are a lot of good online casinos that does not require that. Grab a list and research them- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5341966.160",

If you have concerns relating to gambling, casinos, and games, you should take them to the gambling board, or better yet, drop your questions on the beginners and help board.Every casino has their logic, but specifically telling you to create an account on Metrobank looks suspicious. Look at the casinos on the link provided by @Tytanowy Janusz.",

I found some top companies based on google index with similar names.https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.metrobankonline.co.ukhttps://www.reviews.io/company-review/store/metrobankonline/14909767/?media=store_review_image_id-462354But unfortunately as you can see, both of them have too many negative reviews (which I'm sure are honest from users) to be trusted. I wouldn't recommend them, and definitely bitcoin is my preference for gambling",
