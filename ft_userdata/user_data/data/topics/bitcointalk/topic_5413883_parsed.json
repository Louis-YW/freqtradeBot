  "content": "I’m playing casino hold em poker lately on evolution gaming and this game is multiplayer playing on same hand. I just notice that even the player card is lose there’s still some players winning on the winner board screen at the end of the game even though there’s no bonus or whatsoever way for a players to win that time.I notice this too on other games with same mechanics that have one hands to all players like infinity blackjack. Here’s my question how did this event happened? Is the game is mirror which some players is betting on the dealers hand?",

      "body": "No. All players is playing using same hand so there’s no way a player will play different hand. Do you consider the bonus on each game. There’s a chance that those players win the bonus game even though the result of the match is lose because bonus game result is separated to the result of the game. It’s either a display issue or indeed the bonus game won by other players. You can ask this directly on evo live support located directly on the chat of the game.

      "body": "^ That make sense I didn’t consider the bonus games as part of the list of winners because I don’t have that kind of option on the casino that I’m using. I guess this winners came from different casino that offer bonus bet  on all the games. I rarely place bonus bets too.Locking now the thread.",
