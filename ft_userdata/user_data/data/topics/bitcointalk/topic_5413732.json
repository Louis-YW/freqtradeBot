  "content": "Update Edit: Sold!Selling my completed ASICMiner Block Erupter Sapphire USB collection set on Scarce City:https://scarce.city/auctions/asicminer-block-erupter-usb-complete-collectionAuction goes live on Tuesday, September 20th, 2022 and is active for 48 hours.No reserve.Image: https://imgur.com/HQDmcenTo the best of my knowledge, this is the only existing complete collection of ASICMiner Sapphire Block Erupter USBs that has ever been shared online. This collection includes all 4 unique colors from the first Sapphire batch release (https://web.archive.org/web/20140416100930/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=212085), and all 7 unique colors from the second Sapphire batch release (https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152605/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=280961) for a total of 11 unique Block Erupters. I’m also including another black (batch 1) that is used to display the rear PCB board and hardware components as a compliment the info graphic advertisement in the shadow box frame.Every USB Block Erupter has been tested using cgminer. They are all fully functional and each mine at ~330 MH/s.Both of the 49 Port ASICMiner Block Erupter USB Hubs have also been tested using an APX PSU with a 24 pin power connector and high Amp (30Amp required) 5V output. The Block Erupter hubs use a 5V rail to power all of the USB ports.This completed set includes: - 12 x ASICMiner Block Erupter USBs (11 unique variants/colors, and 1 extra black (batch 1) Block Erupter)- 2 x 49 Port ASICMiner Block Erupter USB Hubs (First and second releases).- 1 x 18\"x24\" shadow box frame- 3 x print outs. First and second batch release print outs of the USB Block Erupter on the Bitcointalk forum, and 1 print out of an infographic by (defunct) bitcoinexaminer.org showing the Block Erupter components and re-sale price of 1.05 BTC.The History:On May 4th, 2013, a user named friedcat from ASICMiner released the first ever bitcoin mining ASIC USB device on the bitcointalk forums, the Block Erupter USB.The Block Erupter USB wasn’t the first ASIC miner released, but it was the first ever to use the USB form factor, and used the first ever ASIC chip ever manufactured. The release of the Block Erupter USB comes only a few months after Avalon released the first ever bitcoin ASIC miner to the public in January 2013, and it comes 7 months before Bitmain unveiled it’s first ASIC Miner; the Antminer S1.These Block Erupter USB devices have a hash rate of 333 MH/s (0.000333 TH/s) and were available for purchase at a price of 1.99 BTC per USB miner upon release. Market value for 1.99 BTC was around $200-$225 USD at the time. These are massively inadequate in terms of mining power by today's metrics. Today, the Block Erupter USBs are technically the least powerful bitcoin ASIC mining devices in the world, since they were the first ever ASIC chips ever created (130nm BE100).",

There shouldn't be any issue shipping to most places. Total weight of everything with the frame is 10lbs. Buyer pay for shipping.I also collected the antminer \"u\" series as well. I've got a few u1, u2, and u3 miners that haven't been used in many years. Unfortunately my u2 miners burnt out after an overclocking experiment gone wrong shortly after I got them in 2015. All 5 of my u2's are toast but I couldn't bring myself to just throw them away.",

The silver one with the orange logo and orange one with white logo (both first batch without regulatory markings) were by far the hardest ones to find.",

Would buy them here for around $10 to $15 a piece and then sell yhem on amazon for $50+ ea. Literally flipped thousands of them.  I also bought them when they originally came out, but got all of the colors through the flipping technique.",

I do remember people managing to get them for pretty cheap on here a few years ago. Don't see them for sale hardly ever on here now.Then again you probably paid for them in bitcoin if you got them here, which might be regrettable now from the store of value perspective.Ebay's selling them for ~$100 per block erupter these days.",

I think I’ve got a couple of these laying around next to my Butterfly Labs FPGA miners somewhere. For $100 each I could probably find the time to locate them. I’m a bit surprised to hear they’re worth anything, but they aren’t a bad collector’s item I guess. OP has them displayed very nicely.",

I've sold some on ebay for more than that last year. They are probably the most interesting miners available right now. Nice form factor, cool logo, colorful, and practically cheaper than anything else you can find. They won't mine you a single satoshi now days though.People buy them to learn, to tinker with, and to keep as a soulvenir, or to try and \"solo\" mine with them... except they are more likely to get struck by lightning 100 times in a row than ever managing to solo mine a block with one of these.",
