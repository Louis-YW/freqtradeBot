I'm losing my home today and considering my car was towed a month ago I'm definitely about to be on my own literally. I don't have many family members never have my whole life so I cannot turn to them . I'm asking if anyone can lend me 20-30 dollars to get me an Uber after I get evicted .

I do not mean to be insensitive, but if you are on a budget and cannot afford Uber, why not take public transportation? Or walk, like Timelord2067 suggested. It is good for your health.Quote from: RobertGudsin on December 11, 2022, 03:13:10 PMI can surely pay it back within 2-3 days I'll give you all my info as in my driver's license my address all of it to assure you I'm legit . Surely? I am not so sure. Your credit score is pretty bad. Considering that you will be evicted, that your car is impounded, and all that...Quote from: RobertGudsin on December 11, 2022, 03:13:10 PMI'll give you all my info as in my driver's license my address all of it to assure you I'm legit . What good is that?",
