I am not surprised. I am going to tag the account for this open scam accusation. If they take longer to reply or resolve the case, it will add a trust flag on their profile.",

I also asked their support if the URL is registered to their database as one of the registered url under that company.So, how often you message/follow up them regarding this matter? Have you PM their representative on this forum? It seems you posted on their ann but without response from their team. So i suggest to pm them.",

Although I've seen you posted there a few days ago but this casino is like a random one and you barely get some help from them. The rep seem to reply a couple of post on that announcement thread that they have but then, if they keep asking for a new version of verification and there's a continuous delay of withdrawal. I'm sorry to say but you can feel what you don't want to hear from us. But anyway, still wishing you luck that this case will be resolved by them.",

So, what made you decide to play there! as far as i can see they are not offering any special bonuses or promotions which may make someone prefer playing there instead of playing on one of the well known and reputable casinos!",

If I may guess, ETEC is in partnership with them as their financial solution.The registered address doesn't match with the one they list on their website, but the mailing address certainly does, so does the company logo, so I am quite sure we're talking about the same ETEC.As for NWI themselves, they're also legally registered in Philipphines,So that's all about ETEC and NWI's legal situation.Nonetheless, for the time being, I don't think there's much we can do other than wait, given you tried [unsuccessfully] to get in touch with PAGCOR to solve this.  I'll try to invite them here, let's see if we can get this sorted out.",

Though I am still confused how they're not under Pagcor while Pagcor still list them on their list of offshore license. With several consideration, I think it'll be best if I left a feedback regarding this, to warn the community who have an interest on their platform, at least until they gave their explanation.I am borrowing your post for my reference.",
