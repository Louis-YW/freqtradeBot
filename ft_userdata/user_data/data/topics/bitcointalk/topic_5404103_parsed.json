  "content": "Let's talk a little about a real incident that I did with bitcoin in the last 1 month and just processed the payment in the last 7 days. I have an investment of more than 1 bitcoin which is equivalent to $28,500 (estimate) at the time I processed the payment. I bought a plot of land measuring 850M2 with a total price of 0.6+ bitcoin or equivalent to IDR 200,000,000 at that time. This didn't happen by chance because I know that the landowner is one of those people who are also bitcoin users. Although bitcoin is not legal tender in my country but I did it without anyone knowing and it is a transaction involving only seller and buyer and so far I have processed this land certificate safely.I tried to remain undetected making these payments because I knew I would be punished by the government if I announced them. The seller received my bitcoin payment directly to the exchange (from exchange to exchange) and I both signed the receipt that I had prepared as proof of payment written on stamp duty.This is a real event, I told the seller that he has to convert his bitcoin directly to stablecoin if he doesn't want the money I paid in bitcoins for his land payments to fluctuate. So even though I know bitcoin shouldn't be used as a means of payment in countries that haven't legalized it yet, but it's always a useful option if a buyer and seller reach an agreement.This is my short story with, so have you ever used bitcoin as a means of payment for the purchase of physical assets like land or anything else?This story is also the first thread that I created in this forum. It will definitely feel special to me.",

Or it is just an implicit ban?If it is an implicit ban, like if it is the central bank in your country that ban it or not totally banned, it can still be a good option for paying for land or goods. But if it is a total banned, I will advice you not to use bitcoin for such option. Convert the bitcoin to fiat and buy with fiat which your government supports. Know that bitcoin do not have to be a legal tender before you can use it for payment, as long as it is accepted in a country, it can be used. But also a country can have different rules on how to spend bitcoin in a way the government approves.Exchange can be hacked, exchange can seize your coins, freeze your account etc. To have full control over your coin, use a noncustododial wallet. For large amount of money, use hardware wallet or any other cold storage wallet.",

      "body": "Quote from: Pmalek on June 26, 2022, 08:16:51 AMConverting Bitcoin to a stablecoin always works out great. Just look at Terra UST and how happy their investors are.Stable coins have actually misled many people, especially, those algorithmic stable coins that are called  stable coins but they are actually not stable coins because many if them in the past have caused significant loss to investors as the coin thought to be pegged with fiat reduce in price. The last example with such significant loss is UST.Not only that, also that many of them are centralized, to the extent some can even be freezed on noncustododial wallet. Then why people going for this option when not having full control just like while using fiat. Fiat is far better to be used for holding than stable coins if not holding for long, because if holding for long, fiat will depreciate in price while bitcoin will appreciate.

So you shouldn't tell anyone how you use bitcoin as a means of payment in a country that prohibits it as a currency. Especially Indonesia, I emphasize that your actions are violations and you have violated them. So don't do it if you know it's banned because you end up risking a penalty.There is only one way that is highly recommended if you have bitcoin and want to pay for something in Indonesia, you have to convert it to fiat and make payments safely without dealing with the law. This is the best advice from me, so never deal with the government especially if it is related to money. They can freeze your account and confiscate your assets.",

For example, if the transaction amount is less than 3 million rubles or $ 56,000, then to register a real estate or land sale transaction, the inspector only asks the buyer about receiving money. The contract says that payment is in cash, but payment in practice can be in bitcoins and gold and euros and dollars.If the market price of land or real estate is more than $ 56,000, then a hired expert can conclude that the price of real estate is less than $ 56,000.",

The surveyor and lawyer would do all the necessary government registration.
