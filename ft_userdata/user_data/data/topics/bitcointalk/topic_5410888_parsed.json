Even a lot of retailers have sold solana,  the price wouldnt plummeted easily,  since of the bigger holders just chilling and let their shares double and increase with thr dumped. If talking about product or network,  I assume you see solana gad multiple break down or crash network reason to halt it for long time which isnt good if I am an investors.  Showing how centralized it is and can be control by someone.",

No reason for this blockchain to be the next ethereum and you shall stop with this kind of gimmick. A blockchain will not kill another blockchain. You must know that if what you have been talking above was not even true. Solana has become alternative blockchain for ethereum and this is the fact that happened in the market. There's no need to call ethereum killer anymore.",

Solana still has a lot of things that need to prove its potentiality, not unlike ETH which has been so long in the market and people know how useful it was. But because of the market competition and fees, many projects are able to pop up and even compete with ETH. However, it was a design that ETH is hard to beat by any altcoins - it was still dominating altcoins.",
