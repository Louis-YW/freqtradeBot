I can tell you didn’t give this critical thought before posting, we really need to work on our topics here. The reason I think the trade by barter system won’t work is because times have changed, not necessarily for the better but we have a different society now. You’re referring to a time where every household had farmlands they cultivate, barns and silos in their compound, animal farms and so on. This generation cannot even plant a orange tree how do you propose they trade goods for goods? Would it be iPhone for a bag of rice?",

Are we progressively regressing? These challenges are just because of improper planning on the side of the government which we all know would be resolved soon.

The transfer system is working perfectly providing you have you preferred banking internet banking details or you have your mobile banking app. The trade by barter you propose is one of the most redeculous suggestion I have ever seen since the beginning of this new note wahala.It's kind of stressful for some of us to survive in this situation but trading a particular goods for the next is not an option at all.",

We have advanced more than that level,it is time we accept the cashless policy system and think of how we can live with it. I do my transfers with online apps or pay a little more to withdraw from POS. As for me cash is still accessible if you need it. Most super market accepts transfer.",

One tin I know in dis cashless system dat is affecting all the 36 state in Nigeria, it will not last longer be4 ur government will do something that will make money circulation to all banks in Nigeria 4 the citizens to have access to their money anytime.",

It has been existing since before you were even born. In BY still, dat kind of trade dey exist till now. There is a market only for dat in BY so if u sae na ur idea den u v made a biggest mistake bi dat. Nd also 4 di cash scarcity, dis week di thing dey go strong pass bcoz na di targeted week bi dis. Going back 2 di old culture is not easy and it will not be possible. World Bank will not even allow dat to happen again. If dat happens then world Bank business e don spoil bi dat. U no know sae na di Currency exchange with goods dey give world Bank money. After di election everything go come back to normalcy. And business will come back to full Operation but the inflow of cash e no go dey like before again because dey wan to implement the cashless policy gradually now.",
