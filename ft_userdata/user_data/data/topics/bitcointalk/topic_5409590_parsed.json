Risking it on altcoins is not really worth it because most of them are just trash, you know, better at first few weeks moths, but after getting too much money on investors, they'll just leave the coin that'll make its price go down on the bottom, leaving investors crying.",

Of course if you exclude shitcoins or those useless token that appears out of thin air, choosing which crypto to invest in depends on what project you believe in, but mostly, people chose bitcoin as it is the safest option out there especially for newbies.For me as an example, majority of my portfolio is heavily invested in bitcoin because of how briliant the technology it offers, it is also a multifaceted tool that will serve as your gateway down the rabbit hole when it comes to programming, security, privacy and economics(finance). Moreover, less than 10% of my portfolio is in ETH and XMR as I think that ETH could offer a lot of opportunies in Defi/GameFi while Monero is for privacy related stuff.Besides preferences, one important matter is your financial capabilities and your risk tolerance.",

But the question now is how does one get to know the right crypto project to invest in?Actually its hard to find a good project where we can trust since most of the project didn't deliver much on what they promise on their target dates also sometimes we always fall for expectation since their product sucks. So if I where you better invest only on top coins if you aim to hold them up for long term, but if you are a risk taker then go on altcoins which is hype by many community members and exit when your portfolio is already in green line.",

But the question now is how does one get to know the right crypto project to invest in?Maybe bitcoin is the right choice to invest in. Although the price of bitcoin is now wilder than a few years before, you can use bitcoin as a short, medium, and long-term investment. But if you want to choose to invest in altcoins other than bitcoin, it will not be easy because many altcoins will tempt you to buy and serve as investments. Maybe you can do some research on the coins that are on the list of the top 25 coins so you don't have too many choices to invest and you won't be too confused about managing them. ETH and BNB are coins that you can invest in because these two coins have great potential to increase in height but do your research first and don't rush to make a decision.",

You are somehow not wasting your time at all. It is not necessary anymore to dig deeper and look for potential coins among the number of new projects, you will get tired of looking at them but never find any ( or you may have but it was not sustaining).You'd rather choose those projects that already have credibility, and you will make a profit right away.",

I know it's good to invest in some good new projects but many of them are unlikely to follow what they're telling on their white papers or road maps.With the older ones, they've got proven track records and you only need to continue what you've started with them because they already have the market and reputation.",

Some coins are just being hyped so it's really important to do your own research and don't just go with the flow. I also check if a coin has a good reputation so I'll have an idea if they are worth my trust. I mostly choose top coins which have been through different market situations so I'll know if they have strong resistance against the bearish season.",

One of the best way to know the type of Crypto to invest in, is to check it's community and how they operate in the space. There are so many coins in the space, some only trapped investors to losing their money, while others are best for long term investment, it's optional for Investors to go for the long term tokens, rather they should go for Crypto Gems that pumps massively and also dumps.",

Of course not, but Luna ended up going to zero, which means that someone who had bitcoin and someone who had luna, both different people, they both lost, but one lost way more than the other.
