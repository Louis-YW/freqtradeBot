Never had a problem and it's not about anonymity for me but more like the ease of transaction, speed, and the cheap fees that are glued into it. Whatever sportsbook you are referring I have not tried it yet. Is it a decentralized gambling site?I think I am in good hands with Stake.com and I don't need to risk my money on something else that I have not touched yet. If ever an issue will happen then I got a Sportsbet.io account which is next to my options for sports betting. Another reputable site with good features, promotions, and fair odds.",

Share your experience in the comments!Not only that, but you can bet on games and events using micro bitcoin. It makes sense when you deposit 0.001 BTC and see something like mbtc, the value gives you the feeling that you are betting large sums and having more fun than the standard $$ value in betting. However, I have a problem with Bitcoin when it comes to deposits and withdrawals, as well as network congestion. When the mempool becomes full, waiting for transactions to be confirmed, you have to double the amount of your fees to get your Bitcoin into any sportsbook, and if you are not careful, you will end up spending the money that could be used to wager on 1 or 2 games with a reasonable multiplier.As much as I dislike altcoins, I use them sometimes as an alternative to fund my sportsbook and casino. The advantage is that I can convert my balance to Bitcoin, but a non-negligible fee will be deducted from the balance. This is convenient because you don't have to wait for minutes or hours for your Bitcoin to arrive, and you also don't have to worry about the huge withdrawal fees that sportsbooks charge.",

Most of casinos are using provider to add the sports bookie and you can't gamble using mBTC because the minimum stake is $1, not 1 Satoshi. AFAIK only Freebitco.in let you place bet with just 1 Satoshi in their sports betting, in Web 3.0 casino you can also gamble by placing bet in coin/token equivalent, but it's not Bitcoin.Most of casinos are charge additional fees when you want to withdraw your coins, it's not only because of mempool are full.",

I have done that last time in 2019 I think on some betting sites that mainly used bitcoin for the bets, but to be honest I lost most of the bets because gambling is not for everyone. However, I can vouch for the ease of use that the platforms offered with integration of Bitcoin as a betting coin on their platforms and the experience was extraordinary.",
