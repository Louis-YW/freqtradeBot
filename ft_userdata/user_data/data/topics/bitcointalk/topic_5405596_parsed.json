  "content": "Recently, there have been series of data and financial hack by hackers from exchanges and kyc verification firms entrusted with customers data, information and funds. The most recent is that of the 1billion Chinese data hack and hacker demanding for 10 btc as ransome. I strongly believe that information and data of citizens are to be treated with utmost care because it's a private affairs so must be accorded due respect but when the third party entrusted with such information can't show any credibility and reliable feature in playing their role what happens?It is unfortunate that data information of clients can't be protected with utmost care as a result of breached security measures. Now I ask though it sounds funny but to be realistic, this is the reality. Who is to be blamed for funds hacks, data leak/hack? Is it the government, security agencies or the kyc firms or the sole organization that demands all customers must under a kyc verification process. Your genuine opinions are all welcomed.https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/07/06/china-hack-police/",

There are no clients here. They are citizens. People are forced to give their data to Chinese government, who cannot even provide the minimum security to handle that data.Chinese state is a Surveillance state. Data from about 1 billion citizens was leaked.https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/07/china-leak-police-database/QuoteNews of the alleged breach has gone largely unreported in mainland China where restrictions on speech and expression are tightly controlled, and internet access is censored and strictly restricted.The breach, if authentic, raises questions about the vast scale of China’s surveillance state, the largest and most expansive in the world, and Beijing’s ability to keep that data secure.,....It comes at a time when China is stepping up protection for personal data. Last September, China passed the Personal Information Protection Law, its first comprehensive privacy and data protection legislation, seen widely as China’s equivalent of Europe’s GDPR privacy rules. The law restricts how businesses can collect personal data and is expected to have a sweeping effect on the ad businesses of the country’s biggest tech giants, but allows broad exceptions for government agencies and departments that make up China’s vast surveillance capabilities.In China there is a law to protect citizens of misuse of user data  by private companies, but there are exceptions for government agencies.",

      "body": "As bitmover pointed out, China itself doesn't care about privacy, so I don't think this data should be \"treated with utmost care\": it should not be gathered and stored in the first place. And while the government of China can't be blamed for the hack itself, it should not have gathered the info about their citizens. Who knows, maybe the data was leaked precisely to show how much China as a state knows of its citizens. So I think better privacy laws, not more KYC requirements, could be a part of the solution. And using surveillance not to monitor regular citizens and what they say about the Communist party, but to look for real criminals.",

I think the government here doesn't care about the safety of its citizens.Back to the public access that is so easy to provide data without ever thinking that what they provide, is an action that drags the data into the publication area. Because the police give free space to be traded, the pretas proudly explain what is sold to the public on the basis of ignorance of people who provide data for free. Based on the article you shared, the victims still don't realize that their data is being sold.",

Hackers who ask for a ransom in Bitcoin are not very intelligent, because the anonymity they obviously want to achieve is actually the way they will be caught sooner or later.",

(you need to learn that not everyone is in shanghei under camera monitoring, using digital cash... majority stil use paper cash. (yes paper cash still exists go to any travel agents and exchange yoour dollars for YUAN, i promise they wont ask you to register to be a CNY citizen just to use cash))this whole gimmich is a clickbait campaign.. intended to make china look bad by making people assume the worse.oh and 23kb per person of 1bill population(the assumed 23TB collection). is not much data per person.. heck its not even a 'mugshot' in SD photo format. let alone bank records criminal records and medical records of everyone. take it from another approach..if some lame hacker said he had record details of 230million americans stolen from a ohio police station containing all bank, criminal and medical records.. would you believe it.. .. no you would noteven if you cast aside the surveilance state myth that that a ohio police station had everyone on file.. just the limited amount of bytes per person shows the information is not as full as advertised",

It's unfortunate that such occurrence can be tracked to employees of organizations if they do such. I think if such should occurr as a means of negligence from their employer, the should seek other means for a redress instead of taking such wicked and drastic measures against their employer and organisation.No doubt as you have stated that organization want to make profits by letting government in through the back door seems this is most likely a point and spot for such but it's disturbing after luring customers into kyc verification and also involving in such act betraying the trust of your customers on you.
