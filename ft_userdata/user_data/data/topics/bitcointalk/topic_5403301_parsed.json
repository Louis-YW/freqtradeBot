      "body": "Quote from: sheryllmcnulty on June 20, 2022, 07:13:26 AMI also think it is better to divide the investments into multiple wallets to reduce the risks.I will start with the fact that the coins are never in the wallet, they're \"on the blockchain\" (said in an overly simplified way). This is very important to understand, for your coins safety.Web wallets are not safe. The website can change the code and steal your information even if it worked well for years. Phishing and clone/similar websites do that even easier.Custodian services and exchanges need KYC, have ever changing rules you have to obey to and they're a magnet for hackers since that's where the money is.Local wallets are as safe as your device. Smartphones are bad, windows systems also bad, so maybe a linux pc is reasonably ok.So the real deal is cold storage, hardware wallets and so on, but even here you have to be overly careful on how and where you store your recovery seed and what companion/software wallets you use.Splitting can be a good idea if you do it right. If you split between wallets on the same (virtually infected) computer you've achieve nothing.Keeping the smaller \"daily\" funds online and the bulk (if it's the case) on cold storage or paper wallets can be a goo direction, if you know how to generate and store safely those paper wallets.Acquiring a hardware wallet can be another pretty good direction.All in all, some wallets are safer, but in case of those the weak link is the owner (you) and the possible mistakes.Not long ago somebody thought about splitting and was mentioning even some exchanges. And as I said, those are usually not advised, especially for larger funds. But each and every solution depends greatly on the user, his amount of funds, his technical knowledge, his willingness for KYC, what crypto services he's using, what software he downloads and installs, how he uses his pc...So I can give some ideas, but it's your decision to make.PS. This looks to me like a \"beginners\" topic, not really \"trading\", maybe you want to move it to the correct place.",

I also think it is better to divide the investments into multiple wallets to reduce the risks. Is anybody using multiple wallets here? If yes, then which ones are those, and how good are their safety features?The fundamental rule is the farther away your private keys are from the online environment, the more secure your wallet will be. Cold wallets are the safest option there is by the reason that private keys never touch the Internet. But what is equally important in the case of cold storage and what differentiates them from, say, hardware wallets is that they aren't equipped for recurring payments. Once you find that you need to spend from your cold storage, you can make your payment, and you need to move the leftover to completely different cold storage, which has never been used for payments before. Hardware wallets, even air-gapped ones, are a little bit closer to the Internet than cold wallets, which makes them more suitable for day-to-day transactions, but that involves certain trade-offs such as the necessity to somehow communicate with a computer in order to function properly. Software wallets are the least safe option because private keys are closest to the Internet and, therefore, always are at risk of being intercepted by a bad actor. Whether it is a desktop or mobile wallet, when you unlock your wallet by inserting your password, your private keys stop being protected by encryption algorithms and are basically stored as plain text that can potentially be seen by whoever spying on your device.",

If yes, then which ones are those, and how good are their safety features?I'm using multiple wallets, but only because they are for different use cases (e.g. Bitcoin Core for running a LN node, can't do this off a hardware wallet). Apart from that I feel like using multiple wallets may actually be a liability since keeping track of the wallets and their backups is prone to user error. Unless of course you currently store all your coins in a mobile or web wallet, in which case it would definitely make sense to move most if not all your funds to a hardware wallet or other form of cold storage.Quote from: mk4 on June 20, 2022, 08:12:01 AM1. Use a reputable hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor/Coldcard) with reputable software wallets (Wasabi/Electrum/MetaMask)Also ideally buy it from the vendor directly and not via some third party market place like Amazon or Ebay. Even if you buy from the official seller on Amazon you'll never know what you get since Amazon is known to mix all its inventory together, regardless of source.",
