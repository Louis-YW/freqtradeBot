  "content": "Hello everyone!I'm selling my own Stake.com account because i'll quit gambling - I can't afford any more.This account is totally real, clean and has very high wager.I know account sales are prohibited on Stake because they want you to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars until you get the VIP features.I DO NOT RECOMMEND gambling - but if you're going to play anyway, you can at least use good bonus odds.Some information about the account:- %44.32 to go Platinum 3.- I had one full screen on Hacksaw's VS bonus, that was good.- There are no restrictions or penalties.- It has Level One verification - so you can use your own info to get Level 2.Bonuses are determined according to the wagers you make that week or month. But since I've been Platinum 2, I've always gotten $25+ per month. on a weekly basis it becomes $10+.I am ready to share all screenshots so that I do not compromise the security of the account. Just write a message.$175.",
