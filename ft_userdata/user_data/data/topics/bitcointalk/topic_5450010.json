  "content": "I have been learning more about Bitcoin from Github as one of the recommendations of  Pokapoka1 since using the development and technical discussion search engine is hard when I don't even know where to start from so had to learn first from github to cover up my basics. so I learnt about keys and Bitcoin wallet address, what they are and how they are created like public keys from private key through elliptic curve and Bitcoin address from public keys through hash algorithm and many more(well it was surprisingly easy and interesting). The impact this keys had on Bitcoin security made me take a glance on bitcoin blockchains, which I Learnt has never been hacked (except crypto exchanges and wallets especially hot wallets) because it would require about 51% control of the blocks to make changes on the ledger. I would be happy to understand why blockchain system is not implemented by corporations in their security(I  have no idea about cyber security)?I read that bitcoin wallet doesn't contain coins but keys, that the coins are stored in the blockchains does that mean bitcoin are not transferred(move) during transactions, but just a change in ownership?The relationship between the private key, the public key and the address is a one way function I.e private key can't be gotten from public key, K= k*G where k= private key and K=public key and G=generator point, but saw something about brute forcing a two way connection wanted to know if brute forcing is impossible or just inefficient?Created the thread to ask the questions since I didn't know if it would be rude to ask a question in another thread.",

In theory, it's always possible that you can brute-force a private key.",

They should look for solutions that fit their problems, not problems that fit a solution (blockchain)The main reason that companies are not using blockchain is that they don't need it. It is a veery specific usage.",

Someday, Bitcoin may become an integral part of some cybersecurity method, but for now Bitcoin just uses cryptography for its own security.Quote from: She shining on April 24, 2023, 02:39:16 PMI read that bitcoin wallet doesn't contain coins but keys, that the coins are stored in the blockchains does that mean bitcoin are not transferred(move) during transactions, but just a change in ownership?While it is convenient to think of a transaction as moving bitcoins from address A to address B, nothing is really moved in a transaction. Transactions are just changes in ownership. A typical transaction basically states that, \"I have a private key that controls this amount of bitcoins at address A, and now whoever has a private key for address B controls them.\"Quote from: She shining on April 24, 2023, 02:39:16 PMThe relationship between the private key, the public key and the address is a one way function I.e private key can't be gotten from public key, K= k*G where k= private key and K=public key and G=generator point, but saw something about brute forcing a two way connection wanted to know if brute forcing is impossible or just inefficient?Most people would say impossible because that is a simple and practical answer, but the correct answer is inefficient or impractical. It is nearly impossible, but not strictly impossible to brute force a private key because there is an incredibly small chance that it will be found. It is inefficient and impractical because the expected cost of brute forcing a private key exceeds the value controlled by any private key by many orders of magnitude.",
