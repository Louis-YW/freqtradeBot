Don't sound too nervous to discourage newbies from creating a topic as long as it has not been discussed before and how do they know this, by making the use of the search function on the forum menu to check, newbies can create a topic as creating a topic does not mean asking a question alone, but one can as well give an information in some specific areas that needed attention and newbies were not excluded in this, but i must make this clear that newbies have no mandate to creating a topic if there's no need for that, it not a must except you find the need to do so.",

Especially when you create some low value posts and contents that don't address some issue or raise major concerns.Comments on posts have got some real values too. You guys have got to give it a chance too. If your not acquinted with the topic of discussion, it would even serve you more to just read and not respond. It's a learning field out here and technically, your participating, your gathering the Knowledge you would need to answer some other beginner in no distant time because sooner than later, they do come around, making the same enquiry.",

If you head to that section right at this very moment, you will see what I'm saying. I don't know what this really means but perhaps low rank members like newbie, member, full member are feeling some kind of pressure perhaps to be more relevant on the forum, or to reach higher ranks faster, or to earn merit, or perhaps they simply are more curious or have a lot of questions? I'm not saying this is a problem but sometimes it seems like some of these threads are hastily created, some even irrelevant or not worth discussing about, some have been discussed over and over again. It seems like low rank members are simply too eager to open a topic so that instead of reading more about it and possibly realize they didn't have to, they end up opening uninteresting threads. In which case, the most knowledgeable members here are probably even discouraged to chime in.",

Thats a good point. Most newbies keep commenting on new threads or topics that they are interested.

I know, this also means they have better chances to get merit (and rank up, if it's the case).I support your decision, there is no need to create a lot of topics (especially repetitive in meaning) and I think that you need to create topics only when it makes sense. For example, if similar topics have not yet been discussed, there are important issues and a discussion with the forum community is needed. Personally, I create topics when I have something to say and discuss (topics and issues that are important to me), and creating a topic is indispensable (if I didn't find discussion of this in other topics).Quote from: NeuroticFish on October 14, 2022, 05:49:53 PMWhile people are different and some want to show their knowledge, I've seen newbies making topics and teaching about things they don't know well enough and making plenty of mistakes, I have to say: one should think it over before making a topic, one should ask around and clear up things he doesn't know before trying to teach about things they also don't know. If this would happen, I would agree 100% that newbies should be even encouraged to create topics.Again, I am personally wary of teaching someone, especially in technical and financial matters in crypto areas (because I think that I have a lot to learn in these matters). Accordingly, I again support the opinion that beginners (and not only) should never try to teach others anything if they are not experts in this field. Otherwise, there is a high probability of harming advice than helping.Quote from: NeuroticFish on October 14, 2022, 05:49:53 PMBut as it is now, I agree with OP: give it time, learn first.

They care about rank, and for this, they need to create a bunch of guides and open new topics to get a few merits. (sarcasm)  There were times when Ratimov sincerely helped beginners get one or two merits. What did it result in? A wave of new topics began, no matter what the information, plagiarism, or manuals, just to catch the eye of the merit source. It doesn't work anymore, but there is a legend that you get merit faster if you start creating new topics. The legend works in the same way that you can get faster profits from alternative coins. People watch YouTube, and the date of creation does not matter to them. Today, too, newbies are creating a lot of the same themes. For example, fennic, Lordsilvabtc, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange, Crypt0Gore, et al. Their enthusiasm is breaking records. You can just see how long it will last.",
