Right now Stake.com and Bc.game use Moonpay for their \"buy crypto\" function, however after contacting Moonpay, Transak and a few other major fiat-crypto payment gateways I've learned that these providers no longer accept new casino business.In the case of Moonpay they are upholding their existing agreements with casino providers (for now I guess) but new operators are only being accepted with casino licenses in the UK and USA (both of which require their own unique gaming licenses) as well as a reputable international license (e.g. curacao, malta, antigua etc.).Transak on the other hand are just straight up removing themselves from the gambling industry altogether.I think it's a real shame that new providers won't have access to reputable fiat to crypto on-ramps, it creates an uneven playing field as the big guys get treated differently.",

Every casino should have equal access, not just the ones cozying up in the UK and USA. And don't even get me started on Transak. Exiting the gambling industry? Talk about missing out on the future of entertainment.This is an outright power play. The big fish are trying to keep the pond to themselves. But remember, every Goliath has its David. New providers will find a way, and they'll rise to the challenge. This uneven playground won't last for long.",

Because there’s crypto exchange which users can use to deposit fiat and convert to crypto for crypto casino deposits. We are talking about crypto casino here which means fiat deposit is not the top priority. There’s also some legality issue on onboarding fiat payment option.It’s not a big deal since most of the players on crypto casino use cryptocurrency to play for privacy or else they just use the regular online fiat casino to play if they want fiat. Crypto casino is expanding their coverage in terms of cryptocurrency payment while fiat payment system is least of their priority due to the law requirements compared to crypto which is not regulated.",

Crypto gambling makes everything more simple and easier.In the last 10 years, I have only one fiat deposit... I wanted to try 888 and their poker. So I have the same feeling that researching about this would be a waste of time because I don't use fiat for gambling. And I don't have any plans to go back to fiat gambling casinos, or to fiat deposits in crypto casinos.",

This area of finance is often considered \"grey\" because there are much larger amounts of fraud taking place, sometimes with dishonest people placing bets and then later claiming that it was not them to get their money back. Which requires careful nurturing and intensive investigation, resulting in more expensive fees going to these businesses. A random person that is emailing these finance companies is going to get stonewalled and receive negative answers, because they don't want any potential bad publicity in the current world which is hyper sensitive. These companies negotiate deals with casinos behind closed doors and try to stay as hidden in the background as possible, they're not interested in announcing how they gather new business so gave you these answers but it doesn't make it true.",

Whether these payment providers had been mandate out on not to accept newly built up or launched casinos or really that strict on following their criteria on accepting one. Therefore, if you are that a gambling site whose really that having no license then dont expect that you would really be able to get this kind of feature on which gamblers could really be able to directly purchase crypto with these providers but come to think that it was never been available before which means that if gamblers are really that interested on playing on a certain site but lacking up with this kind of feature, then they would really be just simply be buying crypto on exchangers and would really be transferring into their gambling account as simple as that. Its not always that a big hindrance for them to stop on playing on a site just because they havent seen that option. Somewhat having these kind of options does really make things comfortable and easy access but exposing yourself towards using up your card or any other correlated things will really just totally opposing the real deal with crypto gambling. This is why these kind of things arent really that something a big issue for most crypto gamblers because anonymity will always be that preferred but cant really deny about on the convenience that it do brings.",

They don't give a fuck about fiat payment that is why they decided to go with crypto and only accepts crypto. Crypto is the world new digital currency and everyone is going after it to abandon the old fiat life style. If you are looking for a crypto casino that has a gateway to fiat,it is better that you first exchange your fiat to crypto in a exchange before funding your gambling wallet. Or go gamble in a fiat casino. Maybe there is a reason why they only accept to deal with only new casinos from the UK and USA.",

In my opinion, Using fiat on crypto casino will remove your advantage of being anonymous when playing with crypto if you will deposit Fiat directly to your casino account.",
