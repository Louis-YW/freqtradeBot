Holding, on the other hand, relies on whether you plan to keep it long-term. And more importantly, you won't benefit by listening to what the majority of people have to say if you don't know how to assess yourself (e.g., finance, risk apetite, knowledge).",

Now is the time to buy because bitcoin is cheap, although it is not out of the question that the price will go down and we will see new lows, but it is a cheap price. Hold, because otherwise it makes no sense. To have bought more expensive and sell now is a bad strategy. It is a good time to buy and hold until the next cycle.",

Buy if you have extra money since the price of any coin right now is really low (bargain price already). Or if you like to gain profit then buy and sell it at a resistance and support level of tokens or coins you wish to play with. Only pick major coins to have an ease mind of buying a shitcoin.",

But use the DCA strategy. But where you don't have a long term view in mind, then hodl. If you sell you lose unless your life depends on it. However, to be able to make an informed decision in accordance with your goals you must keep abreast with news and happenings in the crypto space.",

Although past events do not guarantee that history will repeat itself, I think that every bear market is an ideal moment for investments, although no one can know whether the bottom has been reached and whether in a given month 1 BTC will be worth $30k or $13k.",

For those with investment in coin with Ethereum blockchain, a low gas price and pump about the news of merger should help to take some profit if it shows up. Do you really think after the merger there could be profit showing up in your wallets for any of shit token you are holding on Ethereum blockchain? The gas is many times is too high that sending small amounts is worthless as it would be consumed in fees only and still transaction would be stuck so don't think it's right move to sell your bitcoin for it.On the other side you can hold it for a while and after little pumps you could sell your stash if you wish to do as your funds your decision.",

Buy and hold if you're planning to stay in the market for long term and there's more that you desire to bitcoin's price. Well, selling can happen at any season and even you don't want to but if the circumstance that you're facing requires you to do, you'll have no option but to sell.I've been there and done that and that's why you probably will do all of it. But, as part of my plan, I'm doing the two, buying and holding until I'm satisfied to sell.",

Â If you think that the price of the coin you want to hold is worthy enough to buy and in the next months or a year the price will get double or triple then you can buy a coin and start holding.The decision is all yours you are the boss in holding or trading.

Buy when the market is down and sell when the market is up. We are in a bear market so the time is to buy and hold. In the event that you wish to make substantial profits and believe that bitcoin will appreciate in the future, now would be a good time to buy and hold bitcoin. If you bought a little before, hold or can sell if there is a profit, only sell when there is a profit and absolutely do not sell at a loss, bitcoin will not decrease forever, so there is no need to panic.",
