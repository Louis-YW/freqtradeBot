If they remove it, people can still interact with the contracts as long as they learn how to do so. But this will obviously deter many traders. If they want to seize the website, it is also possible that people would just deploy their forks or run the UI on IPFS or something similar. Would they also claim that should be regulated under the same law?Quote from: Oshosondy on April 19, 2023, 10:57:46 AMCrypto is too not regulated, it would be good for other countries to follow united States SEC. People are getting scammed, there are still companies like the FTX that needs not to be operating again.I think a lot of people are not happy with the SEC right now. They just give a notice that claims Bittrex is violating regulations, but Bittrex claims they were never given answers when they ask the SEC about security rules, etc. It is weird that they go after Bittrex too when there are other exchanges that are clearly shadier compared to Bittrex, at least that's what people complain about on Twitter. Basically, SEC is being perceived as inconsistent and instead of trying to give clarity, they tried to make it more ambiguous. Even the chairman is caught shilling for Algo IIRC, after they claim Algo is security.",

I've never used a DEX, and while the concept has always sounded interesting to me, I've remained skeptical about their decentralized nature keeping prying eyes away.Quote from: Abiky on April 19, 2023, 10:32:53 AMDo you think the SEC has gone too far on its crypto/Blockchain crackdown?Definitely--but the government always goes too far when things might come down to legal issues.  If things get challenged in the courts, no agency wants to have under-investigated or under-prosecuted its target.  And I think the US government's attack on crypto has been way too aggressive as of late, considering that bitcoin has been around since 2009 and the main method of scamming and money laundering continues to be with fiat.  They just don't want anything but the USD, you know?",

This reminds me a bit of the trouble the European Union had when they wanted to revoke a special taxation status for Cyprus and they couldn't get the majority in the European parliament mobilized for it. Why? Well, that's easy, because almost all of them had connections to Cyprus that benefitted themselves. I think we are going to see something similar over time in the crypto space not only because people are financially incentivized, but also because they do understand that there is a true for Bitcoin to exist or otherwise it wouldn't be where it is.

But let's face it, neglecting Bitcoin right now, no matter what size your economy as a country is, is probably going to be a mistake. That is why I provided this quote \"Emmer added that cryptocurrencies will succeed with or without the United States.\" It makes so much sense because the guy is right. There is nothing to add to what he said. Why abandon or regulate to death an industry that is definitely going to be thriving one way or another? Even if it's not Bitcoin (just theory here), crypto money and applications are a thing of the future and young people want to work in that industry. It is attractive, it is modern and has to do with all the things that are to come and enfold their full effects: artificial intelligence, automation, decentralization, supra-globalization as I would call it because Bitcoin is even operating outside the realm of the current global economic system as we got used to calling it. Since it is unlikely that even a global alliance could stop Bitcoin from operating, I would call it supra-global. Because Bitcoin does what the people of every country in the world want it to do, and not what single countries' governments want the people of the world to do. They can require people with force, but that is temporary.",

Just my thoughts Government restrictions will make the development of such projects slow and almost impossible because the government will follow the program's developer and the program will be open source and therefore needs a team of developers to avoid any software bugs, and do not forget that they will try to hide their identity and therefore the update of the codes will become impossible, not to mention the damage that the government may cause From blocking the range, tracking developers, searching for vulnerabilities and exploiting them.If the platforms are closed-source, then they can leave honeypots and try to track individuals with new good locking high liquidity projects.In short, this technology will not grow if government restrictions are placed.",
