Prior to my interest in cryptocurrencies I made investments in various trading markets but I never experienced the level of profit that I have achieved by investing in Bitcoin which is considered the king of cryptocurrencies.One of my friends asked me a question regarding why I am trading and investing in cryptocurrencies considering that there is no central authority and no physical entity involved. They were concerned that if the internet were to go down today I would lose all my investments.?They also asked why the currency of cryptocurrencies is valued so highly.?I thought why not discuss this with my senior. I would like to hear their opinion on this matter.",

Bitcoin is Proof of Work and it needs physical equipments (ASICs) to mine bitcoin and confirm Bitcoin transactions.If we don't need any entity behind Bitcoin, we can say the same about altcoins but they are centralized in reality.QuoteThey were concerned that if the internet were to go down today I would lose all my investments.?No, they are in your non custodial (self custodial) wallets.You can connect your wallet to Internet somewhere else and access your coins. I don't believe in this world, Internet will disappear forever. We will have more development and adoption like Satellite Internet (like from SpaceX), and off-grid transactions too.[Total privacy Bitcoin]: off grid Transactions LoRaWan/goTenna",

They were concerned that if the internet were to go down today I would lose all my investments.?Tell your friend that he shouldnâ€™t worry about authority because bitcoin is actually controlled by the community and any changes to the network will have to reach consensus first. This is by far better than the central authority the government has on fiat currencies which they is use to manipulate the price of it. Concerning the physical entity, the world is evolving and as such many people are beginning to lean towards privacy due to security reason and this non-physical entity provides that. Further more the ability of cryptocurrency not to have a physical or paper currency like fiat will save cost of production and stop the act of devaluation encountered by excess fiat printing. The internet is not going down now because the world is evolving with it and but just theoretically, should that happen then even the commercial banks will find it difficult not to talk of the CBDC been introduced by the government. QuoteThey also asked why the currency of cryptocurrencies is valued so highly.?I would limit this answer to only bitcoin, it is very high in value because it is limited in number. The total number that can be in circulation is limited to 21 million and just like other limited assets like gold, this trait makes it a great store of value.",

But if they actually believe that it's possible and that is a reason they have refused to be involved in Bitcoin, then what makes them believe they are in the clear? Is there anyone today that won't lose his investment if the internet goes down?Even if you don't have anything to do with digital currencies, you have a bank account and you will lose your money if the internet goes down. All companies in the world would lose their investments. If we think deeper I believe the whole world will be in too much chaos and your investment might not be the first thing on your mind if that happens.",

Some people claim that other cryptocurrencies are just as decentralized as Bitcoin, but this is not actually the case. Because of its decentralization, no one will lose their coins if part of the internet goes down. However, if the entire internet would go offline - we will have much bigger problems to deal with as individuals and as a civilization. For instance, our global economy might collapse or basic banking systems fail entirely.What do you mean by \"valued so highly?\" Bitcoin is worth whatever buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing sell it for - just like any publicly traded commodity. This is basic economics: supply and demand determine prices in real markets.",

They were concerned that if the internet were to go down today I would lose all my investments.?They also asked why the currency of cryptocurrencies is valued so highly.?I thought why not discuss this with my senior. I would like to hear their opinion on this matter.First, there is the old rule of crypto investment that states, \"Never invest what you can't afford to lose.\" The reason of such rule is because of the price volatility of crypto assets and not because the internet would fail any day, just as your friends thought.The internet will not fail, because in this century, the level of technology and internet browsing efficiency are even supposed to increase. Almost everything in the developed world works with an internet connection; even the centralized authorities need the internet, unless they want us to go back to the stone age, when there were no e-mails and letters were written by hand and sent through some authorities. I believe no one wants to have the same experience again.For your crypto investment, you did not mention if you are either investing in Bitcoin or some altcoins. But which is it? Bitcoin is the most dominant cryptocurrency in the crypto market, and it's the king of the market. It has stood the test of time; it has seen some of the worst price collapses that most people even thought were the end for Bitcoin, but yet Bitcoin is still waxing strong. I can at least speak so well about Bitcoin but not altcoins, because the situation with altcoins is usually pump and dump, and sometimes after it dumps, it may not rise again and your asset has liquidated. I really don't advise my friends on altcoins, but if anybody is investing in altcoins, always do good research about the project you are investing your funds into.Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",
