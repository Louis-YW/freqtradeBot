Post complaints here in the forum or other website that offer complaints system like Askgambler to make the casino alarmed on what they are doing. Most of the time mid tier casino doesn’t pay but high rated casino always pay when the issue became public while the evidence is strong that the player has the claim to the huge profit. Many high rated casino including slot providers has this story and most of them is resolved.Afaik only 1xbit is the only casino that I know that has a lot of active issue that still operating here despite all the evidence is strong against them. This is the only casino that has exemption to rule. I dunno why this casino still operates while they have a lot of active complaints that still unresolved.",

If they don't respond in a few days, I may open a discussion with the other members and ask for their help solving my case. And if the evidence I provide can help me to get justice, I think the casino site will help solve it because I am not guilty of anything.",

Usually a high rated gambling website will not have any difficulty to pay you or any other person who may win big as in such casinos winning big is a daily occurrence because of the huge number of players they have.If it is the case what I always recommend is to use a desktop recording software and record your gambling session,you can also take screenshots but the video is undeniable proof that you are correct and the gambling website is not,this way they will either pay you or lose a lot of customers because they will be tagged in red here from many forum members.",

First you may have to ask the support what's the hold up on your withdraw, if they say they are doing some investigation regarding your big win and so you have to wait. But after several days, if you still haven't got a word from them then maybe you need to make a follow up.And still if you got no answers then the next resort is to open a scam accusations against them and hopefully they will have to come and respond to your issues. Just save everything, the chat logs, screenshot your winnings etc. etc.",

Gather all the pieces of evidence, screenshots of all your pieces of evidence, and post the complaint here and on all the other platforms, if they have an announcement here with an active representative, the community can pressure the representative to address the issue. A high-rated casino cannot ignore your accusation as long as your complaint is legit and you have not cheated because it will ruin their reputation, gamblers will stop playing here and new players will stop coming in, gamblers have Bitcointalk to thank they have a good venue to post their accusations.",

You have to recognise the fact and be very choosy on what platform you gamble on. Theist of it is that, it should be a legally registered casino or sportsbook and that would be one way to take up the case when there support system isn't working.A few gambling platforms might be fully functional online but, som of them have got there head office in a known location some place else. Be it as it may, always ensure the site is licensed and trusted on the forum if it does exist here and then, you could forward a formal accusation, stating the facts and providing the evidence to the case and when that doesn't work, you go legal with them on there registered certificate.",

A reputable casino will not do that. but if you get a big win and casino start checking your account. I think that's reasonable. in the case of multiple frauds such as the use of multiple accounts or the use of a VPN in the casino which is detected by the casino compliance system. Of course, this will result in your account and funds at the casino being suspended.I often see such accusations on forums. on the forum, there are some of the leading casinos. it's just that some players don't want to read the casino rules before they deposit their money. this creates more and more cases of accusations for more casinos.",

If you find a gambling site that has a thread on this forum of course you can create a thread to make a bad review with accurate evidence so that people stay away from that gambling site, of course they will lose users if they play cheating, but if a gambling site that you mean never made a thread on this forum of course we can't discuss that too here with your complaint, make sure to play on a gambling site that is also active on this forum, as a case of my account being locked and loading posts to their thread quickly they opened my account again",

A gambling website with a high rating will be concerned about reputation because that is how they have gotten to where they are, so they may have a good reason for deciding to make your withdrawal process difficult by refusing to pay. You have to be sure that you have not broken one of their terms and conditions that you agreed to, Create a discussion about it here first, so you hear from people who have been in same situations, before you can decide taking Legal actions against them.",

If this is a high-rated website you're talking about then there's no reason why they will refuse you to pay, there must be a reason why they refuse, and the best action is to ask them if you committed a violation and if the violation is true then you can't do anything about it if not then it's better to make it public by opening a complaint here and if they have a representative here ask him to address the issue and let the public judge on who is right and if the casino has the right to refuse you, a reputable casino will always keep their promise.",

The best thing you can do to yourself is to select a casino that it is not known for not paying out their users.It is like giving your money to a bank that you are not aware if it is going to return them back or not.Hopefully, we have bitcointalk and other forums that you can see reviews about casinos and other platforms and to be alerted where you invest your money.",

There are cases when gambling platforms refuse to give the prize because it is won via a violation of their terms and conditions or in unfair ways. For example, you won the jackpot but it is found out that you are a resident of a blacklisted country. You might not receive your money in this case. Or if you've won the jackpot through a bet that is already beyond the maximum. There are actually many possible reasons why a prize could be forfeited. Whether or not it is fair for the platform to allow the gambler to bet only to be told of his/her violation once he/she has won big, that's another story. But if you're already certain that you truly deserve the prize or that you won it fair and square, then communicate with the platform's official channels. If they still won't pay up, then you could bring the case to a competent lawyer for possible legal proceedings against the site.",
