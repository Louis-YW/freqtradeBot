  "content": "I think this whole FTX issue that we had last year is definitely not helping the crypto world. US regulators have issued their first ever joint warning to banks over the risks associated with the cryptocurrency market, the main problem here it seems the lack of control. Here are some of the points discussed in the joint warning: QuoteThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)(collectively, the agencies) are issuing the following statement on crypto-asset1 risks to bankingorganizations.The events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure ofvulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector. These events highlight a number of key risks associatedwith crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants that banking organizations should beaware of, including:• Risk of fraud and scams among crypto-asset sector participants.• Legal uncertainties related to custody practices, redemptions, and ownership rights, some ofwhich are currently the subject of legal processes and proceedings.• Inaccurate or misleading representations and disclosures by crypto-asset companies,including misrepresentations regarding federal deposit insurance, and other practices thatmay be unfair, deceptive, or abusive, contributing to significant harm to retail andinstitutional investors, customers, and counterparties.• Significant volatility in crypto-asset markets, the effects of which include potential impactson deposit flows associated with crypto-asset companies.• Susceptibility of stablecoins to run risk, creating potential deposit outflows for bankingorganizations that hold stablecoin reserves.• Contagion risk within the crypto-asset sector resulting from interconnections among certaincrypto-asset participants, including through opaque lending, investing, funding, service, andoperational arrangements. These interconnections may also present concentration risks forbanking organizations with exposures to the crypto-asset sector.• Risk management and governance practices in the crypto-asset sector exhibiting a lack ofmaturity and robustness.• Heightened risks associated with open, public, and/or decentralized networks, or similarsystems, including, but not limited to, the lack of governance mechanisms establishingoversight of the system; the absence of contracts or standards to clearly establish roles,responsibilities, and liabilities; and vulnerabilities related to cyber-attacks, outages, lost ortrapped assets, and illicit finance.It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlleddo not migrate to the banking system.

The bankers and politicians who caused it are probably setting up to blame Crypto as the root cause. I have a hunch we will be seeing this \"talking point\" all over the news in coming weeks.",

I had a quick glance at the PDF file and I don't think the situation in question should be portrayed as only having a negative impact on the crypto world [e.g. they did mention consumer protection on its second page]:Quote from: https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2023/nr-ia-2023-1a.pdfBanking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services tocustomers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation. The agencies arecontinuing to assess whether or how current and proposed crypto-asset-related activities bybanking organizations can be conducted in a manner that adequately addresses safety andsoundness, consumer protection, legal permissibility, and compliance with applicable laws andregulations, including anti-money laundering and illicit finance statutes and rules.",

At heart these warnings are understandable, as the shitcoin market is very much a casino where the house in some cases cheats. Let's hope that Bitcoin is considered a commodity and the rest securities and people start to be clear about the difference.",

Isn't that obvious? Cryptocurrency market thrives because nothing controls it. It is a true reflection of human dynamics at a global scale. No other markets show such kind of dynamics. That's what the problem is. Globally the central banks and other regulatory agencies control their own respective markets in the name of consumer protection. Crypto is only market where such nonsense controls are non-existent. Expect more of such alerts and warnings from many other regulatory bodies all around the world. That's bound to happen!",

They understand that if they have a check from the regulators, then they will have huge fines that they will not be able to pay and a possible criminal case. Therefore, they hope that if they close now, they will be lucky.",
