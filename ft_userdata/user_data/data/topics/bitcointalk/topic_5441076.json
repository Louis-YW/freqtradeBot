  "content": "Hey everyone,I hope you're all having a great day. I wanted to share my story with you all. I'm a Software Engineer. A few years ago, I started with crypto trading. I was excited about the potential of cryptocurrency and I wanted to make some money. However, things didn't go as planned. I ended up losing a lot of money.I realized that trading was taking up a lot of my time and effort, and I wasn't getting the results I wanted. I started looking for tools that could help me make better trading decisions, but I couldn't find anything that met my needs.That's when I decided to create my own tool. I'm planning to launch a new startup that will provide technical indicator alarms for crypto assets. You'll be able to select the technical indicators you want to receive alerts for, and you'll get a notification when the alarm is triggered. I believe this tool will help you save time and effort, and make better trading decisions. Here's how I imagined a use-case: If a user selects Bitcoin and the technical indicator \"Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD),\" the tool will monitor the MACD and alert the user if the MACD crosses above or below the signal line, indicating a potential buy or sell signal. Another example would be alert if RSI for [cryptocurrency] is near 30. You'd have a slider to select in % how near should the alarm trigger. Other indicators I plan to add are: EMA, SMA Williams R, Bollinger bands, death/golden cross alert, etc. My question to you is: Would you be interested in such a tool? I'd love to hear your feedback on this idea. What features would you like to see in a technical indicator alarm tool? Let's make trading easier and more enjoyable for everyone. P.S. I'm partnering up with 3 other colleagues (another Software Engineer and two traders that have 10+ of experience in trading. One of them was active on Quantopian and he managed to create very successful trading strategies), so I know that we have the capacity to make anything.",

      "body": "If your tool is good, some people will be interested. But as for me I do not need such tools, I have been using those exchange indicators for everything that I need about trading. If what you are saying is true, it will bring a convenient way for trading, but that does not mean the trader will make profit. You can set RSI alert to 70% and you sell, but that may be the start of a bull market in a way the indicator may stay around 70% or increase higher as a result of the price of the coin you are trading continue to increase. What I am just saying is that indicators can fail, but having the alert for the indicators can be helpful against checking the chart all the time, which can reduce the time spent for trading.",

My idea differs in two things at the start, and there will be more:1. With Tradingview, you have to work manually for each coin you are interested in. I plan to create it such that you can get an automatic notification for all coins where there is a change in the indicator; that is, with Tradingview the focus is on the choice of coins, and with us on the indicator2. On Tradingview you have 10 free alarms until you upgrade the program; I plan to limit it to the number of indicators, for example, you could have MACD indicators for all the coins that I plan to support (for now BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA, BNB, but that's just in the beginning - the goal is to support 10K+ cryptocurrencies)Quote from: palle11 on February 24, 2023, 02:50:41 PMThis will be an interesting support to trading and I believe if you get your plan very well then you will get more people to like it.

I still have to consult with my trader colleagues, but here are some ideas that came up to my mind:1. Alarm to show how tight/separated the bands are to show high/low volatility or begin of a trending move2. Alaram turns on when the price touches the band, or just before it reaches it (here you could define with a slider the distance between the price and the bands. Based on the distance, an alarm would triggerWhat do you think about these ideas? I'd love to hear your opinion, as well as the opinion of others",

Bollinger band is very sensitive in nature and can confuse a trader very fast. Yes. We are aware that Bollinger bands can act as momentum/trend continuation indicators when the price breaks out of them in both directions or a reversal one when the price goes back into the BB area after it has previously already broken out of it. Also, we can compute how wide the BB is in both nominal and relative price terms which would indicate how compressed or volatile the previous price action in the band is. So in total, that would be five different  uses of the same indicator",
