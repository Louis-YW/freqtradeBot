Once a report comes in, it has to be handled either way but if it's a complicated case or too trivial which can't be determined as good or bad, it remains unhandled which doesn't affect your accuracy. By the way, no need to fret about it too much. As long as you are not abusing the button, it's fine.",

I doubt that is possible on the SMF software and it's not a common situation for one to mistakenly send a report. You need to click two buttons to send a report, one after you click \"report to moderator\" and another when you click \"submit\" after writing a comment or not.It's unlikely that many users would find themselves there and such an option would be seldom used.Quote from: Sarah Azhari on March 30, 2023, 04:15:53 AMSo far, I reported 3 posts with 100% accuracy, 1 of the 3 reported is my post.  I don't know how that 100% comes, because my post i did report some time ago, maybe still be unhandled or hasn't been seen by a moderator.

Sometimes they end up as \"Bad\", sometimes as \"Good\".I used to dislike \"Bad\" reports, but I changed my interpretation: it just means I'm not only reporting the obvious spam, but also border cases that may or may not deserve Mod action. So I'll let the Mod decide, and use the rare \"Bad\" report for future reporting. It helps to know how Mods handle certain border cases.In most cases, \"border cases\" stay unhandled. Mods don't want to delete it, but also don't want to mark it as Bad. Fine by me",

About the topic even if you reported your own post by mistake, you are supposed to give a reason while reporting right so what's that.
