  "content": "Hello. I wanna share with you a thought of mine. The last financial crisis started to scare at the end of 2008. Bitcoin appeared in January 2009.There is something that was pioneered back in the distant 1996, was made by just 9 people and became a global phenomenon that everyone later learned about whether they wanted to or not.Its creator was Satoshi Tajiri at the age of 31.Satoshi wanting to unite the children made the game in such a way that if you did not exchange data with your friend it was not possible to complete the game.The phenomenon was later called Pokémania.Selling 31,000,000 copies.Each Pokémon was unique and encrypted so you couldn't copy or create it and exactly what you sent, was exactly what your friend would receive.So with a cable, before infrared, before Bluetooth, before anything, you exchanged encrypted data, data that had a specific value in the game. Encrypted data, with a cable.. The Pokémon Storage System, allows player’s Pokémon to be stored and transmitted as computer data. The player can store Pokémon in a number of Boxes (12 boxes 20 per box in gen1), allowing them to own more Pokémon than just the six permitted in their party. The first such system was originally developed by character \"Bill\".You could always use Bill’s PC (a public computer) where you had the following options. WITHDRAW , DEPOSIT , RELEASE , CHANGE BOX , SEE YA!Each Pokemon was 32 BitsAs many as 32 Halvings that will occur in totalAs many as 32 Ethereum required for validatorA crypto wallet usually has a recovery phrase of 12 to 24 words, the personality value of a Pokemon consisted of 24 phrases of 4 letters (G,A,M,E) ,starting from 00. 01. etc, as you will see bellow.   00.GAEM 06.AGEM 12.EGAM 18.MGAE01.GAME 07.AGME 13.EGMA 19.MGEA02.GEAM 08.AEGM 14.EAGM 20.MAGE03.GEMA 09.AEMG 15.EAMG 21.MAEG04.GMAE 10.AMGE 16.EMGA 22.MEGA05.GMEA 11.AMEG 17.EMAG 23.MEAGA Pokémon's personality value is an unsigned 32-bit integer that is created when the Pokémon is first generated by the game. As an unsigned 32-bit integer, its value can be anywhere from 0 (32 zeroes in binary) to 4,294,967,295 (32 ones in binary), inclusive. This value was introduced with the Pokémon data structure overhaul that occurred at the start of Generation III, and is generated using the game’s pseudorandom number generator.I'll end with a sentence describing a mythical Pokémon. Where he starred in the first film with the voices of Takimoto and Takashima on loan.\"Once in many lifetimes phenomenon, a powerful rare and sophisticated machine created by cyberpunks in a secret lab. Mewtwo\"",
