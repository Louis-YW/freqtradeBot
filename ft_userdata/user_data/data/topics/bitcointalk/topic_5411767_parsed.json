Because from my perception Bitcoin is been determined on the increment of price the restructured of the market by the investors.Instead of watching the video and being proven wrong you sit in your predetermined bubble trolling from the sidelines with nothing to back your claims.Actually, investors don't determine the price, trading bots and major miners do. You won't beat AI, you won't beat the miners... - how do you think I was correct about the actual price 2 x in a row when it went up? I'm up 2 x without being wrong as shown in my videos - recorded in advance, and accurately priced & timed! Please save the mindless jargon for someone else. You are probably one of the same people that tell people the government can't track your transactions...What are your credentials? I was arrested by the FBI, DHS, NSA, US Marshals and shut down by USDOJ with a complaint brought forth by Comcast because I have an intricate knowledge of how DOCSIS standards as well as cryptography opererates, trust me when I tell you this is my area of expertise, has been from a very early age.",

My YouTube channel was seized. But I'll make sure to message you months before it happens. If I said in 2 years then I would understand your point, however I said between 7-8 months and that's exactly when it went up... Lucky guess, coincidence? Or maybe just a keen understanding of what drives the price. I have only made 2 price predictions, in 2017 and in 2020, so far 100% accuracy within days of major price movement.",
