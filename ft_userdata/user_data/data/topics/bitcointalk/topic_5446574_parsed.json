If one can see all of these UTXOs head out all at once, you can start making more and more accurate inferences. Don't matter if you HODL though.Though, if you consolidate or spend small amounts at a time it makes it much easier to maintain that privacy. Okay, so they are deriving these shared secrets via derivation paths I assume. So a wallet needs to be ready to scan them... I assume it's been implemented in such a way that the wallet knows to keep scanning till it hits a zero. TY!!!",

Still cool to use the same payment address over and over again? Hmm if I was a content creator and I don't mind being d0xed, I shouldn't have any problem reusing a BTC address or something. Maybe you can even generate a vanity address for that so they would know it's you.",

      "body": "the whole payment code is simplewhen you want someone to pay you, you usually press a 'generate address' button which derived from your key. adds another address tro your wallet for it to monitor incoming payment after ou pass around that address.. thus you +1 the nonce/salt of a new address..however this scheme is where the other person that knows your secret can generate a new address to you to send you funds without you having to give them a new address.. and they notify you that they are sending funds to a new nonce of the key thus allows your wallet to also move your nonce to the also add the same address to your wallet to then see the paymentEG if old wallets only scan/look for address 1,2,3,4,5  its not yet looking for 6,7,8,9 because you have not pressed the generate address to trigger 6,7,8,9these payment codes notify your wallet that someone has sent funds to 6,7,8,9 so that your wallet would too generate them same addresses to start watching for incoming transactions on 6,7,8,9 even if you did not manually trigger the generation of 6,7,8,9the issue still remains.. the need of sharing the secret upfront. meaning you have to choose who you get into this relationship withthe silly part is you need to secretly communicate before setting up this relationship to secretly share a secret.. however you might aswell not tell them a secret which they can abuse.. and instead during the private communication. just send them a list of 100 public addresses for them to use. and just give them an upfront list of public addresses as they are used.. thus no need of a shared secret",
