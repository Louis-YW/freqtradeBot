Depending on football match outcomes, they earn points. Josue created an excel sheet with minimal intervention. One only needs to:- enter the match outcomes- paste a portion of responses from playersThe Excel automatically tallies points by stage, as well as a compiled leaderboard. The working version is linked in OP of the thread I shared above.As a bonus, Josue is communicative, pleasant to work with and charges a fair rate. This not even acknowledging his being an asset to the forum. Highly recommended!",
