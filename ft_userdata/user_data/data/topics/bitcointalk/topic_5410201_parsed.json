  "content": "There's an interesting thread about 0.46 BTC (~$11k) being released from escrow by OgNasty after receiving authorization to do so from a compromised account. One of the issues being raised there is the lack of 2FA on Bitcointalk:Quote from: BetGalaxyADM on August 17, 2022, 01:08:22 AM{...} And to blame it on my account' security... when escrow is being offered on a platform that DOESNT EVEN HAVE BASIC ACCOUNT SECURITY FEATURES LIKE 2FA!!!!! Which I also will make sure that my following is aware of this as well... escrow shouldn't even be fucking allowed on here without 2fa being integrated first. How the fuck does this website not have 2fa?That in and of itself is what bothers me the most now after thinking about it. WHY IS ESCROW EVEN ALLOWED HERE WHEN ACCOUNT SECURITY CANNOT BE GUARANTEED!!!!!Close down the marketplace until 2fa is implemented! Do SOMETHING!Why doesn't Bitcointalk have (optional) 2FA?Seriously, @theymos needs to set some time aside to read RFC 6238 and then spend a weekend getting a basic TOTP implementation working (with default parameters to maximize compatibility: 6 digits, 30 second time step, HMAC-SHA-1). I'm sure he's reluctant to add features to the \"legacy\" codebase but it's not much code and the effort would be worth it, IMO.I very much doubt he'd need help with something like this, but I'm willing to volunteer my time, although my PHP skills have just about fossilized at this point. Can anyone think of a good reason why this shouldn't be done? It seems like it would take so little effort for so much reward...Edit: Based on some of the responses so far, it seems necessary to point out that I'm not suggesting that 2FA would completely stop accounts from being compromised. I'm also not suggesting that there are not already alternative mechanisms to prevent escrow mishaps (like message signing). I'm only suggesting that for a lot of users (especially ones with bad habits, like password reuse) 2FA would help. I also think that even using 2FA lazily (i.e. on a single device) can still prevent things like phishing sites, clipboard malware and keyloggers from being able to easily steal and use your password.Edit: Thanks @Z-tight for finding this thread! It seems that someone already attempted this in 2014 and even made some changes at theymos' request but it was never implemented. Edit: I ended up tackling, and finishing this. Here's the topic about it: A concise 2FA/TOTP implementation (SMF patch).",

Having 2FA on another device is what that is recommended.",

There's no need to make using Bitcointalk more work, just because some people (who earn up to hundreds of dollars per transaction) can't guarantee the one thing an escrow should do: protect the innocent from the scammer.Besides, 2FA will only stop a small part of the scams that take place here.

But I'm proposing optional 2FA so you wouldn't have to use it. Also, RFC 6238 is pretty well supported (i.e. lots of different choices for mobile and desktop authenticator apps, native support in some password managers, etc.) and doesn't require an additional device.I'm guessing you use a password manager, and TOTP is already natively supported in a lot of them (like KeePassXC).",

In my opinion, the best security is from ourselves in the use of this forum.- Reduce the activity of browsing unknown websites- Don't just open the link on the forum or outside the forum especially from stranger- Antivirus for the device (if needed), but also be careful when choosing AV- Prepare a good password, strong, difficult to guess, 4 combinations (letters, numbers, capital, symbols).This should be enough to secure the account. Let's see why theymos accounts or top user accounts have never been hacked, both don't use 2FA, right? Because they secure the account with their own method. LoyceV for example, he created account for PC and for Mobile. because he realized the importance of keeping his account secure. From him we can learn if not logging in on any device is important to secure our account.",

However, the rest is good. Physical key although free, is by your discretion. Other than that, using a Bitcoin address, and automated system for verifying signatures would be the most logical approach. Although, that would probably be difficult to implement into the current software, and that's why I imagine it hasn't already been implemented, I take theymos has someone who cares about security, so I wouldn't have thought they'd be against two factor authentication. It's probably the issue of implementing it correctly, and without introducing a tonne of new problems, and potentially breaking other things.",
