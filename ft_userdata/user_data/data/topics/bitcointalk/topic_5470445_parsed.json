Please note that the availability and types of tasks may vary based on your location and skills.OP, you are so wrong, these aren't just platforms were you earn money by performing tasks. These are freelancing platforms where companies and other employers outsource  their projects to qualified professionals,  and they do this from the economic point of view, possibly to cut down the cost of employing and maintaining an in-house professional. You don't just do tasks, you bid for these contracts, the employer verifies your capability and outsources the contract to the most qualified professional under some agreed upon terms which includes project cost and payment schedules based on milestones or at the end of the project, depending on the agreement. Its in no way tasks, you give tasks to someone already working for you, but contract is for someone whom you want to work for you for a specified length of time.",

There are actually numerous freelancing platforms beyond the ones I listed. I only included the ones I've personally experimented with. The platform you brought up is indeed relatively new, just as you pointed out. It does have its limitations; for instance, there's a cap on the number of ads you can view daily, so don't anticipate seeing as many ads. Nevertheless, you can expect to earn at least $1 in a day.\"",

Not all client on the freelance industry are companies that wants to outsource job, some of task their are from individual personal request with their given circumstances.I use odesk aka upwork before and I have a lot of client that is just requesting a job for their personal interests.

Skills that you need to learn and master. If you are not good enough and unable to create a good portfolio you are not going to get those tasks done. But the list is good. If you have skills to show off then I guess these online platforms are the best place to do so. If you want to make the big bucks, you will have to learn multiple things at once and also need to be good at it. It's hard but with practice and patience it could be done. And you are doing those jobs sitting in your home. So what better way to earn than this. Thank you OP for sharing. There are some that I didn't know about before. I might give them a try.",
