Sure you can build up a MVP, let me break it down for you:Design cost: I mean, a basic logo and some colors, probably you could find someone to build it for you for $50, but it's not gonna be nice. Domain cost: this is the most affordable one, I would go with a .com for better indexation. Hosting cost: a lot of hosting providers don't like gambling content, so you would need to find a gambling approved shared hosting provider, cca $50 per year for startersTemplate cost: let us say you're starting of with Wordpress, and then add a casino affiliate template on top like the Poka Theme, you're looking at around $60Content cost: You can try to go with AI content for starters, but you'd still need to learn how to fill out the template, test the operators and so on. In case you do go with human-written content, you're looking anywhere between $80 to $120 per review, depending on the writer. And I didn't even include marketing/SEO in the equation here.",

It was an example and i said more basic then that.I dont need any help with marketing/SEO & can do a logo myself.I already have host provide, affiliate networks & i already got a domain.as i said i just need somebody to make the website, everything else I do my on my own.Its easily doable to do a simple affiliate website for 200-300 USD. Easy..I am sure some people already have saved designs etc.So no problem, no bubble bursted.But thanks for your input.",

      "body": "Well, this sounds easy, but in reality, it is quite complicated and requires a lot of work.$300 is probably enough money for just setting up a site (WordPress with a paid theme and there are many reasons why it is a good solution), but there you have a problem with the content. If you want quality, it certainly cannot come at that price, and it is almost crucial for further successful promotion. As the gambling market is heavily loaded, any progress requires quite a lot of effort and investment, in the marketing of course.If we take into account that you are targeting the Swedish market, I assume that the plan is not to have everything in English but in Swedish. So for the content, you need someone with a good knowledge of the Swedish language. It can't be cheap for sure. When I mean cheap, I mean offers of $5-$10 per 500 words.Plus, regardless of the content, the site needs to be adapted to the local language, which reduces your choice of potential collaborators.Next, what can be a problem in your business, there are certain restrictions and prohibitions for users from Sweden when it comes to casinos with a Curacao license. It will bring you additional work, time invested in research etc... It doesn't matter if you want to do it all yourself or if you have to hire someone, there are certainly additional costs.Why am I telling you this? I am currently in the process of setting up two services of a very similar nature, so I go through the whole process. A similar idea with an affiliate gambling service was abandoned because of too much work, and the niche is very demanding and competitive.As I said, I am currently on very similar projects, although I'm still learning and if you need some advice, or help, you can contact me.",

I am Swedish and I will do all that myself.For the second time.. I just need somebody to make the website, everything else I do on my own.I have created and build many affiliate websites before with wordpress that made alot of money and them looked very good with very less effort. So I know its possible, i just dont have the time to do it myself right now.And I dissagree its to much work, when you start to get signups from your website everything runs automaticlly, i still making money from my old website but its shut down becasue the people signed up still playing.You get like 30%-40% of their losses from the day they signed up and until the day they stop playing.And I also wont get any problem because of a license, I running a affiliate website and not a casino, i dont need any license my self, I just sign up on a network and they fix everything and they take % from all my earnings.If you are good at marketing & SEO and know how to promote your website. its possible to make insane money and you dont need to have an advanced website.Trust me I know this and i am very good with marketing & SEO.But thanks for your opinion and good luck with your projects mate! If you need any help, you can contact me.",

OP needs no help in installing a WordPress site he should be the one doing the launch because it allows giving access to his Cpanel, to launch the script. OP just needs to launch the WordPress script I'm sure the domain is already connected to the hostname server so it's already propagated.OP knows what I'm talking about because he claimed to own WordPress sites, I wonder why he needs to pay $300 for launching a WordPress site all the themes he needs when it comes to affiliates are on the WordPress theme page and when it comes to SEO all OP has to do is to set the permalink to /%postname%/ and he is good to go.If he still wants to hire he just needs to launch the WordPress script and give him the admin username and password.",
