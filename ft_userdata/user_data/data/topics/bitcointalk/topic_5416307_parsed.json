This'll probably be the case until its widely accepted and widely used in places (it doesn't have to be done everywhere but as soon as it's done in a city and shows proof it'll keep them stable we'll see this happening).By accepted I don't necessarily mean it has to be used as a means of payment for goods but could be stored or used in other ways.The people saying we're going to be in a bear market for a few years are using the past to attempt to determine what's going to happen next (and are also perhaps hoping for the past to repeat itself because it's much easier to trade when you know what's going to happen).",

In times of uncertainty, people should be looking into something more certain, into a way of saving their wealth if it is very likely to suffer heavily from the global economic recession. Perhaps the problem is that Bitcoin is NOT stable. If a person doesn't have faith that Bitcoin will recover again, the losses with Bitcoin can be higher than from fiat inflation. Also, stability is something more associated with gold, the price of which remains quite stable. Bitcoin requires taking a risk for the sake of potential profits, and maybe priority in uncertain times is not a risky decision but something relatively certain.",

Such a law would be hard to accomplish, I imagine it was back then. There'd then be enouch ways to exchange crypto to currency if that happened or to assets once crypto wasn't allowed to flourish in some areas. I don't think there's one market with significant influence on bitcoin though, I think that's been decentralised a bit too recently (US companies might be the largest public buyers, but even then they don't seem to have that much influence on the price from there when they claim they've bought or sold). I don't know if areas like Europe will follow the US on such a ban too, there's a chance but there's also something they could gain by watching the US banning it and keeping hedge funds and other companies happier by keeping it (there's already a much less regulated derivatives market in Europe too).",

That was my idea of it.It should be bullish. The problem is not all of the people who buy bitcoin do it with their own money. Some take loans to invest or have taken loans to buy other things like stocks or real estate and are now getting destroyed by rising interest rates. These people had to sell bitcoin to pay their loans up and stop losing money to the banks. There's also a group of investors who trade bitcoin by predicting cycles. When bitcoin loses about 50% they sell everything because it could mean a prolonged bear market. To them the economy isn't important. What is important is if bitcoin is in a bull or bear market. The good part is those people are out by now so what's left is the mostly normal investor, a person who held in 2018 and is not easily scared. QuoteBut why do legendary investors like Michael Burry predict that we are not at the end of the bear market yet, because of a looming economic recession/depression? Burry is a permabear. He was bearish in 2019, 2020, 2021 and he's bearish now. Also, he's impatient. In 2020 he sold all his gamestop stock right before it exploded in 2021. It's estimated that holding the stock for another 6 months would've made him 1 billion USD.",

On happy scale crypto is still premature in the eyes of government and world wide summits. They still think printing more money could be better option and imposing this rule and that rule would be far better. That being said it could happen they will try to banish the whole crypto space so that the money invested in it will be sold off and all the money starts rotating in the bank to bank. The recession is inevitable, it’s gonna happen because that’s the position we have created for ourselves with pandemic outbreaks, stimulus giveaways and wars!",

      "body": "Bitcoin will see increased prices as soon as we start recovering from the recession. Others have touched upon it, but during the very start of a recession, everyone is filled with panic, and due to the drastic changes are usually worried about putting food on the table, let alone investing in a newish cryptocurrency. So, basically buying power goes down, which results in less coins being moved. Exactly what happens with fiat systems when the market crashes. People don't have the money or the will to spend their money, which results in businesses feeling the pinch. It ultimately takes time, and adjustments by the people, and governments to mitigate the effects. Once we start to recover from the recession a little bit, that's when people have more buying power, and are coping with the recession. Not only that, they'll look to alternatives since they've just lost a lot of money being invested in a fiat system, which is the direct cause for them losing their money.So, when the market starts recovering, we'll see increased buying, which in turn should increase prices.",

Currently, both gold and crypto are bearish and only the USD is the strongest, so other assets dumping is understandable.
