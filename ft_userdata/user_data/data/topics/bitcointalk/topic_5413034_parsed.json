  "content": "Several hardware wallet manufacturers have suffered hacks and data leaks in the past. This trend might not stop, and I think we will also read similar stories in the future.That’s why I decided to check with the most popular hardware wallet creators if they support shipping to PO boxes and payments with cryptocurrencies. I sent emails to their support to ensure I got the correct information.You can check out the results in the table below:|Brand|Shipping to PO Boxes?|Payments via Crypto?||BitBox|Yes, depends on country and courier.|Yes, BTC and LBTC via Crpyto.com Pay and BTCPay Server.||Blockstream Jade|Yes|Yes, BTC, LBTC, and USDt via BTCPay Server.||Coldcard|Yes|Yes, BTC.||Foundation Passport|Yes|Yes, BTC via BTCPay Server.||KeepKey|*Unknown|No||Keystone|No|Yes, via Coinbase Commerce and OpenNode.||Ledger|Yes, via regular mail. Not supported in USA.|Yes, via BitPay and Crypto.com Pay.||OneKey|Yes|Yes, via Coinbase Commerce and MixPay.||SafePal|No|Yes, via SafePal Pay.||Satochip|Yes|Yes, via Coinbase Commerce.||Trezor|Yes|Yes, BTC and LTC via Confirmo.net.|* Support agents are unsure, don't have precise information, or info is not available on official sources.11 hardware wallet manufacturers were contacted, and all of them replied back.When it comes to shipping to PO boxes, these are the results:-   7 companies support sending shipments to PO boxes. It’s important to mention that not all carriers will ship packages to PO boxes in all countries.-   2 companies don’t ship to PO boxes. -   The support personnel of Coldcard and KeepKey weren’t sure exactly and couldn’t provide me with the correct information.   In terms of paying via crypto, all popular brands support crypto payments. It would be weird if they didn’t, but that wasn't the case a few years ago for some of them. KeepKey support told me they accept crypto payments, but I couldn’t find an option to pay with cryptocurrencies in their shop. Once I get more info, I will update the table and thread. More brands can be added to OP. For now, I decided to focus on the most popular ones. If you want to see a particular wallet in the table, feel free to request it below, and I will try to add it.",

Example is the Ledger Nano that does not much care about their customer's privacy, anyone that wants privacy may not still want go for such kind of wallet. Another is SafePal. I am not surprised that SafePal is making use of SafePal Pay, just like Binance wants BUSD to be the dominant stable coin. But that is not the matter, the matter is that SafePal is the worst wallet among them, not recommendable nor advisable to be used. The wallet is completely close source, using close source mobile app, not support open source wallet like Electrum, but stuck with their app with little to almost no feature than to send and receive cryptocurrency.BitBox02 is one of the best hardware wallet, but not just partially recommendable because it supports Address Ownership Proof Protocol (AOPP).",

      "body": "I can tell you that as of when *I* ordered both ColdCard keystone both DO deliver to PO boxes. OR at lest DID.BUT, keep the following in mind.1) I am US based so this might not apply to the rest of the world.1a) That is probably a fair assumption in general that there may be different requirements for different places. Specifically if something is going though customs / requires a signature for delivery. 2) With keystone you either have to pay with BTC or have the PO box address on file with PayPal. A PO box is my default PP address and when I bought mine that is where it went.3) ColdCard accepted whatever address I put in. Since we are the default office for un-deliverable things in my office building I often make up office numbers. i.e. STE 507 which is very impressive since the building only has 2 floors.... But, the point is that they do not do address verification like other places that will not let me make up office numbers.3a) Which did turn into a disaster when the old building owner sub-divided some spaces and added 10 offices on the 2nd floor and it took a while for the post office / address verification databases to catch up.4) Keystone is available through Amazon and they will deliver to Amazon lockers here in the US.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5359720.msg57962757#msg57962757-Dave",

If the only way of buying a Ledger online is either through a KYCed fiat method or a KYC enforcing bitcoin processor such as BitPay, then you should simply never buy a Ledger online. With all the time Ledger can spend integrating debit cards and instant exchangers and other privacy invading trash in to Ledger Live, you would think they could just set up their own instance of BTCPay or similar.",

Yes you would have to trust me, but since I would really not care or check you could have me ship it to someone else who would then ship / give it to you.Probably a very small market, but would help some people feel more secure that there is no real way to trace hardware wallet 'xxx' to them.-Dave",

I know that Ledger and Trezor have dozens of them worldwide. Since you mentioned Foundation Passport, I know they have 3 official resellers in the EU. The one you mentioned is for the UK, but there is also Cryptomaan and Bitcoin Brabant for Belgium and The Netherlands. There is also a company in Slovenia called Eventus sistemi, but they are not mentioned in the EU list. They are in a \"Distributors\" category at the end of the page.",

We know from things like AOPP and FATF documents that in the US the government want to move to a system where every address is KYC linked, and that they want all centralized exchanges, platforms, or services which allow withdrawals to personal wallets to ensure every withdrawal address is KYC linked. It's not a huge step from there to imagine them wanting a system where every wallet, software or hardware, requires KYC linking first. Of course such a proposal is crazy and could never work in practice, but these are the same people who are trying to ban encryption, so I wouldn't put something equally stupid like this past them for a second.",

I know a lot of the mail forwarding places do keep records and have handed them over to the authorities if requested. The o_e_l_e_o re-ship service could get away with a lot more, and if you are ordering the device yourself you have 0 concern about someone shipping you a pound of meth that you then forwarded on...Taking it a step past that you could always keep a few of the more popular ones sitting around and then just ship from stock, but when the next model comes out you might be stuck with the old one.
