ETC was unlike ethereum which have been massively used by people to build their platforms. ETC is not even worthy to be considered as investment. The miners are only using POW coins as a way to get cash. These POW mechanism was a garbage thing when it comes to the coin without limited supply. ETC has no total supply and it will become only a money grabber for the miners. Only people who wanna risking their money try to buy ETC in this case. The thing that makes ETHPOW dumped so hard is if people didn't even need it caused by it has no utility same as ETC",

ETH is the biggest hurdle for ETC, but once ETH moves to POS, the chances of ETC are huge. ETC has a supply of 210 million coins.It is normal for ETHW to be dumped after the fork event, because it makes no sense for the holders, they just want to get it for free and will sell it later for a profit. ETHW is really garbage as we have had ETC before and now when it comes to POW, ETC alone is more than enough without anyone else.",

I'm pretty sure ETC will trend up to 100 during a bull market which is prolly a couple of years from now.  But here's the thing, ETHW can trend up during a bull market too.    These things don't make sense when there's lots of money coming in.  They all just go up.  The thing to look for is which coins go up the fastest to give you more +EV trades against BTC or ETH.  That's why...  Before taking on a trade, chart it vs BTC or ETH first.",

And so what if miners migrate to it? What they do is only mining but I think the one that contributes the most in the price of the coin is the buyers. Those who buys this coin are blinding investing because the coin is said to have no utility other than I think being a mineable coin.Quote from: icalical on September 18, 2022, 01:38:46 PMif a developer wouldn't mind with the Ethereum move to PoS and most of the investors wouldn't mind too since thought that people still use Ethereum smart contract, maybe some investors that think Ethereum PoS will be less decentralized but I guess the amount is not very significant. The developers didn't mind the upgrade because I think they are very confident that this can greatly improve the performance coin and I think most of the people/investors thought of the same thing, so they don't complain about it but the only downside of this is I think it makes Ethereum more centralized, as you also said.",

Obviously miners move to somewhere, but just because they mine it more now, it doesn't mean it would be more popular as there's no other point to it existing then for miners to target their rigs. All the developers moved to other projects and they got left with this relic of old eth. And those miners just want to make profit and dump it on the markets, not to participate to anything meaningful.",

The market's situation won't look at it as it's possible. But with the current price, it's got, only 3x of increase and that's going to be there once again.I guess that the main use of it these days is to be just chosen as the alternative coin to be mined and get some profits from it.

If we are talking about ETC boom, I think $100 is too small for that.   We all know that when a cryptocurrency boom, the price multiplies depending on how cheap the coins is.  So ETC currently @ $29.x  may grow more than 10x if adoption, hype and boom happens since $29.x is still cheap and potential for 10x growth.",
