I'm really glad that more casino cryptos are on the forums these days, which means we'll have more reference sites to play on.BTW @Team_MegaPari, why not do a marketing campaign on this forum? I think it will be better because promoting only from this topic is not very effective. We have @Hhampuz as the most trusted campaign manager here.About the signup bonus, will it actually be credited to the user's account even without them having to make a deposit first?",

MegaPari is a completely independent gambling project. The design might seem similar to other platforms but I guess the decision to pick the existing design was in familiarity and intuitively friendly interface. Anyway, speaking about insights, we do plan a redesign  Few words more to independence: since MegaPari is not connected to any other casino site, it also means that the company has its own truly amazing team of professionals - that is what I personally like about MegaPari. In contrast to gigantic gambling representatives, MegaPari is so dynamic and open to improvements and the path to them is much shorted. For example, I manage omnichannel communication with our audience - I collect what our players say and then discuss with our team whether we are able to implement our players' ideas.To verification: No, I would not say that the verification process is strict. The only thing we ask our players is to be loyal to the rules stated by the license requirements and provide a timely response to our security team. The faster they get the necessary information/documents, the easier it is to verify a customer. Anyway, you may specify what you mean under \"strict verification\" and I will gladly provide you with more details.

You may also specify what means \"strict\" to you and we touch upon the topic of verification a bit closer. \"NetEnt gaming\" is a provider that asked us to include the information to prohibited regions to our T&C. We are now on the way to include the provider to our provider portfolio (over 50 for now) and are eager to agree upon the requirements that may appear. More info to GEO restrictions in T&S 2, points 6-8. Thanks for your suggestion to FAQ, I will discuss it with my colleagues!:) (btw you could add some other questions that you would love to see on our website so I have a sharper image of what questions shall be there)Quote from: passwordnow on October 26, 2022, 11:08:45 PMThe links that you've attached to the image and the megapari word are quite long.

We offer a welcome bonus to all new players. The conditions of applying the bonus you can find under \"Promo\" on the main page of the MegaPari website. The right to access our website is based on countries' jurisdiction. The fact that the website is available in any country does not suppose sufficient legal grounds for using the website.
