Bitcoin is a crypto currency and it is not impossible for it to lose value years to come ( the chances of it losing value is very thin though).",

Of course it's because they didn't understand about Bitcoin, they invest in Bitcoin because relying someone else advice or join because his friends are invest in Bitcoin.So make sure you're need to be educated enough, learn slowly, and invest when you're ready.",

If I were you, I would keep Bitcoin pension plan as my plan B. Be practical, while Bitcoin can reach up to moon, there's no guarantee to it. It can very well go down in prices. A lot depends on international politics. So you never know what's going to happen in the future. So keep investing for a longer period of time but at the same time have a separate pension fund. You never know what's going to happen. Just don't gamble with your life.",

I have made inquiries to know if it is possible and realised it isn't possible to switch to my preferred choice. So what I have been doing so far is to set aside part of my income for DCA outside the mandatory pension contribution. For people in Liberal countries, I think using Bitcoin investment for pension purposes is very much possible.",

Spreading investments in different coins could be a great thing as well but having Bitcoin, as the main component of your portfolio, would be ideal. That's just my opinion. Of course, since we are here in the forum, it's a good thing that you are in the Bitcoin forum and know that it's a great investment and could give great returns in the long run.",

Almost every fool knows and practices (or plans) about this method of investing and receiving an additional pension.Quote from: Marvelockg on March 08, 2024, 03:21:42 PMFrom what I've come to see, such investment has lots of disadvantages and limitations due to unforseen circumstances like war and government policies that could make the cite of the buildings inhabitable thereby making the investment unprofitable and sometimes most men at the point of retirements, discovering that they can't get access to all they've invested into become traumatized in the process.Also, natural disasters and population migration to better areas (both within the city, the country or the world) can significantly spoil the ROI of these investments. Don't forget about investing poorly in the wrong area. So, investing in real estate also involves many risks, despite its initial apparent simplicity.Quote from: Marvelockg on March 08, 2024, 03:21:42 PMInvesting into Bitcoin is good and for the time being, we can actually make a ten year speculation on the fact that it will still remain a  valuable and profitable investment but the question here is;Until now, investing in bitcoin has been profitable, but no one knows whether this will stop before you retire. It makes perfect sense to include bitcoin as part of retirement investment portfolio, but whether should build that portfolio 100% - sounds risky.Quote from: Marvelockg on March 08, 2024, 03:21:42 PMIs it wise and realistic for someone in his early twenties to set up Bitcoin as  a retirement plan such that he continues accumulating Bitcoin from this time till he gets to his retirement age? In short, why not YES. By the time a twenty-year-old guy retires (if everything goes well), it will be approximately 40-50 years, his pension and investment portfolio will show crazy returns (assuming the current growth dynamics bitcoin over the last 10-15 years are maintained).",

BTC has a good store of value for a long time and there's a feeling it would stay to keep being number one investment option for those who believe in cryptocurrency and its possibilities. BTC launched the ETF for potential investors to use to their benefits in case we forget.The other investments could be real estate which has better chance of increasing its value for the owner overtime, but BTC for pension plan will require one to have good knowledge of how to keep their wallet and key phrases safe and intact from both friends and families and adversity.",

The odds of bitcoin price going up is higher than it going to zero, which is very slim. The best thing is to use 10% of your income to invest in bitcoin with regular DCA weekly or monthly, so that you will ha e the chances of increasing your bitcoin portfolio with timeline.Don't also forget the the size of your bitcoin portfolio overtime is what will determine your profit. I have also decided to Hodli bitcoin to be part of my life, and I will pass it on to my kids, because a time is coming that the people that owns bitcoin might become wealthier than people with fiat related investments. At the same time, you should also have a back up plan, incase bitcoin price did not meet up to your expectations.",

It's a wise decision and it's very feasible. However you should have it at the back of your mind that cryptocurrency is a risky investment.

That disadvantage are government policies. In the EU there's a push towards making shelter the necessity governments have to provide for people.
