Irrespective of any gender they are free to gamble online without being to go physical shops.",

It is conducted on hundreds of LGBTQ+ people which are gamblers, they are telling their experience while they are gambling offline and the reason they prefer online gambling. What people can disagree to about this is if the participants involved are small and there should be more participants.",

A single issue with them can create chaos in social media their community is very strong and well-supported.  In our country, there's a bill that is being approved that will give them the power to express themselves more up to the point that they can bypass their original gender limitation without committing a crime such as using a girl's restroom by game which can be abused by real mean impersonating as gay to peep.LGBTQ+ is already not discriminated against except in some countries where this is not allowed like India.",

Is it because of the documents sent to the online casino or is there a behavior that is different from LGBTQ+ so there is discrimination against these people including from staff and other users?I understand that LGBTQ+ is contradictory in some countries, there is still this ban even though LGBTQ+ is very strong in some countries, but I won't comment too much because for me LGBTQ+ is a contradictory gender.",

The research is still ongoing. The results from the completed study are expected to be published later this year.I doubt that what triggers LGBTQ to gambling has nothing to do with harassment, for me just like the rest of us. They want to enjoy and have fun and to some extend  win some money just like the rest of us.Just last night I went to a traditional base gambling and saw some members of the LGBTGQ community and just simply playing, simply as that. I doubt that they are there because they feel isolated or something. In fact they are all laughing and I even saw them getting drunk and no one cares.",

Not that it's something weird, as you've said, it's pretty obvious, especially if you consider how most places still don't really have their mindset changed with regards to the LGBTQ+ issue and stuff. It's stupid research though imo. It doesn't prove anything, since in the first place, the bias exists still, the research proves nothing at all since the bias exists all over the world. Plus, it's titled wrong as I said, when gambling generally has the same effects all across the board, regardless of gender (or whatever you identify as). It's the same reason why there was a thread here but with women and gambling instead.",

Especially for those who doesn't like being surrounded by strangers since it's involved money. Like me who is introvert, I highly prefer online gambling because I don't have to be with other people and I have more peace of mind being at home so I enjoyed gambling more. Based on the research you've mention, there's not a lot of correlation between the LGBTQ+ community and casino since it's not only them who experiences discrimination and harassment in casino. And I think that in this era, people are more open and the LGBTQ+ community is more accepted and understood by others. So I think they can still have fun in casinos if they really like going to those places.",

Your opinion is clearly what every well meaning individual in the society should have if we really want a better future for the global community. In as much as millions of people across the world doesn't believe the religious creation that brought human to existence which I don have anything against such people for their personal beliefs, the fact that every other living animal is made male and female should tell humanity that we are supposed to let just two genders exist.The manner at which many people promote this third gender is inhumane if you ask me. Why try to be who you weren't born to be? Whatever effect gambling has on their community should remain with them. They shouldn't force us to share from it or talk about it",

Judging from this meaning, it's quite understandable why such set of people will prefer online gambling to the normal traditional casinos, that is not a normal lifestyle to he honest, and for them that have willingly chosen not to live a normal lifestyle like normal people, it should surprise or bother them when they face discrimination in public places, I do not have pity for such type or people, as they are a bad influence to the society.",

They have their own community, they have their rights and there are politicians also a member of their community. If they wanna gamble online, it's up to them also.",

Their realm is in certain places but when it comes to casinos that involve a gender I know it's never been questioned. LGBT, a thing that doesn't deserve to be shown to the public, right? in some gambling countries it doesn't matter, the important thing is that they make a profit from the players, for example, in Thailand, I often see that this kind of thing is commonplace.",
