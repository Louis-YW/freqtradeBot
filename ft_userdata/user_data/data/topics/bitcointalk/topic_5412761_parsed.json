As far as I know you just asked for help with bitpr0 but is it right to give the label of OG site to bitpr0 even if this is your new own site?",

Unlike some reviewers who present to us totally strange sites who heavily influenced them with some pays.For the referral links it's normal, if you want to proceed playing with the sites at as first timer you could chose to use the link or ignore and follow the site directly.",

I wonder if there's a system or let's just say an FAQ for each sites like these such as what criteria is used to give a review about that casino though ratings and reviews can be biased or just copied from other review sites just to have people who are new to the casino create an account and the site owner will be the referrer. I always noticed that when a review site is posted in this forum and soon the thread will be buried by other threads and yet another one pop up or the same team/person but different domain name.",

By the way, not everyone knows a particular review site and just stick to it.They will always look around and compare or find some new ideas.",

I think that they're both connected for real and that's why it's labeled with that as OG site or there could be more with that story.

I saw Brave as part of the exchanges and I was surprised if Brave is an exchange because what know about it is just a browsing app that one can use to search the internet just like other browsers that we do use. Op need to also give reasons why he made some casinos to be at the top so we can understand the criteria used.",

And the way I read the replies above it seems that those links will give them money once they clicked the link. Nice try for OP, though but it would be best if he could give his honest review to each gambling sites.I've seen several of these links claiming they were the best but most of them aren't true it's just a propaganda so that almost everyone would believe such claims. It's best if you know one or two best gambling sites for you so that you won't waste some time trying to test each site for your liking based on their claims.",

Plus as others have said, I think your criteria could be included, maybe in a separate tab so other curious people can know about your specific criteria and possibly the sources that you've used. Other than that, well, it's like any other review site imo, so if you're not planning to change that, adding more content would be your best bet.
