Nevertheless, after EL Salvador successfully have a good result of what they've done in their country with bitcoins, other countries will also follow in their footstep no doubt about it.",

Since Bitcoin is pseudonymous, we don't know where many people are from, so it's hard to say xxx active addresses are from country xy.

Do you want to boost your post count? Do you really think that such posts add any value to the discussion around Bitcoin?Who cares about how much Bitcoin was valued back in 2009 and how many Bitcoins are mined every day?The people care about the future of Bitcoin and the future BTC prices. The minority of tech savvy people care about the upcoming changes and improvements of the Bitcoin Core blockchain. I'm not one of them, though. Maybe we should stop being so focused on the past and start being more focused on the future.",

For sure, India has many people owning crypto but most likely it's just because India has so many people.  The survey from KuCoin is interesting but I don't know how KuCoin can deliever reliable numbers of total crypto holders in India for their survey. It looks like it's an internal survey from people registered on KuCoin, as it says \"among crypto holders\".",
