I am also into sportsbetting but I was doing dice games before. The thing I liked about sportsbetting is somehow allowing the players to minimize the tendency of losing through analyzing the teams I am interested with; past matches, players'performance and such. To answer the question whether you should go back to slots, that is really on you as @Oshosondy have said. One's preference is the answer.

Sports betting has a chance that your winning will increase through your skills because this is not pure luck, but perhaps this was a coincidence that you have won, if you have a little knowledge of sports, just do research on it to increase your chances of winning. Slot machines are easy money, you don't have to wait for the result but it has a high risk to become addicted if you cannot manage yourself, it is up to you to know where to choose, and you will perhaps receive decent advice to our fellow gamblers here.",

Out of curiosity, do you bet on football by tailing another gambler or do you just bet according to favorites and odds? I mean, because you said you don't love the sport and yet you keep on betting on it. I am curious because I am trying to dig deep on knowing more about football as I have also witnessed a lot of gamblers win in the said sport. Plus, it's a worldwide game so I want to know why the hype about it is so large that almost every sports lover does talk about it.It will be a good addition to both my hobby of analyzing games and my gambling habit. Congratulations though, that's some big bets you got there, perhaps sticking with it will be the best choice, and lesser slots.",

It doesn't seem like you're forcing yourself to gamble in sports so I think it should be fine to continue, it can even come as a sort of breather since as you've said, you started hating on slots quite a bit. Now I have no idea why you chose sports though, I'd honestly have gone to other casino-type games instead if I were in your place, but to each their own. If soccer starts to turn tedious maybe try out other types of sports if you still don't wanna go back to slots. It's honestly more fun imo even given the time it takes for each match to happen, watching the match itself is part of the fun after all.",

But if you feel more fortunate to play in soccer betting, then you should continue soccer betting. BTW, in the past, I was a bettor who bet on football matches. But at one time, when I tried to play slots, somehow I felt I was luckier. And because of that, I lowered my betting percentage on soccer betting. maybe the percentage is 30% (soccer betting) - 70% (slots), I mean, believe me, you'll not be able to leave your old habit of playing slots, just lower the intensity.",
