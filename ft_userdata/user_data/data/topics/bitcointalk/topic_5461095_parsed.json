The reason I asked is because they said not your node not your coin. I want to know how true it is.You need to understand that there are wallets that are custodial and Non-custodial wallets. Basically, from the inception of Bitcoin wallet, if you are not using a Non-custodial wallet, you don't own the bitcoin because you don't have the keys and using any feature like Lightening network is the same as not your node, not your coin as the custodial companies run everything for you from your private keys and the node you are using to route payments.ELectrum wallet is a non-custodial wallet, it doesn't have the narrative of not your coin, not your node but there are things you could mix up when you don't run your own node while using electrum wallet most especially how you interact with the node to route your payment, you have to depend on a third party every time to route your payments.This table is a self explanatory of the relationship between Custodial wallet and Non-custodial wallet, running a full node and also depending on a third party node to route a payment. If you want to enjoyed LN to the fullest, the best is to run your own node, you can still use Electrum wallet if you chosed to but you will have to run a node independently",

The real concern is, if you don't run your own node, you need to rely on other node which as watchtower to prevent cheating (e.g. broadcast earlier state of LN channel).

It's actually quite a good idea to run one full Bitcoin node somewhere and connect to it from your SPV wallets; be it on PCs, phones; anywhere you are, you can connect to that full node over Tor and get a big improvement in privacy.What is true though is that if you have such a box running already, it does make sense to install Lightning on that instead of using LN through Electrum, which would require you to rely on watchtowers and whatnot.Also, even if you have a real full, self-custodial, always-on LN node, it may make sense to also have a light or even custodial mobile Lightning wallet for small expenses.",

Because you have 2 weeks to publish a true one. Am I wrong? Why do we need an always running daemon?It depends. It's not necessarily 2 weeks; I'm not sure about current default values for different Lightning implementations, but it's definitely possible that you have different lock times set up.Also, your channel partners may think your node is having reliability issues if it's down most of the time, as they typically want to use their channels for routing. As a consequence, they may choose to try closing the channel. If your node does not wake up in time for a cooperative close, that becomes a force close which costs both sides more sats.All that is to say that Lightning is supposed to be used as an interactive, 'always-on' system where nodes can reach their channel partners at any (or most of the) time.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on July 29, 2023, 09:58:54 AMGood point, but i never said it's bad idea to run full node.I didn't mean to imply that.
