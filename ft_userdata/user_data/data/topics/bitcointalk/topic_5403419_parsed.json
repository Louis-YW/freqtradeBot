      "body": "Nobody can say the accurate date and time of next halving, it's all estimation.What we know is Bitcoin block reward will be halved after each of 210,000 blocks. The third (latest) halving was happened at the block #630,000. The next halving will happen at block #840,000.Now, we are at block 741,661. You can make your own estimation too.But estimation will be affected by total hashrate on the network and difficult in future. Lot of things can be changed. Assume Bitcoin network will be congested 2 weeks, the halving date & time will be delayed 2 weeks from your estimation.Personally, it is fine to assume the next halving will happen from April to June 2024. Sooner or later 1 to 2 months is not a big matter.Quote from: https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/Past halving event datesThe first halving event occurred on the 28th of November, 2012 (UTC) at block height 210,000The second halving event occurred on the 9th of July, 2016 (UTC) at block height 420,000The third halving event occurred on the 11th of May, 2020 (UTC) at block height 630,000",

Surely, as long as there's no massive changes in hash rate, and the difficulty adjusts within a certain period, you wouldn't get any more than a month difference? I'm saying a month as that's probably overestimating. I imagine it would be a maximum of a week or two difference? I'm sure someone has done the Math before, and how much price changes, and therefore difficulty, and hash rate effects the date of the halving.",

Since, I imagine their initial predictions at the end of the last halving were a little different to what they're displaying now. So, for anyone to accurately predict they probably would need to analyse that far back, to see how difficulty changed etc. I definitely haven't looked at the statistics to give any meaningful predictions, it would be nice if these predictors gave some sort of formula that they use to determine the date, otherwise they might just be purely guessing.",

I would keep it simple: calculate some 9m58s per remaining block and adjust that every .. let's say 100 blocks (of course, I could do it also at every new block). Is that accurate? No. Is that wrong? Hardly.",

Some blocks will be mined before 10 minutes, some will be mined after 10 minutes, the last 3 halving do not occur exactly at the same time, so no site can be accurate about this even if they use 10 minutes bitcoin block mining for the calculation.",

CoinWarz  - 3 June, 2024, it was saying May 16, 2024 in January, so in this case looking at previous adjustments that included a 8% in December I assume they are doing a median for the last x difficulty adjustments, that's why any drop will push it down more.The difficulty will adjust in one day, I'm sure quite a few of them will change their timing by quite a bit since it will go down after an up.But if I were to bet on one, it will be probably Binance, a time just a tiny bit faster than the averge.Quote from: Welsh on June 21, 2022, 08:36:32 AMWhen you say wildly incorrect, what time frame are you speaking of there? Surely, as long as there's no massive changes in hash rate, and the difficulty adjusts within a certain period, you wouldn't get any more than a month difference?That's exactly why you can get those differences, as nobody has a clue how many s19xp and hydros have been ordered and will be sold, only a one-on-one change would bring us a 30% increase in hashrate with no price adjustment, that alone will be enough for a 5-day faster halving. There are gear orders for around 50-70 exa this year, that would again be enough for an extra week, ad a recovery to 40k for the last 6 months and you could reach a month swing. Since we had a + 5.56 % followed by a + 4.89 % one month ago it wouldn't be a surprise for it to happen again, especially if you look at large mining companies' press releases about expansion, even in these times.Theoretically, it could be done I wouldn't be surprised by it, but as I said my bet is at around the 1st of May, a +1% average difficulty adjustment till then.",
