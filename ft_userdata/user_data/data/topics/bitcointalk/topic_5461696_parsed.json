While the odds may still be low from a mathematical standpoint, the power of hope and togetherness knows no limits. When friends unite, pooling their luck and resources, it's as if they sprinkle magic on those lottery tickets. Who knows? A delightful surprise might be waiting for the squad! Even if the jackpot remains elusive, the excitement and camaraderie of dreaming together form a beautiful adventure worth cherishing. So, keep dreaming, and may the lottery stars shine brightly on your group's path! ðŸŒŸ",

You can increase the chance of you winning but I don't think that you can win it by just few tries, it can even last you and your people months without seeing a good results. Additional to that is the hassle that a you will experience in targetting that kind of lottery tickets per day. It would be a disaster filling up the tickets with your details in it.

One thing that you should also put into consideration is that no matter how many gamblers coming together to do the maths their chances of winning is still 50-50 because gambling is all about luck. I wouldn't love to gamble as a group because there can be some misunderstanding when it comes to division of funds after winning big. I prefer the solo gambling that if I loss it's all my funds and if I win,I have all the funds. However,it is fun gambling as a group.",

Lottery ticket has no owner imprint on it which means anyone who will be greedy on the group can solo rhe profit and hide to others. This is very possible since itâ€™s very common to be greedy if thereâ€™s huge money involved so doing this kind of pool is totally absurd unless you have a legal documents that will protect everyone involved for prize split in an event that someone will be greedy. Still, betting solo is the brst thing to do to avoid hassle and trust issues.",

Actually, it just the same as more different people betting on tickets every day but the difference is, people in these so-called groups do have a given task to intentionally increase their purchased tickets.Might be good but personally for me, it doesn't change the fact that the winning chance is slim.Quote from: Wapfika on August 01, 2023, 04:29:24 PMAlthough they indeed increased their chance of winning by doing group lottery ticket by small percentage I think thereâ€™s a big problem here on who will claim the prize if ever they win jackpot prize.

We cannot tell basically, that's just how powerful money is. Yes probability will obviously be higher than individual betting but I'd still prefer betting alone 'coz in such way it'll be easier to accept loss and enjoy winning more.

Would he be wrong if he won't share it? Morally, yes. But you won't be able to sue him for such thing if there's no agreement acknowledgedÂ  on paper and signed by both parties. Such thing isn't nee to be honest. Many people could break their friendship or alliance just because of money.",

I think it could work even without the mathematical flaw that they made a big deal about in the movie. There's a good way for you to win bets as a group especially when it comes to the lottery but only in certain types, as games like the PCSO Lotto in the Philippines completely took care of this and made sure that large bet groups wouldn't be able to win more games than regular players by making sure that the numbers that are still predisposed don't necessarily win you the games, you have to choose the correct combination and orientation and only by then will you be able to win the whole prize pot. At the end of the day I think it's great math exercise but if you're looking for a syndicated form of business why not just invest on a cooperative?",

Having 5000x tickets is really a huge deal for one but as Casdinyard is saying having that Jerry and Marge Go Large debut is not sustainable unless you're really that genius.

Not really a fan of lotteries, i bought tickets sometimes before, but that's more likely a donation to the lottery company. There's nothing interesting about lottery other than the massive amount of jackpot that has been pooled by the thousands or not millions of people who bought the tickets.",

But from a mathematical point of view, it might make sense. For example, the main prize in the lottery is $50 million. For a certain number of separate players, one million dollars is enough to completely solve their life problems. Thus, it will be beneficial for them to gather in a group of 50 people and play together - they will increase the chance of receiving the required amount by 50 times, which is very good.",
