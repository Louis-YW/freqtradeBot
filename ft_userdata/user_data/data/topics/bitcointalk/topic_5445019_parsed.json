Being recognized doesn't effects by government or any authority, whenever a woman or man creates values to world they are being recognized that's why today when you look at the music, and movie industry today you can also noticed they are making names as well, do we look at the sports and gaming industry women are also recognized but the issues there is that how relevant and creative you are to your country would makes them recognized you. The males today are not helpful if they noticed they don't have any value to offer, both male or female they became valuable when they have something useful to proffer to the family Sorry to say, I have came across a family filled with the woman and those men there aren't making any efforts but their parents recognized those girls than the male sons. As a matter of fact I myself values the females more to male because they mostly takes good care of their families when their parents are old while the male looks over their wives instead of their parents, so I don't think government have any power concerning this matter here rather the woman have to walk and work on themselves to be recognized in the nation just as our sister Ngozi okonjo iwala did. Today everyone talks about her because she creates values for herself and her household.I come in peace ✌️Udo",

The matter worse sef well well for some kind countries wey really get strict rules;In Yemen, QuoteA woman is considered only half a witness. That’s the policy on legal testimony in Yemen, where a woman is not, to quote a 2005 Freedom House report, “recognized as a full person before the court.” In general, a single woman’s testimony isn’t taken seriously unless it’s backed by a man’s testimony or concerns a place or situation where a man would not be. And women can’t testify at all in cases of adultery, libel, theft or sodomy. In the same Yemen, Quote Women can’t leave the house without their husbands’ permission. Yemen, where this law remains in force, does allow for a few emergency exceptions, Begum says: if the woman must rush out to care for her ailing parents, for instance In the Vatican City, Quote Vatican City is the only other country that allows men, but not women, to vote.In saudia Arabia, Quote Rape victims can be charged with crimes. Many, many countries fail to protect the victims of rape, but some go a step further -- punishing women for leaving the house without a male companion, for being alone with an unrelated man, or for getting pregnant afterwards. Ridiculous restrictions on women’s rights around the worldSmall small all this things go dey change with time.",
