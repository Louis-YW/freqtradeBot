Whatever happens in this forum is in the hands of its administrator, since he can do whatever he wants with the database where everything from this forum is stored.Now, the merit is not bitcoin. The merit doesn't need proof of work. The merit is just numbers Theymos adds to the database, out of thin air.When merit was implemented many old user had already certain ranks. I am very new in here compared to the founders, but I already had Legendary rank by then. Just as an example.When merit was implemented everybody got \"airdropped\" merit according to his rank. I've received 1000 merit. I don't remember how much spendable merit (sMerit) I've got then, it must have been at least 500 (half of the received merit). From that point people started meriting valuable posts, legendary posts or their idols. If you look into https://bpip.org you'll see most merited accounts and also how much everybody got airdropped.For example Satoshi has 4473 merit, of which 4223 earned and 100 airdropped. And I can assure you he didn't post anything since the merit exists Meanwhile a fair number of merit sources were created, meaning that certain users get spendable merit (within some limits) in order to keep the merit flowing in the forum, hence getting the more valuable posts getting merited.Everybody who receives merit can spend half of that (rounded down) for meriting others.Did I miss anything?

But there's nothing too complex about it considering that merit in the beginning was given based on rank. Indeed, lucky are those who arrived in the forum and had built up their rank much earlier. They didn't have a hard time ranking up. Ranking was as easy as making posts years ago. Now, new users will have to prove their worth before ranking up. To some, it's next to impossible to reach the highest rank. To some, it's almost effortless. While it may appear unfair, it makes the forum better.",

So if an account was a Sr. Member, it was awarded 250 Merits, a Hero Member 500 merits, and so forth. The idea was to keep things consistent, and have all pre-merit ranks be coherent with rank requirements upon introducing the Merit System. The other option, I figure, would have been to have all accounts start from scratch again, option that was discarded in any case.Note that, at the said time, Jr. Members did not require any Merits for their rank, and thus did not receive any in the so call airdrop. The 1 Merit requirement for Jr. Members was introduced in September 2018 to try to further curb the spam on the forum.2.   In addition, accounts were airdropped a certain amount of sMerits (those that are actually sendable when meriting a post), which were different for each account, and depended on its Activity over the prior year (roughly) and its rank. Members and upwards were awarded these sMerits to get the ball rolling, as per this post:Quote from: theymos on April 20, 2018, 12:37:52 AMQuote from: sncc on April 18, 2018, 07:34:19 AMWhile specific formula is not given, theymos wrote that the initial sMerit is not solely determined by rank, but determined by rank and activity points obtained in the last year.The exact formula was:Code:yearActivity = activity in the last ~year, max 378freeMerit = the merit (not sMerit) you started withmodifier =  0.1 if member  0.2 if full member  0.25 if sr member  0.35 if hero  0.4 if legendaryreturn (yearActivity/378) * modifier * freeMeritSo the most you could get is if you were a Legendary who maxed out your activity points in the last year, in which case you would get 1 * 0.4 * 1000 = 400 sMerit.Note that I later made an adjustment giving 500 extra merit to some hero members, but no extra sMerit was given here.I'll probably publish a dump of the initial sMerit at some point. On top of that, Merit sources were introduced in order to create a new inflow of sMerits in the system. Some were initially appointed, and others were later added either after postulating as candidates, or being selected for the task. The number of sources changes from time to time, as sources are sometimes removed and/or added. Their individual 30 day sMerit allowance also gets revised every now and then, and may increase or decrease over time.Last but not least, once the Merit System started to roll, every 2 Merits that get added to your counter generate 1 sMerit to sent to others.",

If you don't mind, I have some question that needs for clarification.. are these sMerits have expiration? at what extent? like when unused for a long time? you said they gain some sMerit when given a merit by some users, don't you think there will be an oversupply that will make merit system unbalance when tried to hoard by some users?Moreover, I really find this Merit System very interesting you know. I can feel that it has more features to unlock. How about a Donation that can be given to a certain charity institution where gain sMerit can be opt to donate that can be converted to a certain token. I know Merits are made of out of codes but you know maybe if possible the Dev can start to come up with a similar idea using this forum to work this things out of a program in the future.",

You just have to think of this merit system as something very simple, this is another requirement to help forum users rank besides activity. Some of the explanations above should give you a good understanding of the merit system, so what do you expect from the rest of the features?If indeed the forum wants to raise funds, then the best choice is bitcoin as the most decentralized coin so far.

So long as things are reasonable on a monthly basis, there is likely not much of an issue with/of people hording, as Merit Sources do quite a lot of pumping sMerits into the system. Forum members will likely make threads on Meta to alert when things are not going well in terms of sMerit flow, and that has, in the past, led to changes in Merit Source numbers and quotas, in order to pump things up a bit.Merits are kind of an equivalent to Karma and Likes on other platforms, but with more semantics and scope as I see it. They aim at pointing at posts that are interesting for some reason or other to the meriter, and it shouldn’t really have any more transcendence than that (other than being a vital part of the Ranking System and, to some extent, a soft reputation).",

Which ever way, it helps and has curbed a lot of ideas that could have gone wrong such as spamming to generate activities whole giving more jobs to moderators and shot posting in the forum to ensure you gain in on the activities that applies to certain ranks.Haven't gotten all the replies as at above, I guess the question that should puzzle any beginners mind is,How was the ranks determined before the merit syste?Well, I haven't been here before then and later joined to meet all these things in place but, information met on the forum tells me that, the activity system have been in place before the evolution of the merit system in January, 2018. Details of which you can find in the Activity & new membergroup limits for which, a grouping based system for what we call ranks now was accorded users.This in turn created a users based determined rank that could result in a shit poster just assuming ranks. Like we see in the bounty section where accounts can just keep posting POA and Bounty Reports and still could assume ranks like Hero and Legendary! It's absurd right.These are the sort of ideas that necessitates the merit system. Whole the activity system keeps you active, the merits ensures you make quality posts too and jus like that, we have a more better form and users than the single activity era. No doubt, we have users that were good then but became bettering this era for sure.",

      "body": "When merit is implemented each forum user received merits according to their rank which you can see the rank requirements thread. Those who have rank from member to full member got merits and every two merits creates 1 smerit which you can send it to whoever you think deserves it. Later on, the rank requirements is changed again which jr. member requirement is changed where it needs 1 merit to rank up instead of activities only. Merits are generated every 30 days for merit sources to reward every forum users that depends on their criteria.",
