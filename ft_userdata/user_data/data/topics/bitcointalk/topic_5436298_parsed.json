  "content": "Anyone interested in purchasing an S17 Pro?  Feel free to reach out to me via PM with an offer.  I'm shipping from in the US, so I'd like to keep to shipping in the continental US.  Some details about the machine...  It was just returned from a repair facility with documentation that it has been tested and is working.  It ships without the cables, so you will need those.  I'm looking to accept Bitcoin and can ship the same day if you so desire.  We can use escrow if you pay for it, or you can pay first and I can ship (check my trading history).  Let me know if you have any other questions.",

You asked about low power mode and I let you know it is possible. If you want to grab it for 0.02 BTC and pay for shipping, it’s yours. Just shoot me a PM with your location and we’ll see what we can work out.",

Plus, this is being sold on behalf of NastyMining so I would much prefer to have the sale done in BTC to keep things simple. It is probably time for me to explore other avenues though, so I appreciate your suggestion.",

I sent my S17Pro in for a repair and they sent me back this unit which I believe could be different. Anyway, it includes a printout showing it successfully mines at 56th/s.",

There are places that sell conversion kits for them if you wanted to try and run them on 110v, but the cost is pretty prohibitive so it would probably be cheaper and easier to just have an electrician install a 220v outlet for you to run this as is. The market is definitely in need of a high powered and competitive 110v miner option.",
