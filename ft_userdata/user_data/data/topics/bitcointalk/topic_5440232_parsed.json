And health is wealth.We realize for the health when it is gone .. So it would be great if we take care of our health - earlier the better.",

      "body": "Nature is special, there are so many natural remedies you can take to ease pain & even heal illness. Manuka honey can reduce inflammation. Natural water springs are a phenomenon, raw ginger can reduce the chances of cancers. I would much rather use things that nature brings rather than big pharma produced poison.Think about this, if you are well & never sick, how does big pharma make money? Obviously if you need major medicine/treatment like chemo then take it but for lesser ailments then try to treat yourself naturally rather than reach for a pill.",
