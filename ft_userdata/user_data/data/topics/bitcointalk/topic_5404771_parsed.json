      "body": "The private key must be protected. The seed phrase must be protected because it can generate the private key. Even after some wallets warned users to keep it (the private key or seed phrase) safe, some people still do not, but got lured to input the seed phrase on a website, be it a secure or not a secure site, the website owner can see the seed phrase and use it to steal coins on the address generated by the seed phrase.But some scam are funny but actually what is happening which people should totally avoid, this are direct scam in a way a scammer told the victim to send bitcoin to a certain address in order to receive double of the amount sent, like this one:Scam from Google Form, Crypto Donate.I still remember when I was not yet on this forum, trying to get some free bitcoin, I registered on a site that indicated bitcoin is mined for me, told me to pay half of the amount that was mined (fake mining). It was obviously a scam and such should be avoided, but though, may not be obvious to newbies.Once people are not greedy, once they learn how to avoid scam and hack, they will be able to be on the safer side.",

Seed phrase is like pin of your atm card. The moment you give your seed phrase to someone, you don't own that wallet anymore and transfer all the assets on different wallet before the hacker steals it.There are others that will say you win this huge amount from a particular giveaway then ask you to input your wallet's seed phrase on the website that they will give to claim your prize. I don't see why some people still fall for this type of scam. They don't even bother researching first if the website is even legit.",

When something like that happen where a user is ask to go to a website and ask for seed phrase then it is a scam site.

And by also not being in a hurry but taking time to read through pop ups before you click to follow any link. Most of these pop ups use words like \"emergency\", \"urgency\", words that put you under pressure and may make you not to delay or second check before taking a decision. Taking decisions in a hurry can be very risky and some may cost you a lot. If you are not sure of a pop up on your device, try to be humble enough to ask someone who has more knowledge than you rather than deciding to try it out on your own first. Newbies also need to be told that they do not necessarily need to put any details on such a website for their details as much as their seed phrase to be stolen, just merely clicking the link and visiting the website is enough for hackers to introduce a malware that can steal your seed phrase if stored on your device by itself.",

All this can be avoided when you choose a hardware wallet over a hot wallet, you are always at the edge of any security bridge and a single crack will make you lose all you have. Seed phrases are supposed to be cast on metal sheets, more often than not, a secure passphrase should be concatenated as an additional seed extension to secure it more appropriately. Don't keep your coins on any exchange or third party centralized organization like lending, always remember that your keys are your coins, if you don't have them, just know that you have no authorization to them until you make a request for withdrawals.",

I feel bad mostly for the newbie victims because this isn't just a crypto-related thing. This type of scam or phishing also happens in other industries like the banking industry where a link is being put to trick the victim into that they've done a transaction that was never authorized by the owner. So, this is the same as that and everyone just have to be aware of this tactic to avoid it.",

I think we've done all we can in terms of hand holding. I do have sympathy for those that fall for this type of mistake, but at the end of the day they know they'll be controlling their money, and they should adhere to all the warnings. The only times which these warnings aren't present is with web wallets, which unfortunately is a problem since most new users will sort of gravitate towards them.",
