If accounts that have managed to rank up to a reasonable rank can still default loan what then should we expect from a brand new account that is asking for loan without any collateral but his words that he will pay. We have seen a lot of accounts come and make such claims. Even if you are sincere about repaying back just know that the risk is too much, and you should probably look for other means to get the required money to find your project. You should also try your bank or any Physical loaning service in your country.",

If you can earn $1100 in a month on this site of yours, then there is no need to look for a loan. I really doubt the situation, someone must be an idiot to use your site for exchange.Otherwise, your site looks like children were playing and made their first web page.",

I recommend you to either provide a valid collateral if you have or find another website or an offline lender that would be willing to lend you money. Your chances of getting a loan on this forum are very low and that's why you should go search for a loan somewhere else. The lenders have already made the mistake of trusting newbies in past and they won't be repeating the mistake again.",
