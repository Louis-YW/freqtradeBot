  "content": "The reason for ban is mostly due to rule #13and plagiarism (updated: June 6, 2023 4:20AM Philippines Time)Ban appeal request for the account: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1035888Quote13. Bumps, \"updates\" are limited to once per 24 hours per thread. Bumping multiple threads at the same time is allowed if it's not annoying.The thread that I'm bumping is \"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4290632.0\" and I posted more than one updates per 24 hours resulting for the announcement thread to be bumped so that many bitcointalk users can see the thread.I was working for Solarex_ICO as a bounty manager and announcement thread moderator. At first, even though I don't know the rules for bumping, I was blindly following the rules by updating the announcement thread one post per day until I already broke the rule #13. I'm not aware that I'm already breaking the rule without being noticed until the month of May 2019 where I update too much and one day, I just saw my account banned after I logged in.It was my first time moderating an announcement thread and it was my bad where I didn't read the rules before doing some actions. If I only knew from the start, then I will comply to the rules. I'm doing updates for it to show on the first page and hoping to get some views to create a discussion with my boss answering their inquiries. With this, the discussion will continue bumping the thread without me posting too much. Unfortunately, my account got banned and what can I only do is update the spreadsheets weekly for the bounty campaign. The bounty campaign was also short-lived since there are only few people interested with the project.If ever the account was unbanned, I will now continue using this account (barlo357) and contribute some of my thoughts in this platform. After being a full-time trader for a year, there are many lessons that I've learned and make sure to utilize the forum to share my knowledge and opinions about crypto.Addressing plagiarism issue: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5455005.msg62360421#msg62360421 (updated: June 6, 2023 4:22 AM Philippines Time)",

I was almost became a victim of a scam website if it wasnt for those people that I talked on that thread. That thread was a good example to what other kind of scams out there during that time.If you disagree on the appeal, then try to find a reason why I got banned other than breaking rule 13. Clue: not on because of the loan. The bumping of a thread is the only reason I can see why the account was banned. Like I said before, it was my first time moderating a thread and merging the updates on a single post was not in my mind that time because in my perspective back then, the updates are time sensitive, so I lost my sense to follow the rule regarding bumping threads.Why finding a contribution? Does being not a nuisance in the community not enough?",

      "body": "Just to chime in on (my understanding of) ban evasion:If you get banned, it's you (as a person) that gets banned, not (only) your account. So, it doesn't matter if your account is a hand-me-down of your uncle, or if you found the credentials on a piece of paper laying on the street somewhere. If an account under your control gets banned, you (as a person) are no longer allowed to post using any other accounts for the duration of the ban. The only exception is making a new account (or using an existing account) to create a ban appeal in the meta section for discussing your ban. Everything else is considered ban evasion (which is a bannable offence).It doesn't really matter why you got banned in the first place... If you don't agree with your ban, the correct order of doing things is: using a new or existing account to create one topic in meta to appeal your ban and ONLY post in this topic whilst your ban is still active. If your ban gets reversed (and only if) you can start posting again outside meta. I got banned once for participating in a raffle in the wrong subforum, and that's exactly what i did: i stopped posting and asked for lenience from the admin since it was my first offence after years of being a member... My sentence got reduced, and i only started posting once my bantime was over.I know it looks like people don't make a big deal out of ban evasion most of the time... I don't really mind... But to my understanding (after being here close to a decade) those are the \"official\" unofficial rules.",

      "body": "Quote from: mocacinno on June 04, 2023, 10:36:28 AMJust to chime in on (my understanding of) ban evasion:If you get banned, it's you (as a person) that gets banned, not (only) your account. So, it doesn't matter if your account is a hand-me-down of your uncle, or if you found the credentials on a piece of paper laying on the street somewhere. If an account under your control gets banned, you (as a person) are no longer allowed to post using any other accounts for the duration of the ban. The only exception is making a new account (or using an existing account) to create a ban appeal in the meta section for discussing your ban. Everything else is considered ban evasion (which is a bannable offence).It doesn't really matter why you got banned in the first place... If you don't agree with your ban, the correct order of doing things is: using a new or existing account to create one topic in meta to appeal your ban and ONLY post in this topic whilst your ban is still active. If your ban gets reversed (and only if) you can start posting again outside meta. I got banned once for participating in a raffle in the wrong subforum, and that's exactly what i did: i stopped posting and asked for lenience from the admin since it was my first offence after years of being a member... My sentence got reduced, and i only started posting once my bantime was over.I know it looks like people don't make a big deal out of ban evasion most of the time... I don't really mind... But to my understanding (after being here close to a decade) those are the \"official\" unofficial rules.As if im the only one that was doing it in this forum. Have you already purge all of them? I think no. At least i was honest about having another account and willing to fix it.",

In accountSolarex_ICO I did not find any data that could point to your account. But what about the other account that you gave three merits to? Is this also a relative?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2031561How many more accounts are there that we don't know about?",

At least i was honest about having another account and willing to fix it.Did you actually read what i wrote?Here's a quote from my post:Quote from: mocacinno on June 04, 2023, 10:36:28 AM--snip--I know it looks like people don't make a big deal out of ban evasion most of the time... I don't really mind... But to my understanding (after being here close to a decade) those are the \"official\" unofficial rules.--snip--I don't care what you do, i'm not the one banning people or tracking offenders down... It just that after reading your posts, i was under the impression you thought that because the account wasn't originally created by you, you weren't evading a ban (which you are).I see people breaking the law on a daily basis (usually traffic laws). It's not because everybody is doing it that it's ok to break the law yourself... Neither am i going to stop other people from breaking laws since i'm not law enforcement. But if they would come to the forum and said: \"i was riding 90 km/h on a road where the speed limit was 70 km/h, but it wasn't my car and everybody else was doing it, so that's ok. I should have never gotten a speeding ticket\": i would never ever agree with you... Maybe the law is stupid and 90 km/h is perfectly fine at a certain spot: it doesn't matter, you still broke the (traffic) law. If you wanted to ride 90 km/h you should have petitioned the local governement to change the speed limit before going 90 km/h.",
