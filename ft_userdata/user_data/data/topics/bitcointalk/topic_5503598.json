It's like a better version of the financial system we have now. Indeed, some evil men use it but they use everything. That does not make Bitcoin bad. It's like saying a car is bad because someone used it to rob a bank. Not the car itself but the driver here.The real story is the technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain. Built for trust and security, it is a fortification. It is not a scam. Quite the reverse. And you realize what? This technology can transform the planet. Regardless of who they are or where they live, everyone can use a fair financial system we design. So, don't panic over Bitcoin. Get knowledge about it. Know it. It's not going to vanish. Here is here to stay. Furthermore, the sooner we all board, the faster we can transform the planet.",

Some of us here have at some point had our own personal opinions about bitcoin but since we decided to take the risks, here we are stuck with Bitcoin. Risk takers are not scared of trying something new and if they try and fail, they try again but with a different approach. How will people condemn what they have not even tried out before? Its really funny  how this same people are comfortable using FIAT which gets devalued every day by inflation but will see nothing good in bitcoin that offers something better.It is true,  bitcoin investment is not for the faint hearted, the weak can still hating it while the brave ones keep exploring and improving their standards of living with bitcoin.",

Bitcoin have crossed a lot of hurdle to have come this far, you don’t need to tell people to see the advantage that bitcoin entails before they should believe. Those that don’t still believe after all this signs are just haters and won’t want to see what they don’t like because of their selfish interest strive to be great. Bitcoin will always stands its ground and for those that hate it because of some misfortune they might have faced in it, it was a lesson to be more careful and know how to manage their money well because they’re the security of their own money.",

That's a normal reaction from those people who have been wronged and scammed using Bitcoin. As far as I remember, when I first heard about Bitcoin and did research to it, I was optimistic already but then when I started to mention it to my circle of friends, they all felt awkward because it might be another internet scam in the making. The comparison you've given to that gal was right, fiat or cash has always been used for scamming people—fake bank calls, credit card scam tactics, and other finance scams as well.

But that doesn't make Bitcoin a scam project or bad asset, people should embrace the potential money of the future and stop unnecessary dislike.Most people who claimed they were scammed through Bitcoin are either ignorant or untruthful. Many scammers promote altcoins deceiving people that it is Bitcoin. Many people don't know the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins, so they are easily scammed. I don't see how anyone will be scammed by buying and hodling Bitcoin in the right wallet. Another set of people who claim that they were scammed by Bitcoin are those who thought that investing in Bitcoin was a get-rich-quick scheme. They thought that it would give them instant profit within a short period. When it doesn't happen they sell their coins at lower than the cost price and claim that they have been scammed.The government and Bitcoin haters will always give any criminal activities in the crypto industry wide publicity. But fiat scam is the highest in the financial industry. The US Treasury in its 2022 National Money Laundering Risk Assessment highlights how fiat and traditional financial activities continue to be substantially higher than virtual asset use to perpetrate illicit activities. Chainalysis also observed that scams related to crypto dropped from $10.9 billion to $5.9 billion in 2022. https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chart-1-scam-rev-1024x679.png",

When people make false statements (such as that Bitcoin is a pyramid), it makes sense to correct them.

Regardless of their reasons, it comes to bitcoin there's no such thing as \"unnecessary\". The fact of the matter is that the reasons why these people hated bitcoin in the first place is quite necessary. They don't know better, they thought the scammers completely represent the whole bitcoin community. Pretty sure if you were in their shoes you will say the same thing especially if you didn't know better. You can't hate victims for hating the platform where the crime was perpetrated, that's like making fun of someone who got robbed at a back alley when they don't want to come near those anymore. You could've done better by informing them that the scammers aren't what the bitcoin community is completely made up of but instead you deepened their animosity towards us. Way to go kid. It's better to just be empathetic than call people stupid for things they don't know. You can't invalidate their opinions either cause no matter how ridiculous it might sound there is some basis as to why they stand by such beliefs. Debunk those beliefs but don't call the person a clown for believing in it.",

Scammers take advantage of investors' naivety and greed to create traps, while investors cannot control their greed and fall into the scammers' traps.

That's what the government is trying to imply to the people, so that's exactly what the people believed. Actually, anything that relates to altcoins or in general cryptocurrency will now considered as scams for those people who have no clear knowledge and understanding to bitcoin and to the crypto space. But if ever they'll be given chances to be educated and the government will not disseminate wrong information, I think people won't resort into thinking that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme.That's right, people are equating bitcoin and altcoins and thinking they are the same, thereby causing misunderstandings about bitcoin. But I don't think it's the government's fault or they are spreading it, we shouldn't blame it all on the government. This misunderstanding is due to ignorance or greed of people who invest in altcoin projects without doing any prior research. Scammers take advantage of investors' naivety and greed to create traps, while investors cannot control their greed and fall into the scammers' traps. It can be said that it all comes from human behavior, not from bitcoin, altcoin, fiat...because they are all just tools.Sooner or later, they would really be able to realize all of those things on the moment that they would really be able to experience for themselves on unfortunate conditions on which we know that when it comes to this aspect on where dealing up with crypto space would really be that vast. They'll soon realize that Bitcoin and with those shitty scam coins around and other frauds wont really be something that they couldnt be able to generalize. People do really love on generalizing everything on the moment that they will really be able to experience unfortunate situations on where this is the momentor time that they will really be making some indepth research on which this shouldnt have done this earlier but well there's nothing we can do about it if people would be having this kind of behavior.Whether we do like it or not, the main reason on why people do really get interested into dealing up with Bitcoin is just they are really that looking for easy profitson just simply holding it but due to lack of knowledge then this is the main reason why on people be lost of track and ending up with those scams and frauds.",
