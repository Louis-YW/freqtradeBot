Dubai emirates raised from grass to grace and even did it better than most developed world leading countries because they valued themselves and had taste for greatness.Dubai is an excellent example for developing countries that when leadership is honest, dedicated and visionary and believes in equal distribution of wealth any big mile stone is possible to achieve. Having huge oil reserves helps financing of development projects but if the ruling elite is corrupt then huge part of cash goes in pockets of corrupt administration through kick back and a little is spent on projects. There are many examples of oil rich counties where general public is still poor despite oil reserves and Nigeria is one of them.",

No matter how developed a country is you'll still have the poor in your midst. I come from a country where the government pay no form of attention to its citizens and it took me a while but I eventually understood that if you want to be rich in spite of a corrupt government you would.There are remarkable people in the world today who started from nothing and today they are millions without the help of any government whatsoever. Dubai is a remarkable country with so much opportunity to get rich,  if you live in Dubai and remain poor then no matter where you go, there would always be a very high probability of you will remain poor.",

Britain has it. Russia has it also, like the USA, Canada and others. But a low poverty population is what every country should struggle to keep to make it appear rich. What is happening in Dubai is what can not happen in third world Africa continent where leaders are corrupt and are stealing everything they can lay their hands on without thinking of developing the country. Selfish leadership in Africa can not make Africans smell what is happening in Dubai and that is why op is so surprised about the speed of transformation in Dubai.",

I agree with you on this, Dubai became one of the Center of attractions of the world because credible leaders with unique and unbiased mind set is ruling them, there is a popular saying that when a good leader leads the people will rejoice so the growth and rapid development you see today in Dubia is a result of good leadership.

Problem was, they elected a socialist that taxed high income earners and poured money into welfare programs ie wealth redistribution. Then oil prices crashed and they couldn't sustain their economy anymore. You need more than just oil to create a successful economy.
