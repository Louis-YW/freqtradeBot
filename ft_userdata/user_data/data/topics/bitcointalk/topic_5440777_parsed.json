  "content": "I was checking mempool for the latest transaction fee and found that only 34 blocks need to be mined to reach the 777777 blocks. It does not have any significance but it will be an event considering that block 666666 was mined 2 years ago. I assume the block 777777 will get mined today considering it only takes 10 minutes to mine a block.",
