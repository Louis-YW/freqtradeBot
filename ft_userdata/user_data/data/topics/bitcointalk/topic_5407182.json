Rather, it should be measured by how vast and deep your Bitcoin knowledge and understanding have grown since you came here. Merit and rank are shallow motivations so to speak. A newbie who remains a newbie after a year, who has only made a handful of posts, but has read a lot of discussions on various topics, made further research on them, and deeply understood them is a forum member much more motivated and better than me, a legendary, and many others with higher ranks and with more merits.",

Like others said it should not be bragged here and having motivation threads with merits display is somehow feel boastful by others. Apparently we can check other's achievement by visiting their profile to see how many merits they received from their contributions.Also the merits are being removed on the display for limited of 120days. Its just show how he did received merits constantly.A success story isnt bad but in this way its not being done properly.",

But the best thing should a newbie must do is to help his/her own to be successful because if a user has no plan to learn and gain more knowledge for sure they will remain in the bottom.

We have to as well consider some newbie not having the intention of staying, ones they got their challenges solved they remains inactive or left, so this may not necessarily be applicable to all newbies.",
