That way you won't have to obsessively follow the market to find the best time to sell it like you have to do with shitcoins since they have short pump period which are then followed by the dump. And yeah, best time to buy bitcoin is always now.Also, if you think that bitcoin might go down more (and that could be the case), you can always use DCA method.",

As said by @Rikafip above that instead of buying altcoins you should invest in bitcoin which will provide you some sort of guarantee returns if you are planning to hold long term.As we have already entered the bearish trend and prices have gone to $30k at this time with shitcoins following the trend you could invest at this time on the contrary basis.We have been down from ATH of around $68k near coinsbase listing and from then we have seen dips with some little pumps for the ants but now the volatility is High but if you have a look at the past patterns and price charts for bitcoin you will have an idea that even after losing it's 70-80% bitcoin has survived and proved that bitcoin is dead obituaries wrong so it's the best alternative for you.For some people like you some other coins might be tempting due to high returns then bitcoin but you completely ignore the fact that they are cheap and don't have huge market cap so it's easy to have more growth but on the other side billion of dollars worth of investment in bitcoin move it little high but all the world accepting it and so much growth over these years is not a joke so why fear it? You can stack sats(the lowest unit of bitcoin) with whatever amount you are willing to put in bitcoin rather than going for altcoins.There might be more dumps or not can't be said but this time you will definitely get some bitcoin at sale so grab as much you can to secure your future without wasting it on altcoins.Rest it's your personal choice where to invest but don't go for some scam projects out there and also invest what you afford to loose.",

Its gonna be hard predicting the bearish sentiment. If you are worried its gonna go down more, then do dca instead of buying at certain lows. Its gonna average your bought altcoin going down instead basef on your quantity. Its hard to suddenly buy the dip and youll expect a pump right away. It could go lower and thats unpredictable.",

Yes Knowing that the current market conditions are in a bearish phase, then I agree with your statement InsteadÂ  investing the same amount of assets on a regular basis or often called investing at the average purchase price. I think that's what we can do when the market situation is bearish.",

About the time when to buy. No one can predict the exact time but for me, every time the price drop it is always the right time to buy. Another tip is you can use the strategy available on tradingview called Stochastic RSI its also help you to decide when to buy or sell.",

You can buy that in the various positions and i do agree with your friend if there are so many uncertainties in the market and that's why you must have divided your positions into some positions that will decrease the potential for you to get rekt. I just wanna try suggest you to take a look at the market right now. You can see how volatile the market is. Im sure that if anyone is trying to buy more but they are also ended in a big loss",

Just as no one else can know, neither can you. The best you can do is estimate based on market sentiment and a set of facts that give you some sense of the wisdom of crowds. Since you are inexperienced in trading, I suggest you stay away from altcoin cryptocurrencies. They are much more volatile than bitcoin. Remember, with assets such as bitcoin, your return is almost guaranteed. But with altcoins, your return is less certain.The safest way is to only invest a portion of your net worth, preferably as a small percentage of your income. The idea is to be patient and let the market make its choices for you. Do not try to time the market by going in and out. As you are learning, patience is the best virtue.",

The bearish market is indeed making so many crypto in the market become very volatile at this moment. This is why so many people are only doing shorting or long when it was possible. The volatility has been making so many people got liquidated and you must be careful when investing in this time. it's caused by so many people are blindly not seeing what happened with the market",

Nobody really knows except for the whales. Small investors are just riding the waves of the whales. We can't time the markets. Don't even try it. If you think these prices are low enter with a small amount and double it if it gets even lower. If the markets do a U turn, then you'll make some profits. You won't make huge profits since you entered with a small amount to begin with but it is still better than nothing. Just don't be greedy and be grateful if you ever make any money.",

What we should do is wait till the market shows a good sign that we're out of the bear market. So we can invest in the market and expect a good margin of profit from price differences (buy low, sell high). Trying to catch the dips when there is no good sign on the market's recovery is the quickest way to become a long-time holder. You might eventually get out the entry price, back to where you've brought it. But your fund is wasted by sitting there frozen for a long time instead of cutting loss, which put you back to square one with less money than before. See the risk of timing wrong instead of waiting and being reactive?",
