  "content": "I just saw in a news on Telegram that President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador just announced plans to set up a Bitcoin node in every home. El Salvador under Bukele does take bitcoin adoption to next level. Now part of daily life, what a bold declaration. QuoteBuilding this infrastructure will not only strengthen Bitcoin’s decentralized network but also let citizens actively participate in the global crypto economy. We’re witnessing the blockchain becoming a key part of the country’s economy.El Salvador has already made significant strides in Bitcoin adoption, from making it a legal tender to systematically purchasing Bitcoin to reduce national debt. With favourable regulations and crypto friendly policies the country has positioned itself as home to crypto firms like Bitfinex and Tether recently announcing moving in.By decentralizing financial services, El Salvador hopes to reduce its reliance on centralized financial institutions and foster economic autonomy among its citizens. This move is a very bold one as the country continues to push the boundaries of bitcoin adoption, it will be interesting to see how this initiative unfolds and what impact it will have on the global crypto economy.It’s just a declaration until it is done! We are still waiting for the bitcoin city at the base of the conchagua volcano.",

Now setting up bitcoin node at every home in El-Salvador is another bold move I would say. Because that wouldn't bring in any profit to its citizens. There's no revenue from the node.

Maybe yes, maybe no. Though the actual issue is \"who benefits,\" right now it's a glitzy scheme that could increase crypto consumption. Is our goal expanding El Salvador's reputation as a crypto hub or helping regular people?Education, support, and user-friendly interfaces have to be part of this puzzle. It makes little sense to expose advanced technologies to people who might never experience actual benefit. Here is where legislators either leave their people wondering or accomplish something amazing: integrating decentralization into daily life. I see potential for everyday folks to sidestep traditional banking fees, maybe own their finances, maybe break free from middlemen. If there is no actual plan, though, it will turn into yet another half-finished project like that metropolis close to the volcano. Real actions must accompany bitcoin acceptance or it is to stay a headline with little influence",

And, not only from the government side but also its citizens have received many good impacts, one of which I read was news about a taxi driver in the country getting benefits and becoming rich because of the El Salvador Government Policy which allows crypto or precisely Bitcoin to be a legal means of payment.Reference :  Watcher - Bitcoin Turns Taxi Driver into Entrepreneur",

While it could be taxing forcing this to happen for every household but the benefits are there if they will look at the brighter side of it. The reason is true, this makes every single person in there to participate in the Bitcoin community and economy. This forces them to learn many aspects that are circulating with Bitcoin from nodes, to markets, to trading, to mining and understanding volatility and the security part of the Bitcoin network, etc.",

A nation of 6 million people give or take, so that means if they make enough money, they could literally just live off that without even needing to do much.We are talking about a nation that is growing enough rich thanks to crypto that, they could just have all the crypto companies in there, every big one could start their headquarters there, and we could see their tax would pay for everything, we could literally have 0% tax on salaries and such, making the nation much better.

There were also pessimistic people when Bukele started buying bitcoin and I'm sure there will be negative people when strategic reserves are set up in various countries. In a more simplified way, more nodes seem to me to be very good news. Then we can debate whether this concentration of nodes or other aspects are not as positive as they might seem at first glance. But there is one aspect that seems to me to be extremely positive for the population and that I don't see that anyone has commented on: Bukele wants to put a computer in every house, and I doubt very much that every house has a computer as of today in El Salvador.",
