      "body": "Keys are normally padded when they're generates so they'll all be 256 bit keys but some can be smaller. A quick calculation says the first 32 bits will be 0 every 4.3 billion keys (232).Wallets that use nmemonics ONLY use 256 bit seeds (the number used to generate private keys) when there are 24 words in the phrase. 12 word nmemonics are a representation of 128 bit seeds. A lot of wallets use 24 words now but there's still enough that use 12, electrum used to vary its length too between ~10-15 word nmemonics which did add a lot more variance than just 128 bits but was probably considered redundant by them as it was removed iirc (not sure if it's been reinstated yet). Regardless the size of the seed used, a hashing operation derives all of the keys so they're still 256 bit.",

[...]Sometimes the best way to understand something is to make a scaled-down version of it. Imagine a toy cryptocurrency where private keys were between 1 and 10. As long as the process that chooses your private key is unbiased, then each one is as likely to come up as another.

Toy bitcoins that make the protocol look really simple. A whole set could be built around it like LEGO. And not just protocol sets, there could also be policy (how the rest of the world interacts with bitcoin) sets as well.Maybe even make a Monopoly clone but with a decentralization theme instead of running to the bank.",

One might think that the keys from the lower range tend to be found much sooner than their counterparts further up.

But, by trying to avoid being near the beginning, you'll introduce a bias into the key selection process which will cause more security problems than it solves. I know it feels wrong, but provided you have a good source of entropy (and you know how to use it properly), then the best that you can do is to select a key at random and not worry about where it sits on the \"number line\".",

Only a small exception would come up with the idea to start counting at eg 30% of a range, or to start counting backwards, or randomly. As for the rest, I'm with you.That is true. Brute force attempts that check a range generally prioritize ranges that are likely to have more use. Due to bugs or laziness, the low end of the 256-bit range probably deserves a higher priority. If the attempt assumes that any key is equally likely, then there is no benefit to start at the beginning of the 256-bit range, but on the other hand, starting at 1 is as good as any number, so why not.Thus, most brute force attempts checking a range start at 1, making the low end of the 256-bit range more vulnerable simply because it is the range checked most often.On the other hand, since there are so many people already checking the low end, an attacker might want to choose a different range that does not have as much attention in order to avoid the competition.In the end, a randomly generated private key is extremely unlikely to be in a range that any attacker is searching, so there is no practical reason to be concerned.",
