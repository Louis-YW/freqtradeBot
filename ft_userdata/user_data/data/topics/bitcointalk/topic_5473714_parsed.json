  "content": "In the not-so-distant future, as artificial intelligence permeates most aspects of human life, the volume of digital data produced by humanity daily will increase tenfold compared to today's volumes.The future belongs to preventive medicine.Imagine an artificial intelligence system that, much like Alice or Siri, interacts with you daily, caring about your well-being and mood. It performs a complex analysis of your condition using sensors installed on your smart ring, bracelet, or even an implanted chip that continuously evaluates your blood composition. Such a neural network will be capable of early-stage detection of a wide range of diseases, providing recommendations for lifestyle adjustments, or timely suggesting visits to the necessary specialists.It's a beautiful future where IT technologies are successfully applied to significantly improve people's quality of life. However, there's a critical condition for this to happen: ensuring the absolute, uncompromising confidentiality of each person's medical data. The problem is that even a potential data leak from an AI server would almost negate its usefulness. If we take the liberty to assume that AI of the level I mentioned earlier has already been developed, trained, and is ready for deployment, confidential and personalized user data, in today's reality, cannot be reliably shielded from both server owners (e.g., Google, Amazon) and hackers and other malicious insiders of the company. The former may secretly gather user data from their servers and sell them to corporations that treat their clients differently depending on their health status, while the latter can steal this data from centralized servers for similar purposes.A reasonable solution to this complex problem today appears revolutionary, as it incorporates blockchain technologies not yet widely adopted, in combination with, though not the most innovative, fitting, and accessible technology, Intel SGX. In this technological ensemble, thousands of spontaneously distributed computational machines worldwide equipped with SGX ensure a guaranteed secure environment for running software code and round-the-clock network availability through decentralization. The Polygon blockchain provides immutability and reliable data encryption in the decentralized IPFS storage.The technology I've briefly described has been developed by the #EthernityCloud project, which invites those willing to connect their idle computational power to earn income from its operation. Naturally, the application of the proposed technology is not limited to my example, and there are many more fields where computational confidentiality is critically important than I can imagine today.I've presented this example because I'm inspired by the goal of becoming a doctor and implementing IT technologies into medicine. After spending many days studying the topics I've touched upon here, I can confidently say that this solution will work.https://ethernity.cloud/https://discord.com/invite/hmvFTDFTfchttps://twitter.com/Ethernity_cloud",
