I doubt they have the money to properly handle KYC/AML procedures.  Of course, it's an offshore company.

This is what will most likely happen, even using most likely is still an understatement because scam is what what will actually happen, if someone pays into any address given by that exchange, the money would likely be gone, not that it would even be stuck but will be spent by the people that owns the exchange and a way they scam.
