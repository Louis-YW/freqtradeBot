Trading on them has stopped completely, no one needs them, now it's just a mountain of garbage that will forever remain in the wallets of investors. With each new cycle, this figure will only increase.I know bitcoin 7 years. During that time it was indeed Bitcoin that was able to reach new highs. During this time I observed some of the coins that still survive because the creators are constantly developing or the community is constantly evolving. ETH and DOGE that I know of today still survive and have a large community.I understand this is an industry, all cryptos are currently created to take advantage. In this matter the difference is the team in charge or just the team of liars and leaving. Because currently crypto is in development and attracts many new investors in. Although I believe they offer a better advantage than the first generation coin. Quote from: Ratimov on October 12, 2022, 12:41:49 PMNever ignore bitcoin, it is good for any purpose, as a means of payment, as a storage value, as an investment, as a way to diversify. But do the shitcoins you fill your portfolios have such properties?Of course my top choice is Bitcoin, I store it some. Furthermore indeed I have some Shitcoins that I keep, but I keep it hoping to have a good future because the team is still continuing to work. Perhaps it would be better that we should take advantage of the moment of buying and leaving, there is no need to store for too long",

The issue with this is its normally picking the Sell price as the ath of the coin or token (you're not going to know what that is until it's gone).I've seen ICOs go for runs up to 3x immediately after they're listed on exchanges, just to flop back down later to zero (not sure if this is an internal attempt at manipulation from the ico team or not).Bitcoin is the best crypto so far for long term investments though thst might always change too (it's certainly most notable in press releases though and it'll probably remain the dominant coin until something is mentioned a lot more than it and for a long period of time).",

That should be the mindset, but mostly newbies fail to realize about it but still stick to altcoins because they see it more affordable than bitcoin, but never care to think if it can sustain long term profitability making. Although i’m not saying it generally, because there are still some smart newbies who stick to bitcoin first and just start to accumulate altcoins after they made profits from bitcoin.",

I got some profits from altcoins investment, but I only hold the altcoins for months. I never hold altcoins for years since many of them dropped their prices drastically and never return to their good prices again. The best strategy is to buy in the pre-sale and then sell them in the first launching listing on the exchange. If we failed to sell them in the first listing, it usually will be difficult to get a chance to make a profit.",

Investing in altcoins first in exchange for bitcoin in the future might be too risky as altcoins have lower chances to survive or sustain profits in the long term. But some have still managed to take the risk and end up profiting in the end. However, to lessen the risk especially for first time investors, focus on bitcoin first and never be tempted to buy altcoins first just because they’re way cheaper than bitcoin. Remember that if you invest for a big capital, your profits will also be as huge like 5x or 10x from your capital.",

I seriously doubt your average altcoin and bounty crowd knows what deflationary means. They could be interested in altcoins for a number of reasons. I am just going to mention two:1. Bitcoin has already been around for over a decade and people know about it. They believe there isn't that much room to make a profit. Maybe they even think bitcoin will never reach those old highs ever again. They are also not aware of market cycles. Because of that, they think it's time to find the next coin that will become the new bitcoin when it comes to returns. Filling your wallets with as many of those useless tokens is what they believe will increase their chances of getting in early before one of them explodes.2. They have no money to invest and can't buy Bitcoin. They have no other means to earn it. They don't work or have enough saved up, so they focus on what they believe is the next best thing - new unlisted tokens and altcoins. Maybe by holding those, they will amount to something in the future that can be sold or traded for bitcoin. Unfortunately, that rarely happens nowadays.",

Without a doubt, the meme project is just to keep up with the hype pump doge and make some people rich overnight. So this is used by developers who only want to make profit for the development team. The following is a quotes from the Nomics team that I took from Business2community.com about the dead project.Quote from: source: https://www.business2community.com/crypto-news/heres-the-12000-zombie-coins-that-have-ceased-trading-according-to-nomics-02555526A co-founder at Nomics, Nick Gauthier, has said that most of the zombie projects are related to meme coins, small personal projects, and short-term leveraged assets.

Reasons for existence and reasons for creation. When Bitcoin was created, the idea was to give ordinary people an alternative financial system they can use to avoid centralized control by corrupted entities. It made sense. Altcoins aren't improving on this initial idea. They are just saying, spend our coins instead and not BTC. Many don't have a reason to exist because you could just use bitcoin instead of whatever they are called and get the same results. Many projects don't even need a blockchain at all, they just want to be part of what is trendy.",
