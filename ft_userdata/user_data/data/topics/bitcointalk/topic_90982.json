Wow  This might be a reason to consider a new feature for future Bitcoin clients: the user could optionally provide a wordlist and the client should make sure that newly generated addresses contain none of the words in that list (something like an inverse vanitygen). Such a list might include only some potentially offensive/confusing terms or even be a whole dictionary to go for sure (cost of checking is negligible due to the low risk of accidental matches). In a professional environment such a feature could be quite useful (you don't want to accidentally present your customer with a payment address like 1UAss or something )",
