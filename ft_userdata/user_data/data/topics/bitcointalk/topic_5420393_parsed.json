Obviously he was the first to bring down the market when his stable coins lost it's pegged on US Dollar and the subsequent collapsed.But it seems that Sam Bankman-Fried has surpassed him to be the villain in crypto market, similar drama, he brought the market to it's knees including bitcoin and this will not sit well with his investors and for sure there will be legal ramifications because of this one. So let's see how it goes, for sure next month we will forget all about this things as the market will recover.",

If they are still winning here while a lot are already suffering because of what happened on their platform, then we can assume that he‚Äôs one of the greatest villain who only cares about their own interest. Sad to see another LUNA failed project after making a good market exposure. This will be a hard situation again for FTX and no one wants to bail them out.

With a tweet he sent, he caused dozens of people to become unemployed and suddenly caused the markets to go very badly. I used to actively use FTX until this news came out. As of today, they have started to make fiat money withdrawal transactions with a limited limit. However, withdrawals and deposits of cryptocurrencies are still suspended as they are in the process of selling binance. Its acquisition by Binance is a good thing, but the exchange's reputation has been severely damaged.",

I already posted something about that:QuoteMembers of UK Parliament have asked Binance to explain the circumstances surrounding Zhao‚Äôs November 6 tweet, and whether the company understood the potential impact it might have. Source: He has been blamed for sparking FTX‚Äôs collapse. Now CZ wants to save cryptoAnd SBF is crazy! He basically put almost everything in his FTT token, making his projects vulnerable. Of course, the question is how much did CZ contribute to the downfall of FTX itself, I'm sure he had information about what was going on, that tweet that he is selling his holdings in the FTT token... and later his \"changing mind\" about whether to take over FTX or not seems like playing cat and mouse when I think about it now.
