  "content": "The energy de very high for people wey de run bitcoin matter, sake of say next year wey be 2024 na im di next halving go happen. So di advice for everywhere inside bitcoin space now na make everybody de find money buy plenty bitcoin de hold in expectation of the coming ATH (all time high) wey we de expect to happen after the halving next year. So dis one na sure banker say bull run go de certain to happen and investors go cash in well well on dem bitcoin investments. Me sef i no wan carry last for the need to de accumulate plenty bitcoin as my power reach, so i go follow enjoy di benefits of the coming ATH. But e get some questions wey i de ask my sef about di high expectations of di ATH1. What if di ATH no  come happen after halving next year? Or e happen but di result na far bellow our expectations?2. The reason wey i de ask be say bitcoin price no too de predictable like dat, and what if di factors wey de trigger di last three halvings before di ATH no come happen as we expect? Like many buyers de pursue to buy fewer bitcoin for market?3. I know say during halving wey new bitcoin de cut in half wey go affect miners reward, bitcoin go de scarce, and price suppose go high. What if buyers no de willing to buy at dat high price, how sellers go take sell dem bitcoin and accumulate di plenty profits?4. As we know say from di creation of bitcoin, di price de appreciate de go high, so we no go fit to totally rule out di possibility of dat kind scenario, wey price fit to high reach certain extent after halving, wey go fit discourage buyers from  buying plenty bitcoin I de very optimistic about di expected ATH after halving, but i no fit help but wonder about di possibilities wey i mentioned above. So wetin in una think?",

In fact e dey be like say this next year own go make sense because bitcoin self no gree drop unlike before by this time price go don dey come down but this one e still dey push up small small. Person wey no fit buy btc make the person try buy better altcoins at least top coins go still follow btc bull. So if na to DCA now e go still help to gather the coin small small. If person buy 10,000 own every two weeks from now till at least February for person wey no too hold cash, that will obviously help or you gather 100k put now because I think say we fit leave this price range anytime.",

Or e happen but di result na far bellow our expectations?Na him make dem talk day make we always dey lower our expectations so dat we no go feel discouraged if we no hit our target plan wey we dey expect after halving. Me now, I no too dey expect much because d market dey very unpredictable, my own be say if my savings go increase pass d way I put am initially in a considerable range, I no mind make I take my profit like dat. Too much Expectations dey always lead to disappointment dats why I dey always avoid am.Quote2. The reason wey i de ask be say bitcoin price no too de predictable like dat, and what if di factors wey de trigger di last three halvings before di ATH no come happen as we expect? Like many buyers de pursue to buy fewer bitcoin for market?E no fit possible like dat ahbi you see and sign say something like dat go happen for dis upcoming halving? If you dey follow d market we’ll, by now you suppose don know say many big investors dey put plenty of their money inside bitcoin now and was invest big time like oda ones wey don benefit from am, dis kind whale investors na him dey among d tinz wey dey trigger thee price of bitcoin to reach new ATH after bull run.Quote3. I know say during halving wey new bitcoin de cut in half wey go affect miners reward, bitcoin go de scarce, and price suppose go high. What if buyers no de willing to buy at dat high price, how sellers go take sell dem bitcoin and accumulate di plenty profits?Anybody wey don buy before dis current price now, don already get some profit on top their investment already. Dey no get time wey dem no go get buyers and dem no go get sellers too, everything na base on demand and supply. I dey sure say d price of bitcoin in d future no go stop people from stoping to buy it but rather d increase for price wey e get, na him go make more people wan invest in am.",

I just purposely start dis thread and state di small disadvantages wey I fit to think of, make I for take see di reactions about how our members for dis forum go take react, so i reason say if di reactions de positive e go join boost my morale to invest di small money wey i don put aside. Reason be say me I de relatively new for bitcoin matter, so i wan to an extent make i rely on di opinions of more experienced members, because money matter no be Small thing, so person suppose shine im eyes before im go put plenty money for inside any investments. I hope say as we don predict am na so e go be, so after halving na massive ATH with bull run way go raise di dust of plenty profits for investors to cash in.",

Knowing that Bitcoin is a volatile asset with a market movement that is not controlled by anybody, it is not wise to put all your plans on the Bitcoin investment, so that if the price doesn't do as you have speculated, you will still have other assets to fall back on, but that doesn't mean that the Bitcoin investment will not still give an ATH better than the previous one. All in all, I know that the Bitcoin ATH in this coming bull market will definitely surpass the previous ATH, and whoever is buying now will surely make some profit.",

So di same thing carry me reason say normally and all things being equal if di price of bitcoin continue to de increase, say e fit reach a point wey di increase go discourage investors to buy and all of a sudden price go dump very deep. But you don give me beta assurance for your analysis say as di price de increase, e no go affect di demand for bitcoin, because people go still continue to de need am for hodling and trading purposes.Just quoting you now i come realize say wetin go help say make price no crash or dump be di scarcity wey de happen for halving wey new bitcoin de cut in half, dis bitcoin scarcity go still help maintain di high demand, wey  despite di high price for ATH demand go still de high to balance di equilibrium. Meaning say scarcity + high demand = increase in price.",
