  "content": "The price of Bitcoin often stayed between 22k and 25k for a long time.  But since then the price has been much lower.  Nowadays many people are afraid to invest.  Bitcoin market is down now so now is the right time to convert stubble Stable coins to bitcoins.  Bitcoin price is now at $20,404 and Bitcoin price is likely to move lower.Reasons for the current cryptocurrency market downturn: The closure of the US Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) caused Bitcoin prices to fall overnight.  SVB, the US lender to startups, announced on Wednesday that it will sell shares worth $225 million to strengthen its balance sheet.  One of their announcements spread among the bank's victimized customers and created panic among customers and investors.  Then as the share price drops by more than half, customers are more likely to withdraw their money.  Due to this, the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) bank was closed.I had a small amount of stubble Stable coins that I turned into bitcoins.  This is the last chance that Bitcoin price will continue to improve in the future.  If everyone takes advantage of this opportunity, the chances of Bitcoin price going up are very high.",

That's why hoarding BTC is really a good strategy since the value will surely hit more than the ATH in the future. And as I analyze it with my personal technical analysis, BTC might go down more than $17k if the support level area will be broken.  I highly suggest not exchanging stablecoins right away but waiting for the right time when the market will are recovering from the bear trend.",

Bitcoin already tested the $15k+ price and seriously I don't think Bitcoin might be falling to that point again even though as you said, this is just my thinking too  looking at it from this chat except for something unusual happens.  I do think this is the mistake people will usually make while missing out on getting Bitcoin at a better price hoping it will continue to go down.",

Perhaps you didn't get in the right grammatic usage. You called for stablecoins to be exchanged for Bitcoin but on the other hand you're saying \"Bitcoin price is likely to move lower.\" I don't know why that ambivalence is.However don't think now is a last chance to get in. I know you're saying it in the light that now affords us a better lower entry point but we can't be sure it's. Price can still go down but what is certain is that price will still soar more than what it's now. Anyone interested in Bitcoin should buy whenever they can and not think much of their entry levels, especially if they're going to hodl.",

Nothing to be sure that Bitcoin won't fall back to $16k again in future. Remember the market is in bearish phase and likely in accumulation phase.

From my perspective its now someone needs to buy Bitcoin as its decreasing in value,  because its acceptable to purchase Bitcoin when the price is getting low so that when it appreciate you will make a little profit, but not in a situation whereby Bitcoin have no life and you advice people to convert their stables that has live to bitcoin that's downgrading.",

It is the same reason pegging a fiat to another will end up the same way even when enforced by the State (if you check history, behind hyperinflation there is always a pegging). The so called \"volatile\" price of Bitcoin is a honest market price, as shown in the long term graphs, its a steady climb. The people who don't understand fail to realize fiat is a descent (by design, infinite emission).So it either breaks because their reserve was too low, because someone played with the reserves, because code failed to react to external events or data came \"too late\", etc. Pegging always breaks sooner or later, you are simply being blindfolded from the truth, just like a PPS pool...There are too many elements that can make a peg break, and they all do sooner or later. So its best to not peg in the first place. To add insult to injury, almost none of those \"stable\" coins are \"tokens\", meaning they don't even have their own blockchain to begin with. It is hilarious that some even peg against each other so things like Luna occur.You could argue it was not Circle's fault the bank they choose to put their reserves failed. Of course they can fail, they do fractional reserve. Guess who also does fractional reserve? That's right, Circle. None of the badly called \"stable\" tokens do 1:1 and even if they did, the other external factors (like in this case, a bank failing) could hit them regardless.Do you trust your bank? Why trust these? Don't trust, verify: Bitcoin. P2P electronic cash, no banks, no exchanges, no State. Its not a mere asset...",

Personally, I don't see any signals that bitcoin will go above $20-22k range in the close future.
