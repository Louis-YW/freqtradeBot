But thinking of huge Ai projects would be agix, but since it did pump a lot already I might need to cancel my plan of purchasing it or at least wait for it to have a lower price. I dont want to fomo cause surely it will burn me to the ground once the market crashes again.",

It's important to note that investing in any project carries risk, including AI projects. While AI has the potential to transform industries and create significant value, there are also challenges and uncertainties surrounding the development and implementation of AI technologies. Therefore, it's important to do your own research and due diligence before investing in any project.That being said, some factors that investors may want to consider when evaluating AI projects include the technology's potential impact on the industry, the quality of the development team, the level of adoption and interest from other investors, and the overall market trends.",

None of them, artificial intelligence doesn't need a blockchain nor i can't find any solution that would benefit it and not just make it bulky and unnecessary.If you want to buy because of the hype, by all means do that as you can make money just by investing into memes too, but don't kid yourself it will be a real product. Very few projects benefit from any kind of blockchain based incentives.",

Not familiar with AI that much, and my question is AI a cryptocurrency that works with a blockchain technology?I see the hype with ChatGPT but upon reading more details about it, it confirms that they are not crypto and they serve a different purpose so I'm quiet hesitant to join the hype because I know there's still a risk with AI and its too early to get hyped.",

I've got but I haven't done my research yet for each of them or if I did, they're just little efforts. And that's why I'm not going to give that list because if someone believes in it and it turns out that project turns into a dump, I might be blamed or someone's investment might get crapped out of that opinion. I do agree with some insights here that AI is still on the phase of being questionable if it'll be at its best together with blockchain and crypto.",

I'm starting to see hype about this trend, and things look perfect for some speculative deals. Although I don't really spend a lot of time doing research in this area, I do have a project that I've been observing for quite some time, anyway they're pretty interesting in concept, and the actual product is having a lot of fun. also very good.If you've ever heard of it:https://www.coinecko.com/en/coins/bostromEven oraichain I only see quite mediocre in terms of product potential, perhaps next time we will see the trend of AI being spread even more.",

While it's possible that people have been quite fomo following this trend lately, it's fair to say it's actually a potential area for many developers to take advantage of.The crypto sector also sees the combination of many complex technology fields, so as long as they can be applied, I believe and the opportunity to succeed is great.Before that FET was also one of the cryptos that I have followed for a long time, and wondering why its valuation is so low given the potential it has, even when it is close to $1, I still think it is much lower. self-expectations.",

But I am sure it will gradually become a big trend in this market, basically if you missed it, don't worry about it, because ETH BNB is always a good choice for investment. .",
