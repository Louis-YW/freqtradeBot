      "body": "You would elaborate your services like explaining everything in detail for people to know that you a good hand work and if is possible showcase some of the works you have done for us to see and not just a mere saying from your mouth that you are app and wallet developer. Where is the evidence to show that you are wallet app developer. When you are advertising your services at least you have to make it clear with images if possibleÂ  and with that it will look legit and not this one sentence with telegram link.
