  "content": "Greetings my fellow Naija people. I don't know why some people are still falling into the traps of those people that will call you for phone or meet you one on one and introduce fake decentralized investment, that if you invest #100,000 you will get #200,000 within a week. Someone came to share with me that there is a BTC investment one of his neighbor introduced to him, that when he invest on it through him , my friend will get double profit from it but the minimum anyone can start with is #500,000 above, that the numbers of people they want in that BTC investment is almost complete, that he came to seek advice from me if such decentralized investment is real. But I told my friend to run alway from them, that those guys are scammers and they don't have any knowledge about BTC investment. Did I give him a good advice ? What is your advice to such person.",

The scammer can request you of OTP sent to you as sms, which they can use to scam you by taking over your account, like bank account to withdraw yorj money. I have received such calls before and most are OTP scam used to access your bank account. It is possible to use it to access crypto exchange accounts too, but all such calls that I have received before are related to naira scam.There are some that are through text messages too. The one that I noticed which is bitcoin or crypto scam are Whatsapp messages. I do not wait to report such messages which also result to complete blocking of such account for further annoying scam messages. The WhatsApp scam attempt messages from unknown people was common on my WhatsApp last year and beginning if this year. But they have nothing to receive from me because it is easy to spot them as scam.No matter where the scam is coming from and the tactics the scammers are using, they are easy to know and avoid, but some people are ignorant and greedy about scam.Bitcoin is an asset, you can hold it and wait for the price to appreciate and earn from it, instead of depending on people to hold for you which may result to scam. If you find out, the people they depend on for the HYIP investment are unknownn to them and no how to trace them.",

What is your advice to such person.You actually did a good job O.P by saving your friend from falling victim to such heartless scammers, because that's how they go about using the name Bitcoin to scam innocent newbies, creating a bad image about Bitcoin, as who ever fall victim will start seeing anything bitcoin related as a scam, which is ought not to be that way. However, whoever that will fall victim to such scam must be a greedy person, because greed is the only reason why anyone will fall victim to such this 2023, after everything MMM & Twinkas did to us many years ago, because imagine a person asking you to invest #500,000 to get double in 1week, isn't common sense supposed to tell you that this is likely to be a scam. But some will allow greed blindfold there eyes and later after falling victim, blame their village people for it.So let's not get tired to always be our brothers keeper, and eh for really make sense @ O.P if to say you been fit ask that your friend about the name of that website, so that other newbies here go fit see say they be scam and avoid them.",

It is just very unfortunate that there will always be greedy people like this for scammers to work on. No matter how much the existence of this kind of scam is talked about, people will always fall victims whenever a new well packaged one is started because the people behind these scams know how to always make it enticing and not like the other one that just failed. Funny enough, even well knowledgeable individuals can still fall victim depending on how organised and packaged the scammers make it to be.I personally avoid any scheme that tell me to invest and get a ridiculous ROI in a very short timeframe, I also avoid any scheme that tells me to invest and bring two other people to invest under me.",

What is mostly affecting our people is to become rich overnight without them thinking twice or having to know the sources of the site whether is a fake website or not, all they want is just for them to invest and get their profits in returns of 2 weeks or a months. Come to think of it, which investment platform would give you 100 percent in returned without them stressing for the money, naturally I will like called it big eye or open eyes to have wanting to invest and receive such payback in return. Lemme join @Charles-Tim to say they are greedy to have wanting to invest 500k to receive 100% payback in few days or so.",

Or giving your coins to another third party in the name of an investment platform that is 100% scam,Â  the most annoying part is the spread of fake Ponzi that promises investors up to 300% profits returns within the shortest time some time say 24 hours.",

Omo, I'm happy you were there to advise him not to go ahead oh, because this just reminds me of what happened yesterday when I went to FCMB bank to go make small complain about small P.O.S withdrawal error wey dey been debit me and not credit the p.o.s agent, and right before me, an elderly man came to make complain about a debit he got when he didn't withdraw any fund, and later we got to understand that it was scammers who called him and told him is a lucky winner of 1miionn naira, that all he has to do is that in few minutes time a code will be sent to him, that they will call him back, he tells them the code so that they can use the code to activate the 1million naire into his account and he fell for it. And in few minutes time instead of him to receive a credit alert, he got a debit alert of all the funds he had in his account. So painfulSo abeg, it seems your friend needs to be familiar with the recent update scammers use to scam people of their funds",

I remember what happened with mmm many people were paying the debt until today, and all of it was due to greed and nothing else people are becoming wiser now. I receive a lot of notifications on Telegram about Bitcoin investments, and they often start showing screenshots of how they have benefited from the investments, all na scam.",

Normally, the young in Naija only know much about crypto investment and trading, it's quite unfortunate that our fathers would just put in money when they don't even know the difference between dex and cex exchange or investment platform, they may even withdraw out the funds in Fiat and send it to whoever referred them without even knowing how to purchase off P2P.I wouldn't blame anybody because the life is all about trial and error, you can't be strong in this crypto space if you haven't been scammed in any way, so that makes you strong and experienced untill you learn out the good way about crypto investment.",

First, where should that sum of 100% profit that I would earn within a short period of time come from? The second question is, if you are giving me 100% profit in just a week, then what would be their own profit, or are they really making 200% profit in a week? That kind of big interest is even enough to give you a red flag that it is a scam. There is no aspect of earning money that is so easy to the extent of generating 100% in a week, but people sometimes sell their real sense for greedy interest in situations like that.",
