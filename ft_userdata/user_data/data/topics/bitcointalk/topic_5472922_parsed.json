  "content": "Hello, guys! I thinks everyone knows what is courtsiding - when you go to the stadium, to any sport, and make bets from there, trying to make a bet faster than bookmaker will update the odds.I have been working as a scout for two years now in a company that provides data for bookmakers (in Scandinavia, in the north). In some countries I have been to all the football and hockey arenas.I can dictate (3 years of experience) to you matches from arenas where there are no scouts (the bookmaker updates the quotes by taking information from the person who is watching the broadcast from the office). There are arenas with old equipment, and due to this, a delay in data transmission is created. These are the arenas I ride in.My price is 125 EUR from a person (I can accept almost any crypto), and I want to take 5-6 persons maximum, so companies will not cancel your bets. Delay is more than 7 seconds (up to 12).PS I am interested to work with professionals, who knows how to bet and how does it work. I will not write here my contacts, you can contact me in PM and we will discuss it.PPS You can ask me everything here and I will explain",

      "body": "I'm very much inclined to believe that OP is lying and probably doesn't know what he is talking about. A 7 to 12 second window of opportunity would make this method very detectable and hence any bookie that respects himself would flag this really fast and null the bet winning and ban the account... So unless OP has an unknown method to make this past a bookmaker's detection, doesn't sound like a system that would work.

Sorry, but you even did not try, you have never worked with me, but are saying that I am lying. About to be trusted - I have nothing asked in advance, have I had? You can try and if you will like it - you pay. These is a good one time offer for anyone \"who\" tend to think and other speculation.",

      "body": "When I looked at this type of proposal I thought about the following: why would people pay 125 euros for someone else to give them this type of tips when these types of schemes also do not guarantee 100% success. In my opinion, it would be good if people didn't pay anyone and took the money they have and played with that money. This is because in addition to this method not being a 100% guarantee of correct bets, gambling should not be seen as a place to make profits, people start looking for strange methods to get around the harsh reality that the house always wins, and In this search for this contour and to be able to profit, the only thing that people can obtain are huge losses and they become frustrated and addicted.If OP has this scheme which in my opinion could be something that is against the casinos TOS and for that reason people shouldn't use it, then why does OP need other people's money? Why is OP taking the risk of exposing his scheme when he could keep quiet and use it without anyone knowing? my theory or assumption is that op probably used this scheme but didn't make any profit. Therefore, he realized that he would not be able to profit from betting, but he could profit from the money that people would pay for the scheme. This is just like the courses that guys who consider themselves professional bettors sell. in other words, we are faced with those cases of selling dreamsAnother thing that shocks me is with these two posts made by these two accounts that have only made one post since they were created, honestly it's very strange that a person created an account just to make a very short post showing interest in this method, I was wondering : how did these guys know about this thread? Well, these are things that shock me. I hope these two guys don't come back here complaining later, of course that's if they really are customers and they are two people, because with so many lying people and fake accounts, it's hard to believe certain things",

You have “probably”, “possibly” in almost every paragraph. You have a bookmaker’s avatar - you understand everything perfectly. After several such bets, the site will increase the reception timing and will not be able to do anything else.Why don't I bet from arenas? Because it’s difficult to switch “buttons” and follow the match, plus I’m a scout and betting isn’t really allowed. If you are so sure, why are you against the “test”? You don't lose anything. Here's why - you just don't want people to do this at the bookmaker's office, which you yourself advertise.Detto890 - write your telegram",

This is an honest question without any sarcastic intent.The only possible way that I knew this is effective is when the match is already over yet bookmaker still open some bets due to the delay for the result. Aside from this, the minimal change on odds is what I think possible whenever a team made a score within that delay span.Afaik, Casino is very vigilant on betting like this since your client will have a pattern on what match and when to bet. There’s a chance of being connected to each other especially if they are winning together frequently. Your limit of customers is really a nice idea.",

This is an honest question without any sarcastic intent.Bookmakers have contracts with scouting services. Not all cities have scouts, and then the odds are made by a person who sits in the office and watches the video broadcast of this game.I know arenas where the protocols are old and the equipment is not the newest either. Thus, when a team scores a goal, you will have from 7 to 12 seconds to place a bet until the bookmaker’s line closes.",
