      "body": "This is like going to a coffee shop forum and asking if their business is making them any money, if everyone was honest enough you would hear all kinds of answers, one will say they got rich in 2 years, someone else will tell you they have been making coffee for 5 years and have yet to ROI their espresso machine, another one will tell you his story of losing his house for the loan he took to open his business, all of them could be valid answers.The same thing applies to mining, there are many different factors involved, your power rate, capital, is it a loan or your own money? capacity? the distance between your house and the nearest neighbor, do you come from a country that's friendly to Russia and enjoys cheap gas and oil or are your country's gas reserves running out and they are going to double up on the power prices? you might think I am joking, but I am dead serious, all the factors mentioned above are critical in determining a successful mining business vs a dead one.I can't possibly list all the things you need to consider, but if you provide as much information as you can, the answers you get will be more likely to be accurate.",

Because Solo mining if you're at the pool you're getting rewards of course based on your hash rate shares sent to the pool every time the pool finds a bluff you're solo mining you're not getting any rewards at all until you single-handedly that block and at that point, you do get the full block reward all bonus rewards.It's like a lottery ticket or it's like a gamble as well. And what I can suggest here is solo mining on Ethereum.",

      "body": "Solo mining these days need hard luck on your end to be able to find a block because you will need a lot of capital to either set up your own pool with a huge mining setup or go with the flow and give highest hashrate to a pool which is already finding too many blocks. The second one is worth going for because pools are giants, so fighting against a giant whale and trying to win as a small fish will only keep you defeated for long because even if you go for chances, there comes the luck factor that even if it shows that you will get a block mined in a year or so, it will be based on the luck of your mining equipment.",

It will all depend on the cost per watts you have in your country and there you make an evaluation. Don't think the profits will be immediate. Don't invest too much money in a machine for now, try to buy an economical one and be patient.",
