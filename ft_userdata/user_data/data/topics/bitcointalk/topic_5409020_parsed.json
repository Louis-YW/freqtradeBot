Some time ago I asked for people's most hated shitcoin and from a neutral perspective, Tron and Ripple are awful Shitcoins: It's a very good read: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5334708.msg56918275#msg56918275But directly after my question, a scammer appeared and defended Tron AND Ripple! Of course, he could not offer any arguments.  Interestingly, more scammers appeared and defended Tron and Ripple. Tron and Ripple are scammer's choice!

Tron is technically very weak because what does it have to compete against ETH? TRON is just good marketing for a crappy coin and it will dye slowly. Quote from: crwth on August 07, 2022, 06:04:58 PMSo what do you think about BTC since you are saying that Tron is an ancient coin already?Bitcoin is a very proven coin since it was invented by Mr. Satoshi. Bitcoin has received top reviews by leading, professional coders, while Tron is very negatively rated by experienced coders. Bitcoin has proven to be an excellent coin.",

If tron is as bad as you describe am pretty sure investors would have dumped it long ago. If they are holding it, it's because it is profitable for them otherwise nobody is forced to hold against their will.Once they don't find it to be profitable anymore you will be surprise how they will exit the project.",

It has nothing to do with love and hate because it is not a matter of feelings. I did not start about love and hate, I make my decisions based on facts. In neutral reviews, Tron has reached a very weak score because Justin Sun is not a good coder like Vitalik Buterin from Ethereum or Emin Gun Sirer from Avalanche.

But when I look at tron from a broader perspective, I honestly don't think of leaving it. When I try to make my transfers between exchanges in USDT with other cryptocurrencies, I pay too much commission and it goes later. But when I transfer as tron and tusd, my transactions are processed quickly and I pay very cheap transaction fees. As long as it continues like this, tron usage will definitely not decrease.this is actually one of the advantages of the tron network. comparing the fees of USDT(tron) to other USDT networks, is very cheap. also, the transfer of trx from one platform to another is cheap and fast. it is actually good for payment system. so i don't think people will abandon Tron as it has its own advantages. other currencies running under tron has similar advantage, the cheap fees. and traders want this aspect. so yeah, i don't think people will abandon it.",

It's not going too high, but it's not going too deep either! I am using it for years and I still do... it's interesting! Especially for us who actually use crypto and move it from place to place, cheap and fast transactions always win in the end!",

There are tokens that are using the Tron network and all I can say is that it's useful for those folks that are using it for a cheaper fee when the network is too clogged that causing the fee to be high.We've seen those times that the network is having traffic that makes the transaction fee to be high as well. That's why everyone has looked for a cheap alternative that has also the same token from a different network and some tokens have their share on the Tron network.I'm talking about the Tron network.",

Though I don't have any of this coin but knowing it belonged to the top 20 coins of the CMC you can think that it was valuable and many investors have given their support to this project. If you suffer losses from investing this, then just keep it yourself rather than spreading misinformation as it was not reasonable to say it was a bad coin unless it was a scam (which is not).",
