Send a PM with forum link and another with an external link. The PM containing external link will display the warning to the receiver.",

The only warning I knew is this one:You aren't using the forum PM system a huge, or maybe you didn't receive a such PM for a while. It has been there for a quite long time now, I noticed that on April 2022. It must be there prior to my post. I'm not surprised that you didn't notice. AI fact  Edit- Once again, AI fact.
