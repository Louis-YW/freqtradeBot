  "content": "It's been a hot topic these days that the collapsed exchange Mt. Gox will begin paying back thousands of users in a few days.  I am in no way saying that getting hacked is good but considering the current situation of the victims who are supposed to receive the refund, they would be gaining more than 10,000x% profit[1].  The fund being hacked, recovered and locked for about 10 years made these victims unable to move their funds, and the recovery and refund resulted in a huge profit.  If the exchange was not hacked, many of these people could have sold their BTC at worth less than $1000 and they should not have gained this huge amount of profit when they received their refund.Bitcoin was around $600 when the exchange shuttered.  And now the price soar for more than 100x as the refund is about to be executed.  I am happy for these people, all their stress, worries and patience had been fully rewarded.  I hope the refund process will not put too much stress on the Bitcoin market since $9B worth of coins will be unloaded to the market and this is not a small amount.With this thing happening, I believe the Mt. Gox hack after the authority recovered the fund became a blessing in disguise for victims who exercise patience. Your thought?Btw, I read that the disbursement is a mixture of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, Does the victim have a claim on the Bitcoin cash equivalent of their Bitcoin when Bitcoin was forked?

Of course creditors are pleased with Mtgox's responsible efforts - however, many of them postponed all their wishes as long as the Mtgox case was not resolved. They should all be grateful because behind this hacking incident there is a lesson to be learned.Selling pressure may be around for a while - but I don't think everyone will put the coin into the market. Some creditors are experienced users - they will hold and capitalize on the next bull cycle, while others will sell and earn the profit.",

Many of these people might have one time in the past be in dire need of their funds to maybe cater for some emergency issues but couldn’t have got it solved, most might have even lost a thing because they couldn’t get access to their funds which no matter the return later is definitely not good enough to me. Also the recovery of Mt.Gotx funds Shouldn’t give users the leverage to start using exchanges and save their funds there, the return was just a luck that might not happen again. As for the market pressure during the period of distribution, I will vote for a negative sentiment because I believe the news will be circulating round about sells going to happen and this could only create FUD among investors and we all know it leads to bearish sentiments. But this wouldn’t last for a long and the market will bounce back again",

I'm sure that many suffered a lot of mental damage because of the hack, and they've been waiting for such a long time.That being said, it might be bad news for the market because a lot of those people will likely want to cash out immediately, considering what they've been through. Billions of dollars worth of BTC being cashed out can have a significant negative impact on the price. Of course, it can then recover in a few months, but we should get mentally prepared for this.",

Maybe the victims were lucky, because the hackers weren't competent enough. Anyway, this is like someone stealing the money in your bank account and you get them back after 10 years of waiting. In the case with Bitcoin, you get 100x of what you have initially invested, but I definitely wouldn't call this \"a blessing in disguise\".",

Some might have outlived and never got the chance to get their money back and they are going to be paid in a fraction from what they have lost. And those who lost money here has been battling their sanity for the rest of the ordeal as some of them have their life saving on Mt. Gox prior to the hack. If there is something from the Mt. Gox is that is remains as the skeleton in the closet for some of us here. And maybe they are no longer active here because of what had happen and few only remains to see that finally, they will get something in return.",

To much drama created its because to many people doubt if what Mt.gox saying is true. That's why there's a lot of doubts or anything if they can still get their money back from them. I understand that there are people sell their claims since this is the only option they can get since at least they can get something from their claims then move on. If I am the one who experience that maybe I will also sell my claims then move on since the pressure I can get from those incident maybe not worth it since as we heard from certain news spreading some claimant already died without getting something that's why its better to take action than getting unnecessary stress.If this hacking incident maybe a blessing as disguise for existing victims which have strong belief that they can get something then I guess they deserve that since imagine their experience for sure they suffer for devastating loss and that gives so much stress for them. Hopefully this refund would really happen since to many people really want to get their money back from Mt.gox.",

But we shouldn't fail to acknowledge the fact that some of these victims might not be alive to enjoy these refunds because they are dead. Others suffered from health problems because of the shock and frustration of not accessing their investment. Some people invested with their retirement benefits while others might have used borrowed money to invest. The pain and frustration they went through over the years cannot be equated to financial benefit.  Mt.

Because over the past 10 years, the victims have had to endure so many hardships and humiliations, some even lost their lives because of this, how can it be called a blessing? I don't deny that Mt.gox has returned BTC and many people are making profits based on the current bitcoin price and maybe it is the profit that many people dream of. But is that worth it and enough to compensate those who have waited for the past 10 years? And in those 10 years, just because of the collapse of Mt.gox, many people lost their homes, many people lost their families, lost their futures and even lost their lives. Is the compensation now worth it and considered a blessing? If someone thinks this is a blessing, it means they agree and support the idea that exchanges should continue to collapse as Mt.gox did.Not to mention I'm wondering, how many victims of that year's incident are still following the incident and know about this news, and how many people have received the bitcoins refunded by Mt.gox. Personally, I don't believe in the numbers they give in the near future.",
