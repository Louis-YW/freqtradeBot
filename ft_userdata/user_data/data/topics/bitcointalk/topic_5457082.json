      "body": "Is your Asic miner going to be left in the open air for it to be struck by lightning? You can say it is possible it'll hit through the roof or window, but it isn't likely to happen. Your Asic miner should be kept in the mining farm or surely in a location or room with a roof. There are different ways your Asic can get damaged, like when there is bad ventilation where it is kept or you fail to invest in maintenance, but the issue of lightning striking your Asic is very unlikely and a non-issue in my honest opinion.",

Something useful and worth keeping in case you have a faulty miner in future? If the Asic miner is literally struck by lightning, it will obviously be destroyed and can no longer be used for sure, of course if it is struck by lightning, it is possible that it will be completely destroyed. Now if there is just a strong lightning and the Asic miner is not hit, there may be a problem with its life span and its operation.And it is also possible to have short circuits in the miner which can be the cause of damage. Apart from this, it can also happen that its internal components are damaged too.",

      "body": "ASIC miners needs a professional electrician to ensure the quality of the grounding, especially if your area has a lot of lightning strikes.Simple tests are done by making sure that miner does not touch any metal shelves or the Ethernet interface by setting the multimeter to 220 volts and then placing the test wire of the multimeter on the mining device to the adjacent surface and making sure that there is no voltage.",
