  "content": "A shocking amount of Bitcoin wallets are built such that they forfeit your privacy at step 1 by sharing your addresses with third party servers.  No matter how carefully you label your UTXOs and track your spending, common ownership clusters are revealed simply from the synchronization process.  This article covers the historical attempt to solve light wallet privacy (BIP37 bloom filters) that failed, and the prevailing solution (BIP157/158 compact block filters) for those who have hardware or bandwidth limitations that exclude usage of a full node: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/why-bitcoin-wallets-need-block-filtersCombining compact block filtering with Tor and selectively disconnecting from peers after block download requests prevents any efforts to recombine this data into a traceable wallet history.",
