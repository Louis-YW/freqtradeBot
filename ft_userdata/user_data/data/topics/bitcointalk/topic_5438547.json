The way of making fool people was the same like using promo codes and getting a huge amount of balance.So this is a very popular way of scamming people. Just follow a thing that if any platform asks for making a deposit to make a withdraw, 99% platform are scams. So don't fall into this trap. Don't be greedy.",

But the truth is once you buy from them your account get locked and you lose your money",

Although it's risky you did well by going further so they will be exposed if you did not do this the report is not complete and we will not know how they implement their method of scamming the big reminder here is no exchange will offer that huge amount of money, its not been done before and there are other ways to verify your account like signing and verifying the wallet, the method of sending a specific amount to prove ownership has been proven to be scammer's method.",

There have been many entries in my Discord about this old school fraud, even more than dozens that I know, they always say I won a giveaway and have to claim with the code even with a random email without confirmation of verification so in essence they want us to deposit with the lure of being able to withdraw everything given balance, all of these were classic traps until a few years ago.We have to ignore this and it's impossible to win a giveaway that doesn't make sense, moreover we don't do any work, I'm only giving advice to beginners around me about this problem to stay away and obviously this is 100% fraud",

But they're modifying this technique over time, because once exposed, another one is ready to use! The website is already down which is good news, so no new crypto users will fall prey to scams at least on this website.
