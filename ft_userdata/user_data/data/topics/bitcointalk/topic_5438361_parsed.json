  "content": "Hello everyone. I hope that I have opened the subject in the right place. Friends, the biggest earthquake in history happened in Turkey which is the country I live in. And unfortunately we have got the information that thousands of people have died. As the time goes on we see the affect of the natural disaster more. We see cities literally falling to pieces completely. We still can't reach our acquaintances living in the area although there have been many hours passed.Besides people in the area have to deal with the freezing cold now. Therefore I think we can start an aid campaign on the forum to help the people in the area to get blankets, food and tents at least.Some shots from the earthquake area...https://www.hizliresim.com/qf9aol4https://www.hizliresim.com/hlj82fnhttps://www.hizliresim.com/7iq9hkmThe moment of a building falling down A mother whose children are trapped in the wreckage is calling for help The final situation of the citizens who have got out of a dispensary",

Local people of Turkeys are also helping¬† as replied here some members which is positive movement and And support must be extended. I recommend OP or any most Reputed member(Resident of affected area) to open thread like this in Services section to help Turkeys. We will support as much as we can. Turkey's President Tayyab Erdogan has appealed to the united nation for help. I think they should open the doors for Btc users to donate like Ukraine did in war.",

More than 6,000 buildings have been damaged and this is only the detectable number. I estimate that 200 to 300 thousand people are under the rubble with a simple calculation.Directly distributing the donation is not possible because of roads are damaged and It's very hard to going earthquake zone at the moment. Turkish charity platform Ahbap will share crypto deposit addresses today. It's community based so no trust problems. Well known Turkish NFT artist Refik Anadol shared an ethereum wallet for donations. He will exchange the money and send to AFAD and Ahbap.QuoteDear friends, ETH wallet to support people in earthquake region. This funds will help so much for people under massive challenges in the most cold days. Hope we can gather together a strong support in web3 community!

After this, there is no longer any point for anyone to collect donations personally, so if you want to help earthquake victims in Turkey, you can make your donations comfortably to the following address.\"https://twitter.com/haluklevent/status/1622913175409623041*BEP20 Wallet Address:*0xB67705398fEd380a1CE02e77095fed64f8aCe463",

Although it's only for BEP20 transactions more than 100k USD was raised already in less than 40 minutes. Because of the limitations I mentioned they created this address with special permission from MASAK. We also made a suggestion to open a Bitcoin wallet. If it's accepted, we will share that address here.",
