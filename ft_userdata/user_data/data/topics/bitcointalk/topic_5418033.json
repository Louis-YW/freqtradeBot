With the online tools that there are for self-learning, if you do a higher training module in computer science and continue training yourself, you can get a job without going to university because in that sector there is a high demand, and what matters to them is that you know how to perform the required tasks.Not all sectors are the same and having a degree is still important, but much less important than 100 years ago when the only way to learn was to physically go to university. But, well, that the university is expensive and that there is a lot of employment, I understand that these are the main factors. If I'm going to have to go into debt almost for life to study a 4 year degree that I don't know if I'm going to finish and yet I can start earning good money now, the equation is clear.",

You can obtain liberal arts degrees that will cost up to 100k USD in total tuition fees and the institution will happily take a naive 18 year old's money because they aren't the ones cosigning on the loans. The institutions will stick around, they're more than comfortable with collecting payment plus interest over a period of 25 years.Hopefully with less supply of college applicants, the price will come down. No reason to be paying the inflated prices that currently exist.",

In terms of career growth, university graduates will generally also have bigger opportunities than mere high school graduates. Although it is expensive, it will probably be worth it, that is, if you don't want to end up taking blue-collar jobs. Anyway, at least there's a balance between expensive university degrees and a strong labor market in the US. It would be a dread when expensive university degrees are coupled with lack of job opportunities. And that's exactly what's happening in my country. Now, the government is asking companies to hire more senior high school graduates. But why would they do that when college graduates abound. Why would I hire a high school graduate as a store cashier if I can hire a college graduate for it with the same minimum compensation?",

The knowledge part I feel the universities still offers them because an indept knowledge of a particular course gain at a college or uni is far greater when you drop off only at high school. People with degrees offer much more (in terms of knowledge) than those of high school.Monetary aspect of it is comparing the money earns after college to the fees spent in acquiring it. Tuition fees are expensive and many work places are paying fees ment for high school graduates. Once a college graduate gets tired of being jobless he picks up those low paying jobs.In my country here people have developed the culture of getting both degree and acquiring a skill because after graduation/convocation from university you don't need to be on a pressure to pick those low jobs. Moreover the skill+ degree gets you a high paying jobs in various companies here",

Students want to make money rather than finish college because some of them believe that they could earn the same or higher than those who have finished college as long as they acquire the skills needed to be qualified for a certain job. They are just being practical since we're in the midst of an inflation crisis. Our focus is to survive and earn to afford to live. Even tuition fees have increased due to inflation so some students can't afford especially those who have been badly affected by the pandemic. It's just a good thing that there are already lots of opportunities being offered to those who don't have a college degree.",

Because today many young people have a fairly broad mind where they think that the cost of going to college is quite expensive while the knowledge they get can be easily accessed on the internet. Today seeking knowledge is not as difficult as it used to be when we have to take it in private and public universities because the internet is still not accessed by the lower classes and I think a bachelor's degree before 2000 still has a good value. But now skills can be accessed and developed if you have the internet anything can be searched easily if you want. As of now, content creators don't need to work in companies anymore because they create jobs they love, and not a few of them don't come from people who have degrees.",

People began to learn diverse skills online and these skills were indeed beneficial because high-paying jobs were available. Before it was: go to school, earn a degree and get a job. But Covid-`19 broke that orientation. It became glaring that degrees are worthless without skills but skills are useful even without a degree. Now people prefer to go for the skills and not degrees because universities and colleges are more expensive than these skills acquisition centers or organizations. My colleague in my place of work resigned because the online skills he acquired during the pandemic session gave him a high-paying job that pays him 6 times higher than the job we got with our degrees. And the beauty of his new job is that he works for 4 hours, while I have to work for 7 hours. Yeah, university degrees are not bad, but why go to school to learn sometimes outdated skills, when you can always access the a highly needed labor market after a few months of training?",

In some countries some course of study is no longer relevant or in use, maybe they can only be teachers and how many graduates can the classroom occupy but in all those countries the human life and to safe life is important and very needed so that is why the health field is more needed in people to work all over the world. In Canada health workers are in need, Australia, Uk, USA, China all the countries even remote countries, the health workers have jobs to do. Another area for course of study that graduates get job is in technology but not very many.This is a sign going on that leadership and government has failed and people taking to survive by their own struggle and not what government can provide for them to work. People now finding help in online business, gambling is increasing, trading are all part of the jobs people don't do in the past but now no job so they can't stay hungry.

It's unsurprising in a way, because we all see the ridiculously high prices that these college and universities have been squeezing out of youngsters for year after year. Saddling a young mind with such enormous amounts of debt can be crippling and debilitating at one of the most critical times of their life. We're asking them to take in vast amounts of knowledge while at the same time burdening them with vast amounts of debt when in many cases they might have barely seen a few thousand in their bank accounts. I can understand why many would prefer to take a more apprentice and hands on style of learning, which might actually be more beneficial for the companies who often end up molding these youngsters into the workplace anyway.",

Nowadays only a few students are chasing for degrees in Science, Tech, Economics, and other such field that pays highly but also gets you into a pile of debt in the academe. Meanwhile labor jobs are on the rise because the number of people that are skilled enough to do the job are declining, hence why the field is slowly booming again and getting a lot of heads turning due to the increase in pay and a lot of jobs ready to be taken.",
