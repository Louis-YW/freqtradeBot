Also, people how have that mindset on women and money may have other problems which interfere with their love life, they may not even realize until somehow improving their economical situation and yet finding their road to a fulfilling relationship to be uphill.",

Why do you need to study woman? Of what purpose will that be? You have to understand that some of these women related issues are natural and depends on how it is presented to you as an individual. Or have you not seen a situation where a wealthy man goes after a lady but she keeps rejecting the overture but rather choose a \"poor guy\" perhaps she will be happier with the poor person and sees potential with him whereas some ladies will immediately fall for any wealthy man, that is why I believe it is different for different people.Another point is the issue of making money. Sometimes it is destiny and not the amount of effort, strength or mussels you have. But money is good, it helps t sustain the human life in all ramifications.",

And there's also the safety need which includes personal security, employment, resource,  health & property. Now one has to secure these needs before taking the next step forward which is the need for love and belonging which includes; friendship, intimacy,  family, sense of connection  which of course includes romance.   In a situation where the man doesn't possess these needs  as stated in  Maslow's hierarchy of needs. It's highly probable that he'd find it easy to cope with romance involved whereas he'd be literally fighting for his life. \"Money before Romance\". It's only logical to fend for yourself before you do for others as it logical to love yourself before you share some love. In an era like this, affection can be monetary, but then again... love is blind.",

      "body": "Romance is unimaginable without money, the main tool of romance. Romance and money are substitutes for each otherThat's why you need to know the strategy of earning money before having romance, because only after earning money, the topic of romance will be created in the mindAs the saying goes, the full moon in the land of hunger is like scorched bread. That's right, because if there's no money, there's no romance.The pre-condition of the word romance is that you have to adopt different strategies to earn money and save the money properly, then it will be seen that a beautiful desire will be created in the mind and from this beautiful desire, Thrill would be the origin of the word We understand romance in today's society when men mean women and women mean hanging out with men, chatting, getting together, etc. These are known as part of romance in today's society, but if you want to do them, the price of money Need money is the key here No money, no good dreams, no good happiness, no good atmosphere, just no more, that's why when money comes, romance will fill your heart, everything around you will feel exciting and everything you see will feel exciting.No one appreciates people without money Money helps people to reach good places Many people say many words that without money I will be by your side but at the end of the day no one is by your side without money and your own Close people also drift away, and the word romance does just the opposite The word romance is suitable for different classes of people in different ways To the youth, romance means beautiful women, parties, attending various events, etc., but their main tool is money We can think of money as a soldier and romance as a victory, just as a war cannot be won without a soldier, romance is impossible without money.In the end I can say that money can not give everything to people, but it can give a lot of things to survive in life with the environment, but money has to be earned first through various efforts then in your mind.That's why you have to do romance without Roman people can't live well Romance helps people to live well healthy normally and helps to create good work Men can come and say there is no money there is nothing world Who will not value a good beautiful wife to have good money is what our society wants, so we should earn money properly and think about romance.

Romance and money are two entirely different things. Romance is a shared emotion you generate with a partner [spouse], whereas your money is related to the asset you now possess. Romance and money are significant since they bring happiness and fulfilment, but it's also important to strike a balance and avoid letting the quest of money overtake us. Therefore, while learning about money and finances is vital, spending judicious time to develop meaningful relationships and savouring the romantic side of life is just as crucial.Don't forget, despite the significant roles that both money and women play in our lives, people are not items or commodities that can be bought or controlled.",

Money is not the basis if one can have a partner in life because romance is not only limited to rich people. Therefore, even a man is poor he can still find a romance, the one who can accept you regardless of your situation. Isn't it good that you found each other while you're not financially stable?
