When user spends from either, balance will be deducted simultaneously from both networks, so original amount remains same. No conversion involved. This should avoid congestion as people will use LN as it has cents fee. What do you think? Any good?",

Lightning Network is for small transactions because it is less secured than Bitcoin network (on-chain) and you should never let transaction fee affects your decision for where you store your bitcoin.Safety for your bitcoin first, transaction fee can be considered later because you don't have need to move your bitcoin every day, hence you can choose good time to move it with cheap fee.",

      "body": "Mirroring balances and ensuring simultaneous deduction across both networks would require significant changes to how these networks operate and interact.The security model of the Bitcoin network is different from that of LN so it would introduce new security concerns. To elaborate further: A key aspect to consider is the impact on Bitcoins decentralization and security model. Bitcoins security is underpinned by its decentralized nature and the robustness of its blockchain. Introducing a system where transactions and balances are interdependent with another network like LN could complicate this model potentially introducing vulnerabilities or centralizing aspects that are currently avoided.A seamless interface between those networks would require significant changes to their protocols. I get your point but imo this would never happen because it violates the principles of Bitcoin.",

When you need to send a payment to an on-chain address it will do a submarine swap to transfer those funds. That’s about as close as you can get to the idea you’re proposing.",

However this can't be used to save fees since centralized exchange has a fixed withdrawal fee.If you talk about centralized exchange withdrawal, just check that Binance withdrawal fees are fixed but not the same for every blockchain. Recently, Binance implemented the lightning network, which I consider to be only a Bitcoin chain after the main net. The rest chains like ERC-20, BEP-20, or BEP2 are just altcoins. They charge different withdrawal charges for different chains, and the Lightning network is most cheapest among those chains. The mainnet withdrawal charges a 0.0002 BTC fixed fee for the withdrawals, but the lightning network charge is 0.000001 which is around $0.04 at this moment.",

This is because it would require a real-time synchronization mechanism between the two, which currently doesn't exist.LN operates with a different set of rules and processes designed to be lightweight and fast, while the Bitcoin blockchain provides a more robust and secure record of transactions.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on November 10, 2023, 09:07:25 AMThis is what I currently understand, but like I said before, I will still need to study this topic to understand better how the lightening network truly functions. The LN operates quite differently from the main Bitcoin blockchain. It is a \"layer 2\" protocol, meaning it sits on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and provides a different way to transact. LN transactions happen off-chain in private channels between parties.These transactions are not immediately recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. They are settled later in bulk to reduce transaction fees and congestion.Understanding how LN channels are opened and closed and how they interact with the main blockchain will give you a clearer picture of how balances and transactions are managed across these two layers.",

When user spends from either, balance will be deducted simultaneously from both networks, so original amount remains same. No conversion involved. Non-custodial Bitcoin wallets don't actually store a balance.  There's no ledger inside the wallet keeping track of how much bitcoin you have.  Instead, your wallet calculates the balance by looking at the blockchain and adding up all the Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) associated with your wallet addresses.   So you can't just deduct some bitcoin from your wallet balance without making an on-chain transaction to spend some UTXOs.  The balance is just a calculation, not a real thing stored in the wallet itself and  to spend bitcoin, your wallet has to create a transaction sending some UTXOs to a new address on the blockchain.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on November 10, 2023, 09:07:25 AMif some one should have the supposed 1 bitcoin in his or her wallet, and open a LN which I believe should be connected to the same wallet, the balance from appears as the same, and which ever network the individual decides to spend his or her bitcoin from, the transaction will be recorded on both networks, which will also make both balance reflects accordingly.No. That's not how the Lightning Network works.",

What the op is saying cannot work, if tx's are not broadcasted on-chain, they cannot reflect on the mainnet. It is either you use LN which is a layer 2 solution or you use the main network.",
