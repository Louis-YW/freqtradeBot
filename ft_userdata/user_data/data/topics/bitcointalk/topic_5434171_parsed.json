For better security, you can use passphrase along with it, but backup the passphrase in a different location.

The steps he should have taken include not using a terrible OS like Windows and ending up with a device full of malware, not installing spyware software such as Google Chrome, and not using a hot wallet in the first place. If you install any hot wallet on an insecure machine, then your funds are at risk.You can use Electrum safely by setting it up as a cold wallet or as a multi-sig wallet, or you can use a hardware wallet instead. But if you are going to use it as a hot wallet, then it can only ever be as secure as the device it is installed on, which in this case was not secure at all.Quote from: mk4 on January 11, 2023, 02:23:19 PMI don't got why like a huge majority of bitcoin/crypto holders wouldn't just buy a Ledger/Trezor.

But nooo, most people wouldn't want to pay a measly <$100 for security.Yeah, they find it hassle to purchase a hardware wallet because they think that it's not worth it and the price is too much. It's the easiest and yet one of the strongest way to protect your assets. At the same time, being aware of the typical ways of keeping your wallet still has to be monitored on how you browse with the use of your computer. If someone can't purchase a hardware wallet but has got some spare device or laptop or desktop, use that as your personal wallet for which you'll not do anything about it except using it as a wallet and at most time, it's disconnected to the web.",

Having such a hot wallet on a computer that is used to download torrents, pirated software and visit pornographic websites is a perfect recipe for some kind of disaster to happen. Regardless of one's financial situation, one must find a way to protect oneself as much as possible from all online threats, even if it means that one has to give up some of the habits one had until then.A good AV is not something that guarantees 100% security, but it is one of the important things if you use Windows OS, because it will prevent most viruses and malware from infecting your computer, thus protecting your crypto wallet.",

It may be hard for some people too. But people should care for their money, if they can not buy a hardware wallet, cold storage is still the safest way. A process used for making wallet on airgapped device can easily be used to setup HD paper wallet which is simpler if compared with single key paper wallet.
