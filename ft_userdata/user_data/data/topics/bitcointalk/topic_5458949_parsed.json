It's not about having contrary view and opinion, how you present your view is what led to this lengthy banter. We can disagree to agree or otherwise but it should be done politely. I would advise you to be civil in approaching to issues because it tells a lot about your personality. In fact, how you attained Hero rank is questionable with this your character.You erred already and you should succumb and accept correction rather than trying to justify your action. You presented your opinion in a harsh and rude manner which is uncalled for. You can do better mate.",

So anyone that is interested in signature campaign updates can put the link above on notification. So anytime there are open slot, you will get notification as people post about it.Second, some people see this not good because people from other boards and English boards may see it as a way that Nigerians do not joke with campaigns. @knowngunmanIt would be good if you lock this thread.

E get one opinion wey go cause unrest and e get some wey go make everybody agree to your point. As the higher rank members wey una be una suppose to dey guide and encourage us upcoming members and no be to dey discourage and rubbish our efforts. After all, we dey together.That idea of Telegram or WhatsApp is a very good one but some problems go dey base on say some people including myself no dey active on telegram like that and I no dey sure whether that WhatsApp own go dey OK to some people base on security protocol. WhatsApp go show everybody number for group and I believe say some people go like maintain anonymity. Telegram go take care of that since one can hide the number from public. E go make sense make we get either of that two. You be my brother oh, because for the fact say we all from the same country 9ja we are all brothers & sisters for this forum, but eh get wetin you go bring and we go tell you \"CAPITAL NO\" and eh get some wey you go bring and we go embrace am wella, and that shouldn't discourage you, because if you feel discouraged, then that means you aren't ready for the journey of life, as no be everybody go always agree to what we say, but our ability to stand strong and keep pushing is what makes men successful in life. So thank God at least you were able to see reasons with me why I said having such discussion on \"Telegram channels or WhatsApp group\" for really make sense than having it here, as you fit drop message now & in few seconds everybody go just receive notification and people wey dey interested go just apply sharperly- sharperly, unlike here wey if you just drop am now, if person never visit the local board, eh no go know say such update don come on board.So no feel discouraged my guy, as we are all here to carry each other alone.",

D way people dey condemn am no make sense at all, make person put effort just to make Impact on the local board and everybody come dey condemn am like that, if the post no too dey okay, dey get reasonable way wey dem go talk am. With the way people dey talk now, you think say e go encourage am to create another thread for dis local board again? Any thread wey anybody create, make we dey try encourage d person, if we dey discourage people then everybody go come dey run from d local board. Wetin be d use say person go take time create thread you go come dey talk say Wetin d person do no make sense at all, and most people wey dey talk all dis rubbish no dey create thread for local board na only comment dem dey do. Abeg make we dey try appreciate peoples effort even if Wetin dem do no too go well.Make we allow the matter slide and move on.
