Those were available for $0 + $0 shipping within the US. Also, there was a limit of 1 mag per person. (maybe that's why they have set limits to the physical locations too)Hopefully, someone will be able to find a lost/forgotten/hidden pile of a few dozen magazines somewhere...",

I am keeping one for myself and going to be setting up an auction for the 5 copies on this forum soon. Since the demand seems pretty high I think this would be the best way to give users on this forum a fair shot at obtaining one. The copies I obtained were free, but just know any sats spent on the auction will be going towards an engagement ring I have to purchase soon as I plan on proposing to my girlfriend in 2024. It was also kinda a bitch walking around NYC for hours in the rain today lol.Best,BTCOVERFIATS",
