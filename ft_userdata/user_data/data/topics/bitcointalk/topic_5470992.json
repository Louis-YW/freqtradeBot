  "content": "As we all know, the Gambling Board is one of the most active boards in the forum. However, some members may be wondering why they aren't receiving merits. My guess is that merit sources may struggle to review the numerous posts and topics due to the high volume, and some threads are quite generic, with answers that can easily be found through quick research. We don't discourage posting, but there should be limitations on how long a thread can stay active. This should be based on the judgment of the moderators because when a topic remains active for an extended period with redundant answers, it can turn into a spam thread.In my opinion, the most relevant topics are related to sports betting. Updates are frequent, and members are eager to discuss matters concerning their betting decisions. Some of the active threads in this board are as follows: 2023 NBA Season   NBA 2023-2024 betting   NFL Sportsbet.io discussion & predications thread  Tennis League All Thread And many more. I have a suggestion: I'd like posters to create specific threads for individual games. For instance, today there are six NBA games happening, and if there are posters who want to share their insights, they could create a dedicated thread for each game. In these threads, they can include statistics, betting predictions, and any information that can help members who subscribe to that particular thread stay informed about how the poster's predictions are unfolding. This approach would keep the conversations organized and prevent them from becoming cluttered, unlike general discussion threads where it can be hard to follow the discussion's path.While some might view this as creating duplicate threads, I believe it would make the discussions more relevant and keep the threads cleaner since they would be topic-specific. I'd appreciate your insights on this idea and any suggestions on how to improve the board further, given that we can't prevent posters from making posts there, especially since many of our signature campaigns are likely gambling-related, and their rules require members to make a minimum number of posts to get paid.For the active campaign, we can see in  Overview of Bitcointalk Signature-Ad Campaigns By my count, 17 out of the 28 total active signature campaigns are associated with casino platforms, which means that 60% of these campaigns focus their posts on the gambling section. Without taking necessary actions to address this issue, the Gambling Board may be flooded with redundant posts, or in other words, spam.",

      "body": "Ahh this seems like a very bad idea, to be honest. Imagine In a game of football where club matches for each countries league are nothing less than 7 matches each week (some twice a week). With Almost more than 7 league games discussed on the gambling boards that’s like at least 50 threads a week just for football games. The likes of NBA, Rugby and the rest have their own games too so the number will definitely be more than 100 in a week only. This will greatly increase the scam because someone that could have just discussed more than one game he is interested in a single post will have to write them in 4 or more threads. The suggestion only thing would have been a moderator but right now even that is not visible at all because I can’t see how a moderator will work it out there. If we also suggest thread created there should include moderation by OP it won’t still be a great idea because it is sports and most people do not agree with each other and you know why happens to post that OP who moderates it doesn’t agree with, you just sees a counter thread created from it. Igebotz, also brought up some interesting suggestions on how to reduce the spam there but certainly it has gotten out of hand that I think you just can’t. The only way is when gambling signatures do not just exist again which is not possible. So I doubt any other proper solution",

They focus on current events, and there's no way an article or AI would be of much help for their responses. I'm specifically referring to generic threads like \"How to stop gambling addiction?\"",

I believe, based on my observation, that this has been happening on the forum for a while. Not just in basketball, but in the realm of boxing sports as well. You see, there are long threads dedicated to boxing speculations. However, when a new fight is scheduled, a new thread is created specifically for that bout. This makes it easier to follow the latest developments, including the latest news, rumors, and updates on betting odds.Let's not only consider the forum rules but also take into account the perception of the gamblers. I believe that sports betting enthusiasts and responsible forum users would better understand the sentiment expressed in my post.",

Therefore, I find it to be a major concern that needs to be addressed.The title implies like you wanna stop all the spam on the Gambling board.  But I don't really get how making more topics is gonna fix that.  Absolutely, it was my intention, and this is just my suggestion, so I'm seeking input on its viability. As I explained, even though the topic itself isn't spam, it can sometimes turn into a mega thread, which in some people's eyes might resemble a spam thread. So my suggestion is to divide the topic. For instance, if I open a discussion about a specific match-up or game, that topic might only remain interesting for a day or even less, as after the game, it's no longer a subject of discussion unless someone is trying to make spam posts. However, as mentioned, the OP could lock the thread to prevent this from happening.The problem with mega threads is that when you're trying to follow a particular discussion, you might lose track of it due to the sheer number of posts in one thread.For example, in the context of the NBA, if there are 10 games on a given day, everyone will be discussing these 10 games mixed together. Some might only focus on the more popular games, so those interested in betting on every game and seeking insights from other posters might not find the information they're looking for. It's hard to get noticed or get answers in a fast-moving mega thread. Just think about how many posts are created in an hour in a mega thread; it can be challenging to find the information you need. With dedicated threads for each game or match-up, it becomes more organized and easier to access relevant information.Moreover, in dedicated threads, it's simpler to detect and report spammers because it's easy to spot if a certain user is spamming in a thread with only a few replies.Quote from: FatFork on October 20, 2023, 10:03:16 AMPlus, someone said the spammers are all part of gambling signature campaigns.  but you responded to the comment that the campaign managers know it's a problem here and they wont put up with the spammers in their campaigns. No, not all of them are not spammers, they just looked like spammers because they tend to post on mega threads due to limited threads being created. Solutions is suggested above.",

They can create new threads and post but it won't make their posts are better in quality.Managers judge post quality and count it for payment, it's their works.Not only this, but do you think posts get merit are always better than posts don't get merits.

And why do you think that those who would be active in those boardsd would actually talk about odds and other gambling related stuff instead just sharing their usual stuff? I suggest it to make a test: pick some popular football (or any other sport) game this weekend and make a thread about it and see what happens. Addiotionally, make it a self-moderated so you can delete all the posts not actually related to gambling and let us know how many posts were there? Your suggestion would maybe make sense if every sport had its board (realisctially, even then it would be a problem) but with the current state on Gambling Board, it would be a total mess to have new thread for every game. The only way to solve gambling board spam is for managers to be way more strict when counting posts there, but since there's more spots in gambling signature campaigns than gambling posters who know what they are talking about, result is what we have at the moment.",

The merit sources always try to find good posts which they can send some smerits and it's a quite difficult task for a human to view each post in a mega-thread.

We were thinking of casinos that were opening campaigns and where posts would be the most helpful for them.

I think because of these requirements, users feel in a rush to make posts in the gambling sections, but they pay no attention to if they are doing it correctly. Then, while posting a new topic in the wrong section, they make the post and do not participate in the discussion. Managers need to crack down on the spam. Remove members that 1. cannot post in the correct section and 2. make a new topic and abandon it. I might also think the requirement of posting in gambling sections needs to be rethought.
