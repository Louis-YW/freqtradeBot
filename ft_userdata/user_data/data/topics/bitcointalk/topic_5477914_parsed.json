  "content": "Hello, my dear Community Members, I started using ELECTRUM wallet on Dec.13, 2023 and therefore I have very little knowledge of how it works! Someone has recovered 1.3 BTC of my funds after my crypto account in Hong Kong was hacked a few years ago - and said it was sent to my ELECTRUM wallet using the BTC address I gave him for the Electrum Request. He also told me that I need to deposit/send $5000 BTC (about 10% of the BTC funds he sent) to my Electrum wallet - to show HISTORY in my wallet BEFORE my funds can be verified by Electrum and PAID into my account (and Request Status to change from UNPAID to verified?). Is that correct, or is he trying to fool me and keep my recovered funds for himself?",

No wallet or exchange would ever ask you to send such a ridiculous amount of money (or any amount really) to \"verify\" your account. I'm guessing whatever Electrum wallet you are using was not downloaded from Google play or from the official site either? https://electrum.org/",

      "body": "LolI believe you might have come across all these online scammers who promise to help recover a lost fund in your wallet or any crypto account, but one thing that you have to ask yourself is: if they actually help you recover that money, why didn't they use money from the BTC recovered to pay the fee they are requesting you to pay??  It's just a total scam, as they want to use your lost funds to scam you more and more, and no payment is ever needed for you to view a deposit in your wallet. Everything happens in the blockchain, and if truly there is money in that wallet, you can see it yourself from blockchain Explorer.",

If it is your electrum wallet you can verify the ownership via signing a message so no need to deposit any dime into it.TX status should be either unconfirmed or 'x' confirmations which means the wallet you are using is not an actual electrum, get rid of it ASAP.",

Once a transaction is sent to your address even if it is not yet confirmed you will still see the same unconfirmed transaction in the wallet. So if it is sent you must see it. I hope he doesn’t have the keys or seed phrase to that address this one that he asks you to send some funds there. I will even advise you to ditch that entire wallet and create another one by yourself.",

There is no way he could be able to recover that, and he still needs $5k from you. Their wallet was never recovered in the first place, and I also don't think you have any wallets from the past, as what I think you had back then might have been an account with a centralised platform. Just don't send anything to anyone; Sending money to him will make you the fool he wants you to be, so it's better you avoid him entirely before you get fooled.",

I believe the person you are talking to is just a social media scammer and i know for sure you have never met him or her in real life. There is no such thing about viewing your history before anyone can send you any bitcoin to your electrum wallet. It just a strategy to scam you. If he or she has the fund recovered he should be able to take a the service fee from the recovered funds. And how the heck can someone recover a 1.3 Bitcoin for you without your present or never seen you before imagine the the amount it worths now so it can never be real. Don't fall victim.",

Did you contact him and ask for help to recover your BTC and deal with a 10% fee?Did he send the recovered BTC to your Electrum wallet?Check carefully you should be able to see the transaction under the Electrum history tab.If you see a transaction and it's not confirmed yet with a very low fee don't send him the 10% fee yet until the transaction has 3 confirmations because he can cancel the transaction and send it back to his wallet while it's not confirmed yet.Most scammers do this to make it look legit be careful not to send BTC except if it was confirmed and if you can able to send these funds to your new wallet.",

What's the difference anyway?If you go to \"Receive\" tab and create a request, you can be sure that you haven't given that address to someone else before. This is useful for protecting your privacy. With using the \"Receive\", you can also set an expiry time for your request and add a description. In this way, you can know which address you gave to whom and whether the payment has been made before the deadline or not.",

I believe it is a scam but the advise is for you to check Bitcoin transaction generally and help you to avoid scam in future.Irreversible transactions",

What's the difference anyway?Firstly, the 'Address' tab isn't displayed by default so the 'Receive' tab is necessary to request for unused addresses of your wallet by default.Your question only arises once a user enabled the tab due to curiosity or specific purpose.Here's some perks of using the 'Receive' tab:Aside from tracking purposes as already mentioned, it can generate \"Bitcoin URI\" which contains the amount and description that's supported by some wallets.Another is it's for lightning invoice, Electrum isn't just for on-chain transaction but supports lightning as well.It also provides some functionality that can only be done in the console via command like generating addresses beyond the gap limit;In the Receive tab, you can generate address past the gap limit if you need more than 20 unused address.",

It’s impossible to recover lost bitcoins or in your case stolen bitcoins. I know it’s hard to let go of such a huge amount of money but that person is only trying to scam you. Also he doesn’t have your 1.3btc. If he did, why would he hand them over to you? I have so many questions; How did you come about this person who’s an expert in recovery? And what wallet were you before that got hacked? Did you check your wallet address on blockchain to see where the bitcoins were moved to?Your story reminds me of  this thread that was posted some days ago, I guess this is the latest tactic used by scammers to swindle their victims.",
