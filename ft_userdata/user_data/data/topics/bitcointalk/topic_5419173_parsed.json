If you want to use Ledger with an Android wallet, you will need a different one.I use Mycelium exactly because Electrum for Android doesn't work with HW. But there may be other better alternatives too (I think that BlueWallet is one of them)",

It looks like ledger have released their own app for handling the device though (called ledger live) I'd check on their website too though just in case there's help with installation or tutorials on features: https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live",

Quote from: Charles-Tim on November 02, 2022, 12:45:00 PMCan Ledger Nano make use of QR code to sign PSBT? I don't think ledger can do that (but I am not sure), and even if it could it probably wouldn't be compatible with Electrum QR code format.",

It can also work with wallets that make use of SD card like Coldcard.The Trezor T also has a slot for a MicroSD card, but I've never tried that. As far as I know, its function is still limited to encrypting the PIN.Quote from: https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/issues/49#issuecomment-691073231Right now, you can sign PSBT via HWI with both Trezor One and Model T. We will add PSBT signing via SD-card, but there are things with more priority (like native hardware Coinjoin, etc.) on our list first.Quote from: Charles-Tim on November 02, 2022, 12:45:00 PMCan Ledger Nano make use of QR code to sign PSBT? As far as I know, Ledger Nano or Nano X cannot use the QR code to sign PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions) because there is no such feature in Ledger.Quote from: https://privacypros.io/ledger/nano-x-review/The biggest feature missing from the Nano X is support for PSBT (or â€˜Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions).",
