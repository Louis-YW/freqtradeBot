  "content": "A group of researchers carried out a test to investigate the randomness of fair coin flips. They collected 350,757 coin flips, recorded the results, and concluded that when a person tosses a coin in the air, it has about a 51% probability of landing on the same side it started. This same-side bias varies and is different from person to person. Some have almost none or very little bias, while others display a more significant bias.The researchers believe the bias comes from the rotations and wobbliness of the coin, which causes it to land on the same side more often than not.They posted this data in support of their hypothesis:QuotePr(same side) = 0.508, 95% credible interval (CI) [0.506, 0.509], BF same-side bias = 2364Their research also confirmed that the coin is equally likely to land on both heads and tails if those were the starting positions (the side that was up). They didn't record a bias that one side is more likely to end on the same side than the other.QuotePr(heads) = 0.500, 95% CI [0.498, 0.502], BF heads-tails bias = 0.183  They carried out the test with 48 people who used 46 different coins and denominations. The total number of coin flips was 350,757. The results show 178,078 landings on the same side.The researchers did mention a concern they had. The people who participated in the test were aware of the main hypothesis they were testing. With that in mind, manipulations or attempts to manipulate the results to either prove or disapprove the theory are possible.The source also mentions the scope of this same-side bias in a betting scenario.If you bet $1 on the result of a coin toss to get $2 if you predict correctly or lose the $1 if you predict wrong, you would earn an average of $19 after 1000 coin flips. But knowing the starting position of the coin is essential.Could these findings lower the security of seeds generated from coin tosses, considering that the starting positions of the coins aren't known to a third party?I remember that o_e_l_e_o recommended using von Neumann's unbiased coin flipping algorithm in a similar discussion from a few weeks ago. One more reason to use this algorithm if coin tossing is your system of generating seeds.   Sources used:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04153.pdfhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04153",

      "body": "From quantum physic's perspective, all the coin flips are landing on both sides at the same time, but who really decides which one of the outcomes become our reality?A simpler example, in fall seasons usually trees lose their leaves, is it really random when they drop one by one whilst there are infinite possibilities of when they drop down, land where and on which side exactly.?  Just use a secure random generator, ignore tossing coins, and don't reuse addresses.We control absolutely nothing, we are just given options to choose from.",

The advantage and house edge is greater for roulette where the casino would profit more long-term. But blackjack is known as the casino game with the lowest house edge. Coin toss has nothing to do with casino's house edge and odds, because they are using computer entropy to generate the random numbers that in turn determine the results. It's not affected by any gravitational bias - although some people do point out that heat conditions around the CPU's random number generator(s) might have a slight impact - but that can be mitigated by also using a software RNG like OpenSSL's.",

But at least last page of research paper mention all kinds of coins used.At a quick look they were all coins. I was just wondering if you picked some other thing that you could flip like a coin but was not a coin it would be a different result.In the end it probably does not matter, just more of a though of how things that should not matter or we think would not matter actually do. Like flipping a poker chip or washer vs. a coin. But for some reason using those things do change the outcome.-Dave",

But did they be sure to make the coin spin and that it must go upwards over the head of the tosser.I can favor a half dollar or a silver dollar if I flip it to a soft surface such as grass. And I start it on heads or tails I can bias the toss by doing a gentle lower toss.say my hand releases at waist high and it arcs up to chest high and fall to grass with a slower spin.Much like tossing a dart at a bulls eye  you can do some control over the coins.But If you have to make the coin toss go over your head and spin rapidly hitting a hard surface like a maple wood floor control is far more difficult.The bias is very likely subconsciously done by the tosser.If you tested this with blindfolding I wonder if it changes.",
