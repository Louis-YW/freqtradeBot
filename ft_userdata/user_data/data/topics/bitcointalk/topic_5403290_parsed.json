  "content": "Slumberjack's 1st BTC Collectors Coin**Arizona Copper Coin**  [next coin sneak peek at bottom]_______________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________This coin is the first in my series for US State coins! What better way to start with an AZ BTCitcoin Cactus. The more BTC friendly the state = next in line!These are DIY coins. I provide the coin, blank NFC tag (write public address), Certificate of Authenticity(place NFC on COA), plastic case, and an optional transparent sticker. The NFC tag is a concept I haven't seen on here yet, but I think you'll find the end result slick and effective.How To Video:  https://rumble.com/v192xih-how-to-slumberjacks-diy-bitcoin-coin.html   You choose which editions you want! See list at the end for available editions.All the coins have the denomination of 1mBTC or 100,000 sats. Again, these are DIY so they are unloaded.***This will be the only run for AZ coins. I am committed to a max supply of 100 + 2 proofs. My continued effort will be put towards coin'ing future states.***Mintage : 100 - 53 SOLD / 47 REMAININGMaterial : Copper Plated BrassSize : 1.75\" DiameterThickness : 3mmWeight : 0.9oz [25g]Denomination : 1mBTC = 0.001BTC Serial : 1 to 100 Price : 0.00175BTC / coin + shipping costBTC Payment Adress:  bc1qlhxp49fpkppzsr45legqh8qj7xvh0gmst9rvkcShipping cost [Includes Tracking] :US Lower 48: 1-4 coins - $4 (~30k sats)5+ coins - free shippingWorldwide (USPS 1-4+ weeks): 1-4 coins - $17 (~60k sats)5+ coins - free shippingAfter payment please DM me the following information :TxID :Qty of Coins :Shipping details : use privnote if possible  Front              Back           Front w/ penny              Serial  CoA w/ NFC              Tamper evident sticker              100 Editions + 2 ProofsPlease reply to this thread and DM with preferred serial number(s)  Editions Available :Code:Serial     Reserved By1      Slumberjack2      markzellers3      Bullion-n-BTC4      Bullion-n-BTC5      Otillio13306      Saxoshi7      Saxoshi8      Saxoshi9      minerjones10      Gary11      Santos12      Satslife13      minerjones14      raritycheck15      raritycheck16      raritycheck17      av8rjeff18      av8rjeff19      av8rjeff20      Kryptowerk21      tweetious22      Kryptowerk23      --24      Est201325      sunnybwoy26      sunnybwoy27      TheNovemberMan28      TheNovemberMan29      Steeley30      Pinky123431      --32      --33      Michael34      --35      --36      --37      --38      --39      Suzuki Matt40      Mitchell41      --42      minerjones43      --44      Hookzup145      hotdog746      hotdog747      --48      --49      --50      av8rjeff51      av8rjeff52      av8rjeff53      --54      --55      Hookzup156      --57      --58      --59      --60      --61      FalseFaucet62      --63      --64      --65      --66      Sweeteye67      --68      --69      FFrankie70      --71      --72      --73      --74      --75      --76      MoparMiningLLC77      Hookzup178      MrMojoRising2679      --80      --81      --82      --83      --84      --85      Hookzup186      Hookzup187      Hookzup188      Hookzup189      Hookzup190      --91      --92      --93      --94      --95      --96      --97      --98      --99      Hookzup1100      DirtyBirdE _______________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________*Sneak Peek* 2nd BTC State Coin**Texas Bitcoin**  As my Proof of Work, I present to you a sneak peek at the next state BTCcoin. Production for this coin has not started yet. The goal would be to release a select few states every year. With the added possibility of a country-centric coin for those that adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. For the Texas coin, I'd like to offer the option to reserve (for a limited time) the same serial number as your AZ coin order.  This would apply to all complete orders as well as the remaining AZ serial numbers. I'm stoked for this series! It's given me a case of nostalgia",

I remember discussing this with you at the conference - great idea you will have people lining up for 1 of each state - we need a \"50 coins of the US\" Slumberjack style - like the 50 state quarter map.I might make something once I have one of the coins for measurement - do you know, will all the coins be the exact same size?",
