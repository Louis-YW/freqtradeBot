  "content": "Hi folks,i have a good reason to sort of revive my PHP programming again. There are not many things i didn't do with PHP yet, but i need help with charting. It's not hard to create the data, but i ceased to find a library that easily lets me display a simple chart like this:The line is representing non-zero values, positive and negative, but the differnce to zero should be colored (red for negative diff, green for positive).Any hints or tips?Thanks Â EDIT: For now, it looks like the Highcharts JS API will do.Using the \"area\" type of Graph, setting css properties .highcharts-point and .highcharts-graph.highcharts-negative to the desired colors does the trick.",
