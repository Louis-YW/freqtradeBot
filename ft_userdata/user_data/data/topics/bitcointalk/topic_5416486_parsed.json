Â You heard that correctly, whether someone buys a Loot Coffin in $UNDEAD token, purchases a limited edition skin using $UNDEAD token, or another in-game item purchase with $UNDEAD token, that token is immediately burned. Â What this means for the token is that by just holding $UNDEAD, the value of your holdings may increase with every $UNDEAD token that is burned to decrease the circulating supply. Â With several games to come in the future under the Wagyu Games umbrella, and many games developed using WagyuOS, $UNDEAD burn will accumulate in a large way over the next few years. Â $UNDEAD is burned by periodically sending all $UNDEAD tokens used for in-game purchases to a burn wallet. Â Burn statistics will be posted weekly.GovernanceWagyu Games will be implementing a raw voting system with weight based on $UNDEAD holdings. Holders of $UNDEAD will be able to vote on matters such as, but not excluded to:Incorporating future Weapon Loadouts into the ecosystemFuture map and game modesPotential rewards for $UNDEAD token holders dependent on performance and sustainabilityThe Halloween Bash is FREE to play and earn to the public, no NFT required!",
