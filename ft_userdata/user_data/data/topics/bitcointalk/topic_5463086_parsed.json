Paying back on 3-5 month is still a good result, but you need to watch the mining difficulty. I think that soon the payback of these asics will be a year or more, and the worst thing is that many inexperienced miners have these asics on the way. And when they receive them, they will have to wait a long time for payback on such equipment.",
