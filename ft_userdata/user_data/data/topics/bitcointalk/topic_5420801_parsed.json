  "content": "Original 'white paper' was published in 1997 by BIS, the Satoshi whitepaper from 2009 is a 99% copy by text of the BIS paper, and note Satoshi paper doesn't even credit the BIS paper.The SHA256 hash used by BTC, is 100% created and promoted by NSA; The NSA has never released on ALGO and mandated to the public in their +70 year history where they didn't have a backdoor; FactThe Secp256k1 eliptic curve that is used to generate bitcoin addresses from private keys is designed and developed by NSA; This particular curve is full of backdoorsAnybody that says \"TRUST BITCOIN\" is a certified MORON.Who do you trust? Not sure, here's what I think today.Ethereum is better because it uses KECCAK algos which are Russia developed and stronger; But now ETH has been compromised by 'staking' where all the staking is controlled by US-GOV so they can black-list addresses on their whim; Ergo while ETH is the better coin, its fucked.ETC using classic ETH algo and not stake is therefore secure, but is ignored because it doesn't make you rilch.Monero is known to be full of backdoors as its origin is from questionable INTEL sources with CIA-NSAI particularly like Zcash, and the Zen derivatives as they all super secret addresses to hide transfers, so you have real privacy, while BITCOIN/ETH offer NO privacy.Forget about the $$$ money bullshit and getting rich off of crypto; It's just like GOLD, you hide it some place and never tell anybody you have it, best is if you flee, you don't have to carry it with you; This is about FREEDOM, not fuck all about getting rich quick or making assholes like bankman-ponzi rich. Or the CZ's of HK;The point is a trusted Crytpo is ...1.) Private2.) Not developed by the 'man' aka the police state (CIA, NSA, CCB, KGB, MOSSAD )3.) Strong solid blockchain requiring minimal maintenance;4.) world wide server base so that transactions can be fast, and no gov can block on ramps to the servers ( VPN )At this point what is known is that FTX was used to fund Ukraine, that is why $8 Billion USD are 'missing', BIDEN was using FTX to funnel money to UKRAINE and zelensky was buying FTX so that the US money sent to Ukraine can funnel back to BIDEN crony's; FTX Bankman-Ponzi was #2 financial supporter to put BIDEN into power; Ergo the PONZI and the take down of crypto have all been orchestrated by deep-state aka CIA/NSA/BIS ( the bankers ); Possibly more exchanges and cryptos have been used to fund Ukraine conduit back to US political pockets; Certainly of the $100 Bill sent to Ukraine to date, at least 50% was used by Zelensky to buy Crypto where it was money laundered back into USA stocks and real-estate;In summary 99% of the crypto establish is ran and promoted by common criminal assholes; It's up to you to be part of the 1% and steer clear of the shit;",

You find it all through the search function.Now, I found this:'Many crypto experts have noticed that Bitcoin’s choice of secp256k1 elliptic curve was unusual for its time, as it was not yet well researched. ... Cointelegraph asked one of the world’s leading cryptographers, Tatsuaki Okamoto, about this unusual choice. Okamoto currently serves as director of the Cryptography & Information Security Lab at NTT Research. According to Okamoto, there are two alternative explanations for this choice: Either Satoshi picked because it offers greater efficiency or because it may have offered a secret backdoor.'https://cointelegraph.com/news/this-researcher-says-bitcoins-elliptic-curve-could-have-a-secret-backdoor'Laszlo Hanyecz, who worked closely with Satsohi in 2010, told Cointelegraph that he was befuddled by Satoshi’s choice of the elliptic curve secp256k1. The use of this curve, at the time, was unusual. ... At some point, Hanyecz sent Satoshi an email asking him why he picked this particular curve, Satoshi explained to Hanyecz that he had had some experts helping him: “‘I had a bunch of people look at it and they told me this was good.’ And he didn't really elaborate on it, but he said he had experts look at it.” It is not clear exactly when Satoshi sought this outside help, but prior to launching Bitcoin.'https://cointelegraph.com/news/satoshi-nakamoto-had-outside-cryptography-help-says-early-bitcoin-devI had a bunch of people look at it and they told me this was good.",

      "body": "both sha256 and elliptic curve is in open source code.. you can read it. and thousands have. there is no back doorwhite papers are not code. they are just the manual/prospectus. when you read the code. then you see how things actually work and you can then see if there are any backdoors.. again for emphasis.the code for hashing blocks and also the private/public key curves is open source. it has been reviewed by millions over the years. there is no backdoor, and thats why people trust crypto(blockchains) more than the fiat world of businesses and custodial databases that are closed sourceas for btc-room prefering ethereum PoS(EDIT: seems BBC room now supports Eth classic in his edit. )(to add.. ETC is priced at near $20/coin but underlying value is $6/coin so its speculating at a high of more then 3x value. so NOT good to be selling btc to the be buying etc either)(anyways ill still leave my warning about ETH PoS below)ethereum Pos is mostly custodianised and staked into centralised exchanges.. hasnt btc-room learned anything this week about exchanges owning users assets.. also ethereums underlying value(value always sits below market price) went from $900 to $40due to PoS.. while the market rate $1.5k(pow days) $1.2k(Pos days) shows that the market rate is falsely being propped up instead of correcting down to new value levels.. ethereum value:price is at a speculated premiumbitcoin however has a underlying value of $15k for the year and the market rate is brushing near it. meaning a great time to be buying bitcoin right now while its cheap and near value.its the worse time to be selling bitcoin to then buy ethereumselling low(btc) buying high(ETH) is a bad investment decision..whilst ethereum is at its premium of expectation and speculating high.. people should be selling ETH before the fall. and then buying bitcoin while bitcoin is low.. especially when most of ethereum is custodianised and can break due to PoS control of staking by custodians(centralised exchanges).",

True, anybody can claim anything but nobody is forced to believe on them...as we are still rational people who are looking for evidence before concluding on anything.
