Unfortunately you have fallen into that trap, now he has promised to pay you and wants to work on another project, but there is no guarantee that he will pay you. It exists in the midst of all the fraudsters, they are trying to find a way to get rid of you by making various excuses. Since this user is not in this forum, tagging is not possible.

This could be useful for anyone who wanted to invest on those projects he mentioned above, but I didn't find those projects on this forum, though it's already listed on coinmarketcap. This forum had bad SEO rank, so it's not easily to be appeared in the first result if you didn't specifically adding \"bitcointalk\" on the google search. It would be better if the @OP adding the word \"scam\" so anyone which search \"First11 scam\" \"ETH Shiba scam\" \" ETH Floki scam\" will may likely found this thread.",
