  "content": "What happened::  The airdrop topic was published in the Bounties (Altcoins) section for a scam project called Nokiamemes. In order for the participants to participate in it, they have to open the site and then complete some tasks, including buying their currency, which they claimed it has been audited and verified by CERTIK, and this is a lie because after I looked at the Certik site and searched for the name of their currency, which is (Indestructible Nokia 3310 (NOKIA)). Its symbol is NOKIA, and its smart contract is 0x0E267BB13A6369599d7eF20b552EBAF20120c1B2. It did not show me any results related to their currency. They also claim that they raised $56,820 for pre-sale, and their site is 11 days old until today, and they have no communities.Scammers Profile Link:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3561458Reference Link:  * Airdrop/Bounty Topic: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458167.0 | Archived* Pre-Sale Topic: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458364.0 | Archived* Site: https://nokiamemes.com/ | Archived-----------------------Information about their domain:QuoteDomain Name: NOKIAMEMES.COMRegistrar: Key-Systems IANA ID 269Status: clientTransferProhibitedRegistrant Name: On Behalf Of Nokiamemes.com OwnerRegistrant Organization: C/o Whoisproxy.comRegistrant Email: 396295f106e43ec684e5de7b86e922afeccf076e40ee5d620b381c7d2892d712@nokiamemes.com.whoisproxy.orgRegistrant Address: 604 Cameron Street, Alexandria, Va, 22314, USCreation Date: June 26, 2023 (1 week ago)Update Date: June 26, 2023 (1 week ago)Expiration Date: June 26, 2024Age: 11 daysSOURCE: https://www.domainiq.com/domain?nokiamemes.com#/whois-----------------------Screenshots from the scam site:-----------------------Certik.com search result:-----------------------Additional Notes: I hope that no one of the bounty hunters did not participate and buy their currency through Metamask because it is possible that after purchasing their currency, the hunters will lose their entire wallets, Certik was a good way to condemn this scam project, and I hope any investor or hunter in Airdrop or Bounty should do such research before he connects his wallet Because it is one of the crucial pieces of evidence that could potentially unravel the whole scheme and serve as proof to know the project and unveil it as a scam.",

After you saw this topic of accusations of scams against your project, you wanted to remove the evidence that condemns your project, but you forgot that all topics are archived. Â Quote from: Idn on July 07, 2023, 06:09:49 PMTHE ORIGINAL HAS SUPPLY OF 331B TOKENS TOTAL > NO BLOCKLIST AND NO MINT OR BURN !!!!!Truly? LOL And if it was really the original one other than this one that I mentioned on this topic? Why didn't you mention it on your site or here? Also, on your site, you mentioned that the Indestructible Nokia3310 Smart-Contract has been audited and verified by CERTIK, so what is your conclusive proof for this? Knowing that the currency of your project does not exist in Certik, I also contacted Certik support, and they reported that your project is a scam. I will attach a screenshot for you.----------------Last thing, in the presale counter on your site, see the screenshot above. In less than 11 days, you raised $56,820 from investor funds, and today the raised funds have increased to $63,860. What is the evidence for this matter, and the presale time counter indicates that only 20 hours remain at this stage, and today the time has increased to one day and 8 hours. This is another evidence of your fraud. [You are manipulating the counter]Waiting for your response to these accusations against Nokiamemes.",

[You are manipulating the counter]Waiting for your response to these accusations against Nokiamemes.The nerve to come down here to defend his shit project without the proof that they've accumulated this amount I doubt if they can defend their platform, developers of shitcoins are manipulative one of the things that gave them away is the certik certificate, they know that certik certificate is to prove that their smart contract is fully audited.I hope participants of their airdrops will be aware that they are supporting a scam and manipulative project, just the name gave them away you cannot use a brand to create a platform without their permission.",
