But other old members got your feedback. wanted to ask what money/bitcoins they have used and how those coins were different from mine?(i would adjust this in the future and would buy and prepare the same bitcoins as they were using). Now, do not run leaving that feedback, no need. just saying.this was written in public just as irony as how fucked you are. now tell me where did i asked or insisted something?

Yes you piece of shit. i wanted my receipt and was waiting for it 2-3 years.NOW I GOT IT.All i cared for you to write that we made transactions, never asked but patiently waited. You wrote today! thank you for that, and the rest said in that feedback i do not care. You are Fake in what you do. You know that feedback is fake, live with that.You are a peasant to me. I have much larger network of people on telegram than you do here. at the end of the day i am still StackBTCbeing that said,FUCK OFF",

(asking for a friend)Quote from: MoparMiningLLC on November 28, 2023, 06:19:45 PMyou made several posts now questioning why I did not give you \"feedback\" Show those posts please.Thing is , that you reverted my words and conversation of how you wanted.Differently from what you say, in my words i was not asking a feedback but saying that you are the person who is farming DT feedbacks in my opinion and you want to have less \"opponents\" and you select not to rate newbies based on your bullshit thinking that you would be responsible if something when all we know you wouldnt.Maybe you are legendary, its okay, but it does not make you a better person.You are just a human, like all of us.Your feedback has power by stopping customers to buy from you just because they asked a question with irony. well done.and believe me least what i care is your neutral feedback, after reading you negatively rating first Titan BTC victim for being a victim- you have me no surprises.Quote from: anonymousminer on November 28, 2023, 06:36:28 PMthe fact that you made that comment like you are Satoshi or something just made you look like a clownQuote from: StackItUp on November 28, 2023, 03:23:46 PMI reserve the right to be identified as satoshi nakamoto for the next 24h.I did had/have a reserved right",

He can have that opinion, others might not share it. It isn't negative feedback (yes it has negative sentiment, but it isn't a red trust).With everything else you've said, it's hard for me to have a say as I can't see all of these things or I haven't dug deep enough. All I know is that it's unlikely you'll change his mind at this point and you have to ask yourself - Is this battle really going to be worth your valuable time in comparison to just continuing business as usual, and ignoring the feedback?I learnt that hardway with JollyGood, that you're better just to move on. Hopefully you don't have to learn the hard way too. Sometimes, you can't change peoples mind and there's no point trying. It might even wind up bringing more trouble.Good luck",

Soon we will have \"right reservation\" service.paid service to remind what rights someone had reserved and when they are about to expire.and when i say \"fake mods\" i mean it, because i find no other normal explanation of how my post that was deleted different from those that i commented on todaywhen you say not respectful. this is exactly what i meant when saying that you leave feedback \"paid\" on just some of the people when leaving others who also \"paid\" questioning what do they did wrong. do they paid too little? not on time? or do you think of you writing of a successful trade would make you attached to someone for the rest of your life lol? so yeah, you are disrespectful",
