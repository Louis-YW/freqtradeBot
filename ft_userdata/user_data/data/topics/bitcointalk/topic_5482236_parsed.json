      "body": "Well, the 21 million BTC is a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin's design. Changing this limit would require a consensus from the network participants, which I believe it is unlikely given the strong commitment to Bitcoin's original protocol. It also would alter Bitcoin's scarcity value and economic model. Dimon's comment might be speculative or aimed at provoking thought, but it's good to remember the decentralized nature of Bitcoin that makes such changes pretty hard to make.I believe that making such a change could mean a huge decrease on BTC value and even the loss of trust on the coin.",

So why halving meaning bitcoin is not singly operating as it was created as peer to peer nature so there's every possibility to be scarcity of bitcoin either the supply should be increased or halving should be extended to every 10 years or more to enable bitcoin Last for generations to come just as we are using cash currently and it has been in existence for centuries so why bitcoin can't be created as that.",

But is there a point from satoshi's post that he'd already told about that it won't be changed and it will stay to the same supply limit? I Maybe there is, right?People have bought and invested on Bitcoin for this very reason. The halving that's making the rewards for miners cut into half every cycle or 4 years makes it even scarcer and for that reason, many are believing that its design is perfect and just don't take the opinion of the people like Jamie Dimon. He would always say something that won't matter at all. He might be the owner of JP Morgan Chase or the CEO of it but he's been telling shit about Bitcoin since long time ago.",

That's pretty much equivalent to saying how do we know the sun is going to rise tomorrow, maybe God (or whatever other imaginary all powerful beings) is going to come and laugh hysterically and turn off the sun.OP, I don't even see why you would make this topic, unless you are new to Bitcoin and simply don't know how it works. If that is the case, Dimon is an idiot and he either has no clue how Bitcoin works or he is deliberately spreading anti-bitcoin propaganda (as he has been for years). Satoshi has zero control over Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized. Nobody can change the supply limit. There will never be a single Sat over the 21 million bitcoin limit.",

What would Satoshi stand to gain if he increased the limited supply of Bitcoin? How did he know if Satoshi was still alive or not?Dimon doesn't like Bitcoin, so he would rather make some hypocritical speech just to create thoughts of doubt about Bitcoin in the minds of people. I really don't care because what he said is not what will happen.
