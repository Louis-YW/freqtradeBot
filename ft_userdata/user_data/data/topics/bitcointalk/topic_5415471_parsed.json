I don't know what the TOS of that company is when it comes to VPN, but if Malaysia is on the list of banned countries, the OP could have problems in continuing to use their services, especially if he is a verified user. By that, I mean primarily if his account is connected to the account of a bank in a banned country. Maybe someone who is in a similar situation can say something more about it, but I personally would be careful in such a situation because it doesn't take much for them to freeze anyone's account.",

Using a VPN is completely legal in the USA, Canada, UK, and the majority of the World. VPNs are only illegal if you live in Belarus, Iraq, North Korea or Turkmenistan. However, countries like China and Russia have laws that restrict VPN use in certain ways.There are some countries that banned VPN usage but Malaysia do not ban nor restrict the use of VPN.Quote from: https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/best-vpns-malaysia/#:~:text=Is%20a%20VPN%20illegal%20in,or%20secure%20your%20internet%20connection.Is a VPN illegal in Malaysia? There are no specific regulations that prohibit the use of a VPN in Malaysia. This means that you don't have to worry about breaking the law for wanting to bypass content restrictions or secure your internet connection.

But if I would do that, I may try use VPN first, but if it does not work, I can go further and contact Binance customer support. My decision is because as my account is not freezed, I am still unable to withdraw my money.",
