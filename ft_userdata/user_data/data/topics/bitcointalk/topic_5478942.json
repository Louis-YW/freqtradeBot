  "content": "Gifted wife with bitcoin money on birthday and wife happily gifted handmade bitcoin logoAlmost every year I celebrate my wife's birthday. This year too I celebrated my wife's birthday but it felt different from previous birthdays for me and my wife too. My wife's birthday was on 20/12/2023. I was very busy these two days for which I could not do the post but I got time today so I did the post.This year I gifted my wife a hair straightener for her birthday with my invested bitcoins which cost not too much just $20. I have about $200 worth of invested bitcoins from which I spent about $85 on my wife's birthday gift and other stuff. But my wife is very happy to receive this gift from me because I gave her bitcoin money. I told my wife about bitcoin a long time ago she knows and understands well when it comes to bitcoin. He also said to invest in bitcoin with me but because he didn't have enough money he couldn't invest in bitcoin but I continue to invest in bitcoin sometimes buy some amount of bitcoin and try to hold for a long time maybe will continue in future.    My wife was happy to receive my bitcoin money gift and she gifted me bitcoin logo which I think is very beautiful because she made it with her own hands very hard just to gift me. Many may not like it. But after I gave him the gift, he stayed up all night and made me this handmade bitcoin logo as a reminder that I gave him a birthday gift in bitcoins.I want everyone's prayers for my family and lastly a big thanks to Satoshi who created bitcoin and bitcoin forum. Maybe if he didn't create bitcoin we wouldn't know about bitcoin or even invest in it.",

I do not want to ruin your post or post something that will dishearten you but your post is very confusing, as I thought you gifted her BTC so she would know how it feels to invest in BTC or have some BTC in my own custody. But after reading your post twice, I realized you used your BTC worth around $200 and you used $85 out of it for all the gifts and other stuff like cakes or decoration items, etc. Which means you simply used your BTC earnings to celebrate your wife's HBD. I don't know if it is worth to be sharing or not, because I also use my BTC earnings to make my living, to gifts to my relatives, my parents, and my siblings, and even to meet the expenses of my house. I just made a deal with my father that I will manage the home rent, and you don't have to take care of it now. I did not create a topic on it, I think I should also make one. I am not trying to be hard, I can understand you wanted to thank the community and maybe those who are behind BTC because they are the main reason you celebrated this birthday or maybe you would achieve great things in future with BTC not only you but me, and every other member and person who have adopted BTC. It has changed lives of everyone.",

I don't like the gift but I like the thought of doing it just to give you something after receiving a gift from you on birthday and also the reason where you get the money which is from your investment. As I have said, I don't like the give but still would keep it if I were you because the effort of your wife to make it and the thought of giving you that as a thank you of celebrating her birthday. Once again, it's not the value of the gift but the thought of doing it and also thanking the community if that's what you mean.",

I thought you gifted Bitcoin, but I clearly understood when I read the full post that you bought a gift with your earnings from Bitcoin. However, I feel a direct Bitcoin gift would be more memorable; I mean, gift some Bitcoin to her wallet. Since it's already past, you may plan for the next birthday. A bitcoin gift might give a good return in the near future as well, which would be special for both of you. Anyway, you did good and appreciate your wife's gift, which is BTC writing and logo.",

This is the side(indirect ) benefit of holding Bitcoin. If I received a gift like this from my wife, she can have whatever she wants for the rest of the year.",

I imagine that your wife will be very excited at the gifts and the surprise money she got. Excuse and pardon me because it is not like I want to teach you how to spend your own money, but as a better suggestion I advise that you try to open up a business of some sort for your wife, so that she can have some money to continually invest in bitcoins and not just this one time.",

You give someone a gift and that person gives you back a piece of styrofoam with the name of that gift, like you decided to give your woman an iphone and the next day she gives you back a piece of wood with the word iphone written on it. I'd probably frame that and show it to friends when they come to visit saying it was the best gift I ever got from my wife",

I think women love cash gifts or investment gifts more too, because it is one time where they have control over their finances mostly if they are dependent on the man to take of them and the household. Am also convinced you wouldn't have bought such a gift if you hadn't spent much time educating her on the subject of BTC or perhaps she is the one with the motivation and whip on your back to invest in BTC for the future benefits.",

Bitcoin may be complicated at first, but when you come to understand it well, you will realize that bitcoin is very precious to hold. I hope you will grow your bitcoins together and for me that's very possible as long as you keep supporting each other most especially when it comes to finances that bitcoin is mostly concern about.However, since you gifted your wife with bitcoin, then you must teach her as well how to secure his bitcoin and hold it for long term. Bitcoin will likely to gain its huge potentials when it's safely hold for years in a secured wallet.",

Let us all tell you where and what we use our bitcoins that we exchange for fiat. Are you really interested in this? Now that we are waiting for the New Year, maybe we will create a roll call of who gave what gifts to whom.But seriously, OP, if you are married, young, and your family decided to go with Bitcoin, teach your wife. Let her join the forum, read, and help you develop. Perhaps your young family will receive even more bonuses instead of drawings on foam plastic.Honestly, I see the forum as a big family. We cry together about the death of a grandmother unknown to us, and congratulate someone else’s wife.",

Don't sell your bitcoin anymore, try to hodli and have an emergency funds prepared to take care of any expenses that might arise.Happy belated birthday to your wife and a big congratulations to her.",

Don't say that negative bullshit that not many may not like it because I don't think it's true, sure there's some that are going to constructively criticize you but don't let it make you falter, and those that genuinely hate this display of celebration of bitcoin, they're just jealous that you've got a loving and supportive partner.",
