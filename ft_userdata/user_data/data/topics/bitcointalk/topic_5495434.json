  "content": "I recently visited a locally owned business that accepts bitcoin as payment method. I was so excited to see someone who isn’t on BTT accepting bitcoin as payment method. It shows that bitcoin adoption is spreading across the world. The store had a beautiful signage on the exterior and interior of the store that displays “Bitcoin, USDT, Enaira Accepted” After window shopping, I had a little chitchat with the owner and asked if he would be open to chat about his experience which he agreed to. I texted him 11 questions, it took a while but he finally replied with answers to all of them.This is how the interview went: 1. When and why did you decide to start to accept Bitcoin and other crypto as payment methods in your business? “I thought it would be a good way to attract customers who like cryptocurrencies. I have been doing this for about three years and I have had this business for four years.” 2. How has this decision affected the growth of your business over the years? Do you still see your business accepting Bitcoin as payment in the next ten years? “Business has been good. People here are not used to seeing small businesses accept crypto as payment and are fascinated when they are offered the option of paying in crypto. It has opened me to a new network and I’m grateful I made the decision to include crypto payments in my business. I still see my business accepting Bitcoin as payment in the next ten years. But I cannot say what the price of Bitcoin will be in ten years time.” 3. What’s your government’s stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency? How has that affected your business? “Bitcoin is not illegal in Nigeria. I also accept E-naira which is a cryptocurrency endorsed by the government.” 4. Who are your main customers? “I sell electronics, gaming consoles and gadgets. A large portion of my customers are males. The gamers are not new to crypto, most of them have used bitcoin to make in game purchases so when they come here they are more than happy to pay on bitcoin.” 5. Which cryptocurrency do your customers pay with the most? Bitcoin, Usdt or E naira? And which is your favorite? “I have never had a customer pay with E-naira.  Bitcoin and usdt are the favourites.” 6. Do you offer discount for customers who make payments in Bitcoin and other accepted cryptocurrencies?“No I don’t.” 7. How do you deal with high fees in Bitcoin? Do you use lightning network?“No, I do not use lightning network. Bitcoin is one of many payment options available. Customers can choose to pay in usdt, E-naira or fiat when bitcoin fees are high.”8. Do you use the services of Bitcoin payment processors?“Yes I use Binance Pay. I’m looking to switch to other payment processors since Binance has disable its p2p option for Nigerians.”9. What is your management style? Do you hodl the coins or instantly convert crypto received into fiat? “Both. I convert the crypto to fiat and also keep a small percentage of Bitcoin.“10. What are the biggest challenges you face in running a business that accept Bitcoin as payment method? “Balancing the books can be tricky especially when you don’t immediately convert the crypto to fiat. The market changes rapidly and you can experience a loss or profit.”  11. What key piece of advice do you have for someone that may one day like to start a business that accept Bitcoin?“Just do it.”  I also discovered other SMEs advertising online that accept Bitcoin as means of payment. I sent them a dm and hopefully they will respond. I will be updating the thread as soon as I get a response from them. If you find a business that accepts Bitcoin as payment in your city, feel free to use the above questions and share with us the answers you got from the business owners. And I will add the link to the OP. If you also have suggestions and questions you think I should add in my next interview, please let me know. Cheers!",

Well, if it's internal transaction then it should be fast enough to receive the funds but if it's from another then you will have to wait for the transaction to get confirmed unless you want to use usdt to pay. It also depends on the seller if he wants to receive crypto payment other than bitcoin and usdt like eth and other crypto only have small transaction fee. It is only possible if crypto isn't banned in a country.",

The merchant are selling electronic ang gaming gadgets, it is one thing to consider when accepting crypto as payments since majority of the target market are probably heard about crypto at least even once. Though there are still a lot of techy people who are not into bitcoin yet, this would be a great help for bitcoin to build trust to those kind of people. That number 9 question might be a difficult thing to manage being the merchant since bitcoin is a volatile asset. Though he can just convert it to stable coin, but still it is a challenge to his risk appetite. So, it just made sense that he convert some to fiat to take profit from his product, while retaining the other to take the opportunity to get profit from bitcoin as well.",

      "body": "There is a research that shows that when a business add bitcoin as a payment option, they will attract new customers and their revenue will increase. For the third question, it is a dicey one because lately the federal government of Nigeria have been all out against bitcoin and even mobile money operators have been directed to close and report any of their customer engaged in crypto currency trade. He has to be very care so they do not make an example out of him. For the  fourth question, I am not surprised I didn't expect females or older adults to be his customers. And this is the reality every where. He has got everything really planned out and I like it. The government has made it difficult for other business people who want to add crypto as payment option to do that. There is a risk of them losing their business and going to jail if they are caught.",

Do not start a business accepting bitcoins when you do not have any understanding of what bitcoins are or the technicalities involved. If you are a business owner and you rush into accepting bitcoins as a payment method without really understanding it, there is a high chance that you may get cheated along the way by people who may have a better understanding of bitcoin than you do.",

      "body": "That was a pretty nice interview, the guy was smart enough to allow Bitcoin as payment method because gamers often know about cryptocurrencies as sometimes they have to purchase digital goods or other stuff with cryptocurrencies. The store owner was fast enough to find that and allowed the gamers to pay in Bitcoin and other crypto currencies. I believe for such stores, it's better to accept stable coins in order to be safe from the volatility of the market. But, if the owners are the ones who like holding their coins for long term then Bitcoin should be the no.1 payment solution that they accept from their customers. I know sometimes it's pretty hard to pay with Bitcoin due to network congestion but most of the times it still works way better than fiat.",

Enaira was introduced to limit the use.of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria. But it failed to achieve aim since most people don't even have knowledge of the that version of the Naira. I am not surprised that the businessman have never had a customer who wants to pay with Enaira.Offering discounts would have encouraged more crypto users to pay with crypto. Maybe giving discounts might affect the profitability of the business. Lighting Network is complicated to use and it might not be suitable for electric businesses where you don't have the same or consistent customers.

As we are moving forward when it comes changes and other stuffs then it would really be just that normal for a business owner to consider out on adding those new things which are really that on trend or something that could be possibly applied into their business. We do know that crypto is really having that increasing recognition now and sooner or later years we would really be able to see that acceptance and adoption is really that there on which if people would be finding out that they do have that crypto options or payment then it would really be bringing out that ease and convenience whenever they would be deciding on buying up something or having that kind of service or something. So it would really be just that depending on how known or really that being legalon a certain place before these business owners would really be making out such option.",

Seriously about the tax I will say the business owner isn’t paying that on for either bitcoin or usdt. My reason been that he would definitely have to hide from the authorities that he accepts bitcoin as a payment option. The government is currently placing heavy restrictions on bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large at the moment in as much as I would love more people to accept it into their businesses I think it is way too risky for now. So for tax I am pretty sure he isn’t pay for that? Because if he does, he might currently be facing the law for using it as a payment option.
