Knowing how much it has gotten to now at 19.15million.According to my information, the completion of mining the last Bitcoin will be by the year 2140 if I am not mistaken. Are you sure that you would like to invest in different forms to become rich after mining the entire 21 million Bitcoins?I am not knowledgeable enough to give investment advice, but I can assure you that if you only invested $1,000 5-7 years ago, you would have multiplied it many times over. And you can imagine if you invested more amounts in the same period. There are many ways to invest, but no one can assure you when you might become rich or how much you have to invest.",

Many are likely selling it for their personal usage and converts it into fiat for covering their needs. Those that are rich are the ones who have been early into this space and bought a lot and also those consistent ones that has never sold or probably sold a few of bitcoin before until they see the price gotten up to their expected price.",

Depends really. DCA is just a strategy that would allow you to recover losses while at the same time earning more, which in itself is highly dependent on the chance that the asset you are DCA-ing is to increase in value over a lengthy period of time to maximize your investments. As for your question of reaching 21 million bitcoins, I think that's quite impossible because just reaching that final 1 million would take you hundreds of years to deplete, but I'll humor you for the sake of argument. I think, and you can correct me if I am wrong, you could become a millionaire or maybe even a multimillionaire of around 150 million through DCA alone, provided that bitcoin continues increasing in value until you reach that last morsel of Satoshi.",

It might sound like a petty amount, but approximately 2 million coins will take decades to be mined. I believe that your post is hypothetical, but you should keep accumulating through DCA; anything below $25,000 is basically a bargain. It's unlikely that you or the majority of us will become rich in the upcoming 10 years, but we'll definitely make some decent money by then.",

Bitcoin does not have a predefined trajectory, it's value has moved up and down over time. If you started buying at $30,000 up to $60,000, you would currently be sitting on a loss in your \"invested\" money. If you're buying now and it does creep up over time, your invested amount could be worth more when you decide to sell out. Judging by the fact that only roughly 5% are left to enter circulation, it almost has no relevance and you could say the existing circulation amount is the expected long term value (which may change in future).",

Demand/Recognition2. Adoption3. Regulation aspectsIf you do make use of DCA strategy then it is really that something good but dont expect that you would really get rich because everything would really be depending on how much you had invested.Plus if you are asking on when the last bitcoin would be mined then it would be playing around 2130-40 as far as i remember on which i dont really think that it would reallybe making you in concern.",

There will probably be a stage where Bitcoin fulfills its initial prophecy as a form of \"electronic cash\" and one of the elements of true cash is that its value is stable enough to be a viable payment method. There will probably come a stage where the value provides miners with an opportunity where the price of Bitcoin won't matter to profitability, probably because the reward (even after halving) will be exponentially greater than the energy required to mine it. At this stage volatility will significantly reduce, probably after an exponential value increase that validates the aforementioned...then, there will be almost no point in the DCA strategy because Bitcoin will not be seen as an investment product but rather as a form of money.Assuming this scenario plays out, DCA'ing from now until Bitcoin fulfills the electronic cash prophecy will probably leave you at least much better off than anyone who does not pay any/enough attention to Bitcoin over the next decade.

Most baseball cards printed in 2023 likely won't be worth much. But over time the limited edition minted items will become increasingly scarce, leading to consistent price hikes. Bitcoin's price trend should follow a similar pattern.But of course, bitcoin's value is also determined by speculation and trading from hedge funds and other assorted high liquidity investors who buy and sell in large volume. Then we have regulators and lawmakers who are creating laws relating to stablecoins and crypto in general. All of these factors, and assorted other variables combine to determine what the eventual price will be. It can be impossible to know what the outcome will be, without a time machine. Even if people can guess the correct outcome, they probably could not describe the series of steps which led to it.",
