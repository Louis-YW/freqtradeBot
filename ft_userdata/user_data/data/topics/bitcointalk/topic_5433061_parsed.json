Any feedback from second buyer or miner that convert there mining gpu to typical gaming gpu?In January 2022, video cards were very expensive and the actual prices in stores were 100-200% more expensive than MSRP. It’s hard to overheat a video card in 1 year, but if you don’t know how to check a video card after mining, then it’s better to buy a video card with a guarantee a little more expensive. Look at other offers on the market and the prices of new video cards, or better write which video card you buy and its price.",

Any feedback from second buyer or miner that convert there mining gpu to typical gaming gpu?I don't think there are any statistics indicating that the GPU that worked in mining before its purchase will somehow differ from another used GPU, using my example, I can say that from my experience of using 2 GPUs bought from a former miner, they have been working for 3 years and have no problems. Of course, there may be differences depending on which established long-term mode the video card was working in, and whether it had repairs before you bought it.",

I don’t trust most of the reply on altcoin board that makes me create the topic here to ask Bitcoin miner. Not all Bitcoin miner is mining only Bitcoin so I’m using this as chance to ask Bitcoin miner that has knowledge on GPU mining to ask for an advice. I’m planning to risk money so I want to have an opinion coming from trusted user. My question is not directly about altcoin mining so I believe this topic still fits here because I’m asking opinion from Bitcoin miner that has GPU mining experience.Quote from: FP91G on January 05, 2023, 10:42:16 AMIn January 2022, video cards were very expensive and the actual prices in stores were 100-200% more expensive than MSRP.

Asus Ko RTX3070 purchased last year and price is 304$. The GPU is never been repair or open since I knew who’s selling it. I just don’t have any idea on the durability of GPU since this is my first time to change my desktop GPU for an upgrade.",

Any feedback from second buyer or miner that convert there mining gpu to typical gaming gpu?I can tell you about the Rx 470/480/570/580 series,the old ones that I have sold many of them for gaming and other rendering activities after being used for mining for at least 2-3 years and 0 complaints so far.It means that there is not a direct relation to being prone of early breaking if cards are used on mining.In fact it depends on how the gamer or architect and engineer uses the card,if they run it and don't check the fan settings at all the risk of such cards being prone to failure is real but only of such cards,even other cards,I have seen gamers breaking their cards by not paying attention to cards temperature.It all depends on the behavior,on how good will you take care of such cards,if you will be careful to run them as good as possible then they will not be prone to failure early,I assure you of this.The same should be for all other card series newer or older.",

Any feedback from second buyer or miner that convert there mining gpu to typical gaming gpu?If he is truly a friend tell him you want to try it for a week. If it works it is likely to keep working.I have mined with 100's of cards. All the way back to 2012. I do not max the watts out so  they rarely fail. Maybe 5 duds in 500 cards that only lasted a year or so.",

      "body": "My advice would be to either like others have said, allow you a week to test it out, or if that isn’t ok then I would ask him to demonstrate that it will be able to work without issues going forward. I would say to have him download FurMark and run a stress test on the GPU. If it can handle a furmark test, then it’s probably going to be ok and continue running without issues. Hope that helps you out.",

      "body": "You really are better buying a GPU from a miner than a gamer. Most miners keep GPUs outside the case and they are well ventilated and usually undervolted and underclocked. Gamers are the complete opposite, they want max FPS and they usually overvolt and overclock and it’s inside a computer case with poor ventilation. Those are the suffering GPUs.The only issue is perhaps the fan might go bad sooner however it’s an easy fix. You can even fix it yourself by lubricating the bearings or buy a replacement fan from eBay and should be good to go.",

Any feedback from second buyer or miner that convert there mining gpu to typical gaming gpu?What gpu is it? If nvidia 3000 series then better chose lhr card so atleast is new stuff around 1year, so you would be fine. Mine my gpus around 5years old and still kicking but you know that depend where u used that gpus, humidity only real gpu killer, mostly gpu mining dead when they dont operate for months and humidify became fungus killing the gpus",
