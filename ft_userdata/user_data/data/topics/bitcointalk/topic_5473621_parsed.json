Understandable concern but I can probably deduce why OP isn't sharing any details yet, I feel like OP is trying to make sure that there's someone that's going to answer that they have the ability and capabilities to do what he/she is trying to ask, if I am right about that deduction, I still don't think that OP should do that and that it's probably best if OP does share it now. I don't use Binance I am not familiar as to why they will block your account but given that it's a custodial wallet like app, I think that it's likely a KYC related incident. Hopefully what everyone's thinking the problem is will be the actual problem because it's definitely going to be a headache when that's not the case, might have to prepare for unforeseen results of recovering the money from your account which although unlikely might be a bigger headache for those that's going to fixing the system.",

The screenshot shows only how much you have in there but not the error you are getting. Do you use p2p service lately? That's another fast reason why Binance can block your account, they usually block people when they don't keep their part of the promise when dealing with peer to peer transaction, like two days ago when I was using their p2p, the person they paired me with is a crazy fella who intentionally delayed the transaction for over 24hrs.I opened an appeal and the CS told us to drop proof both, and I dropped mine but the guy failed to drop his, and he was warn that if he didn't follow this rules he is definitely trying to cheat and if he can't drop proof that he truly paid me he will be block from the exchange, the guy later lied that the money got reversed, I knew he lied but things was sorted out, if he hasn't did this his account would have been locked already. So OP what exactly did you do wrong?",

Your best chance is to find someone that have same issue to you and know what’s the best solution. It’s better if you can provide the info on how your account was blocked.",

I'm sure they are going to ask you for the KYC verification.If there's nothing related to suspicious activity. Most of the platforms use this allegation to block the customer's account.

One possible cause could be that a hacker has attempted to access your account, or you have attempted to access your account from a sanctioned country. To address this issue, you should first step should be to contact Binance support team and provide detailed explanation of the problem. By doing so, I am sure the support team will help you to regain access to your account.",

Emphasis on \"binance\" as the community is not binance so we can't directly help, op. At best we could only point op where to go e.g. binance chat/social media account and discuss possibilities of what may have happened including some precautions.My guess is this is either a desperate plea or op has an ulterior motive seeing as they tried to get into PM's from the get go which is unnecessary. I'm saying this because scam PMs are rampant where scammers play mind tricks on gullible people. They love PMs since it's more isolated.",

The user is a newbie and the first post is about a Binance account that got blocked, he didn't share any information why the account got banned at the first place.  I know very well that in this particular case, it's only Binance support that can help out. But someone that truly needs help would give more details of the problem, take advice from the community and follow it up... And not to be asking for a PM on Discord or Telegram.",
