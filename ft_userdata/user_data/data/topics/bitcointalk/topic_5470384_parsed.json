  "content": "The freshly leaked documents from the communication by the four-star general in the United States Army who currently serves as the 29th chief of the National Guard Bureau, general Daniel Robert Hokanson has revealed that the US troops are not willing to die for the terrorist organization known as Israel.This is not the first time armed forces of U.S. refuse to die for the terrorists either: https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/extremism-disinformation/2023/06/01/white-house-orders-pentagon-to-probe-antisemitism-islamophobia/Not just that but also he reveals that United States military (the CENTCOM sector) neither has the troops nor the capability of entering the ongoing conflict specially if it turns into a multi-front war in case the armed forces of Lebanon enter the war too.P.S. The funniest thing about this is that it was in June (4 months ago) that after massive intelligence leak from US military and other sectors, Gen. Hokanson vowed that there won't be any more intelligence leaks and now his very own classified communication is hacked and is being leaked",

He has a lot of followers who see him as a demigod making his words more powerful than Biden's. The fear of Hezbollah who is the first Arab armed force to push out Israel from its territory is real and the US soldiers no the consequences of fighting against them. Even Trump knows that Hezbollah had the capacity and military prowess when he said they are very smart. Anti-Semitism is not just growing in the US, it has also increased in some African countries because of some inhuman policies against Palestine. I doubt if Hezbollah has any intention of joining this war because the first 24-48 hours after the Hamas invasion would have been the best opportunity to strike Israel. At that point, Israel was weak and confused. Maybe they still have a better strategy if they have any intention to join. Gaza City might be a better place to join the war because they understand the terrain and will have a better defense system. Israel has not forgotten the bitter defeat they suffered at the hands of the \"Party of God”,  so they might want to settle these scores in this war. This document leak might also be a military propaganda to make Hamas and Hezbollah assume that the US military is weak which will serve as a motivation for the latter to join the war.",

At that point, Israel was weak and confused. Maybe they still have a better strategy if they have any intention to join.This is a wise operation that is planned carefully each step of the way to keep the cost as low as possible. You see, they are all fighting against a propagandist enemy. An enemy that has full control of the mainstream [Western] media and consequently the public opinion. Just look at the obvious lie they spread a couple of days ago about Hams killing babies! All mainstream media from Washington Post and Reuters and even the President of USA to BBC and CNN and a lot of European news outlets ran it without a second of hesitation.It was a clear lie and now all those outlets are admitting it was bullshit but as a footnote somewhere nobody sees. Like this tweet from CNN.That is while the Israeli terrorists have already verifiably slaughtered 400+ children in Gaza with internationally banned phosphorous bombs, and none of those mainstream media outlets are covering it at the same level!Imagine if from day one everyone brought their full forced and started attacking the Israeli terrorists from all sides. The public opinion in the West would have turned against them right away as they would have been bombarded with massive amounts of propaganda brainwashing them every minute with lies. This would have increased the cost of the war. For example now instead of discussing how many Merkava tanks and F16 jets have been lost we would have been counting the number of warships US has lost.But look what happened instead that it is only Gaza in the front line, the public opinion of large number of people in the West and obviously the entire East is actually against the Israeli terrorists specially since these terrorists have been committing horrible war crimes against women and children.Even more so when videos like this one come out from the mother-in-law of the First Minister of Scotland who is currently inside Gaza with her family and children watching the slaughter happen with their own eyes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koFHbbgIl4EQuote from: Die_empty on October 15, 2023, 07:40:50 AMThis document leak might also be a military propaganda ~Considering that this is not the only leak, not the first time and not the only evidence we have of the serious weakness of the US military, assuming it is propaganda is out of the question.",

Joe Biden opened his mouth and claimed that he saw pictures of the beheaded babies a claim that even the The White House has refuted. From my experience I think Aljazeera seems to be the most truthful media house to get information from regarding this conflict. But we cannot deny the fact that both Israel and Gaza will be running some propaganda machineries. So there is a need to verify any information from both sides before believing.  QuoteBut look what happened instead that it is only Gaza in the front line, the public opinion of large number of people in the West and obviously the entire East is actually against the Israeli terrorists specially since these terrorists have been committing horrible war crimes against women and children.Even more so when videos like this one come out from the mother-in-law of the First Minister of Scotland who is currently inside Gaza with her family and children watching the slaughter happen with their own eyes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koFHbbgIl4EIsrael will justify the attacks on Gaza with the fact that Hamas started the attacks but I think they have killed enough civilians. The West should call them to order and let this massacre end. How can one explain the bombing of civilian cars that were fleeing along Israel-recognized safe routes, this is inhuman and tilting towards a genocide.",
