  "content": "There have been rumours in the market recently that black rock wants to accumulate more bitcoins, but at more reduced rates and for this they will make the market crash more. I don't know if this news is really true or if it is just a rumour. This is one dark side of these giants that they will never play fair. They have enough money to influence the crypto market which is still at the very initial stage and move the market according to their wish.https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/1026075",

This threat of manipulation is not only from BR instead many other big giant companies interested in BTC wants to take entry at lowest point.The only thing holding BTC back is the trust people have in it. IMHO, such platforms will only face failure once the public having trust in them will see there true face. By true face I mean how they wanted to manipulate the market (if they really wants to). We should always prepare for the dips and should not act upon these dips and sell in loss. But those who are in future can not prevent from such dips, the only advice I have for those is left the future start doing accumulation as now is the time. Not a financial advice.",

Ofc Blackrock and anyone who wants to invest on Bitcoin wants to invest on cheaper price but that doesn’t mean that the price will adjust so that they can make an entry.This kind of narrative is a wild speculation to backup the hypothesis that the current dump is due to Blackrock trying to bring the price down while the crypto is just experiencing a natural price correction in reality.Reading online speculation will just make your mind confused about this conspiracy theory that doesn’t have proof supporting it.",

And that's what they want to do, all these companies want to use Bitcoin for their advantage and they don't give a single freak about the people invested in Crypto or Bitcoin. It's all about them at this point. In the end, they can't control the price at all. Keep them trying, don't worry at all. They surely have enough money to manipulate to be very honest.",

Would they be the first ever to manipulate (or trying to) bitcoin's price? Absolutely no, they won't even be the last. Anyway there are always less and less people selling their bitcoin at these prices, maybe we could go down a couple of thousand dollars more but I think it's extremely unlikely that we can go much further than that.",

But if it goes up instead, its a loss for those who believed.We should not believe and make decisions based on such unofficial news, like the one who made withdrawals from exchanges and dropped the market more back on August 17 just because they heard unofficial news of Elon's SpaceX selling BTC. In fact, I still think there is no confirmed news or announcement that could confirm that they really sold the BTC. But the point is, whether they have sold or not, why are we acting upon them? We should have faith in the market instead of these manipulators.I am not denying the fact that these whales and big icons have had an impact on the crypto industry, but at least we have to trust BTC from our side. I am also not denying the fact that many traders, like in margin trading, have to make decisions based on such selling and buying, but those who intend to hold should really not sell. But I think loss and profit are things that happen all the time, and if people start to believe in such things and make trades or existing trades based on unofficial data, then they might really face losses.\"",

That's the cheaper way trying to manipulate the market because there are far too many people who take such news/gossip/rumours for granted, regardless of the sources. Personal search bubbles and echo chambers do the rest. Some weak hands might loose their nerves (and coins in the end), but that's likely not enough momentum to produce a significant shift of the market for such players like BlackRock.Or what do you think they could use as toolset to achieve what this gossip is about?",

The better solution would have been to give an equivalent worth of fiat money to the  mtgox victims because at that time the bitcoin price was very very low and if this mtgox haven't happened, they would have sold all their bitcoin long before.

But lets consider this from the perspective of an economist: its a signal. a sign that they believe Bitcoin may one day be valuable. And isnt it sort of a compliment to the crypto community in some ways?The bottom line: Pay attention to the wider picture rather than getting sucked by rumor.

Those who are not rich to buy more to their portfolio suffered more to the hands of the few whales.

Now the halving is very close again so they can also wait for the halving to acquire the unit they want.
