I'm not a professional avatar designer by any means but recently in a contest run by Royse777 one of my avatar design was selected for final decision. Although, I didn't won the content but many of the users voted in favor of my design. I think I can help to design that avatar for you, and you don't need to pay me anything for the avatar design. I'll try my best to create a design that would be according to your specifications and I hope that my design will get a chance to be applied on your profile.",
