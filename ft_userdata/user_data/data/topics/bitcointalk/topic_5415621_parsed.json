There was a hell lot of fiscal deficit generated by various countries first to fund the vaccines programs and then for distribution of the same. Some countries even gave a lot of freebies to the normal people which has also led to a lot of wasteful expenditure, ultimately someone has to foot the bill for these expenditures, eventually, this is footed by inflating the currency as a whole which leads to currency becoming devaluating the currency. I can understand that COVID-19 and all the economic consequences have contributed to the poor economic situation of many countries, but a strong economy like the German economy needs more than one blow to reach inflation levels of 10%, and therefore it is not logical to blame the pandemic.What is happening are profound changes in the global economy.",

I was just searching few articles to see where at Germany stands in terms of GDP. Surprisingly developing nation like India is 5th in the rank just behind Germany which is 4th in rank by means of their GDP. The GDP’s are at $3.2 trillion and $4.2 trillion for India and Germany respectively. If Germany Keeps its growth like this (steady & into inflation) then it’s projected that India might cross Germany in terms of GDP. However there is one hurdle in this, Germany needs to be at stagnancy while India needs to be at 7 percent per annum. Im amused why Germany is slowing down like this and that’s why made Short comparison. They can do better I think and I don’t think we should blame on pandemic all the way up. Since India thrived anyways they never stopped growing. Germany can too.",

Although Germany is always perceived as some kind of leading economy of the EU on which everything depends, I think that this will gradually come to an end, because as the leading country of the EU, it was they who created the policy that created such a great dependence on Russian gas and oil. Now that Merkel is no longer present in the political arena, the political influence of that country will weaken considerably within the EU, and even more so in international relations. In addition, Germany's position in terms of military aid is very bad when it comes to Ukraine, so the question arises as to why they are so restrained in contrast to others, but perhaps one should ask their Israeli friends who share their attitude. It is incredible that in the light of what is happening, some things come to the surface and that those who have experienced great suffering in their history have no sympathy for the suffering of others. Regarding inflation in Germany, there is a very appropriate statement that says \"as you sow, so shall you reap\". The only problem in all of this is that Germany is part of the EU and the Eurozone, so everyone will suffer the consequences - but that's why there will be more and more countries that will go in the direction of Hungary or, more recently, Italy.",

The recent sabotage on the Nord Stream is a control shot in the head for the German economy. It is still moving, but already an economic corpse. I did not look at the latest statistics, but in July industrial inflation in Germany exceeded 37%, that is, the production of goods in Germany rose by more than a third in a year. This is a fairly reliable leading indicator for consumer inflation.",

Look at the graph again, if the major cause was COVID-19, then it shouldn't have been moderately sideways during the time when the pandemic hit so hard but when the war started, things just went uphillI am thinking this is all due to the spillover effects of Sanctions",

Of course some nations are doing far worse than Germany, it's clear that everybody is having hard time right now, and some are doing worse while others are doing fine.In this situation, Germany is still fine, not doing great but compared to many others they are still doing better and that is why we shouldn't take them as base example.",

It started with COVID 19 then followed by the Russian Ukraine war as well which has led to the increase in energy prices. All this has increased government spending a lot and then obviously how badly companies have been affected by all the things leading to lesser taxes as well all this gives a cascading effect to create more inflation.That is not entirely true. Gas, CNG, and electricity prices were already on the rise even before the end of summer 2021, due to a mixture of policies to ban coal-fueled plants, which are popular in Europe in an attempt to switch to greener alternatives. Certainly, the Ukrainian-Russian war was the icing on the cake, but honestly, I believe that all this fuel and energy crisis is also, to some degree, pure speculation. Electricity and fuel providers are recording massive profits during the past year, placing a huge burden on consumers throughout Europe.That's the price you pay when you're dependent on Russia's oil and CNG, along with placing sanctions against a superpower.",

But I think the scale and scope of those programs is too small to handle the widespread inflation that we're seeing this year. Efforts to address inflation will need to be scaled up and restructured. If standard of living is to be maintained. There are search engines like ecosia which claim to plant a tree to address climate change for every # number of times their search engine is used. Similar programs to plant food to boost supply and limit inflation might help. But the lag time of farming could be critical.
