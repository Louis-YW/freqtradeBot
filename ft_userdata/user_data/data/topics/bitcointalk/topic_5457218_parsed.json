  "content": "Hi, I'm interested in selling a Reddit account with 12.1k karma (as of June 2023). The only reason why I'm selling is because I'm disappointed with the Reddit administration and intend to dedicate all of my efforts towards creating a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and user-centric Web3 replacement and really wish Reddit will become the next Digg. How much would something like this account be worth? It was created in 2022. Escrow is fine as long as it is established (either an established service or a BT member with good reputation).",
