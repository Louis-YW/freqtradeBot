      "body": "I think that Ethereum going to proof of stake pretty much sealed its fate as far as censorship goes. Most of the blocks being confirmed these days are complaint to whatever standard of processing transactions that the government has set forth. I imagine in time all of the blocks will be, otherwise funds will start being frozen. Ethereum is definitely the biggest target of blockchain regulators at the moment, and I’m sure such censorship will attempt to find its way to Bitcoin in the future. Although I’m sure they’ll try to steer Bitcoin towards PoS first to make their job easier.",

Do you think we are heading to complete control with no alternatives?Well Satoshi's vision was for Bitcoin and not Altcoins, i'm afraid, that was what he stood for: Bitcoin being decentralized and the algorithm to bring coins into circulation being the proof of work mechanism, and it is still that way. Ethereum and quite a lot of other altcoin projects are rightly centralized and there is prolly no alternatives in the altcoin industry. But the Bitcoin network is still decentralized thus far, not that it isn't targeted by governments and regulatory bodies, but there is as yet no change in how Bitcoin operates/has operated, thus i'd not talk about the end of decentralization just yet because we haven't gotten to such end.",

So, does it mean that you believe we are just watching the beginning of the end for Decentralization and everything that Satoshi's main vision stood for? Do you think we are heading to complete control with no alternatives?I wouldn't call it dark, I would call it as logical and realistic as possible. Look around you, almost the entire industry has been influenced by kyc and regulators. Most countries around the world have created their legislative frameworks and taxation for cryptocurrencies. And all of this is part of centralization and control. Any centralized exchange that supports kyc and aml policies can block and confiscate cryptocurrencies. Also, cryptocurrencies have political censorship and sanctions that prevent certain citizens from using cryptocurrencies and using services. That's a full-fledged control and regulation.  How do I see the future of cryptocurrencies? Fully regulated. Alas, there is no trace of the original intent of cryptocurrencies themselves. Cryptocurrencies were supposed to fight the oppression of central banks and governments, but that's not how it turned out. These same bankers and governments control cryptocurrencies and dictate their terms. People do not use cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat, they seek to exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat, through various speculations.Governments will continue to increase control and regulation. The reason for this is that once worthless coins, once worth very little and taken seriously by few, have become worth very much and a huge value has been transferred through the blockchain. Billions of dollars. Now it is a full-fledged industry, and governments, along with banks, will not miss the opportunity to make it all work for them.",

Ethereum fell for the trap and what worsened was their very high transaction fees... lolPOS or not, Ethereum is still a very large network compared to other altcoins. From the beginning, their selling points were transaction fees and smart contracts. I don't think any other shitcoin like BNB will overtake them in terms of adoption, but they certainly will drop further down way from Bitcoin from many points.",

It’s the trend now where a project ship into a new network to address their current issues, it seems very effective to other project as well.",

And what project do you guys believe could surpass Ethereum?Well, once it's no longer censorship resistant, it's no longer decentralized because much of the cryptocurrency ideals like censorship-resistant, immutability, true public consensus, etc work handinhand. If one is compromised or weakened the network becomes centralized and less secure.PoS is anti- decentralization and should never be encouraged by any right thinking person. It helped in turning the network into zombies and could actually be considered dead/dying. So, it's best to use it with what you can afford to risk, or avoid completely.",

However in my opinion, it won't be dead because of Proof of Stake. If you look at Binance Smart Chain which I am sure is the more centralized network than Ethereum network. You can compare two networks' validators to see how Ethereum network is better than Binance Smart Chain.Do you see Binance Smart Chain is dead?

ETH was just very lucky at the time, at the initial stages of the market they were able to attract miners who made the network reliable and stable from 51 attacks, then it was time for ICO, most of whom were on the ETH platform and collected ETH in exchange for their tokens, simultaneously increasing the transaction price and the income of miners. Then there was USDT, which was also on the air, then Define and NFT. All of them only added money and opportunities to the ETH, it is clear why with such data the other became the second after the BTC. Now without mining and clear rules, the future of the project is not so rosy.",
