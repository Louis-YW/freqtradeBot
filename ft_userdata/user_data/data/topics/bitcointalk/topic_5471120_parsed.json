Don’t be like me who regretted not buying and holding bitcoin when I have the time to, so don’t use what scammers are doing and stop your self from buying bitcoin you might leave to regret it, which will take you a long time to move on, but I have and have realize my mistake so I won’t allow anyone to fall into such mistake again.",

Flash bitcoin is mostly used by scammers to pretend as if they have truly completed a transaction so as to convince their victims into sending them money and I believe that the set of people that will mostly be affected by it are those that don’t know how to confirm their transactions on the blockchain rather they just rely on screenshots from the sender (which I’m sure only few people do).I don’t see it affecting the price/market of bitcoin, they have been cases where counterfeit fiats were being used to purchased things by scammers and it’s still being done. So the fact that someone was lazy enough not to check his/her transaction on the blockchain before proceeding with a deal does not mean that the whole market system will crumble.  And I do  hope the “flash bitcoin” I saw on YouTube is the same one you’re talking about because that’s what my post is for. Quote from: Rap111 on October 21, 2023, 08:33:34 AMI totally agree with you. Agree with what?",

No.The best advise is that continue to accumulate we are getting to the block halving, and next year could be the start of a massive bull run. Better be ready.",

Two most famous Bitcoin 'forks' are Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. They are all failed altcoins.How many Bitcoin forks are there?There are many tokens, Wrapped Bitcoin tokens and they are not Bitcoin. They are even worse than Bitcoin (Proof of Work) forks because Wrapped Bitcoin tokens are mintable and their token pegs can be lost (de-pegged).",

Where did you hear of these \"flash Bitcoins\" that disappear in 90 days?There are various altcoins or tokens that can be loosely referred to as fake Bitcoins. For example, BSV is often considered a fake Bitcoin. However, it's an altcoin with its separate network and market price, unrelated to the actual Bitcoin network. Also, there are so-called \"Wrapped Bitcoins,\" like WBTC, which also aren't real Bitcoins but tokens on other networks that represent the value of real Bitcoins. In most cases, you can exchange them for real Bitcoins. Still, I've never heard of fake Bitcoins that vanish in 90 days.",

Maybe you are referring to double spending by fraudulent people where an unconfirmed transaction can be replaced with a new one. I know that immediately Bitcoin transaction is confirmed by the network nodes, it cannot be reversed. To avoid such problems it is important to wait until the transaction is verified by at least two miners before you release your coin or money. Don't rush to conclude the deal without checking in the Mempool if the transaction has been verified.",

I have no idea what Flash Bitcoins but according to your description they are some altcoin that destroys itself....why would you ask if you should short Bitcoin because of some random altcoin? That's like asking if you should short Gold because someone made fake Gold that disintegrates in 90 days. One has nothing to do with the other. You don't short Apple stock because someone made fake computers and put a picture of an apple on it.Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Nothing else is Bitcoin.

Like, they create a fake layout, that says, we have sent the payment while we have not received the amount. It is more like a fake layout, which can not be in circulation, or I am missing something here, if yes, then do let me know. And how such a thing can be a cause of a market crash, I mean, people do get into FOMO or fear but you should not, because you are a BTT user   So, be calm and the market cannot crash. And you don't even have to rely on the replies of the members to take short or long entries, and by judging your education and understanding level, I would suggest that you should also not take trade in futures. First, learn about Bitcoin and try to control your emotions.",

In other words, selling these shit tokens or coins can lead to big losses. So, the best you can do is, compare the BTC smart contract with the token you are receiving, and check if that's real or fake. You might be scammed even if you will check those token transactions on block explorers because transactions of shit tokens are also recorded on the explorers. So do not rely on them only and verify the nature of the BTC manually. You need to get some information on how cryptography works and to know that, you should read the above article.",

This is usually a transaction that is being carried out by a scammer to a genuine person who might have fallen victim to some scam scheme, either where the scammer uses the BTC to pay for a product or is wanting to exchange that for cash. If the person is not careful enough, he will be convinced that the transaction is real, and if it's a payment that was meant for goods, they will hand the goods over to the person, and if it's for cash, the seller might release the cash without realising it was a scam. One just needs to be careful in this crypto world in order not to fall into all this form of scam that's increasing every day by day. These scammers are just targeting those who are not really that experienced in crypto and can easily be deceived.",
