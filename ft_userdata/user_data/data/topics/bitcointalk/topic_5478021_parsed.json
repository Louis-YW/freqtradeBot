Maybe he knows that ANN thread can only be opened by officials, but still, he opened maybe to get some referrals, for affiliate marketing.See under the topic a newly registered account has posted with a referral link. Moreover, I saw him open another topic about a casino on the Gambling board, there he also used the old strategy and gave the referral code under the post. 1win Betting Casino: Unlocking the Benefits with NewYearNFT Promo Code.@Franki22 Buddy, I don't think your this strategy will work, It has become very old a long time ago.",
