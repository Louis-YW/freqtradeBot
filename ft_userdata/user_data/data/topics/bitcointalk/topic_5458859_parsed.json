Don't trust any platform, they can self-proclaim like best platform, most unhackable platform but your responsibility is securing your bitcoin by yourself.When you make a trade deal, pay attention on confirm status of the on chain transaction and how many confirmations it has.ReadHow many Bitcoin confirmations is enough?Two toolshttps://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-confirmation-risk-calculator/https://web.archive.org/web/20181231045818/https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.html",

You may not find sufficient liquidity and are not as easy as the options of CEXs. Therefore, whoever wants to exchange a small amount or save fees and directly withdraw, some CEXs are good.If you intend to invest periodically and the time factor is not important to you and you want to enhance the privacy and security, then https://bisq.network/ is the best. In any case, it is your knowledge and your keenness that you do not download random programs that make the possibility of hacking your coins more difficult.",

If not why they got hacked before? Surely you cant be bias about dex that doesnt offers staking cant be hack. There are no exception and thats the fact. Even the most genius person in the world creating a 100% proof of defense against hacker can still be compromise.OP's question btw is kinda stiff. Since he ask for unhackable platform? Maybe the best answer there are those platforms that have no record of hacked or breached before isnt it. At least they can brag that.",

But as some users said that they can be hacked too I want to add that if it happens there is a very little possibility to hack any popular decentralized exchanges as like Uniswap, Pancakeswap.Now think about, What you will do when decentralized exchanges aren't fully safe? Use DEXs to buy sell Cryptocurrencies and more your funds to non custodial wallets. And use non custodial crypto wallets which is open source like Electrum, Mycelium, Blue Wallet. They can't be hacked if you don't share your phrase to someone or connect your wallet to a Phising site. You should also avoid closed source non custodial wallets like Trust Wallet and others as you don't know how the phrases are created.",

Even if the developer of some projects are claiming that they have made a hack-proof platform but still hackers always find a way to sneak into the project and loot people's money. While they do not even know what is happening to them. So the simplest answer to your query is:There is not a single platform that could assure you full security from both sides. This means they can assure you full security from their side but what if the keys and seed phrases of your project or wallet are compromised by some hacker then who is responsible for that? It's you, so they cannot take assurity from your side because you are the one clicking on phishing scam links and providing a back door to hacker to enter the system. Let's say the same humanoid mistake would happen from companies side if one of the employee click on some phishing link and being compromised then total project will be at risk.At the end, every project is hack proof unless someone within the system made some mistake intentionally or intentionally and you were asked example. In my POV, every BTC based product is a perfect example like Electrum wallet, bisq DEXs etc.",

Bisq that you recommended is not working in Mobile phone, that is there is no Android Version of it and desktop can't be move around to all the destination you travel to.

As for wallets, I would suggest either using a hardware wallet such as Trezor or any other option except Ledger.
