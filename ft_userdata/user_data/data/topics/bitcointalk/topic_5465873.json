Just a friendly advice! Great advise mate but the truth be told that holding is much more easier and profitable  for people with some reasonable sum of holding or portion of bitcoin.I see nothing wrong with hodling as well as seeking better paying options provided you know what you're doing and you also do your researches as nothing is guaranteed in cryptocurrency industry even is the profit in holding guaranteed if the amount in holding is not relevant.I do agree with you that holding  seems to be the best option but on the other hand, I think everyone's reasons for adopting bitcoin  differs.",

That's why most people used to distinguish between trading and holding because both have different strategies and different outcomes.Holding is also investment, so saying do not look for investment, just hold might not be correct.But other than this fact, I totally agree with you that those who want to confirm profits or who are looking for better results than trading must prefer holding, but this advice must not work for everyone. Because some people want to become rich overnight, they know BTC cannot make them rich with their low investment, but if they invest in some shitcoin or some project that assures 100x or 50x (most are scams), they tend to invest in those.They know the risk involved, but most newbies don't. The point is that the greater the risk, the greater the reward. Now one who is more greedy will look for more money and take more risks, while in holding there is less risk involved.Ps: Before posting please check for spelling and grammatical error.",

That's why most people used to distinguish between trading and holding because both have different strategies and different outcomes.Was on already typing this I felt OP actually made a mistake of contracting the two word holding and trading. Holding basically is also investment since is an act of allowing the assets grows into some profits over a period of time, it can be short or long but the the time frame determines the percentage of profit to be earn. This is what holding bitcoin is all about. The one OP says about exchanges leaving with others money can simply be classified as trading because this is the only area where People leave their funds on an exchange. On to trading just like it brings quick profits to the investors the risk is higher to a total newbie to it and just like OP pointed out it is a huge risk for newbies to ho into it. So what I would say i deduce from the post is without proper knowledge just treat bitcoin first as an investment by holding firm on a good and reputable Wallet rather than trading to avoid scam",

As a result, we are urged to employ DCA when investing in Bitcoin in order to plan for other expenses within our monthly or annual incomes.",

I know we have a lot of bitcoin maximalists in here but there are people who like to take risks in altcoin. We have seen in every bull cycle project like polygon, solana, Shiba inu emerge and the investor makes a huge profit. Everyone wants that kind of gain.

Newbies fall for scam investment because they're not yet informed on things happening in the crypto space, some are inform but still ignorant because they aren't patient to wait for Bitcoin to give them profits in few years time but want instant gains and that's why we have numerous projects because the founders know there are many gullible investors looking for the next profitable investors and knows they can scam these set if investor.Quote from: Ojima-ojo on September 06, 2023, 03:15:24 PMTo avoid all this,  it become paramount to only abide by one rules which is to keep Bitcoin in your wallet and stop looking for investment that are centralized to reduce your risk.The market is full of opportunities to make you rich (that's what they're been told by the influencers paid to hype a certain project) so it becomes difficult to ignore all this distraction all over the market and just buy Bitcoin which is why I advice new investors to make bitcoin their top priority then whatever is left they can use to play with the market (which is more like them going to a casino to gamble). I'm not against anybody experimenting with the market but they should know all there's that isn't Bitcoin would probably make them lose money in the long run.",

Just a friendly advice! After reading your post 2 to 3 times then I realized what actually you are trying to emphasize here. You are trying to justify the fact that instead of investing in new projects, alts, NFTs, metaverse etc. platforms in the hope of better outcomes you should invest in BTC for the longer period of time and wait for the results. And I am agreed with you because I have seen the results of daily trading and the holding. But sometimes lump sump trading is better then holding but of course in the short period for example if BTC drops price to $25k and people still doing DCA instead of lump sum buying then they might not be doing right because accumulating is necassary but getting more on dips is also necassary and now if those who would have lump sum at $25k and waited for the next ATH means if they hold then the results will definitely be risk free as the risk is involved in other alts and risky investments. Halving is coming in around 8 months and after that new ATH might be set in less then 15 months or maybe more, as no confirm date just a prediction but still holding now is the best option.",

Just a friendly advice! I mean Bitcoin is great as an investment sure if you're going to buy Bitcoin for sure that is the main reason why we buy Bitcoin anyway I mean I dont know anyone who bought Bitcoin that doesnt treat Bitcoin as their investment or doesnt expect any kind of return on Bitcoin. For sure Bitcoin was just a new thing back in the day a few years ago, There was no such proof that Bitcoin going to guarantee profit so it was obviously risky to invest in Bitcoin in the past years, even now the market price is just supply and demand. I can clearly see your point here but I think the best way to say it is to only invest what you can afford since it is just not expecting anything on return on your cryptocurrency because that just means you could hold for a long term because you not expecting anything, I completely agree with it since a lot of newbies are just buying cryptocurrency expecting a big return already, the trick is to HODL for long term until the Bullrun, which is, in my opinion, is going to be difficult if you're just going to make Bitcoin or cryptocurrency your main source of income, if you have multiple sources of income you could easily HODL for long term investment since you dont need the profit quickly if you have a emergency.",
