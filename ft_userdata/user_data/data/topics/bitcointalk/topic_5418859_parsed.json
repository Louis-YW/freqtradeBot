  "content": "I am presenting a \"reset\" device used for self-resetting of cryptocurrency miners (GPU) based on the PC motherboard under construction. The device cancan also be used wherever there is a PC motherboard with pins corresponding to the power sw output.Â Principle of operation:- The program checks the availability of a suitable host in the local network through a network command of the PING type. When there is no response to the PING command,the appropriate sequence is executed which turns the computer / server on and off.- the server must be network connected through the RJ45 connector to the local switch- the server is additionally connected with a 2-wire low-voltage cable (e.g. telephone). On one side, the cable connects to one of the outputs of the relay moduleand on the other, it connects to the server's motherboard directly to the pins with the MB output.- the user sets the reseter's working parameters via the websitefor more information follow this kickstarter link:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reseter/reseter?ref=project_link&fbclid=IwAR00gKwkrWQdfJ98znWm7OOlNH2GMji6swZDQ1Tf44Sx-JNfT5hfU9ORXBM",

Normally, I would say move this to the AltCoin mining section, but since the merge GPU mining has gone to shit, so perhaps changing the product to accommodate high voltage / amperage devices would be better.-Dave",
