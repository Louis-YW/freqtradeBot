So in conclusion, the appointments of these Nigerians are still to the advantage of the Americans so there is no big deal about it",

Nah good info you wrap for here but if me and you dey tok the same thing, you go know say our country get enough bright minds but if there's no nepotism involved, you no go fit get better jobs. So if these pipo dey abroad they get appointment nah beta thing, but e dey pain me say we Govt no notice their talent instead nah anoda country man notice and with their brilliance, them go help grow him country. You know how much moni dem go bring give him country? But our pipo just get myopic view.  I no dey blame any body wey wan Japa from this country because e no easy to spend 4 years for uni only to come out dey struggle to get jobs, e come b like say the sch nah scam so I no get issue with them wey him give appointment, I just wish say if e wan push naija name forward, nah to recruit those wey dey the naija already..just like scout.",
