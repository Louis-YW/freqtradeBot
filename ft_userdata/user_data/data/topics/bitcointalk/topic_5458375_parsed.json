Online or physical lottery tickets?I just did a quick search on bc.game lottery article and nothing was written on the duration at which a lottery ticket that wins will expires or would become invalid for claim.In my opinion, a user should be able to claim his/her reward anytime they Wish to, because I see no reason as to why they'll render the ticket invalid after sometime. If we were referring to a physical lottery ticket I would have judge that different but since I'm referring to an online casino then it shouldn't have any maximum duration at which it will be valid.",

Based on the Freebitco.in and I checked it now, it will never get expired. You can ask this on the casino staff too.",

Read them in a jackpot you want to join.No forum member can give you answer on how long a jackpot reward claiming duration will last. It depends on each jackpot so let's read its rules yourself. If you don't read any rule and most important rule, reward claiming rule, why do you buy a jackpot ticket? To push your money away?",

IMO it's rare for casinos to touch your balance, so I doubt the reward would get refunded or moved unless it's stated under their lottery's terms and conditions that they have the right to confiscate the reward if it's not moved for several months.",

The same goes for online lottery too and it is recommended to always keep a track of the expiry date before and after the purchase of tickets. There are a few apps to help you with this issue. If do a Google search using the keyboard lottery ticket tracking apps. Some of them are from lottery organizers and some are paid apps. If you do want to use it then maintain a ledger with all the details of your lottery tickets.",

Especially half a year is too long. So if there is a jackpot winning ticket in the casino it is better to withdraw the prize within that time if it is mentioned there. Otherwise various steps can be taken like stand KYC you need to be authenticated. So I think it's best not to waste time especially when you win prizes. Since you are claiming money without taking the prize, you should make your withdrawal decision very quickly.",

I'd say it's rine but who's to say that a casino wouldn't be such an ass that they'd cancel your win because of an inactive account? Even if it was directly rendered to your accounts wallet, as long as it's sneakily hidden in their ToS that they can, they will do so. It's pretty much free money to them anyway since they technically \"announced\" it as a prize somebody won.As for physical lotteries, they usually have a limit afaik? They're much more public about it though, since technically someone not claiming the prize just resumes the lottery again just lik when nobody was actually called a winner.",

Read the Terms of Service of the lottery, in which you are participating. Everything should be stated there.I don't know about any active lottery players, who would just forget about their tickets and leave their accounts. I don't think that the lottery would refund your tickets if you forgot to claim the jackpot. Probably the lottery platform won't pay you the jackpot, if you don't have a withdrawal method in your account. I'm no expert in online lotteries. We need someone, who is actively playing online lotteries to explain everything in detail.",

Also, you should take the time to study the local gambling and lottery laws in your country, because, I think, depending on different countries, there may be differences. In turn, local laws may stipulate the period of time when a player can collect his prize money if he won it.As a result, I can say that:1 - read the lottery conditions from your service provider;2 - learn your local lottery laws.",
