  "content": "We have heard of several countries that are embracing BTC, and even in it's falling state, some want to partake of it. It's quite an impressive initiative that the Swiss Post office, through it's banking arm, PostFinance, are taking to offer crypto services to it's customers in response to their demands for it. The plan to introduce this service will be the first of its kind as it aind to independent from other banks and operations will begin from 2024.Despite it's fall from it's all time high price of 69,044.77 in Nov of 2021, the need to venture into cryptocurrency was necessitated by citizen's demands. . “Our clients want direct access to this market through their house bank. Given the growing institutionalisation [of cryptocurrencies] in the last 18 months, this is the ideal time to enter the market,” Sandra Lienhart, head of retail banking has this to say. This move will go a long way to helping Bitcoin go global and I expect to see more people who were less welcoming of it to have a change of heart. What do y'all think of this? Your thoughts. https://finbold.com/swiss-post-office-to-offer-crypto-trading-and-custody-services-by-2024/",

Although it will be a custodial service, still good for citizens who are Bitcoin fans. But still, we have to wait for the official announcement. I can't see the official information source on the article.",

With enough patience and controlled investments, the ROI could be very high.This also applies to businesses, cooperate firms and banks getting into bitcoin.I should point out that the Swiss Post is looking to gain more exposure into cryptocurrencies and not Bitcoin in particular and have been into the crypto space for some time now.",

Your thoughts?I agree with her, with every institutions, companies, businesses accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment for their goods and services, So will adoption continue to grow, and definitely, those who are less welcoming of Bitcoin will definitely have a change of heart, the most important thing is not to force anyone, but the secret is to continue to build and promote Bitcoin in our own little and whatever way we can, Bitcoin is here to stay, it is here to bring a total change to the monetary system, it is here to bring freedom to financial slavery, with time, even those who are currently less welcome of this technology will have no choice but to embrace it.",

I just think customers' satisfaction and welfare aren't the priority for these companies, rather it's all about their own profit. I say that because customers are being smashed by annoying and ridiculous regulations, while businesses adopting bitcoin don't give any importance to it.One example of that is crypto.com platform, which doesn't allow users to cashout fiat funds to any banking accounts until users make a deposit on the platform through that same banking account they are trying to withdraw to. Moreover, that account must be attached to their name and ID as well, otherwise it's not possible to transfer money. Consequently, money can't be transfered to anyone and users are restricted to debit card for all daily transactions, what isn't enough to fully replace traditional banking system for real.i expect at some point, you won't be able to transact bitcoin freely, because regulators will create a kind of whitelist addresses you can deal with and a blacklist containing the forbidden ones... All with connivance of such companies.",

We know that adoption and recognition is somethingnatural to happen and not all would really be that confident on dealing with volatility but for sure and we know about its potential that it cant really be denied that this one is really worth of to engage onbut actually its just really that basing on own personal choice whether you would really get engage through it or would just wait for some opportunity before you do get in?",

Top platforms and government institutions are pessimistic about Bitcoin so only few bodies indulge on Bitcoin investment. The little number of institutions like SPO (Swiss Post office) have a better view of what Bitcoin is all about. This will indeed help productivity in the company when bitcoin hits bullish trend. So Bitcoin will keep on getting more adoption despite the winter because the bull market is sure and good investor tap from such repetitive experience.",
