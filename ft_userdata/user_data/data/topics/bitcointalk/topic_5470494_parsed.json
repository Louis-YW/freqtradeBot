  "content": "I came across a video where a guy gave an incredibly fun analysis of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology,  and I feel it will help our newbie a lot to understand this concept. This is how the analysis goes:Imagine you have a friend named John who has a business partner in a faraway country and needs money today for a business venture, So, John goes to the bank and says \" I have a friend in Spain who needs money today, can you help me send it to him?\" And they said \" John, we can help you but it will take us 7 to 10 business days I'm sorry. And John starts freaking out and is like, what am I going to do because my friend needs this?And here is when crypto comes in and says,\" I heard you needed to send money overseas today, well what you can do is buy a coin from us and we will send it immediately, it's almost as an email.And John is like, that sounds good but don't email get hacked?And they are like, yeah John, but we are a little bit different because, every time you make a transaction, we keep your receipt, and not only do we keep it, we organize it in a way that it cannot be altered and what we do is that we store in a file called a ledger and then we put your file in a digital vault which is called the blockchain.And we will copy this ledger over thousands of different computers across the world so if someone says, John, didn't pay or they are trying to hack you, all we have to do is to look at all the other computers Around the world and we will see very quickly that this person is the one that wasn't playing fair and we can keep your money safe that way.And so everybody is happy because it's not backed by banks or the government and John has the opportunity to send money instantly internationally and he feels more secure because he knows he is safe by this technology called the blockchain technology that is monitored by thousands of different computers that is always online\"I hope this helps someone.",

And John starts freaking out and is like, what am I going to do because my friend needs this?It seems to be a video for children because the script is too simple and it really not explain what actually is happening in the Bitcoin network, but I think it is for only giving an overview to someone who is totally unaware of the BTC blockchain. Well, at the start, a newbie would easily notice and can point out that, banks don't take 7 to 10 business days to send money from one country to another, even though they say those numbers, but they send it very fast. Even in the current era, we can send money from one world to another using banking apps within minutes. And that would be pointed out by those newbies, and there they will be make up their minds already that, BTC is not providing anything useful. And of course, I have seen many cases, in one, there was a student who had to send the fee to a Uni located in the UK but the Western Union took more time than they promised of and on the last day, the student get to know that his fee did not reach in UNI account and he then went to WU and they said, it will take 10 more days. But the student said, I don't want to send it from you just give me my money back, Well, that's a long story. The point was, in such cases. Money is stuck for a long time. But BTC might not help us here, because in order to use BTC, the receiving party must agree with it, if they are not accepting BTC as a payment method then we cannot do anything. But that's just a general limitation of BTC or banks (whatever you can call it). Overall, to really understand what is BTC, then experience it and then compare it with banks just like I said in this topic --> To Understand the Potential of BTC, What we Must Know?",

Maybe I'll use a way like yours to get started if someone asks. Because if I'm not mistaken, crypto was created the first time it was for this purpose. While investment is a bonus of this technology. Perhaps with this problem many people will be interested in getting into crypto. But in fact, I have never transacted money from abroad but transactions using Blockchain technology are the best solution regarding a very long transfer process. And it looks like it will cost a lot of money. And my country seems to be a country that has a difficult bureaucracy when dealing with money or goods coming from abroad.",

But we now have instant payment systems that can send money anywhere in the world in a few minutes, an example is the US Federal Reserve FedNow service. However, I know that people still go through a lot of challenges using conventional banking systems. One of the problems we face in my country is the restriction placed on the amount you can transfer to anyone. In my country, you might not be able to transfer more than $1,000 except you pay higher transaction charges. But Bitcoin has the advantage of allowing users to transfer limitless amounts anywhere in the world with competitive transaction fees.",

Dropping the video link with the story would have been more helpful for a newbie because my guts tells me that more important things beyond all that's is written in the op can be gotten in the video if a link was provided to it.There's an impression I'll like to emphasize about how some bitcoin would wanna think about bitcoin when comparing it's useful case to fiat, and that impression is that bitcoin is fighting against fiat to take over the financial system of the world. It's not truly in that thought. Bitcoin is just an alternative to the fiat banking system for people who wants financial freedom from centralized censorships about their privacy and based on the anonymity and decentralization the bitcoin blockchain technology offers it makes it an alternate measure  and not that BTC is constantly having a fight with fiat system. No one is forced to adopt, it's a choice based on what money mean to you.",

Yeah nodes are responsible for validating transactions and relaying it to others nodes, whilst miners find blocks and these blocks make up the blockchain. But mind you that they keep the Bitcoin network safe and not the Bitcoins in your personal wallet, thay also don't they act as mediators if you have a transaction dispute with someone. Bitcoin is a \"be your own bank\" network, thus you are responsible to keep your assets safe and ensure you are not sending it to scammers.",

I always paid some businesses where I bought services via Bitcoin, and I don't even know where they are located. There are some alternatives to send money instantly, like PayPal and other electronic currencies. But Bitcoin gives you more privacy and security. It's true that how it works. But your friend needs to know how to set up his wallet and not choose the wrong one, such as exchanges as a wallet. At the beginning of my crypto journey, I picked centralized exchanges as a wallet as I thought those were the wallets to store my Bitcoin. I did not use those exchanges to keep many Bitcoins there. But my understanding was those are the wallets. I learned that there are a variety of wallets, like non-custodial wallets and hardware wallets, that I can use to store my Bitcoin, giving me complete access to my Bitcoin. So, knowing a few more things before using Bitcoin is essential.",
