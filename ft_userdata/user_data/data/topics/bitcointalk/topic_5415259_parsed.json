  "content": "Hey everyone, i just stumbled across the wager races held on faucetpay.io (micropayment wallet & faucet site).They have a daily $1,710 wager race in which the top 10 most wagered user will receive a prize according to their position.I want to play there and hunt the races, but im unsure if they are paying bigger amounts, as i know they are legit in the way of paying smaller (few $) withdrawals.The first place even gets $1,000 and i was wondering if they actually pay the users who gets first position, maybe you have some experience with faucetpay and bigger withdrawals. i would appreciate your opinion & experience in the comments.",

I haven't tried any of it, so I don't have any info about the withdrawal limits. Based on the usage of different survey platform, there'll be limits on withdrawal apart from auto-pay.",

Because after all, everyone has a risk of betting. The decision is yours, but if you are not satisfied with some support try not to do it. Betting with a fairly large amount and the first 10 positions will definitely make you interested. Is it worth it if in the end, you don't occupy that position 10 ranks?",

However, they suffered a hack in February of last year and people weren't sure if the victims would be compensated the lost amounts or not. Apparently, they reassured their customers that the site will cover their losses, but at the same time their TOS states they aren't required to do that for security incidents such as hacks.You can read more about it on Faucetpay.io Security Incident if you want.",

Let's just say that greed is part of our lives that's why there are some times that we become so greedy when in the end the money that we use to risk hoping to double or triple the amount but didn't go as planned. If most people mindset is to explore and understand first before before taking the risk is much better than taking the risk right away. I am kind of like that where I only spend a little money just to try it out and if I only lose many times and less win then i'll stop (physical ones).",
