But it does require some hefty funds.  #TossACoinToYourWitcherP.S. is thet your Twitter handle ?",

This strategy is just hypothetical and high risk since it requires huge sum of money to pull this kind of arbitrage loan and there’s a chance that Ren will notice your action and freeze your account due to manipulation of the market. The idea is great in theory assuming that no one will care about your action but if somethings go wrong in your loan management. You will suffer terrible loss that’s why this strategy was shared publicly and not done personally by the author since he can asked someone to fund him and DIY.",
