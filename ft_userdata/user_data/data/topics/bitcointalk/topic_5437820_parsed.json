  "content": "Crypto.com doesn't charge fees when exchanging currencies, but I noticed rates are inferior to the official rates on the currently moment of the operation. Also, you don't have freedom to place a sell order with the price you want. They force you to set a minimum price, above the currently market's price, difficulting the sale.So I concluded they charge a hidden spread exchange fee. Do you know how many percentage is this fee?I found a local innovative digital bank in my country which claims to not charge fees, but they have the spread thing feature, and informs it stays around 1%. So, technically, absence of fees is a fake propaganda, anyway.EDIT: nevermind, although they don't display the fees and respective values charged on the moment of each operation, there is table informing the percentages.",
