  "content": "I will exchange your crypto for whatever payment method you are looking to get. Cash-in-Mail, WU, bankwire, Paypal, you name it. I notice that it seems people are paying quite a steep price just to get this type of currency while keeping their privacy... I will gladly use Escrow if the fees are covered by you. I have a 100k limit per day and just not utilizing it enough like I should be. All I am going to ask is that with whatever payment method either buying or selling that my marginal profit rate is maintained at a 2.5% profit after all fees. This service is 24/7 and currently only way to contact me is through private message on this board. If you are moving a larger amount we can negotiate a bit on the fees.",
