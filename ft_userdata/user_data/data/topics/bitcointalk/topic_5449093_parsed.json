Check games and rounds boards for that. About free lottery in gambling casino? It's not common that you can entry without betting money, maybe a they give you a bonus but you need to deposit first so its not free.",

That's also one of the fun part, you get to have fun getting those free lottery tickets from giveaways and there's that essence of having it freely and you're not going to worry whether you win or not, as long as you've taken that for free.Anyway, I don't usually get into lotteries and I know that it's fun but I'm done with that part so I'd just say good luck to you as you track your progress with it.",

Depending on the kind of lottery, the number combinations could reach in the millions and tens of millions. If you only bought 1 to 3 combinations, your chance of winning is lower than 0.00001%. So there's no point expecting to win. There are so many people who have been betting on lotteries and have already died without winning. Why would a betting site offer free lottery tickets?",

I've had my fair share of lotteries, haven't experienced winning in one so far though. I've won some minor prizes but no grand prize win yet. Not really hoping to get a win most of the time, entries just so happen to coincide with me seeing them and me having spare money, so why not. I'd have better chances hoping for some wins in the casino rather than hoping for a win in lotteries.As for a lottery without paying, I think those are called sweepstakes iirc? It's a legit system and who knows, there may actually be some in your casino of choice.",

Apart from Utopia, playing the free game on freebitco.in also gives you lottery tickets, and, although the probability is low, there have been cases of people with few tickets winning. The first prize is usually around 0.1 bitcoin, and there are up to 10 winners.",

That's the only \"free\" part that you will receive but other than that, you must pay for entry. That's where they will get the funds for the prizes for all the winners so it's just fair. Before I also took part in lotteries at freebitco.in, some I received the tickets for free, and some I bought with my faucet earnings but that was a long time ago. I don't know now if they still do that kind of event, you could check it out, they are one of the known longest signature campaigns here in the forum.The faucet part though may not be existing anymore.",

I enter in lotteries where the participation fee is not big,for example I like the weekly lottery on TV that most countries have and that is drawn live every Sunday.The cost where I live for such a ticket is 2 dollars and is a 15 out of 90 one which is very difficult to win and the people who usually win it have a huge amount of luck favoring them.I also take part in free lotteries in gambling sites like the one Freebitco.in does every weekly also as the site gives you the option to get them free or even to buy many of them if you want for a really small cost.It is the same though,the difficulty to win such a lottery remains huge.",

To win a lottery is difficult, by why do you keep playing without being hopeful to win? People win lotteries, and at any moment, it could be your turn, you do not need to terminate it with too much doubts. Whenever you take part in lottery and then you do not win, rather than saying you are not lucky, console yourself with a better thought that it is not your turn to win.",
