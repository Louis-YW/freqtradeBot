It also eliminates third parties like banks which may interfere, delay, tamper/reduce the amount meant for the recipient (in this case, American Cancer Society). So long as the correct wallet address is displayed on the recipients website, to avoid sending to wrong address. Cryptocurrency will obviously have many use cases in the future, this is just the beginning. The preference to using Dogecoin, IMO could be a way to show some sign of love in the charity act. There could be other reasons, but I think it simply reflects how the donor feels.",

That being said i think the news it self is not that big of a deal for Dogecoin to be honest because it says \"that Dogecoin is the third most donated cryptocurrency\". I don't have the exact numbers but i would guess that more than 90% of the donations to the cancer society are made via FIAT and less than 10% of are made via cryptocurrencies and from that 10% Dogecoin is \"only\" the third most donated currency.",
