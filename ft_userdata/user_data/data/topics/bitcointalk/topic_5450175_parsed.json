This is what they did in stepwork forward which people lost plenty money before last year.I've noticed that ponzi schemes are one of the tricks that scammers use most frequently. People are desperate for money and will do anything to get it, leaving greed out of the equation. I don't understand how it is possible to invest a certain amount of money and have it double, it is better to be satisfied than to look for low-cost investments to get rich quick. One thing is for sure, though if people don't learn, they will always fall victim. The information op shared is very helpful we can inform people about it.",

E NO GO EVER BETTER FOR YOU AND YOUR GENERATIONS IF YOU USE YAHOO MONEY BUILD HOUSE OR TRAIN CHILDREN AND FAMILY THAT SAME THING YOU USE PEOPLE'S MONEY DO GO CAUSE YOUR DEATH WITH MUCH SORROW AND PAIN HERE IN THIS WORD. My brother and I was the victim of this sometime last year and the experience was not funny only God saw me through, and I come to realize say this Yahoo plus guys no be ordinary eye them the use, so the best way na to avoid any contact with them as much as possible even if na your blood brother dey do yahoo just separate your self from them because nothing good comes out of them, na so so fake life I trustworthy both at home and abroad. One of the easiest ways they get through to their victims is through the use of close friends and relations who are already victims, and once you listen to their explanation baba their charms fit cash you unless you too na strong a man on your own. So when you notice anything of such from close friends please try as much as possible to save them from the traps of these wicked soles who's life can never amount to anything, if possible report them to EFCC do follow up on the report online, Ponzi and internet scams can never help anyone and at such, we must try all means to get rid of it or minimize their success. If you never be victim, you go think say you smart, but believe me some of those guys dey sleep inside ⚰️ coffin till daybreak before they start their work on you, so it beats your human smartness unless you have their antidote.

They bank on the ideas of people having to make withdrawals in current times and that makes it legit. They seem to forget that the hook that gets the fish is usually covered by a bate. Why some or even you (them) might successfully make withdrawals at first trier, the bate is always there to hook you (them) in the end.",

The truth be said, e not go dey easy to scam person like us were dey into online things but then e still dey happens once, once but the most important thing ba to distance ourselves from anything were concerned with those guys and forms of schemes, we must eliminate greed and try not to give ear to anything related to online investment that we are not in total control even if it a family member that owns such business trust na something we're person no purpose get for the online space since me and you no dey see ourselves so no trust me but we can deal only on a secured and guarantee ground.",
