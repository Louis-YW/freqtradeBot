Normally a mixer breaks the link between the inputs and outputs. Meaning that you get back money that's not obtained from shuffling around your own coins. So normally the answer is no.On the other hand, CoinJoin is also considered mixing. And afaik CoinJoin does not break the link, hence, if you are keen to do that in your own wallet, you may (but it requires so many operations you don't want to do that by hand).",

Simply search for the terms 'bitcoin mixer' and 'bitcoin tumbler.'Bitcoin is often used for anonymity, but since the introduction of KYC requirements, it has become less anonymous. That's why bitcoin mixers exist nowadays. Some people may view it as a negative development, as these mixers can be used for criminal activities, especially for money laundering. However, as long as you can justify your actions and they are legal, it's okay to use these services.",

Even despite the fact that you are not personally involved and have nothing to do with it.Is this even possible? You are talking about dirty/clean coins and taint which is not something we as bitcoiners should accept as any kind of standard. There is no such thing as dirty BTC. There is only dirty BTC from the position of the oppressors (governments and their blockchain analysis conspirators). When you issue someone a € or $ banknote, it doesn't go through an inspection for taint, nor do you need to explain the history of it. The same rules must apply to Bitcoins.Back to your question. It's possible that you could \"run into trouble\" with your newly acquired coins depending on what you do with them. Certain centralized exchanges could freeze your coins if they notice a history with crypto casinos and sportsbooks. Therefore, you don't even have to be in possession of stolen coins or crypto that originates from illegal businesses. People have had coins frozen on CEXs that have come from mixers or Wasabi coinjoins. I read a discussion not so long ago where a person who bought tens of thousands of dollars worth of crypto had all of it confiscated on a CEX because he couldn't pass AML requirements and explain the origin.",

If you want to send them to an exchange, then you should probably check the history before just in case.

If you use one that has \"mixing code\", then what this means is that you will get someone else's coins and automatically inherit their history. This makes it possible that you could receive coins straight from a major hack/ransom/ any other illegal activity that you don't want anything to do with.Using Whirlwind this can't happen as we pool all funds together in a multi-sig, the same multi-sig that is also used for withdrawals. Instead of getting \"someone's\" coins, you get coins that could have originated from any deposit into Whirlwind, so you can't be directly linked to anything. The privacy set (amount of deposits from where your mixed coins could have originated from) will become stronger with every executed transaction, so in a very short amount of time after we get some usage we will offer by far the strongest privacy of any mixer on the market.",
