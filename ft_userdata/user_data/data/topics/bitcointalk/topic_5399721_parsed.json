  "content": "I have seen so many threads and topics about what happens to our Bitcoin when we are no more and if our Bitcoin asset can be transferred from one generation to the other. This is a serious topic we need to look into maybe we can consider a good alternative that can save us from total lose of our Bitcoin when we are dead. Based on my shallow knowledge on Cryptocurrency, I think If you don’t create a copy of that key and put that key in a safe place where the people that you trust can find it and know what to do with it, then the wealth that you’ve accumulated in crypto is just going to sit there. Could there be an advenaced way to get this done? The nature of Bitcoin just like other cryptocurrencies that makes it complicated to pass down. Bitcoin is usually stored on the blockchain, a digital ledger that’s formed by a network of computers throughout the world that record transactions, including the exchange of Bitcoin. People usually make these transactions by using public and private keys. Public keys work like bank account numbers, and serve as an address that you can use to send other people crypto. Private keys work like passwords, and are made of unique, extremely long strings of characters that unlock your crypto. Unlike other types of passwords, however, private Bitcoin keys can’t be recovered once they’re lost or forgotten. That means that without those keys, people who are entitled to inherit their loved one’s Bitcoin won’t be able to get it.We can always pass down assets that we already know and love like car, house, clothes etc and they are handled by law but with Bitcoin, it doesn’t really matter what the law says if you don’t actually have access to transfer those assets because there’s no formalized way to pass down Bitcoin, investors are coming up with their own sometimes bizarre protocols to guarantee that their heirs will get their digital assets. These plans can involve everything from locking their keys in secret lockboxes to hiring professional services to manage their crypto for their successors. But other crypto owners are still struggling with what to do, and have yet to find financial advisers who know much about crypto or who can even direct them to someone who does.what happens to your Bitcoin later?Families have been locked out of enormous fortunes because they couldn’t find their loved one’s keys. A man named Michael Moody was unable to unlock the Bitcoin that belonged to his son, Matthew Moody, who died in a plane crash in California. Matthew Moody was an early miner of bitcoin, which means his Bitcoin would be worth a lot of money today.Technically, nothing. Again, Bitcoin is stored on the blockchain, so there’s a permanent record of it. That means your Bitcoin will exist as long as the blockchain exists, and regardless of whether you’re alive or dead. How your loved ones will be able to use that Bitcoin is a different question, one that largely depends on whether they know about it and if they know how to access it.https://www.vox.com/recode/22971265/bitcoin-wills-estate-planning-cryptocurrency-nfts-death",

      "body": "It's really a waste when all of your assets will not be benefited by your loved ones after your death because they are the one who is worth having after you passed away. But the question is, how can we prevent such things to happen to our families where they have no idea how to claim our crypto assets? my answer is simple, you need to check first whether any member of your family can keep a secret and the most trustable ones will be the candidate whether you trust to him some partial details about your wallet, or choose to give him full access once you are gone.",

Before now she taught I was just wasting my time on the forum since she was not seeing any financial benefit. She never knew that I was taking my time to learn and observe from the forum. Just yesterday I enlightened her about wallets. I showed her how much I have and how the market affects my account. I also taught her about passwords and keys. I showed her where I kept the password and keys and told her how to use them in case I am not around. For me she is trustworthy and can handle my finance for the good of the children when I am not around. I just want to make it easy for her because she might not be technically sound to go through any other complex process to retrieve or have access to my wallet.",

It'll be a bit of hassle to spend the coins at the same time because the signed TX would have to be re-generated every time a transaction is made.I don't believe that there is a perfect way of doing so. There's multisig (ie. 2-of-3) but you'll always have to trust that the last key would only be revealed after your death. Transaction size of Multisig is probably a non-issue but I would have some doubts that certain parties won't collude to steal the funds, even if they are only stated to be revealed after death in the will.",

This should be a good option, but there are many other options that can be followed.Another option is Shamir secret sharing means of encryption. Shamir secret sharing can be used to encrypt a private key, a seed phrase or words, letters or characters that you want to encrypt. Encrypt the seed phrase or private key into M-of-N secrets. Having M shares out of N secrets will construct the encrypted seed phrase or private key. Another is the use of M-of-N multisig wallet. But, above all, in this regard, your family needs to know how to go about this, they have to be very conversant with the technical aspects of wallet setup and the right way to go for the recovery.",
