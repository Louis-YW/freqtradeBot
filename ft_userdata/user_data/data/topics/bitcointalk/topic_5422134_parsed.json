  "content": "Hi all. Here's a question. When I go to Exodus crypto wallet, it shows 150 USDT, but when I click on USDT, it shows 0 USDT. What can be the problem and how to fix it? I have not seen this problem before, but for some reason it happened to me for the first time. I also tried to add through MetaMask, but for some reason the wallet was not imported at all. If anyone has had a similar problem before, write how you coped with it in the comments. Thank you in advance for your support and hope you will not have such problems.https://imgur.com/a/iCr4QGY",
