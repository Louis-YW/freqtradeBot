In my speculation I also came to the conclusion that Bitcoin may cross $35k barrier in coming months and if yes then the chances for next bull run will be strong.In that case the next bull run can start anywhere around the last quarter of 2023 and would have high intensity during the halving that will occur in 2024. But, till then we can just be positive about bitcoin's price because in crypto world anything can happen anytime.Quote from: humanvelocity on April 30, 2023, 10:16:40 AMEverything you said makes sense but I’d disagree with the price drop to 20k in this financial period of 2023-24.If you take a close look at the past events that happened few months ago then his speculation isn't incorrect. If for example anything wrong takes place in crypto world the price of Bitcoin will also be affected from that event. The UST's de-pegging and FTX failure are among the worst events that occurred in crypto world.",

Was it based on a random guess or a specific analysis? It is generally difficult to predict Bitcoin's price without adequate analysis and data to create a predictive model. However, I would speculate that Bitcoin will most likely reach 40k USD by the end of this year or remain in its current price range. I am also anticipating the halving event next year, and I believe Bitcoin will begin a bull run from that point, possibly increasing in value to 100k USD, as you mentioned above.",

If by any chance like you said the price actually drops below 20k then you believe I’m gonna invest alot into it because its a guaranteed pump after that lolI will justify the graph below.The chance that the price will fail 20 thousand is very possible. It is likely that we will not see prices of more than 30 thousand all summer if the price does not break through this level now. There is a general trend of support at the very bottom (now 18k), and it gives confidence that sooner or later the price will rise, but now at the moment I would not really hope for a quick rise to 45-48k. Of course, all my words are not a call, and only you are responsible for decisions and actions. It's just my thoughts.",

We are already on 20K+ plus area and struggling to go above 30K. Now you are erasing the possibility of going down below 20K while the price is from 65K when the price dip 16K level before.

Bitcoins follows a 4 year pattern in going from bear to bull market. And guess what this time it is the 4th year. So definitely we will see something big from the coin. Still many of us are complaining regarding the price, when the price crashed from 30k usd to 28k usd. We need to understand that the price will only increase in price, if the demand to buy the coins by the people increases, so let’s see what happens this year.",

Because I don't think that the bullrun will end in 2026 and 2027, especially for now the bullrun has not happened even though there is a lot of belief from some people that the bullrun will occur in 2024, but at the moment the Bitcoin price still looks difficult to pass $30K even though the price prediction which you say is still quite logical to expect in Bitcoin now.",

Btw, we must focus on more realities, which are. the current Bitcoin market reaction and the directions Bitcoin price is pointing to, and since Bitcoin's lowest low is way above your 11k prediction in 2024 it won't be realistic to say, Bitcoin will go below the current price at a low price in 2024 before Bitcoin halved. And my lowest low prediction before Bitcoin halving in 2024 is, 25k and nothing below that and I am preparing my money to be able to buy more Bitcoins when the price reach that discounted price.",

Nearly everyone believes that a bull run will occur by 2024; if this happens, I predict that we will reach an all-time high (ATH) higher than the ATH of bitcoin. If that occurs, bitcoin will increase to about $100,000. If this presumption proves to be true, we may now slightly guess that it will eventually cross $100,000 plus, depending on how the market evolves after the bull run.",

Right now your line looks like the optimistic path, but also goes to show that since $20K price remains in a strong uptrend. I also have my own price target of around $50K this year rather than $40K, as long as the $30K resistance area is breached to the upside. As you say, price will have to decide soon enough whether to correct back to the downside and potentially extend the bear market (or sideways market between $15K and $30K) or otherwise break to the upside. If the direction is to continue upwards I think it'll do it with similar or stronger momentum than the move from $20K to $30K.To me $40K is the conservative outlook, as failing to break $30K this year is the bearish, and $50K is the bullish, so it's more or an average of either bullish or bearish scenarios.",

Imho 11k would mean something very bad and would make 100k impossible for 2024. So no, no 11k. A drop after May, yes (maybes), but not so deep down.",
