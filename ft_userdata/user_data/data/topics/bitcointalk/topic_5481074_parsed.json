If he wants to convert to bitcoin or any other crypto, he know the way he is doing it before and that is what that matters. But as for selling his bikes, he should only accept your local currency than to do what may pay him in problem.",

I don't think anyone here is going to teach your friend how to break the law of the country. If the law catches him up, he will see those who give him that advice as bad influence and also a crime accomplisher. If your friend is a true crypto lover and wants to get crypto accepted in his work shop, the best advice I can give him is to move over to a crypto-friendly country, which will be the best thing for him to do, and that's where he can get his customers who will be willing to pay in crypto, because in his country, where it's not accepted, both he and those who ever want to patronize him using crypto as a method of payment will share the same faith.",

The anti-bitcoin governments are ready to make a scapegoat of defaulters. He shouldn't be overzealous. Best thing he could do now is to DCA and HODL. Selling his and receiving payment can be done via P2P and on a decentralized platform. This is what other people in countries with similar law do.",

He has a motorbike shop. To move to another country will not be the best thing to do. He can just continue to accept fiat and no disadvantage to that. If he is successful in a business in his country, another thing might be what would happen in another country. If he is successful in his business, no need to move to another country. What should make someone leaves his country to another should be because of business opportunity and that is not the case here.",

I would advice you to suggest your friend to not accept Bitcoin or crypto-currency dealings if they're not allowed by government. Any time if authorities get information about his shop then they might take strict actions against him. If he has invested in Bitcoin then that's not an issue he should hold that investment and if he wants to invest more in Bitcoin he can do that as well, but he should never share details about his wallet or investment details with anyone.",

Since Bitcoin is illegal in your friend's country, your friend may be in danger if he openly uses Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin is illegal in your friend's country, use Bitcoin secretly. Your friend has a second hand mobile shop and you ask him to focus on that business and carry on with other activities including investing secretly. It is better for him if he invests bitcoins in secret because if these things become known your friend may get into legal trouble. If ever bitcoin is legalized in your friend's country he can trade bitcoins directly but for now it would be a good move for him to stay away from these things.",

Corruption is rocket high here. Almost every other government employee knows about Bitcoin and they even use Bitcoin for their benefits. But, when they want to destroy someone's life, they accuse them of being a Bitcoin user. Which is illegal and Bitcoin users could be considered as criminals because of that. I often see news like where a group of people were arrested because they were buying selling crypto. They get arrested under money loundering law and then they tie up many others law like they were buying selling drugs with crypto etc etc. The government are always negative about crypto. So, I would suggest not to use crypto in public at all.",

If that friend would be in danger because he's going to reveal his bitcoin ownership by doing that then it's a risky maneuver and in no way in all the possibilities that it's the best thing to do.",

There are many ways one can involve into cryptocurrency in a country where it's not fully accepted. For example he can receive payment in Fiat use it to buy bitcoin through binance and store in his wallet to make more profit when Bitcoin rises rather than exposing himself to the government.

It will be very risky to accept payments openly through Bitcoins or cryptos. If the tax department of your country notices this, they might file a legal case against you. Hence the suitable option for you can be to just tell your really close customers to pay in Bitcoins, otherwise you need to wait till Bitcoins becomes legal in your country.",

In my opinion, he can still carry out activities with Bitcoin and crypto as long as he doesn't use Bitcoin and crypto as a fiat function.Make sure internet access is available. During that time he could still do it. There are several countries in Asia where the government prohibits Bitcoin and crypto, but Bitcoin and crypto activities can still be carried out by Bitcoin and crypto owners as long as their intention is not for something that is detrimental to themselves and those around them.Is your story true or not?",

And what your friend needs to know is the law that applies if Bitcoin or crypto is used as a means of payment, and your friend must know this in detail for his safety and also the risk of being caught by the authorities if he finds out.And to make Bitcoin your business transaction, you and the seller or buyer must have a Bitcoin wallet to be able to carry out transactions with the consent of both parties carried out privately. Plus currently Bitcoin transaction fees are very expensive, and this is also something you have to think about.",

But if you are in a country that does not have definite laws in the use of money you can use the means of exchange that you want, but most countries already have standards for their means of exchange.

Some people advise others to move to a country where bitcoin is legal to live and do business. But honestly, it's bad advice, just because to be able to use bitcoin, we have to leave our homeland and loved ones to go to another country. Where we will have to start everything from scratch and will encounter many difficulties such as differences in language, culture...More importantly, there is no guarantee that our business will be as stable as in our home country. Is that worth the trade-off?In OP's case, if bitcoin is not yet legal in his country then he should continue what he did with bitcoin. He should continue to keep his bitcoin investment private and wait until the day bitcoin is legalized in his country. Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular and it is only a matter of time before the entire world adopts it.",
