Instead of trying harder to be a Robot, learn how to use AI for crypto trading, some are using AI to trade and the emotional side is lower compared to you doing the trades yourself.",

That alone can transform your entire trading journey.  Trading like a robot means you have master all the trading strategies, how and when to stop loss etc. If you know how to manage all this then you can perfectly use the trade like a robot statement but also note that robots don't actually wins 100% of their entire trade but their chances of winning are kind of higher.  Which ever way you want to place your statement or which ever strategy you want to use, I will always advice you trade with caution.",

Although some persons who are really financially stable have conditioned their mind in a way that no matter the amount of money they waste while trading,they still don't feel bad,but that doesn't mean they don't think about the money,but they won't just let it affect them.They do it with double minds,either they gain or they lose,and when they lose,they don't get dissappointed because they already have set their minds that anything can happen.",

Perhaps you should set a target price so that you are certain you aren't gonna change that whatever happens. Robots can do that because they have been programmed that way but we human have some free will to whether change our decision or go for what we believe is right.Practice yourself to control your emotion whenever there's an urge you will get triggered by what's happening in the market. Avoid those things that would cause you to change or trigger your emotion so you can safely decide that your decision is final.",

That's why I won't want yo trade like a bot no matter what. Bots have got there accuracy no doubt, they could keep up with the times and launch in immediately a signal is hit but, its got flaws of jumps and stop lose isn't hit then you find yourself relying on a bot that has malfunctioned and your funds liquidated.With humans, its a whole different story. The only thing that could go wrong is not being sure or you not watching your screen when the moves play out. Better still, you could have a notification in place to remind you. Your emotions are not always against you, some times they could be a tool to keep you out of a bad market condition.",

Emotions are not the problem, understanding of the market is. You can compare this to someone who is investing in bitcoin for the first time; they understand a bit of how it works and expect it to rise as indicated by history, but they panic when the price plummets or even dips a little and sell off. Same person few cycles in would not be bothered by such price action.This is same with a trader, after years of trading and gaining experience you learn to control your emotions and decide when to act on it and when not to.",

You can't be a good trader if you don't have patience, having emotions isn't a wrong thing but having no control over them is probably a bad thing and it needs to be taken care of. You don't specifically need to have no emotions, but your emotions should not have much influence on your decisions or you will probably be at loss.They say that practice makes a man perfect, so maybe you need to practice being patient more, you can find some tutorials about how you can build up your patience level and follow that, once you learn to become more patient, you should continue with your trading again.",
