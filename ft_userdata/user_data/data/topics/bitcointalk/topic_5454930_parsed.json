The OP clearly said he is not going first if you are not trusted. Sending money to your service is the equivalent of sending money first and hoping for money back next. If OP finds the people he is looked for, then he will do 1 : 1 with them and not face any fee like what he will face when using your service, other than the network fee to send the BTC. I'm not against proposing solutions to services when they are applicable, however this advertisement is not applicable as it does not meet the requirements stated in the OP.",
