India is the largest exporter of peanuts, so I think there will be some guys on this forum who may own peanut company or are in touch with people who are into this business. We may purchase up to 1 metric ton at first. If everything will happen remotely, (buy, load ship, receive) we can use an escrow from this forum.",

As per my understanding, this is not the place to find someone dealing in agri-based products. You can check this website for more information about your requirements. You can check https://www.indiamart.com/ and find out other payment options. I might be wrong, let's see if anyone here can help you which I doubt.",
