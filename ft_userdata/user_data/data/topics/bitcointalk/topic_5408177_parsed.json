Miners MUST have a stable incoming voltage typically between 208-240VAC. Prolonged operation below or above that range will quickly kill the miners.",

How good is the power when it is on?Sorry I should have been more specific, the power outages are often, and when the power is on, it is typically around 220v but sometimes fluctuates and may fall below that.Quote from: NotFuzzyWarm on July 30, 2022, 08:43:38 PMIf power outages are a very frequent thing then you need to get power that is not tied to your grid. eg solar, wind, small scale hydro etc.A small scale hydro is not plausible to me, Wind? It is not windy around where I reside so it may be a futile effort to want to harness the power of the wind. I just considered the generators powered by PMS or diesel but that will not be economical. So the best options for me i guess according to my location is Solar, and Gas powered generators.Quote from: NotFuzzyWarm on July 30, 2022, 08:43:38 PMMiners MUST have a stable incoming voltage typically between 208-240VAC.

I mean let's just assume it's 12 hours a day, that means your ROI time is 2x, and given that we all are in a race against difficulty, you may never ROI before the gear becomes completely worthless.The issues I explained earlier can be solved, you can protect your gears from spikes and drops using some tools that are not very expensive, so the real question boils down(How many hours in a day do the power outage last and how much do you pay per Kwh for when the power is back) without knowing these exact two answers, it's just a shot in the dark.",

Please suggest any and all possible solutions to this challenge for a bitcoiner interested in giving mining a trial in a country that still experience power outages? One of the keys to success for a prospective miner looking to start mining bitcoin in a country that experience power outages is for the individual to use multiple alternate sources of energy. The miner would have have to map out where in his or her country where this alternative sources of power is easy available, cheap, and favourable local laws too. For example, I did a thread on this some time ago on ideal crypto mining locations in my country where power outages is experienced",

Maybe in this situation where there is a shortage or loss of electricity, the only solution I see here is if you have the money to buy a generator or a solar panel, it can be a solution to this problem.I don't see anything else that is good but this is only if the scenario is this difficult especially if you are still a bitcoin miner.",

Since you will not directly know which one it is you will have a lot of maintenance work for the small profit that you could get during the dark hours.

In places where power cuts are common it is a must for miners to get electricity uninterruptedly by using solar energy or using a generator. Frequent power cuts mean you live in an economically difficult place. You need to calculate your costs well while mining in this case. It can be advantageous for mining if you learn solar power installation. If you calculate that the energy stored by the sun is enough for mining definitely do it.",
