Or when you download a file and you run it, if it's virus it will infect your device and spy every of your activites.Quote- Do not reveal your forum related email address on your profile or anywhere in the internet,It's worth to mention if you use \"report to moderator\" you're reveal your email address to every moderators and administrators in this forum. Although the moderators said they wouldn't harm your email address, but you're still need to trust them in this situation.",

So always make sure the link is correct what you are visiting. Don't keep the same password for more than one account on the internet. Always set a long password with smaller, capital, special characters, etc. And you can store your bitcoin address here- Stake your Bitcoin address here, this will help you to recover your account if unfortunately, it hacked.",

There must be a simple way to secure account?If you are talking about bitcointalk forum account, than you should first use unique strong password that was never used before for any other account.I would also choose new email account, or sub-account that is dedicated only for this purpose and it should have 2fa protection, maybe Proton mail would be good.You can also sign a message with your Bitcoin address that proves ownership of address and account connected with it.Most important thing is to never click on any links received in forum personal messages, even if it's coming from established members, to avoid phishing attacks.",

The rest only depends on your habits of using the device and surfing the internet safely and wisely against all the risks that exist.After all, you don't have to save your login on your PC or on your Android just because you want it to be faster and more practical when you login, so it's only about you and your habits. The point is, 2FA has not yet been integrated into forum and maybe it will be implemented in the future on EpochTalk or maybe not forever.",
