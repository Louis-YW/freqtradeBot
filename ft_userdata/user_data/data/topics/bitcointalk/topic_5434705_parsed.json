  "content": "Or at least these sites with the whole database from people personal and \"secret private keys and mnemonics\". All the people who made them are scammers, even ian coleman shouldn't exist in its form. How is private when all people keys, adresses and all are publicly exposed in the freakin open web? No wonder why so many people got scammed and this is utter sh.t. I absolutely mean it while im trying to find my long lost adress before someone else do it. Even if you think a bit more out of the box you can get much more relevant adresses in ian coleman,forget all other databases exposed publicly. Crypto isn't same anymore, just throw an eye on the coleman wsite traffic between 2020 and mid of 2022...all these dorment accounts didn't wake up, they were scammed, by who its obvious. Prove me wrong that holding crypto is secure these days.",

This website generates keys for all of those numbers, spread out over pages of 128 keys each.This website doesn't actually have a database of all private keys, that would take an impossible amount of disk space. Instead, keys are procedurally generated on the fly when a page is opened. The page number is used to calculate which keys should be on that page. using math you should be able to work out how many possible private keys there could ever beand to check them all. how much time it would takeits like115,792,089,237,316,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000imagine you tried 1million a second checks115,792,089,237,316,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000seconds to perform1,929,868,153,955,270,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000   minute32,164,469,232,587,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000   hour1,340,186,218,024,490,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000   day3,671,743,063,080,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000   year104,906,944,659,451,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000   35 years26,226,736,164,862,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000   4 descendant generationsyep in 140 year there are still26,226,736,164,862,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000   combinations you have not triedtry to realise how big that number is..trying to find your random number in that number is going to take anyone more then they can imaginethere is soo much entropy/ breadth of possibilities its not simply finding a pin in a haystack its finding a specific grain of carbon that could be on any planet in the universeBut you're looking for a single adress privkey, even if it takes you 10 years to find it, gonna be worthy, i can imagine that some even can use couple machines to browse in those wsites searching for a single adress, you need to find 1 with balance inside, also who gave the rights to loyce for example to list all these information with balances and public keys in it? Okay its not the private, but still is enough to give someone a lead, also im sure he's affiliated with one if those sites. It's just not right, yes you can see it in blockchain but its different when someone made a whole list arranged by balance and alphabetically.",

I think little chance in case like this turns to enormous.Also the fact that loyce answer was ad hominem is pure example that it isn't completely like you described it.Also im curious whats the mystery behind the huge traffic on sites like this still will add ian coleman tool, between 2020 and 2022? How come sleeping adresess got drained with huge amounts in the span of couple months?",
