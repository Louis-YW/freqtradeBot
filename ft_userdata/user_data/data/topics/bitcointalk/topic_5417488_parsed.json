If we are talking about the cheap fees and then yeah even binance needs you to pay a few cents to deliver your transaction. The problem is these days there are so many smartcontract coins that offered better utilities compared with the old coins. that's why even some old coins were dead. It's caused by the demand was migrating to the new coins with more utilities. That reminds me with namecoin too.",

      "body": "I just wonder why this coin has not made any noise this past few years and maybe because they cannot seem to find any partners to make their coins more usable or have some number of utilities for it to be used. sadly this is not the case for Litecoins and it remained underrated for the past years since they don't have working developments or some updates to further escalate the number of people using it. What they really need to do nowadays is to make partnerships with some top coin owners or businesses in order not to be left behind and LTC price will only depend on bitcoins price nowadays which is not recommendable for investment.",

Considering some of the shit coins yes you can claim that it is undervalued but you need to market the coin to the new users to make it relevant. We can ask coblee if we can expect any major announcements  .",

For classical investor this asset fits perfectly, because it has already proved itself as the most reliable and as growing over time. I try to buy LTC at drawdowns like BTC and ETH, as I think that Litecoin will be worth $500 in next 5 years and it has less chance of scam than 99.99% of altcoins.",
