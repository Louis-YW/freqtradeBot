  "content": "Each time the market kills Long- Short (2-headed long beard, pump-dump in 1 note). Like the last 2 days. Then the market will have no volume.=> The reason is that people have been killed all their money, so they don't FOMO to create volume. And people with money are also afraid.After killing long-short, there is usually an uptrend, essentially because the \"market makers\" use their own money to pump in to create fomo, stimulate greed so that they can refill the market.",
