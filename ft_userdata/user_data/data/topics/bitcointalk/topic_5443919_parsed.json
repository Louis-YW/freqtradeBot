      "body": "The only way to get profits in mining is if you have a low or almost free electricity rate. That's the only way but since the Bitcoin price of Bitcoin is too volatile and the block halving is coming there is a big chance that the bitcoin price rises it can give more profit to those who mine at low-cost power. Another thing to ensure profit is to keep holding your mined coins and sell them at the right time.",

Because you will end up wasting time, fatigue and money.      But if you know that your electricity consumption is really cheap there, maybe somehow you can make money, but of course that depends on the price of bitcoin in the market as far as I know.",

Most of it is on credit.Compute North went bankrupt, Greenridge sold off $74 mils of equipment, Core Scientific needed life support cash injection to stay afloat, Iris Energy went into debt 100 million to avoid bankruptcy, the spike from 16k to 24k  saved half of those companies that have not learned a thing and keep expanding on credit and debt.

Mining is still banned in private homes, but there is no control if you do not consume a lot of electricity. The only gear that still makes sense draws 3000W, that's 72Kwh a day and 2160 kwh a month!Since the average American house who are the leader in consumption burns only 800kwh, I seriously doubt you can mine and not get a control, you simply can't mine without consuming a ton of energy! I only have like 250-300 kwh a month, no way I could disguise a miner.But, what country is that, cheap energy and a ban on private mining? Doesn't ring a bell!Quote from: ETFbitcoin on March 10, 2023, 12:07:18 PMAlthough using GPU or few USB ASIC is valid alternative.At 5c/kwh you make 10 cents a day with a $1500 card, better play the lottery with a sha256 stick.",

Asic itself is a little high capitalized but I think it's a more effective tool to use if you focus on Bitcoin. Maximum profit can be obtained by taking a little profit from mining results to make investment assets.",
