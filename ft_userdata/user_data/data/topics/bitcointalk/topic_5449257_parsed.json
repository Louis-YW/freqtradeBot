      "body": "I don't see anything wrong with this technique other than that it becomes slightly more annoying to restore a lost wallet (you need to go to two different physical locations to collect all of the words).Anyway, that's not true multisig since it's not cryptographically guaranteed to be so. Multisig refers to how transactions need at least X number of signers, and has nothing to  do with seed phrases. This is more like a redundant form of Shamir's Secret Sharing.",

If you are looking for security it would be better to use a single seed phrase and add a pass phrase to it for extra security. The single sig with passphrase is much easier to backup or save because you will have to save 3 things (key, seed phrase and passphrase) whereas for the 2 of 3 multi signature you will have Atleast 6 keys to save or backup (3 keys, 3 seed phrase). The transaction fee is also higher for 2 of 3 multi sig (it needs Atleast two different signers) than a single sig.",

The basic problem is that finding any one device reduces the the search space to only 8 words. Methods such as Shamir's Secret Sharing are better because you gain no information about the seed from any single device.Watch this: Bitcoin Q&A: Why is Seed Splitting a Bad Idea?",

That's the recommended manner to do what you want. Splitting a seed phrase in multiple places, or splitting one part twice, one of which can be merged with another that is also split similarly introduces complexity, which is the enemy of security.",

Let's say I find the piece of paper (because I am a super clever detective).What can I do then? I will try to restore the wallet and I will see that it is empy. Why? Because you will have added a passphrase that ONLY YOU know.So even if I stole your seed phrase, I would also need the passphrase.P.S. The passphrase is a part of your wallet. It is not a password that is related to the application that you use. It is attached to your seed phrase, in order to create the seed for your wallet.",
