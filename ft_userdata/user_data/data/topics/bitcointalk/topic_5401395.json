  "content": "Block published a very interesting report on Bitcoin. QuoteBitcoin was originally created as a currency for the internet, where people could send and receive money without going through a financial institution.In recent years, the dominant narratives surrounding bitcoin have been solely focused on its potential as a means to make money. We sought to dig into these narratives further and provide a resource for decision makers to better understand people’s knowledge and perceptions of bitcoin across different geographies, genders, and ages. In early 2022, Block, Inc. partnered with Wakefield Research to survey 9,500 people in 14 countries across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC.The results show that a large portion of respondents also see bitcoin as a means of payment, whether that’s sendingmoney home to family or buying goods and services — in line with its founding principles. Additionally, we found that the common perceptions of bitcoin as male-dominated are not as stark and disappear completely in many cases,with a broad and diverse community of people who are enthusiastic and consider themselves knowledgeable about bitcoin.It is a very interesting report, and one of the topics resonated with my thinking about bitcoin: Quote2 EducationIsKey:Knowledge Feeds Optimism and ParticipationThe higher people rate their level of knowledge, the more optimistic they are about bitcoin’s future. People in Nigeria, India, Vietnam, and Argentina have the highest rates of optimism globally about bitcoin’s future.Lack of bitcoin knowledge is the top reason people don’t buy, followed by concerns related to security, price volatility, and finally an uncertain regulatory landscape globally.The network effect is real. Globally, those who don’t own bitcoin but know someone who does are much more likely to say they plan on buying bitcoin in the next year. I guess the whole point of participating in this forum, as I said many times,, is all about knowledge. Also, as highlighted in the report, lack of knowledge can be an obstacle in buying bitcoin, to the detriment of the part of the population that could potentially benefit the more from his adoptions: It is very interesting to have a read on this report many aspects are considered, and I guess many topics can be discussed starting from it.",

For me, they don't brave to buy Bitcoin because of FUDs besides don't understand what Bitcoin is. Once people read the FUDs, next they are only looking for more information about the FUDs. So, they actually get more misleading information about Bitcoin because they read from the wrong sources (hater sources).  Quote- Too much price volatilityPeople don't understand that the volatility even becomes an advantage. Without significant volatility, people can't gain big profits. Just imagine if BTC price is similar to the stablecoins price. How we can gain profits with no big range between top and dip.",

      "body": "I'm more surprised about this statisticOn both EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and APAC (Asia-Pacific) regions, women are more expert among her friends and her familiy, this mean many women out there are really understand about Bitcoin and technology. I thought it's otherwise because female seems doesn't want to touch anything that technical or technology related due to hard to understand.It's just sad how after 13-14 years Bitcoin has been existed, there's still a good amount people still never heard about Bitcoin word.I would like to answer the reasons to not buy Bitcoin based on my own opinionQuote1. Don't know enough about itFair reason.Quote2. Cybersecurity/theft risksThis still have a correlation with the number 1 because mostly who doesn't learn and understand about computer related, still think any online stuffs is easy to get hacked. But if they understand about cryptography and SHA-256 or Bitcoin algorithm, they will know Bitcoin is almost resistant due to hack. The truth reason why there's many Bitcoin hack is holding their coin on exchange or using fake wallet.Quote3. Too much price volatilityThe reason why many people interested with Bitcoin as an investment commodities is volatility, if Bitcoin price can increase 10% in a day, then don't be sad or surprised if tomorrow the price will decrease 10% or more.Quote4. Uncertain regulatory outlookMake sense, imagine you have trading and holding Bitcoin for a long time since your country are allow of use Bitcoin. But someday when you want to withdraw your fund on banks, they freeze your funds since they said it's linked with Bitcoin and they ban Bitcoin due to regulation at that time.Quote5. Too expensiveDoesn't make sense, you can buy a small portion of Bitcoin e.g. 0.001 and so on, no one force you to buy 1 Bitcoin.Quote6. Don't know how to buy itDoesn't make sense, you can search about and there's many exchanges ads appeared offering to buy Bitcoin.Quote7. No practical use for itDoesn't make sense, it's due to low knowledge.Quote8. The environmental impact is too highDoesn't make sense, Bitcoin is only use a tiny energy consumption comparing to other industries, why does the government/people didn't shutdown or complain about those industry energy usage? Moreover now Bitcoin mining will using more friendly energy called Crusoe Energy.Quote from: bitmover on May 03, 2022, 04:45:35 PMQuote9. It's too much for long term investmentDoesn't make sense, look at the history.Quote10. Interest in a different cryptocurrencyThis is the most bad reason since they're prefer to buy shitcoins over Bitcoin.",

How it's possible since both of El Salvador and Central African Republic is already accepting Bitcoin as a legal tender, while Panama they have proposed to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, though the Panama's president fail to sign the crypto bill, but the top Panama's banks is Bitcoin friendly. I guess accepting Bitcoin as a legal tender doesn't need a huge holders or demand from the citizens, but the government can do it yourself whether they want or not.Quote from: https://block.xyz/2022/btc-report.pdfPeople with lower incomes,regardless of where they live in theworld, recognize bitcoin’s utility asa payments ecosystem, seeing it asa way to send remittances and buygoods and services.This proving Bitcoin isn't expensive and can only be used as investment to protect against inflation, but people with lower incomes can still buy Bitcoin and use it as a currency. I don't know how much they consider a low incomes, but most exchange usually charge ridiculous fee and a transaction fee to send Bitcoin to another wallet cost you around $0.5-$1, how can the low income people survive from that? My assumption they're using Lightning network since the fees is really cheaper, but there's no survey about lightning network on the report.",

      "body": "Don't know enough about Bitcoin, and the ways of securing it will likely be our biggest obstacle. Users here like to talk about scalability, and various other limitations to the code, but those can definitely be reworked. However, I don't see enough work being done towards simplifying Bitcoin so that the general public can just pick it up like fiat. Now, I do understand that this is partly a unrealistic expectations, since securing Bitcoin is always going to be complex, especially if you aren't relying on a third party. I imagine in years to come we'll start seeing banks or the equivalent of banks which will offer to secure your Bitcoin for you, which could actually increase adoption. However, this breaks one of the golden rules for many of us, and one of the reasons why Bitcoin is unique, and revolutionary. It allows you to be your own bank, which is brilliant for us that do our due diligence, and don't mind being responsible. However, not everyone will be comfortable with that. Lets face it, how many people in the general public break security rules all the time. I would say the vast majority do. People in my family have such weak passwords that I would be able to guess in under an hour. I know that, since I've done it before to prove a point. Yet, they still didn't change it to a more complex one. How many people write passwords down, right next to their computer for example? At that point there's no point even having a password. I've been saying this for a while now, and I do believe there's others that are in support of it. I don't think the concept of Bitcoin is at fault, it's generally how uneducated we are as people about security. I'd love to say I had a solution to this, but I really don't. We can simplify the wallets, Bitcoin to a certain extent, but there's a ceiling to that. Hardware wallets are something that has changed the game a little bit. They've provided a way for people to use Bitcoin without knowing much about securing it. They just trust the device. This is all well, and good, but the only problem with that is trying to convince these people to use open source hardware wallets, and acknowledge there are still risks of using them. As the saying goes, complacency is one's worst enemy. If the statistics are to be believed in the OP, they agree with me. Over 80% of people don't go into Bitcoin because of not understanding i.e Bitcoin being too complex or not knowing how to secure their Bitcoin. That's our mass adoption right there gone, and therefore is the biggest stumbling block. I believe every other problem we might have, can be solved given time, and adoption. The more people that come into Bitcoin, the more urgency there is to solve any other superficial problem, and then we'll have even more people lending a hand to solve it.  For example, too expensive or don't know how to buy can be solved. The more demand, the more exchanges, the easier it becomes to buy. However, for it to be considered to expensive is baffling to me, since you can buy any denomination you want, but convincing the public of that will be a little more difficult. I imagine, we won't be using 1 Bitcoin in the future, but talking in Satoshi's. That way, it removes the idea that 1 Bitcoin is too expensive, since most people I talk to have an obsession with whole numbers, and owning that 1 Bitcoin. It's like they think holding anything less, isn't worth holding. It's a weird problem, that will likely be overcome with some terminology changes. Quote from: Despairo on June 05, 2022, 03:22:01 AMQuote3. Too much price volatilityThe reason why many people interested with Bitcoin as an investment commodities is volatility, if Bitcoin price can increase 10% in a day, then don't be sad or surprised if tomorrow the price will decrease 10% or more. The reason for this is, because I would deem us in either the early bird catagory, i.e early adopter or the speculative investor period. It isn't ready to be a main use currency right now, although it can be used as one, it isn't as enticing as other options for people. Quote from: Despairo on June 05, 2022, 03:22:01 AMQuote4. Uncertain regulatory outlookMake sense, imagine you have trading and holding Bitcoin for a long time since your country are allow of use Bitcoin. But someday when you want to withdraw your fund on banks, they freeze your funds since they said it's linked with Bitcoin and they ban Bitcoin due to regulation at that time. Yeah, that's a concern for many. However, if we look at the recent war with Russia, and the West you'll see that many people had trouble withdrawing their fiat money. So, this isn't exclusive to Bitcoin. However, I will admit that's a concern. Quote from: Despairo on June 05, 2022, 03:22:01 AMQuote7. No practical use for itDoesn't make sense, it's due to low knowledge.Yeah, directly correlates with number one. Quote from: Despairo on June 05, 2022, 03:22:01 AMQuote8. The environmental impact is too highDoesn't make sense, Bitcoin is only use a tiny energy consumption comparing to other industries, why does the government/people didn't shutdown or complain about those industry energy usage? Moreover now Bitcoin mining will using more friendly energy called Crusoe Energy.This is the most bad reason since they're prefer to buy shitcoins over Bitcoin.This is the most difficult one to answer. At the moment, we're very environment friendly, and every company has to appear green. It's an actual selling point now if your company is doing things green. Now, I think the Bitcoin argument of us using too much energy is unfounded, but we should probably be thinking about ways of improving it regardless. The only problem with this accusation is it's hard to prove, and hard to disapprove, but as soon as people hear it, that's what they believe. Therefore, it's not a problem of proving otherwise, it's convincing the general public that it's not true, which is a lot harder. Quote from: nurilham on June 04, 2022, 11:12:59 PMPeople don't understand that the volatility even becomes an advantage. Without significant volatility, people can't gain big profits. Just imagine if BTC price is similar to the stablecoins price. How we can gain profits with no big range between top and dip. Hmm, it really only becomes an advantage if you're a speculative trader. If you are receiving your monthly wage in Bitcoin, you ideally don't want that to be going up, and down. Especially, if you're using it as a currency, and not a reserve currency. Some people already live pay check to pay check, so adding some volatility into the mix, isn't good. As long as massive amounts of volatility exist, Bitcoin will not be adopted by the masses. Luckily for us, Bitcoin is naturally deflationary, and the block rewards reduce at given intervals, which effectively introduce volatility i.e Bitcoin should in theory get less volatility the longer it exists.

Instead, convince them they've a choice, and basically release propaganda about the options that don't work into their favour. So, yeah I'd say it's common psychology for people rebelling when outright being limited.",

Why do people choose Bitcoin for an equitable economy?What is needed for more adoption?Why is Bitcoin the top cryptocurrency?I've learned that people are using it for investment reasons compared to utility reasons. The comparison between the different income groups has shown that it's all about the belief in the system. I think I see the importance of the people with lower incomes choosing it because they believe in its actual use, unlike the higher income groups that are using it entirely for investment reasons like diversification of their assets.Having no gender divide also is being discussed in the report, and it's pretty good to see that it's not anywhere affected by that. I mean, why should it matter anyway? We should all be equal.More and more people have always seen cryptocurrency as something that could potentially help people's lives. Still, for that to happen, I agree that education about it would serve the best purpose towards having a better cryptocurrency experience for everyone.",

I totally agree with Block Inc report that lack of knowledge is the biggest problem of bitcoin adoption. In the case of Nigeria, based on local  geographic metrics,Delta, Anambra, Bayelsa, Edo, and Enugu states rank as the top five states with the highest interest in Bitcoin in Nigeria. And these states are located in the Southern part of the country which has a higher number of literates than the Northern part.

The Northern part of Nigeria has the highest number of Muslims and some of them still practice the Sharia law. Most of them don't have interest in modernization hence, they reject any form of payments that they perceive promotes  Westernization. Like other Islamic countries the northern region is not accepting Bitcoin because of religious beliefs. While the Southern part are mostly Christians that have embraced Western cultures. This has affected their openness to accept alternate means of payment such as Bitcoin.",

You may be unaware (though not relevant to the topic) that 40% of the world's population still does not have access to the Internet...The problem is not that it is difficult to get information about bitcoin in our time, but that people may not have the desire to look for this information and the most common laziness.I think many will agree with me that people are different: Some, with their diligence, get what they want, be it information or something material. Others, even with all the possibilities, for example, the presence of internet and access to info about bitcoin, under no circumstances do even minimal actions to study info about it. Therefore, it seems to me that in the form that bitcoin now exists, never 100 % of the world's population will not use it. This will require greatly simplifying everything for the benefit of users (as suggested by  Square, for example), but the question is whether bitcoin will remain the same after that.You also correctly noticed that many people don't physically have access to internet. Of course, with the development of technology, their number is decreasing, but still, not so fast due to hard-to-reach locations. I would also like to draw attention to the level of PC proficiency and the lack of it. Even now, when a PC is relatively cheap, not everyone has it, which also prevents bitcoin's spread. You can also add those people who have a PC at their disposal, but the level of ownership of this still doesn't allow them to start recognizing and using bitcoin. Although the widespread use of smartphones may partly compensate for this, but you understand that this is a completely different level of security and safety of funds.",

Their are countries that had ban Bitcoin because of the threat it pose on currency of most countries. The restriction of Bitcoin in many countries had been because of fear of dumping fiat currency of such country because Bitcoin is currently serving as an investment and also a means of digital currency. https://www.bitcanuck.ca/blog/crypto-blog-canada/bitcoin-status-worldwide/Due to the volatility of Bitcoin many investors had considered it as a good investment just like other financial instruments. https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingOnBitcoin/comments/7amkn9/how_many_people_are_using_bitcoin_by_country_map/",

This will require greatly simplifying everything for the benefit of users...I would just separate possession and use as two different categories when it comes to Bitcoin. Consequently, I have no doubt that at some point 10% of the world's population will own Bitcoin, but those who will try to use it as a currency will be much smaller, as is the case today. Some kind of absolute adaptation is something that will probably never happen, no matter how simple things are. Some people have very negative attitudes towards Bitcoin, and they find it difficult or never to change their attitudes.",

Without significant volatility, people can't gain big profits.Actually you're wrong.If there would be lower volatility then the small traders will no longer earn so much (may no longer worth it) and the investors will earn steadily (even the faint hearted ones).If there would be no volatility at all (which is probably not possible because of Bitcoin scarcity) then people would earn from loaning, like they do with fiat now.So no matter what, people would keep getting profits. Just it will be different people and/or different ways, that's all.",

They are better prepare to lose anything they have when invested their money in Bitcoin. We all know that Bitcoin is really high risk investment, even men made long consideration to decide invest Bitcoin, but it doesn't apply to the women. The long process or consideration on men's mind made women become one step ahead, and that really makes sense when the data show us the fact.",
