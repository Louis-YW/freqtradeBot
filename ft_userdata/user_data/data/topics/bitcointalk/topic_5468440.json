Well there are some projects like Ballet wallet that is a physical storage of bitcoin like a cold wallet that you can redeem when you want or exchange it.It is not my favorite option but at least it is something more or less tested.The main problem with this approach: is susceptible to scams and falsifications. So IMO it is better to stick to regular software wallets.",

It's the same as saying we should modify the Bitcoin fixed supply to make it inflationary. The point of creating Bitcoin in the first place was so that it would self-sovereign and separate from the traditional finance world (with zero links to things like CBDC, banknotes, etc that you're proposing).",

Bitcoin was created as a decentralized software digital currency and store of value, Bitcoin was also designed to operate as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. There is no need for burning after the rapid development of Bitcoin, 21 million BTC since it was created can make Bitcoin so valuable.The Bitcoin system is very different from other coins, BNB for example which has a feature called BNB Burn, Binance periodically buys back and burns some of the BNB, the aim is to reduce the total supply. This mechanism is carried out with the aim of increasing the value of BNB over time. Bitcoin is electronic currency, not paper currency.

Burning those tokens with smart contract is doable because they are centralized blockchains and developers can use their smart contracts to seize your tokens, burn them, do whatever they can with smart contracts.With Bitcoin, you only can lose it by losing the private key. There is no Bitcoin developer can burn your bitcoin, they can not seize your bitcoin in your non custodial wallets. Simply, it's unable task for Bitcoin developers because Satoshi Nakamoto did not design Bitcoin blockchain with centralized smart contracts.Lost bitcoins are gift for everyone.Quote from: satoshi on June 21, 2010, 05:48:26 PMLost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more.  Think of it as a donation to everyone.",

So that this lam cannot be used in electronic form, but only after conversion to digital. Now I’ll go and dare, I’ll feed the dolphins, I’ll come back and clarify if it’s not completely clear. I'm feeling a little seasick, I'm writing from the Strait of MalaccaWell, that is, we burn 1 million out of 21 of one, instead, paper banknotes are distributed around the world with good protection, each banknote is in the register, if it is not there, then that’s it, that block is not there, the quantity decreases, and the price goes up. Is that right? If the banknote is lost, burned, eaten, sniffed, then reissue or not, complete erasure of the block.(google translated)Op, what you're suggesting doesn't make sense. Bitcoin was designed as a purely electronic version of cash money, not meant to be physical like coins or banknotes. If we revert to paper banknotes, we'll revisit the old problems that Bitcoin aims to solve. Who would be the issuer of these banknotes? Who would guarantee their authenticity? What safeguards would they have against counterfeiting? Bitcoin addressed all these issues with cryptographic signing, which is impossible to replicate in physical form.",
