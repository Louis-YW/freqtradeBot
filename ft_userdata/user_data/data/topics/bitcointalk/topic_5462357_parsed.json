  "content": "Hello,My name is Yuri, the owner of FinderVPN.com and Top3VPN.com services. First, a little background. FinderVPN was founded by me in April 2021. The main and fundamental task of the service is to provide the audience with as much information as possible about a particular VPN provider, which is directly stated in each review. In addition to reviews, interactive tools have also been developed for conveniently searching for VPN servers by location and country, which is certainly a unique and unparalleled tool at the moment, which is popular among site visitors. Another feature is the division of VPN services into categories and options (such as Kill Switch, IPv6 leak protection, DNS protection, and many others), helping a potential client find a provider that suits his needs. The idea of creating this kind of service was based on my experience in the VPN industry (more than 13 years). After the successful launch of the project, 4 months later I decided to create an additional project - Top3VPN.com, the idea of which was to support FinderVPN and increase the audience and, accordingly, profit from affiliate sales. In fact, both services work in tandem with each other, using the same affiliate links. Just so you know. It turns out that both websites generate profit, but each site has its own traffic ( essentially almost the same ).Starting from January 2023, I had a chance to launch my own VPN service, as an investor appeared ready to support my idea and business project. Due to the fact that now I have practically no time left to support FinderVPN and Top3VPN services, I decided to sell them and transfer them to other hands for further development.The price for Top3VPN service is $2,500.The price for FidnerVPN service is $4,500.If you are ready to buy the whole business (FinderVPN + Top3VPN), I will give you a good discount and sell both services at a price of $6,000 (or USDT).So. the income generates traffic from both services:www.findervpn.comandwww.top3vpn.comAs I said, both sites use the same affiliate links and complement each other.To keep resources healthy, you need to:a) pay every month for the web server (hosting) on which the sites are located. About $30/month for both websites.b) pay every month for corporate mail for both services: office@findervpn.com and office@top3vpn.com Â - about $24/month for both emails.c) renew domains for both services every year. About $35/yearThese are all expenses for both services.Since I'm mostly a developer, I don't know much about marketing, so I left this job to professionals in this field. I invested in advertising through an advertising agency, an Israeli company that I can introduce you to if you want them to re-engage in advertising and promotion of the service. At your choice. As I know, they started advertising in turn. One - two months through GoogleAds, then through Bing and Yandex, another month and then through social networks. Both websites were also analyzed by an advertising company that set up and coordinated all actions there. I know that they have tested their own analytics tools.Since January of this year, I'm fully engaged in a new business and therefore no longer invest in both projects. I hope you continue my work and promote the business to great heights.By the way, I will be with you for 2 months (maximum 3 months) and help in all directions. Including support for the entire architecture, explaining to you (or your developer) where, what and how is developed. For free.If you have any other questions, I'll be happy to answer.You can contact me at office@findervpn.com or office@top3vpn.comBest regards,Yuri Sari, Head of ResearchFinderVPN.com",
