      "body": "If you're talking about mining with GPU, then you must be referring to altcoin mining. If that's the case, the altcoin mining board would be more suitable for this topic.That being said, I do expect the difficulty to drop, but won't be that instant. Some miners probably have access to a good energy source (very cheap, for example), which allows them to continue mining despite losing some dollars every day. Or, they just believe that the condition will get better and speculate that it is better to hoard some sats from now on and sell them later.",

If you see the high difficulty it means more people still mining and more units are produced and you know most well-known companies like Bitmain always developed machines that can mine faster and more efficiently. I'm sure they also run them to get benefits while selling them.",

I saw that too, but unless you have really great per kWh rates, it doesn't seem worth the capital.  The XP's are about 3X more but are about 4X more profitable per day given a normal per kWh price range.  Plus, I think energy prices are going back up a bit so whatever is there will be squeezed a bit more.",

If you want to accumulate coins you can just buy them directly without mining. If you are mining at break-even you are pretty much losing money since you are wearing out your gear.Every hour your gear runs it increases the chances of something getting burn't out such as a fan bearing going back. If you want to invest in crypto, just buy it directly. Only people who mine at a loss are maybe those that have difficulites buying crypto due to regulations, in that case its worth mining at a loss.
