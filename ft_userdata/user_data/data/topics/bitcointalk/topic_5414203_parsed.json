Well you can use coin gecko to find new projects and open their website to check if they have any available testnet task, right now a project called diva protocol is holding testnet on its website but its very very challenging.

Projects running testnet not all will distribute rewards to their test users. They only distribute to actual testers and give comments so that they can improve their product better than before mainnet, test users regularly interact on their testnet community. The fact that you do not receive the reward may be that you did not analyze the project before joining, secondly, that you did not make an effort to help them perfect the product, but only participated superficially in the hope of receiving a reward. Testnet is not like the airdrop you are participating in, just spam and you will be rewarded, it requires seriousness and diligence to implement.",

It's a form of supporting the project in its early stage. Like the usual airdrops before although mechanics are now different.If you found it worth your time, it's your decision to participate in those. Much better to be involved on their discussion channel and talk with their community to see if it's worth continuing involving there.",

Coming out with a project and yet going to get some profits after being launched, it's a way to adjust and get some free help from the community.

In addition, very often you have to wait a long time, it happens that more than a year before the main network is launched, after which an award will be distributed to testnet participants.
