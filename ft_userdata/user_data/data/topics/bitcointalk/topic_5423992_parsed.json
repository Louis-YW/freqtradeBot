      "body": "It's a painful ordeal to bear especially if this allegations and accusations are coming from someone you've attached or opened up to. Everyone has his or her methods of dealing with false accusations and let me go personal on this as it looks like the OP is not only seeking opinions from others experience but theirs as well. Every human has a different way of assimilating pain and while like the OP noted that it has forever scarred some, others act differently. I learned early in life that to heal from such is to expect anything from anyone and I opened my heart to forgiveness no matter how painful my experience was. It helped a great deal, if I must confess.",

With truth hardly been told by the parties of a subject, it becomes a matter of tactics for the investigators to use what they've got and hope to arrive at some logical conclusion to be true, get a confession or maybe just hang on to what they've got until proven otherwise.Surely, there are victims to this but, you can't imagine it not having victims at times. The innocent once still gets hurts.",

      "body": "The act is painful no matter the gravity of the situation and such can make one withdraw into his or her shell and this results in trust issues. Just like it's difficult for one who has been scarred by an incident to forget, it is quite a stretch to ask one who has been falsely accused by someone they must have had high regards for to forgive and move on. But just like I noted earlier, it all depends on the mindset and mentality of the person.",

I am still searching to know how to heal the pains that get associated with allegations.   I have been privileged to work for an NGO that works with prisoners and I discovered that many of these inmates are innocent of the crime they are accused of. Many of them are languishing in jail because of allegations and cooked-up offenses. This has led some of them to suffer psychological and mental illnesses. I have had encounters with most prisoners that have been accused of armed robbery or rape because their accusers want to covert their belonging so the only way to do that is to bribe some law enforcement agencies and the judiciary and get them imprisoned. I have always assisted these inmates financially and otherwise. But my biggest advice for them is that they should forgive their accusers, forget the past and focus on the future.",

Sometimes it is a frame up allegation that is put on you which becomes so devastating that if you are not the type that can face harsh situation, it can lead you to depression. I have seen people suffering for what they don't know about. All these happens because it is people that are very close to us that hurts us the more. It is people that makes other people wicked.",

I am still searching to know how to heal the pains that get associated with allegation.   Have you also considered yourself in many ways not to be found with this iind of injudicious actions, in most cases, allegations were made because of lack of self discipline, greediness, lies, hatred, gealousy, pride and mockery act towards our fellow human beings, sometimes we find out this allegations made are intentional and few were not intentional but when we discover the magnitude of the outcome in it, it feels bad that such wicked act is coming from us to our fellow brothers, people with bad conscience are found with allegations on others.",

When you are aware that you were falsely accused of a crime and suffered as a result, it takes time to recover from the event. I can't predict what the crime was or what you will go through, but I can assure you that when you choose to let go and free your mind from the bonds of resentment, sadness, and an implacable spirit of regrets, you will be okay and come out stronger.Breathe in a new you and stop allowing the false accusations against you to keep you down as you put more emphasis on the future.

Out of duress some persons have had to confess to a crime they never committed and it's hard to forgive after going through such condition. But for your own sake you must have to move on as it wasn't your fault to have being a victim of such circumstance. Turn on a new leave for yourself by discarding every pain the memory of the allegation brings, and telling yourself daily that you deserve to be happy no matter what.",

If you have served your punishment, be happy that the punishment is not life long, and that you are still in a position to move on. Sometimes you really don't need to prove your point or seek revenge, but just change your location to heal better. Healing involves learning, learning not to make the same mistake that got you falsely alleged before. Move to another location and start your life afresh with more consciousness.",
