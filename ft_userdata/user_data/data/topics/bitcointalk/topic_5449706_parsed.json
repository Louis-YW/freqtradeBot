More so I think that even a superior computing power is unable to alter the Blockchain as its construct and backup policy is made to be unalterable.",

Specific algorithms/cryptographic protocols are either quantum resistant or not. You don't need a different technology than blockchain to be quantum resistant. Bitcoin may need to make a quantum resistant update at some point, or it may not, but it doesn't need something other than blockchain.In terms of efficient transacting - that's what L2 is for.So the answer is no, there is no need for some other technology besides blockchain.",
