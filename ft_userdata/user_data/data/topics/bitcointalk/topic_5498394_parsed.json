I can see why it's a good scale too, it just shows what would happen when you invest in bitcoin and you accumulate and hodl for the long-term, it's just that profitable to have bitcoin in your possession that it would be stupid not to buy now even when you're at a loss temporarily which always happens when you're invested in bitcoin, it's a volatile market after all.",

      "body": "Your analysis would have sent a better message if you had reduce the value you're using in making your comparison between investing in Bitcoin and going into real estate investment. On a more practical bases, most of us here might not even be able to accumulate up to 3BTC after we've invested for years and seeing analysis as this, it's going to be very deficult to relate with it to be honest.But that being said, real estate isn't a bad investment choice just like the way Bitcoin isn't, each of the investment choice has her merit and demerits and the decision to invest into Bitcoin or real estate investment most cases is controlled by which of the option one is exposed to and can work well for you based on your level of knowledge and want you want to push your funds into. The main advantage I see that Bitcoin has over real estate is that with Bitcoin investments, you get to invest bit by but and overtime you get a groose investment that's good but when it comes to real estate, it's not possible to invest $30 at regular intervals and expect that it will work well for you. In most cases, the initial capital you need to get land and make payment for all the legal stuff is much more than what you will even need to do a six months DCA that will even pay you well in the long run. We can just say that Bitcoin allows but the rich, the poor and the average person to invest into it and still make good profit out of his investment while real estate on the other hand favours mostly the rich.",

Anyway, in terms of life, we all want the best, whether we choose bitcoin or not, each person should be responsible for their own behavior in life. In the spirit of supporting bitcoin, I encourage everyone to learn about it and then be able to decide for themselves.",

You can hodled based on your financial level or strength. The advantage of Bitcoin is that you can buy with any amount you have over a long period. Many people who don't have bulk money to buy can use DCA to accumulate. Also OP just used the US as an example, houses are much cheaper in my country. With less than $15k one can own a good house in my location. Quote from: _act_ on May 31, 2024, 06:44:09 AMThis is not about having the amount of money that can buy a house and use it to buy bitcoin.

The worst victims of this inflation are people who keep their money in fixed deposits or savings accounts for many years. In a few years, inflation will make the money worthless. It will be even better to invest in a house than keeping money in banks. But I agree that Bitcoin is a better hedge against inflation but we should also take note that nothing is certain.",

Well said instead of saving our money in fiat or bank account more especially those who are planning to buy a house, is very good to Invest it in bitcoin instead of saving it in the bank, because as time goes on that's how it keep increasing. but for bank instead of your  money to increase it will still reduce, sometimes due to the charges that bank normal takes, even if you don't have a decent job that is paying well you can still use DCA method before you know you have accumulated a lot.",

Though we know it has the potential, what if Bitcoin doesn't gain much value in the next decade? I mean, it's possible, that there might be a lot of uncertainty and instead of extreme adoption, we may see lows and highs which will keep the price fluctuation within a certain range.So even though it can be a good thing to save money in Bitcoin, one should be moderate when they are doing this and should only save what they think is what they can afford to see losing value in case that happens because you can't expect only upside movement when an asset has a volatile value.There is nothing wrong with having expectations, but the expectations should be backed with practical thoughts and no imaginations.",

I get it and know it that, in order to maximise the profit of bitcoin, the good option is to hold it and wait for bull runs or bullish events, but for others that couldn't wait for a year, that will be impossible for them, for example, poor families who can't even have money to eat twice a day, so they will need to invest in bitcoin and wait for years in order to survive. What I'm saying is that bitcoin will definitely make you wealthy if you do it right, but of course it depends on your situation in life. You should work on living first in order to focus on investing in bitcoin.",

Because there is no guarantee that Bitcoin will always increase, I am optimistic that the Bitcoin price will continue to increase in the future. If you have invested in bitcoins and if you want to withdraw your money from there for planning to buy or build your house then you can withdraw from there and transfer to bank no problem. But if you invest in bitcoins and want to complete the construction of the house, you may spend extra money, if the price of bitcoins falls, then a part of your surplus will go to the extra spending sector.",

Unless the demand goes down and another currency become a global currency they will keep on increasing the debt threshold. Everyone here knows that the global currency is USD, even Bitcoin is valued on the basis of USD and the biggest stablecoin is pegged to USD , then why you want to question the existence of USD and then compare it with inflation. Regardless of how we think Bitcoin is for financial freedom it is still not more than an asset. It will remain as an asset which can make an individual or a country powerful enough to question the USD dominance.",
