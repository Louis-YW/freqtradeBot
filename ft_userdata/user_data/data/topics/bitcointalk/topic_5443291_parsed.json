I am sure many request would be genuine but it will be a lot of struggle. I am not sure whether we can place an ANN on this thread. As we are launching a service related to BTT. I think they should allow it.  Please copy/paste it on that thread and let's see how the moderators treat it.What everyone would also like to know is that how you will verify a member worthy for a trade? You haven't mentioned it . Please do mention it and then post it on the ANN thread.",

You list your coin for sale and When someone buys it, you and he instantly get funds transferred. I guess you have never ever visited Bisq. On bisq you do not need to register yourself. Bisq allows P2P trade on its platform which is why it acts as an intermediatory and offers escrow service. Trading pairs are available only for Bitcoin, Monero, and local fiat currency. It uses TOR which means you can perform trade with anonymity. Since complete anonymity is possible on BTT and Bisq you need my Yes to initiate a request as I would do a few security checks before anyone completes a trading request. The only dispute that can arise is if the payment was not received by the buyers or seller. In this case Bisq would take the decision. On the forum I would be deciding the action if any such issues occur.",

Don't I have to give my information to seller for making payment? I did visit the Bisq website but have not downloaded it as it is not available for Android mobile. I would love to use it because I keep buying and selling crypto a lot. If I get payment in inr, then it would be great but I want to remain completely anonymous.",

Since you do not register on the platform anonymity is maintained. When you download the application it will ask you in the initial stage to set up the INR payment method. You can select UPI and provide your UPI address which is only shown to the buyers when a BTC/INR P2P trade is made and vice-versa. Since UPI only reveals the receiver name it is still better than IMPS payment. The only problem is that you won't find any liquidity for BTC/INR transactions. That is the reason I am promoting it on the forum.",
