But I will use it to take payment from freelancer.com which required a verified account (verified means verified bank usually, sometimes may require card verification). Those who are professionals can create a Paypal account and add a virtual bank and/or card. As an alternative I can use a a bank account, in this case, I get 15% less. Cause Paypal= crypto and the rate of crypto is about 15%+ from the bank.",

They gave me two options 1. confirm the code from the previous number (which I used randomly) or changed the phone number. I think if I can change my phone number then I will receive a message to the new number and I would be able to use that account once again.",

If you really have to then try to get that number 137.2 ₽ which is about 2$ simsms.orgNot sure i can share this website here, plus you will need a translator if you don’t understand Russian language",

Imagine someone with a completely different IP address, device ID, operating system etc. setting up an account for you, and then you access it from a different location and device. That raises an instant flag in their systemMy account was permanently blocked because of accessing it using different IP addresses (VPN was on by mistake) and I was forced to create a new account.
