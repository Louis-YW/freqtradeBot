  "content": "Hey guys, I'm new here.Â I moved to Sweden and am aware I'll have to start paying taxes on my cryptocurrencies. I want to make sure I'm ready once tax season arrives. I was wondering if anyone has used either Divly or Koinly before? How did it go? Did you have any problems with the tax calculations? Many thanks",

How did it go? Did you have any problems with the tax calculations? I haven't used either of them, but I've read and seen both of these crypto tax software websites.but if you are unsure about calculating and using the two websites, maybe you can see Compare Koinly vs Divly, advantages and disadvantages and also the law.From other places I found that the most widely used is Koinly, as discussed here: Crypto tax reports in under 20 minutes, after you see the information, now you can draw conclusions for both, which one is the most appropriate for you to use to calculate your crypto tax.",

      "body": "Thanks for providing the comparison site YOSHIE, I really appreciate it. I do like that Divly is based in Sweden. Koinly does seem more popular though. I'm not sure how accurate the comparison site is considering it mentions that neither Koinly nor Divly serve individuals, which I think both of them do. In any case thanks for the help!",
