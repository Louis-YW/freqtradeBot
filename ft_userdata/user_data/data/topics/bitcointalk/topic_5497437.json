At first, I thought they were just gonna show how bitcoin can be used to buy pizza but it wasn’t entirely about bitcoin at all. The video is correct and this is literally what happens with our money. It’s a fun way of discussing something worth addressing. Kudos to Coinbase!",

It's a very creative adverts that really explains the need for Bitcoin to start being used as currency. People taking slices and bites off the ordered pizza really paints a mental picture of how fees cut our money shorts.This video can be a really good tool to convince people who still do not understand the benefit bitcoin has and why the government are fighting hard against it, they do not want to stop taking slices and bites off your pizza (money).",

I'm genuinely interested in hearing your thoughts on this video and its storyline. https://youtu.be/NON0euNOj3kFor me, the video made by Coinbase is okay; maybe it will even be commercialized in ads here on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and something like that. Honestly, for those newly entering the bitcoin community, they will not immediately understand it, and their interpretation will be deep.Which really makes sense, and that's what happens to the Bitcoin or cryptocurrency that we have, especially when we release it to our fiat currency. And as long as your country or government doesn't have any tax to all tax earners, then you are lucky, but once they implement it to all crypto fanatic that would be sad for us of course.",

I'm genuinely interested in hearing your thoughts on this video and its storyline. https://youtu.be/NON0euNOj3kThe video is all about the middlemen and the need for their total elimination which is what bitcoin is largely in for. Middlemen in their pursuit for what they can get only makes us pay more for what we can pay less, creating extra procedures for what we can get directly in a seamless way. The video message may not entirely be about pizza but the message is a conglomeration of pizza and bitcoin knowing fully the important place pizza holds in bitcoin history.",

I'm genuinely interested in hearing your thoughts on this video and its storyline. https://youtu.be/NON0euNOj3kThe ending of that video is a little ironic from Coinbase. That guy says \"Few middlemen, few fees, that's how crypto works\" but actually, coinbase is a centralized exchange (a middleman) and I'll be glad if someone here who has coinbase, checks Bitcoin transaction withdrawal fees for me. If I am not wrong, their withdrawal fees are high, just like Binance.By the way, that Pizza event is historical. Laszlo Hanyecz is a legend, he is the guy, who, if has saved his 10K bitcoins, today would be able to open his own pizza branch but instead, he bought two pizzas in exchange of 10K Bitcoin and wrote the history. Of course he didn't know it but anyway, I appreciate him very much for this historical transaction, he is a legend!",

I mean, in the first place we shouldn’t be having any middle man. Bitcoin doesn’t need anyone in between, simply send your crypto directly to the recipient. Not saying they are not important, of course there’s a point where the importance of CEX can be seen. But what I said is what I think",

Practically, if you want to buy any pizza with fiat, it doesn't really stress you that much and I doubt that th charge of paying with fiat is much more than what's obtainable if you decide to pay with Bitcoin.What should have been the best form of carrying out this sort of advert should be when you're painting the ease with which you can do international transactions without doing all the currency conversion or stuff like that. More like paying for a Canadian or UAE  flight ticket from the comfort of your home without stressing yourself with currency conversion or trying to ensure that when you're in your destination you should be concerned on changing of currency.",

      "body": "After watching the video, these three words really got me: easier, simpler, faster. Surely we deserve a better system, less middlemen and low transaction fees unlike the banks and other third party monetary systems with numerous middlemen causing too much delays, high transactions fees, high service charges, high maintenance charges, low transaction limits, and sign too many documents before your transactions are being processed. Bitcoin is the end to all the stress we go through in banks precisely.I'm really glad to be part of the Bitcoin pizza day celebration as I bought pizza worth $20 for my family.",
