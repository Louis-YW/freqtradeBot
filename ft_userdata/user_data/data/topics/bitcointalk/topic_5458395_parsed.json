That means anyone is afraid to try your platform? What do you think is the reason why no one is trying ot use your exchange?It's clear that you don't have any users who have actively dared to use it, even for a while now there still isn't any, but here it seems to be surprising and makes me think.

I just want to make this clear but I still maintain my stance that people should be careful of this kind of exchanges, it is new and it has no review. One of the reviewing sites that I checked about it is Trustpilot, no review there too. This is Trustpilot review about the site: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/cryptobit.solutions@OP, I will advice you to have good marketing strategy. This will help you and you will be able to gain people's trust. Without marketing new services and websites, people can not have believe in it until you market your service to show people how serious you are. From marketing, people will see your site and they will try it. If they like it, some people they will give you positive reviews on reviewing sites. That is how it works. Scammers do not have time or money for marketing, all they know is to deceive people to use their new created website. Some scammers can have the a domain created, leaving it for months before they will begin to look for people to scam. You can be one and you may not be one. While some scammers are not that patient. Your site may be legit, but you have to prove that.I still remain myself. I can not use the site unless I am convinced to use it, but you have nothing to convince people to believe in your site yet and best for people not to use it if they want to avoid possible scam.",

Which of course are filled with unexpected offers and due to the bad reputation of new exchanges for rug pulling/scamming. People have left to give them a try even.It takes too much time for an exchange to build its reputation among the users and once you will make that trust you will grow like grass. But to till then you have to work on your steps to build trust among competitor's customers and why we should prefer you, other than the fact that you are luring people by making unbelievable offers. Like most of the new exchange make, For example, trading competitions, swapping competitions, etc. And once people started to take part exchange gained liquidity and left the market.",
