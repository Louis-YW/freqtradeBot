Will the US government push them to do that just because a Russian company allows their users to trade USDT? I think that would just give them a negative rep, unless the funds are being used for terrorism purposes or something similar. Then again I don't think Tether cares about reputation at all.",

Will the US government push them to do that just because a Russian company allows their users to trade USDT? Yes! US can do that! US government is very good in putting sanctions on the entities that they don't like. So it is possible for the US government to come up with new regulations that may ban Russian exchanges to operate globally, or at least in their allies countries. QuoteI think that would just give them a negative rep, unless the funds are being used for terrorism purposes or something similar. Then again I don't think Tether cares about reputation at all.It is not a question of reputation. It is the question of a supreme leader that runs the globe from Washington DC. Anyone can be banned from anywhere by the supreme leader.",

Representatives of the exchange know for sure about Tether’s blocking, which means it may be a closed market. Russian companies will indicate the USDT address of a partner abroad and send rubles to the exchange account, and the exchange will send USDT. It looks like a p2p exchange between organizations. But I'll look at the reviews later.",

I won't be surprised if the US claims any stablecoin representing or claims to represent USD needs their approval, regardless if the issuer is a government or overseas business. Maybe they just think it is the same as accepting USD for their business, even though the US can track the bank account they can simply create and use a new one, although it doesn't remove the risk at all.",

Then perhaps there will be settlements with some countries through the digital ruble, but its mass implementation is planned for 2025. So far there is either limited use or planned implementation in some organizations.",

This is what makes all of these services hostage in the hands of the United States. We see how the United States attacks these services and bans everyone who violates its policy.So I was wondering, since Exved is a Russian platform, why doesn't it benefit from the digital ruble, for example, or will this make their services limited to certain countries only?",

But these are all just plans. In Russia this may take several years. So for now the exchange is using what is available.",
