      "body": "Some notes by MrMilk who followed my guide in December 2022; I feel they could come in very handy to whoever reads this! Quote from: MrMik on December 16, 2022, 07:49:55 AMLessons learned:- the OS might take much longer to load than expected. I etched Armbian_22.11.1_Orangepi4-lts_jammy_current_5.15.80_gnome_desktop.img.xzto an SD card and it took over 3 minutes before any signs of life showed up on the HDMI-connected monitor. On second reboot, it too about 4 minutes before showing it is running. I assume that maybe my failed attempts to use an Ubuntu version were due to my impatience, I never waited that long to see if it would boot.- for some reason, the Armbian_22.11.1_Orangepi4-lts_jammy_current_5.15.80_gnome_desktop.img.xz OS has no issues when connecting to GitHub to download the wiringOP thingamajigg (just like my Ubuntu laptop OS). Not asking for a password, just doing it like n0nce's instructions suggest. So for some reason, that previously tried bullseye-minimal armbian has some issue that will not be easy to solve for a noob when following n0nce's instructions.- cannot use the binary file that n0nce has linked to, because I'm using a different OS than n0nce used. At least, I assume that is the case. I got around that issue by accessing the Apollo SD card with the FutureBit OS on it (in a card reader on my laptop). Find the appropriate file for the specific OS flavour, copy it to a USB memory stick, stick it into the Apollo and copy it into the /home folder. Then (for this specific case only):  Code:sudo mv rk3399-orangepi-4-lts.dtb /boot/dtb/rockchip/rk3399-orangepi-4-lts.dtb Such fun typing this stuff without any typo's! - that vim text editor will drive you nuts, unless you just use the few commands needed for the task: type 'i' to get it into insert mode, then edit the file as instructed by n0nce, then Esc button to end the insert mode, then :x! to save and exit. I got that tidbit of geek-speak from here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getting-started-with-vim-editor-in-linux/- whatever you do, do not try to use the built-in help of that vim editor unless you want to spend a lot of time getting nowhere while then fan is still howling!   The creator of vim must be some evil genius type of person.....",

Virtualization and sandboxing like this is great for security, but it clashes heavily with my bare-metal approaches and guides. I'm very sorry; should have catched that earlier. I have to get into Umbrel myself and make a dedicated guide for setting the Apollo miner up in Docker to run on Umbrel. That will definitely take some time, I'm afraid.Umbrel requires installing everything through Docker, as explained here:https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-apps/blob/master/README.md",
