  "content": "Hello.Current SituationI have 3 UTXOs (A, B, C). A is from KYC exchange, B and C are from RoboSats.Desired Actions1. Mix the UTXOs doing some coinjoins2. Consolidate the UTXOs to a larger UTXO and send it to a specific address that I own (D).Possible Actions1. Do some coinjoins on A, B, C separately and then consolidate them into D.2. Do some coinjoins on A, B, C separately and then consolidate only the non-kyc UTXOs (B, C) and send them to D.3. Consolidate A, B, C in advance and then do some coinjoins and send the output to D.Thoughts - QuestionsQ1: I reckon that action 3 is the worst since I am mixing the original UTXOs all together and therefore someone would be able to tell that the person who owns A, does own B, C too. Am I correct?Q2: I believe (1) and (2) to be the same actually. If I mix the UTXOs separately, someone would be able to know that A is linked to my Identity, but they wouldn't be able to know which coinjoin output corresponds to the input. Therefore, I should be ok. Am I correct?Q3: Which of the possible actions should I choose?",

That's what I thought too, but I am not certain why (1) and (2) differ. Finally, I must say I started buying Non-KYC bitcoin thanks to this forum, but I still own some UTXOs that are linked to Binance, unfortunately.",

You have no obligation to give up everything about you and your bitcoin to the government, which is exactly what you're doing when buying from a KYC-ed exchange. Buying peer-to-peer isn't illegal, and I guess it's reasonable to assume that in countries where bitcoin is taxed taxable, reporting your profit will create no problems at all. You can still save the situation if you sell your KYC-ed coins back to the exchange and buy peer-to-peer.",
