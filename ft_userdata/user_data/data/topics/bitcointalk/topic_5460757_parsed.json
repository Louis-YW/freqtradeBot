I think my post is enough for the OP to understand.If you just mention only \"original poster\" to the Op with its other meaning what do you think he'll think when it's used as \"original post\"? I don't see any harm in the Op learning how to use both of them appropriately. As for the editing part, I was already edit my post before I saw your reply which means it was after I clicked \"post\" (after editing) that I saw your post.",

Other members will judge whether or not your posts are valuable, and if they are as helpful as you claim, merits will eventually be given. Although you should be concentrating on expanding your knowledge rather than receiving merits, newbies are constantly more interested in moving up the ranks than learning.",

So it is added to you profile, when you make a new post. In as much as it would be useful, I would suggest that you check out this thread of listed terminologies in Bitcointalk and cryptocurrency. Do well to check it outTerminologyQuote from: teoliya33 on July 23, 2023, 08:12:52 AMI'm here for selling and gaining knowledge and i cant stay NEWBIE forever  I think you should focus on learning alot about Bitcoin and this forum, so you won't be misguided. Every member herewas once a newbie and their various contributions made them rank up successfully. So if you want to rank up and become a higher member, I would suggest you learn. And forget about merits. Merits comes when you make good useful contributions to the community.",

Taking for instance the question you asked about the meaning of op, I didn't know what it means, I only had an assumption of what the meaning was until I stumbled on a topic where it was discussed and that's how I got to know the true meaning. So my point is you can actually learn by asking questions and also from the response to the questions asked by other persons. Also, You get rewarded with merit for your contribution on the forum which is a requirement to rank up but you shouldn't chase it. Read more, learn more, improve yourself, make quality posts and the merit will come.",
