One cannot miss that. So I agree with franky1 on this: we're not at the end of a cycle.On the other hand, yes, based on historical movements it's expected the market to turn bullish in the near future. Some say the bottom is near, some say the bottom was already in. We will see. With the future.. you never know which predictions were right, if any.",

Based on the past events, we have derived it as a 4 years cycle but there's no guarantee that it will respond in a similar manner like the past. So that's speculation. The only prominent cycle of bitcoin is halving and we are still have some time to reach there.",

I'd say it's not even a \"year cycle\" because it never opens and closes a period within a year (or 4).Take your 2020 \"stagnant\" year and 21 bull market. The bullish breakout was in November 2020 so we can't call that year stagnant or bearish. The tops throughout the year were at maybe 12k and then in November you already had 18-19k and a new ATH in December. I wouldn't put market cycles into any closed time periods. Every time the number of months and days of a bullish cycle is different and it's the same with bearish cycles.",

The current market conditions have not shown any signs of changing, so just enjoy the times when you can get Bitcoins that are offering discounts.I'm not sure the changes will occur in late November and December, early January 2023 still in the same condition.

Nevertheless, his model portfolio, which includes 30 BTC, currently has a net profit of 4,100%. That’s what you get for buying at the lows and accumulating more during major capitulation events, such as the March 2020 liquidation crisis.
