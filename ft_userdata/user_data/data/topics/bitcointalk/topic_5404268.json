I love trading crypto as of lately just seems like a more volatile SP500. I am waiting for the day BTC is stable and digital \"property\"I think there are 3 major hurdles remaining for Bitcoin in order to decouple from traditional markets for the next leg up.1) Mtgox coins:  These coins have been hanging over the market's head for quite some time.  Until they've been distributed and we can get a good idea of how many of them will be dumped, many market participants will be on the sidelines.2) ETH 2.0:  ETH?  Who cares?  Well, with such a massive supply of crypto frozen out of the market that has risen in value so much from the time it was locked away, there will undoubtedly be a lot of profit taking.  Can the overall crypto market survive another massive amount of coins hitting the market?  We'll see.3) Spot ETF:  With no spot ETF available in the US markets, lots of fund money is sitting on the sidelines waiting to enter.  When they have a secure route to do so, it will likely lead to a lot of fresh money hitting the market.So basically, we have 2 downside events and 1 upside event likely occurring in the near future that will effect the price of Bitcoin.  If we can survive the first 2, the third one will carry us to the promised land.",

The movement that it does is somehow always comparative to the traditional.Yes, soon it will have its own behavior because of the mechanism and own feature that it has like halving. While the traditional market, don't have that type of feature just like bitcoin. It will be a factor that it will have its own run and behavior in the future.But, there will always be the comparison no matter what or even it happens.",

I am waiting for the day BTC is stable and digital \"property\"bitcoin is decoupling and moving away from old paradigms of trading. creating its own pathfor instanceyou cant trade 0.00001000 of a share. but you can trade that amount of bitcoin.in stocks if a stock was $200 each. and traders from today onwards could only afford $200 per order. they could only ever buy 1 or more shares. meaning the price stays where it is or goes down when people buy more then 1 share for $200. but they cant buy half or quarter of a stock/share. which means they are stuck/limited in growth potentialbitcoin however even if people could only afford $200.. this year they can buy 0.01btc.. next year they can buy 0.001 year after 0.0001 and the overall price per btc can go up even if the amount per order doesnt... this is where bitcoin decouples from the norms of stocks/sharesthis means even small holders without much money can still buy bitcoin and the price can still go up even if amounts are small.if all orders of both stocks and bitcoin were for $200..stocks can only go one direction 1stock per order or 2,3,4,5 lowering the price of each stock the more they give. even if they added more supply of stocks it wont make the price go upbitcoin however can sell percentages/decimals. it doesnt ned to add more supply. yet the price can go up even if the order amount of fiat spend per order doesnt. ...bitcoin offers even people with just $10 opportunity to buy bitcoin. shares/stock only offer whatever a whole share/stock is as the min buy in. sometimes not even that, as some portfolio managers only accept buy-ins of large basket allotments of many stocks/shares. meaning the little guys dont get a chance(robinhood  falsely represented allows percentage buy-ins. but your not actually buying a true ownership stake in the stock/share. your buying robinhoods valuation for them to own/hoard the stock/share and then divvy out any profit or loss of any complete sale amongst many users clubbing together to fill a whole share/stock. )bitcoin allows you to buy AND OWN small parts, affordably",
