  "content": "In light of recent events I decided to update my Ignore list adding few new members and removing some banned or inactive members.I decide to make my Ignorelist public with some feedback, reasons and explanations, most of the members I ignore are spammers, scammers, abusers or I don't talk with them anymore.Nothing is set in stone, so I can always change my list, but I suggest everyone to make their own Ignorelist to avoid conflicts and make forum easier to use.My question: is there any difference to forum if Ignorelist is empty or full of members, I mean does it have any effect on browsing speed, lags, opening pages, etc?Here is my current Ignorelist:Code:franky1 > Posting toxic anti-Lightning Network opinions to the point of getting banned in several sections, but he continues his ''work'' in other boards.JollyGood > Abusing other members out of boredom, not using trust feedback correctly, accusing members for being nazis, can't communicate with other people or accept criticism, making worthless topics.Lucius > I had argument with him in past and we can't communicate or settle our differences.Lauda > Some of his topics are used for necroposting and spam, for example: Goodbye, world!nullius > Laudajerry0 > I can't stand reading his same old rinse&repeat topics and questions anymore.pelosoremotemassBitcoinAcceptedErdoganvirtualdni_am_viralandulolikaReiMomowildan88Vadi2323qoryVanityWallets2015perlajohhnyUAhv_cryptomaxsunlienfayeIconFirmReidSmokerFacesuzanne5223Ucyonecall123VispilioGozie51Ryker1wolwooScam Exposeyrozakhacker1001101001xenon131knababygunlibert19KittygaloreXCANAnaim027trendcoinmarwellLordhermesLeviathan.007antminerguruguyCryptomiles1Bitcoin SVCoysterExcimerHardFactsBIN-BINSecurity Engineerantikvark16xypjnxlrewBIT-BENDERBlockchainnXsmartcontracts100rokuenPaperWalletLaudanumGeorgeJohncolires1xbit_officialCrptomagmatalkoncrypto Officialhack3rconKingsDenAntithesisTrojaneSatoPrincessKanoKanobislomAgbeKoilSnowshowJamesDaniel90CriptoDebit.comSATOSCARDPSMy list is Open Source and you are free to use it and import in your profile settings Ignore user options Note that you should import only usernames without my feedback!",

Your ignore list page (I believe) is the page that is affect,  having so many members listed on that page will definitely cause the page to be very slow in opening as loading and bring up all the users listed will take some time, it might also cause your browser to lag, most especially if you are on mobile.",

Some people take it very seriously and it seems like they have a mission to ruin and destroy other people lives.  I mean imagine if in real life you had the option to chose if you want or don't want to see some guy all the time and everything he does (in elevator, tv, work, shop, etc.)",

Are you insinuating that I'm not?  Whatever.  The last refuge of a coward has always been and will continue to be name-calling and attempting to portray your adversary as the most evil thing you can think of.  It says more about the accuser's inability to defend his actions than anything else.  But, you do make a good point; ignoring such obtuse idiots is probably the best course of action.Quote from: The Pharmacist on August 14, 2022, 10:12:22 PMIdeally, if you're an active reporter and want to use the ignore function, you can report a few posts by a shitposter and then put that member on ignore.  After that, you've done your part and the person is either going to get banned or they're not.  It wouldn't make sense to keep reporting their posts if the mods aren't going to take action.I hear ya, it can be irritating to see obvious shit posting trolls run rampant.  But I think persistence can pay off eventually.  Recently there was that viral freak who had an ax to grind with facebook.  It took making a threat before he finally got banned.  Somebody must have reported that post, and I'm glad that it was.  If the reporter had the account on ignore that post may have gone unreported.  That's probably not the best example, but you catch my drift.",

Maybe it's not perfect comparison, but it reminds me a bit things on social media where it's popular to block people who don't agree or criticize you and then live in bubble with people who tells things that you want to hear. Butthat's your ignore list and you can do whatever you want with it.And I see few names in your list who is good users IMO, but I'm sure that you had valid reasons to add themQuote from: DireWolfM14 on August 13, 2022, 04:33:55 PMI'm not incredibly active in reporting, but that's a good reason to ignore the ignore function.  Another reason is laziness.  Yet another is that curiosity always seems to get the better of me.  I suppose it would make it easier to avoid irritation from time to time, but I don't take anything that happens here too seriously.  It's just a forum, after all.I often just scroll through posts of some particular users and I don't their posts. BADecker probably is most obvious example. But I still don't bother to put them on ignore. As you said, I don't take too seriously what they write here.
