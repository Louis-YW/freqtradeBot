      "body": "DAY 0: Yep, thats IT. Today is officially the last day I fapped for the rest of my existence. Enough is enough, I'm wasting absolutelly all of my professional and personal potential in this fucking thing. ITS OVER.Today I did some quick math about the number of hours I've spend masturbating in front of a fucking screen in the last 10 years, and we are talking of a minimum of 5,000Â  FUCKING HOURSIt's impossible to be in peace with one's own soul by knowing that, and that deep internal shame feeling affects all the rest areas of own's life. 5000 hours man, just think what could you have done/learnt with all this time... Essentially you would have become a super expert in ANYTHING by having focused these hours into something other than fapping...It's crazy, and its enough, and I'm 99% sure that MOST of the new generation guys are in a very similar position. That fucking needs to change.Since difficult times will come until we're free from this crap, I've created this token $NOFAP. EVERYTIME I'm having nofap urges, I will work on this fucking project, and let's see where we go with that. I invite you all to do the same, and see where all this goes. In the worst case scenario, you'll get clean from this fucking crap which FAP and PORN it is.",

      "body": "DAY 1:First day, it was kinda a flowy day, I just went to the gym and then went to work. I'm psycologically decided and I just promised god that -I will not fap for the rest of my life, will be productive and will be a good person. In exchange, I've just asked him to bring me a good wife in my life, have a lot of kids and bring me financial abundance. Will happen.About the $NOFAP shitcoin project, seems that after yesterdays launch where we got to 50 holders, most of them decided to abandon the ship as soon as they saw that price was not magically going up. I guess that the absence of funding & experience from my side also is not helping much LOL.Anyway, I will continue to thrive. I'm 100% sure that by doing things corretcly and be willing to help those that are in the same situation (most of man nowadays), this will get traction at some point.Cheers to whoever is reading this. If there's anyone there, at least follow the $NOFAP twitter MF ðŸ˜‚",

      "body": "DAY 2:Yessir, another day completed without many troubles. I guess by what I've read everywhere that in the upcoming days some more urges will come that will make the experience more difficult that what has been till now. So far so good, again spent the day training and at work, not much to say.About $NOFAP, I see that there hasn't been essentially any activity onchain or in the social channels I made. It seems that there's no interest in this shitcoin. Anyway, I'll continue posting and promoting it because thats WHAT I'M DETERMINED TO DO, no matter what happens. This weekend when I have more free time I'll start thinking and looking for more strategies in order to make the $NOFAP community grow. Have a good night you all, cheers.",

      "body": "DAY 3:Yep, ANOTHER ONE, as Drake would say. Fridays are always hard days, phyisically and mentally tired, today I almost took my dick and stroke it as usual in front of the computer, but then I REMINDED $NOFAP, and why the fuck I'm doing all this. These have been my first urges since I started the process, I guess some more will come in the upcoming days due to rising testosterone. Today I also saw that $NOFAP holders has risen to 55 holders already, we seem to be gaining some traction, so I'm happy with it. This weekend as stated I will explore some methods in order to make this project grow.Cheers to all the guys there that are helping me with this mission",

      "body": "DAY 4:HARD HARD day, but we made it. Urges came really strong at various moments of the day, where I almost gave up and go watch some porn. But I could resist it, I went to do some exercise and see some friends in order to mitigate the craving effects. All this shit just reminds me that I am a fucking ADDICT and this is no different than any other substance. Really really crazy that the world we currently live is essentially composed by a bunch of FUCKING ADDICTED people.I couldn't think with much clarity today so I didn't think at all about $NOFAP project and how to make this big. I guess I still need more control of these urges before translating that sexual energy into productive work. Anyway, keep going folks, have a good night y'all and thanks for being there.",

      "body": "DAY 5:GREAT IMPROVEMENTS compared to yesterday. Today it was the completely opposite, no cravings, very good mood and nice social life today. I went to the beach, got in the sea and had a really good time. By the evening I've been learning more about memecoins mechanics and the factors that can contribute to their success, so I'm already designing some growth and marketing plan for $NOFAP. I'm more convinced than ever that this is the FUCKIN RIGHT TRACK, and nobody (not even my addicted mind) will stop this. NO FUCKIN ANYONE. Have a good night everyone and keep strong for the next week, It's not gonna be easy, but what would be the point of life if it was? ðŸ˜‰",

Essentially I couldn't sleep till 3:30 am because of the MASSIVE energy I had yesterday, and I couldn't control my impulses. Another clear proof that I AM A FUCKING ADDICT. Anyway, this is not going to stop me, by any fuckin means. I'm more decided than ever to get this, I will fuckin shine, $NOFAP will fuckin shine.Yesterday it was my last EVER, I felt so fucking bad yesterday for only 30 min of pleasure, that is simply NOT WORTH IT.

Today was definitely the best day for this streak, and that gives me hopes to continue.I've recently started reading around 20 pages of the Bible before going to sleep, and I think that is definitely helping in all fronts. Let's continue with that. I've checked the $NOFAP chart and I see that we have some new holders, which also gives me hope that this project is going somewhere. Whoever it is and is watching this, thanks for the support!! Let's go! $NOFAP",
