JEWEL was also available in some blockchains like DFK chain or avalanche https://medium.com/defi-kingdoms-official/defi-kingdoms-new-features-and-expansion-as-announced-at-avalanche-summit-eea5d1e831fbYou can setting up your metamask to use DFK or avalanche. Harmony was good too but i prefer to use avalanche. It's better if you are asking telegram mod if you are feeling doubt about that. The community was quite big now. People are also actively doing conversation in the telegram group.",
