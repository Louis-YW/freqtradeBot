Although, it would appear that the majority of people do not remember them.These types of events usually begin abroad. Eventually, finding their way onto the shores of the united states.

Of course Lebanese corruption stemmed all of this and crashed the Lebanese currency. Courts ruled that overseas depositors were entitled to their funds, and that left people who were late to withdraw out of their cash.If every depositor were to go to the banks and withdraw their balances, the bank will collapse. This applies to banks that aren't riddled with corruption too. The moment funds leave your hands and consumed into the banking system, your trust network extends far beyond that individual bank. Whatever dealings the institution has, you're forced to trust them because that's who has your funds.",

Inflations of 5-10% per year as we have seen in the last year are nothing compared to this. However, these examples show us the way we can end up with suicidal currency issuing policies. In the end we will have to be grateful for the tightening of central banks despite the negative effects it has because going in the other direction leads to what is happening in Lebanon and other countries. The other lesson is that with bitcoin we can protect ourselves from this, although much of the general population does not realise it, but because of events it will be more likely to be recognised by the population of Lebanon and other countries with such serious problems with their currencies.",

The world is facing recession recently and the best way we need to handle this condition is to ensure that we save our money in crypto so the value of our money will not vanish immediately. If people can start saving there money in cryptocurrency at least it will help people to have a better investment.

In my country, you don't even have access to your money because almost all the banks are closed. There have been protests over these restrictions but there is nothing anybody can do. But I have access to my wallet and I can do as I wish with my funds. Stablecoin is still a centralized currency just like fiat and cannot also be trusted.
