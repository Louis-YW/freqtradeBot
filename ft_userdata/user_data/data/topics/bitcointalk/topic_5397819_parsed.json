  "content": "NFT FOR SALE!So I am almost graduating and Trying to make money out of this Also can sell One to two but I sell one NFT art that is the amount of money I can handle and I am trying to sell one NFT art so I can post more or invest the money on some other stuff. If you are wondering if I can sell another sadly I am likely uncertain that it might not sell because like this one I posted it on a different online platform that has marketplaces like Facebook. I kind of forgot about this website and now I remember taking the chances that I might get lucky here and at Imgur. The image will be the direct link on the platform I used you can see it once you reply that it is opensea Also if you are interested in creating art like this PM and post a reply here I really need cash.PS: I can only think that this forum is the best option to post it but if not help me out and tell me where can I post it",

I think NFT's are not so popular anymore.Best is to post them in groups of Telegram/Discord. There are many collections that have their own channel and even build tiny community with giveawaysor contests. They let them post on socials and reward with free nft's.If you want to earn money then you need to build a collection of the same figure in many ways and colors. You can use animated gif's, I think they do better.",
