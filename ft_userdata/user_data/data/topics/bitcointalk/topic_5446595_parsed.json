Basically, arcade games turned into gambling games... and I must say I like what I saw, some of those arcade games I played 30 years ago.Learn what skill-based slots are and how they're different from luck-based slot machines. And look at what the best skill-based slots have to offer. I would say a much better article, with the top 5 skill-based slots, reviews, and videos...I didn't try it out, I'm not sure if there are any skill-based slots in Serbia in any casino (maybe in the capital). As I understand skill-based slots can be only played in land-based casinos, the first one is installed in Las Vegas. I will check if there are some online skill-based slots, especially available for playing with crypto.",

But if you think about it, I will be easily found by anyone and surely there will be some people who will know me if I continue to do traditional slot gambling.I currently prefer skill-based slots because they are easier and simpler to use and the most important thing for now is for me to be free to play gambling wherever I want.",

But from your first article link you provided in Op I read that the risk of losing in a skill based slot machine is reduced to minimal while winning odd is increased. I believe since the the chance of winning is high then it won't favour the casino it will only be an advantage to the gamblers and because of that most gambling site/casino wouldn't want to make it available (assuming it's still something that's common), I feel casino make more when gamblers lose their bets.",

      "body": "If someone could really think of a way to make the slot game \"skill-based\" rather than pure luck then I would applaud them. It's not like there's really something going on in slots. You just keep on rolling until you hit a certain line that could lead to a combo and then a probable jackpot. How can that be skill based is kind of intriguing.Well perhaps spending more money will be the key to it. Instead of a brand new roll, you could continue the game like those arcade games where you just need to drop another token to preserve the game, as long as you can see some reason that it could hit a jackpot. But that would probably be abused by those who can afford it and it's going to be a massive gamble like a martingale strategy which might not become profitable unless you can cover the massive capital needed until you hit jackpot.",

I am not a fan of slots, but I do sometimes play the traditional ones, and I would say it is very impossible to win.",

But if a skill based player could beat the operator, then it's not a business model. And online, you could just bot whatever game they put on there with trivial ease.Without knowing what this is, I'm almost sure that if you play, you are going to be exposed to variable house edge odds of say 90-96c depending on how skillful you are. So if you are more skillful you'll get 96c and if you are terrible you'll be 90c. Better to play slot machines online that are provably fair with a small house edge.",
