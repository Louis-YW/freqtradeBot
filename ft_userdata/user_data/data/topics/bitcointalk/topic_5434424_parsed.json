How was your overall internet connection disregarding the issues with Electrum at the time? Electrum connects to a random server from the list. You can change that and connect to one manually. If you go to Tools > Network, you should be able to see server settings there. Untick the \"select server automatically\" and pick a random server from the list.

In my case, I do have some occasional network issues with my Mac if I connect it to a dock, but this applies to the device itself and is not exclusive to Electrum. I find that with 12.2.1 my network is quite stable, so in my case, it is probably a dock incompatibility issue with the latest mac.",

I'm a bit confused about what you're trying to say here. Just in case you misunderstood me, I'm not using a Hackintosh but a Macbook Air M1 with a dock (from a third party, did not buy it from Apple), which is why sometimes I have issues with my connection. That's why I ask you whether you have the same setup as me or not because if that is the case, the culprit is probably your dock or your Mac version, not Electrum itself.At the end of the day, since you solve the connectivity issue by updating, it's clear that Electrum is not the problem.",
