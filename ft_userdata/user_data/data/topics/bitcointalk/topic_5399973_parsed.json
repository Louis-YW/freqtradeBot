Now the lingering part of this still falls back to the market dip going on presently in cryptocurrency. As the market is falling now, does that mean El Salvador will fall too? Many shades have been thrown on this matter. What happens to El Salvador if the market falls!!In regards to this, great news still keeps coming from the Central American country. Since El-Salvador has made cryptocurrencies an official currency, the country now wants more governments to follow suit. They encouraged 44 countries to embrace cryptocurrencies. Countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America. On the last day at El Zonte, El Salvador, a beach event was organized. Many financial authorities and central bankers from all around the world were present to commemorate the concept of a new financial system. Many debates have erupted online regarding whether or not this is a bitcoin event. However, it was clarified that the event was a financial inclusion event that would aid in the prioritization of funding available to small businesses.",

Still, I believe that the people of this country generally are not yet depending on Bitcoin as their everyday currency as there will always be obstacles on this area that must be ironed out. The big problem as we are seeing always is the volatility of the coin...imagine today one can buy a dozen bread with his BTC in his wallet and yet the following day it would only be 10...that would be disappointing by an ordinary guy on the street...no wonder then that many are looking at BTC as something like gold in the real world and a big speculative asset.",

That's just how the way it is, sometimes someone needs to take all the blow to warn the other on what kind of thing they about to engage with. I'm sure they will gonna survive and grow their country's economical value since they are the ones who first did it, they will gonna have multiple proposals from big crypto businesses as well.",

Now the lingering part of this still falls back to the market dip going on presently in cryptocurrency. As the market is falling now, does that mean El Salvador will fall too? The failure of Salvador has nothing to do with bitcoin, but it has a lot to do with Bukele who some have started worshiping here as Jesus, he is a populist who stretched the budget to the maximum to try and basically bribe everyone, from the gangs that were getting paid to stop committing murders to create thousands of jobs for the government to hire everyone, even the 30$ airdrop was just another of his let's rain money one everyone so they call me the best president.Salvador was in debt, Bukele went one step further and increase government spending as much as he could, the deficit went from 3% to 8.19% and then up again to 9.20, while every other country was seeing the deficit going down after covid, no he pushes more spending.Â  On top of that, the actual government budget is also way lower percentage-wise around 30% compared to Denmark for example at 53%.For example, let's say that happens with a GDP of 100.You have a budget of 30% to GDP, with a deficit of 9.2, it means you're spending 30% more than you have.You have a budget of 53% to GDP, with a deficit of 9.2, it means you're spending 17% more than you have.Basically, if Salvador does the same thing in 2023 it will mean he has burned in deficit in three years one year of budget in advance.The investment in Bitcoin re a drop in the ocean, and even if it reaches 300k it won't be to save the messed-up finances, it needs around 600k/coin.Quote from: Asiska02 on May 24, 2022, 09:48:08 AMMany debates have erupted online regarding whether or not this is a bitcoin event.

I hope they still rely on the USD for regular spending, though, and in that case it's only a temporary issue. As for adoption by the people of El Salvador, I've seen research that it's not that high, so again, it won't affect the majority. But it can discourage other countries from adoption, of course, when the price has suddenly decreased like this.",

Even now the country have been working to make the adoption more effective.El Salvador haven't sold any of its holding, and the problem arises when the country isn't able to hold for a longer time period to experience the profit out of the investment. Coming year seems to be very crucial for El Salvador, because if the market bounce then everything gets solved. If the market remains the same El Salvador will get pressure on repayment of debts as there is no support from World Bank taking into account the adoption of bitcoin.",

This could just be a speculation, but bitcoin price over long time period never fails, all-time-high is very possible.El Salvador did not fail, only the price of bitcoin is reducing for now as it will later increase back, most people using Chivo wallet are even converting back to USDQuote from: _act_ on April 29, 2022, 06:39:14 AMAlso in the research, 71% of bitcoin sales are mostly converted to dollar, 17% stored as dollar on Chivo wallet while 10% stored as bitcoin.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on May 24, 2022, 06:22:54 PMPeople from El Salvador who got burned on Bitcoin investments will certainly blame Bukele on that.

(you can already see the bottlenecks and headaches here) c. the 'HOPE' of 'adopting bitcoin' was that el salvador would see many american relatives take their dollars to a crypto exchange, convert it to btc and then send BTC to their el salv relatives(remitance) whereby the el salv residents would then put that btc into chivo or the exchange and the government then take custody of the BTC and gives the residents $. meaning a 'cheap' way for the government to 'buy bitcoin' however hardly anyone remitted funds to el salv via this method.d. a few months later, with all the issues.. el salvador dropped its partnership with its LN counterparts(strike) and moved over to another system that was even more custodial(alphapoint). where citizens just had accounts with the exchange and balance moved from one 'account' to another within the exchange custody, which meant less/no need for LNyes citizens could decide to withdraw funds from the exchange as BTC or $. but again hardly any are deciding to keep BTC.withdrawing funds as BTC to an address only the citizen had control over required the onchain fee, which was more then a few hours of minimum wage labour and so they shy'd away from that option",
