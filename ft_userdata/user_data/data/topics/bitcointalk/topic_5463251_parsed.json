We couldn't able to identify the users details as it doesn't show us to view user email. We already sent an email to the glazok.org admin regarding this and waiting for their reply.Regarding AML/KYC, All of our crypto transaction checked by the Exchange Service AML. Sanctioned, High risk gambling more than 69% risk level are automatically block. As per exchange service rules it's require to provide identify docs and provide source of fund document. So far I seen they even accept a chat dialogue between clients or sender about this transfer.and without documents the transaction remain block/frozen status in the exchange service, It can't be refund or process as It's not credited to our account.",

If you are then you may know that we recently submitted to list our website. If you not from Bestchange, As per their requirements we must have to place their logo in our website main page.

It's also because of having lots of feature at reasonable price. You may know mine.exchange one of popular and big exchange. They also using ready made script, It's just made some changes in the homepage. Thank you for your positive opinions.

So far we did researched okpay was a gateway and they closed/merged their business. In the other hand  .io, .org domains are not good for SEO as same word matching .com domain name run same business. We tried to choose a simple and easy rememberable domain name to make an exchanger brand. Thank you.",

Does the deposit address or account mean that it isn't yours/not controlled by you? Who freezed user funds in this case?You claim exchange will go automatically.@rat03gopoh, No, We conduct verification ourselves. At first our team will verify the documents. in case if require it may be share with the financial institute or crypto exchange or gateway to get release the funds with maintain confidentiality.Suppose if you receive to a licensed crypto gateway (Managed wallet) and if it's frozen for AML checking. then you will need to verify your source of fund. But when user exchanging on our website , primarily they do not require any documents. That's why if any transaction frozen due to AML check then it will require ID proof doc and proof of funds. This mechanism require to comply with regulatory requirement, Money laundering law,  sanctioned requirement.Deposited balance are in our control. Not the wallet addresses. Managed Crypto gateway are always works like this. In that case you may be suggest to use own unmanaged wallet, so it will require us to AML check for every transaction even for $10 or $10K. The AML checking cost is much higher, you may check AMLbot or similar service price.while transaction are AML blockage procedure, it will be like this in the crypto acceptance wallet system: https://prnt.sc/n1IF4ylQ29TO . Also it won't move the fund from the crypto wallet until verify done: https://prnt.sc/CBHYwRWlvLBN . this is a proof that money is not credited to our crypto acceptance wallet and didn't used.All exchange orders will be process as usually normally automatically or semi-automatically unless sender funds frozen for AML check.",

We tried some checker system, but some wallet types address shows invalid even it was a valid wallet address. that's why we removed the checker system.On the other hand, if you enter a wrong crypto wallet address, it won't complete the order, it will result failed. So you can contact with our support to fix the wallet address. You are fully responsible to enter the valid account details during create order request.",
