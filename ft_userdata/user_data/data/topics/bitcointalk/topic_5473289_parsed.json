  "content": "What happened::I was a high roller on BC.Game with over 130 million USD wagered. See screenshot below for proof. The nightmare started around two and a half weeks ago when my host informed me not to play too much 1.01x on their originals. This was a strange request to begin with as 1.01x is allowed to be chosen as a multiplier on their own built-in games, so no one would think that playing too much of it would cause a problem. Nonetheless, I agreed to the demand and asked my host what I could play; she said anything over 1.01x is fine. So over the next week, I played a mixture of 1.03-1.05x, 1.1x, 1.3x and 1.5x. However, the next Friday my host informed me again that their risk department were not happy with my wagers and decided to cancel my weekly and monthly bonuses, which would have amounted to around $100k USD. Keep in mind this is AFTER I asked them what I could play and only played what they said were okay. My host also informed me that I would still be able to receive my recharges (which is a bonus in the form of daily or hourly reloads) and did not give any clear instructions on what I could or could not play in the future to keep getting my bonuses.A day later, I found out my withdrawals were locked and was asked by support to complete advanced KYC. I completed it quickly within a few hours but was then told to send an email containing some basic information like my email, IP address, etc that they wanted to \"verify as a normal part of their KYC process\" (looking back, this was clearly a lie and an excuse). I was told the KYC would be completed within 72 hours and I would be able to withdraw again. I continued to claim my reloads during this time while not being able to withdraw. 72 hours later, I still wasn't able to withdraw and was told to wait more. I patiently waited another 3 days, and not only did my withdrawals not get unlocked, I was no longer able to login, with the message \"Account Verification Required\" displayed whenever I tried to login. At this time, I had around $100k accumulated in my balance from my reloads that I wasn't able to withdraw and an additional $40-50k in reloads that I have yet to and won't be able to claim because they locked my login. It has now been 11 days since my withdrawals have been locked and 5 days since I haven't been able to login. My host and their support have started to respond less and less, and I just simply get told to wait more each time with no resolution in sight. It seems from my perspective that I wagered too much and BC.Game just didn't want to pay out large bonuses and found excuses to lock my account. You can also find screenshots containing the conversation between me and my host below.

      "body": "BC.Game is very famous in this scam community, their presence can be seen on every page, which is enough to illustrate the problems with this platform. I haven't been involved in cryptocurrency gambling for long, but from my personal point of view, there are too many small platforms here. Platforms like BC.Game have been around for a long time and only started advertising more after making profits, but in reality they don't have much strength. There is too much negative information about them. All the games on these platforms are provided by suppliers, and when they deceive customers, they shift the blame to the suppliers instead of taking responsibility themselves. This behavior is typical of small platforms! If this platform truly has the ability, please develop your own sports betting platform. I guess Sketa may be the only independently developed cryptocurrency sports betting platform that even offers live streaming videos; it's impossible to watch videos on most other platforms.I only have experience with two platforms: Stake and Roobet, and they are both good. Especially Roobet because I've won $5000 multiple times and received the bonuses immediately without any issues. However, Stake had some minor issues but were quickly resolved. For me, these problems are still within an acceptable range. But I have also tried many other platforms. There was one platform that I don't want to search for its domain name anymore; it was recommended by many people on this forum. On this platform, I deposited $200-300 and won $200-300 as well. After my first withdrawal was rejected, I sought help from customer service who asked me to wager 5 times the withdrawal amount before being able to withdraw funds again. Following their instructions, I made the required wagers but my withdrawal was rejected once again and they requested KYC verification (identity verification). At that time during our conversation, customer service suddenly ended the chat window so I became very angry and frustrated. Therefore, I ultimately decided not to pursue recovering the profits or deposits obtained from them due to unpleasant interaction with their customer service team.The above description mainly focuses on profit-related issues, but in reality, I have lost more than I have won.",

Probably they want you to risk more due to the benefits you are getting as roller without risking much on higher house edge games. Casino obviously hate players like you that playing safe. They are not scam but rather they are taking advantage of their ToS to push you on taking more risk. I believe you can withdraw that lock funds. Perhaps they are asking you to KYC?Actually, the house edge is the same at 1% on the BC.game originals games regardless of what multiplier you choose. The expected loss (EV) is the same to the player, but the variance is smaller for smaller multipliers. As for the rakeback, for BC.Game the bonuses are independent of house edge. They are calculated as a % of 1% depending on the bonus regardless of what game you play (so you will get the same bonus for wagering the same amount on slots or originals or live games). I do agree with your assessment that they likely want me to risk more as a high roller, but cancelling my bonuses and subsequently locking my withdrawals and account seems like a pretty scammy way to do so. Taking advantage of their ToS doesn't make it not a scam. All of these online crypto casinos are unregulated and have ToS that basically allow them to do anything and ban your account at any time with any amount of money in it for any reason. The difference is the bigger casinos like Stake have basic ethical standards to not do something like this; they also have too much reputation at stake. That's a risk everyone takes when playing at these unregulated online crypto casinos. I am aware of that and am obviously not trying to win any legal battles, as I doubt any players can in any situation. I just want to see if a resolution is still possible and if not let others see this site for what it truly is. As mentioned in the post, my withdrawals were locked 11 days ago, and I was asked to complete advanced KYC (I already had basic KYC done). I completed it within a few hours, and not only am I still not able to withdraw to this day, I can no longer access or login to my account as of 5 days ago.

BTW, how much deposited funds you have on your account now?The last conversation was on November 5th shown in the screenshots. I haven't talked to my host since she has been very unresponsive after everything started happening. I suspect their internal people told her something. I have tried to reach out to them by other means every day (live support, email, discord, etc), but I am getting either no response or just get told the same thing to \"wait more\". I have over 100k USD equivalent locked in the account, not sure how much of that is bonus funds. As I mentioned above, it is pointless to quote the ToS since any unregulated online crypto casino is set up in a way that they can basically get away with anything. That doesn't take away from the fact that this is a scammy thing to do: taking away bonuses with no prior notice even after I followed their instructions and later locking my withdrawals and subsequently my account.",

Also a lot of high roller names that I used on the see on the leaderboard are gone or are betting very little compared to before.",

Don nicely quoted the image [I merged them both below to give a clearer context] to show that everything is indeed revoked.If I may ask, what's the point of stopping the tipping feature [with an assumption that his withdrawal is not stopped] in concern of OP tipping to another account and withdrew from that other account? He can simply [suppose his balance returned] withdraw from his own account. After all [if we follow your assumption] it's not locked, he doesn't need to take a detour when he can take the direct course.Quote from: -god- on November 16, 2023, 02:49:08 AMUPDATEAccount was unlocked today, but all my balances were reset to 0 before I was able to login (see screenshot below), so it's kind of pointless.

In addition, I am muted in BC.Game lobby chat for no reason. They probably don't want me to tell my story to the current players on their site lol. That amount is too huge to ignored and I really hate the way that support answer a valid concern. Seems like so casual about the faulty withdrawal function while the customer itself is having a rough time with their concern.One thing doesn’t add up here, why they will unlock the account and open the withdrawal function if the user is really an abuser since the account should be perma ban for violating the ToS.QuoteThe reason they gave is as usual some nonsense related to \"bonus abuse\". Anyone knows how to proceed from here?Your best chance is to challenge them through arbitrator website like CG and AG since your concern can be proved by providing evidence that involves the participation of the casino to provide data from their site. BC has a lot of pending cases until so I’m afraid that you can’t expect too much positive result by doing this.",
