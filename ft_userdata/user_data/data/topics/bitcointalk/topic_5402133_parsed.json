  "content": "https://twitter.com/jakepaul/status/1535324685763764224QuoteJake Paul confirms next fight date with Amanda Serrano set to box on undercardNo opponent has been announced for the YouTube star, who will compete at Madison Square Gardenhttps://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing/jake-paul-next-fight-date-amanda-serrano-b2098595.htmlIt seems that both Jake Paul and Serrano will be fighting as a Co-main event in August but doesn't look like any opponents have been announced. Weird. Unless they're fighting each other haha.I'd imagine Jake won't be fighting anyone big less he likely would have announced it already and done his own fight. Maybe he's combining it with Amanda so it's not a flop. I'd be very surprised if he fights anyone notable, especially someone like Tommy Fury, unless he's worried that not many people will be interested without another headline act like Serrano. I really think he should have tried to set that fight up as it's a logical step up for him and gets him the cred of actually fighting a boxer.I wonder why Serrano just didn't take the Taylor rematch which it seems Taylor really wanted. Even Hearn seemed to be disappointed and very surprised it wasn't happening but maybe Jake thinks he can earn more for her with this fight. The first was a really close fight and I'm sure the rematch would have been even bigger.",

The first was a really close fight and I'm sure the rematch would have been even bigger.Its more important for boxers to retain an undefeated status, than it is for MMA fighters. Serrano likely won't pursue the rematch unless something changes that gives her confidence she can decisively win.I seem to remember the right side of Serrano's face being swollen in the Katie Taylor fight which is also not a good look for boxers.If there was a rematch, I would expect Katie Taylor to improve more than Serrano. Taylor seemed to tire and lose focus in the mid rounds, which is easier to fix than any adjustments Serrano might make.",

      "body": "https://www.instagram.com/tv/CfHXECDFAoG/It looks like Jake Paul was apparently going to face Tommy Fury on this card but Fury is allegedly pulling out with some more excuses (according to Jake in the above video). Hoping this fight does get made as I think it's a great fight for both of them. Gives Jake the credit of fighting a 'proper' boxer and will be huge exposure for Tommy in the USA/worldwide and could get him out of the shadow of his brother depending on how well he does. If Tommy loses though he will be an embarrassment in the boxing world so there's a lot at stake for both of them. Personally, I think it's quite an even fight and couldn't really pick a winner. If Tommy doesn't make this happen it's gonna make him look like a flaker though. Two million purse is a lot of money to walk away from especially to someone like Tommy who really doesn't deserve that sort of cash right now but that's the benefit of fighting Jake.Looks like Jake might have a back up plan though in Nate Diaz as Dana White has apparently given the OK for him to fight:https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/jake-paul-nate-diaz-fight-27297260I'd still prefer to see the Fury fight though. Edit: https://twitter.com/tommytntfury/status/1539647903685173248Looks like Tommy Fury is insinuating he's still fighting him according to that tweet. Tyson Fury was recently denied entry to the USA due to his ties to alleged gang boss so neither him or his dad would have been able to travel to the states for the Tommy fight. Maybe Tyson can get his VISA situation sorted out before then. You know they wouldn't turn him away if he personally had a boxing fight on.",

It'd be more exciting to watch since there seem to be a war against Paul vs MMA fighters. MMA fans are waiting for Jakes loss. Jake is bigger though and still very fit to fight making him in favor on odds. I bet his brother Nick will be the next if Nate loses.",

Neither Jake Paul or Tommy will want to lose this fight and it's going to be an embarrassment for Fury if he does and I think that's what makes this fight intriguing. If Jake has a decent performance who knows where he will go after this fight but if he wins it wouldn't surprise me if his next fight is against someone like McGregor.",

He seems quite quiet really, especially compared to his brother/father and they were doing most of the talking in the build up to the last fight before it was called off. The real excitement is going to be what happens in the ring. I can't call it at all. The odds are slightly in Tommy's favour and that's understandable, but not my much. I could see it going the distance p[ersonally, though I hope someone gets knocked out. I think both fighters could be very cagey and worried about getting knocked out so might be hesitant to go for the kill. Both are going to want to keep their unbeaten 'titles' but it's going to be an absolute embarrassment for Tommy if he doesn't get the KO. Even if it goes the distance and he wins on points it's still going to be a bad look for him in my opinion.

I'd be very surprised if he fights anyone notable, especially someone like Tommy Fury, unless he's worried that not many people will be interested without another headline act like Serrano. I really think he should have tried to set that fight up as it's a logical step up for him and gets him the cred of actually fighting a boxer.Jake Paul is supposed to fight Tommy Fury in this event and we all know that he pulled out of the event one time and that is being expected here as well as Jake Paul and even uncle Chael Sonnen predicted that Tommy Fury will pull out of the event citing some injuries and hence may be Jake Paul is mocking him with the poster and i really wanted to see that fight happen rather than any other short term replacement.Quote from: hilariousetc on June 23, 2022, 10:29:16 AM~ If Jake has a decent performance who knows where he will go after this fight but if he wins it wouldn't surprise me if his next fight is against someone like McGregor. McGregor is too small for Jake Paul and i would not want to see that mismatch and Jake Paul would easily win that fight as he will be dragged to the later rounds and finish him there. But for what McGregor lacks in height he makes up in experience and skill. Both McGregor and Mayweather are 1.73 meters tall and Floyd obviously fought Logan Paul who is 1.88 so I can still see this happening in the future. Nobody will care about the difference in height/weight when there's a shitload of money on the line. If Jake wins this I guarantee you Connor will probably start sniffing around for this fight.",
