What I think is that if a casino has verified an account which they know is using encrypted connection like virtual private network (VPN) on their website then they should not go back to pretend they didn't know about it. If the have done verification to see the user is not laundering money or doing some sort illegally but only trying to evade IP ban from his home country then it should not be a problem for the casino, after all they might have allowed such window for that kind of purpose.",

Note also if an account is already verified,  the player then does not have any problem as long as the gambler operates within the stipulated laws and abides by them and if there is any reason such player uses a VPN the casino may overlook that.",

The customer support played it safe by referring to the clause that stated that the use of VPN to circumvent the region restriction is not allowed but I never got a yes as an answer if the player is not in the restricted area.So I think it is better to be safe and avoid using VPN in order for us to not get any problems in the future.  Quote from: DoublerHunter on August 28, 2023, 09:19:10 AM^Why you are using VPNs if a casino is allowed in your country?

Reading TOS is much better before using the casino.There are game providers that block a country even though the player is not in a restricted region.  That is the reason for some players why they use VPN. But as for me, I won't dare to use a VPN just to access a certain game provider.  It is better to be safe than sorry.",

If not, then that means that you just saved yourself from obtaining misinformation and you're able to clear it before you even does.

I think that Stake has alternative links which you can access without a VPN as far as I know and even when I used to play at bet365 when in my country was restricted from ISP-s here,I could access them without a VPN so most likely beside Stake also other casinos most probably should have alternative links.I would only use a VPN in the extreme case where I have no other means at all to access the website and accessing only a couple of times I doubt there is any problem with the casinos,as long as you have 2FA enabled that makes it even less suspicious as 2FA with Google Authenticator app and not with SMS is absolutely impossible to be bypassed.",

Bypassing restrictions is not the problem, but it was never allowed officially, meaning you should accept whatever will be thrown in your face. What do you think? You really need to read the terms and understand how each casino handles VPN usage, because some will ban it outright. Others may allow it but will definitely expect KYC verification and always tend to limit you to one account only, because they don't want bonus abuse to take place. However VPN usage can sometimes go undetected, alternatively it might be a red flag against your account that will cause the casino to undertake further investigations against you - if they can determine you are a user of this service. Generally there are very few scenarios where an average user would be using a VPN middleman service on their connect, unless they are trying to get around certain restrictions like geographic location.",

Casino doesn’t specifically restrict users on using VPN. Only those bypassing their country restrictions through the use of VPN is what is not allowed and not the use of VPN itself for regular use alone. Casino has a license which includes a set a of country being restricted to play due to legal concern. If you are not from restricted country then using VPN is not your problem. I’m using for a long time in all casino that I play. I never encounter this issue. Just make sure to avoid using VPN that use IP sharing because you might be connected to bunch of account that violate the casino ToS because your account will suffer same punishment.",

Bypassing restrictions is not the problem, but it was never allowed officially, meaning you should accept whatever will be thrown in your face. What do you think? I think as long as KYC is completed and both parties agree that the user will use a VPN, it should be allowed, but as a rule of thumb, VPNs are very suspicious, especially if the user has not completed the KYC process. Should the user be gambling from a country which is not allowed by the terms and conditions of the mentioned casino, then obviously the casino owners would get into legal trouble for letting him play and withdraw on their platform. They have government regulations that they have to follow, after all. So when they see someone logging in with a different IP each time, it raises an eyebrow. Furthermore, it could trigger a false positive should the VPN IP come from a restricted country. Its a lot of confusion and trouble which can be avoided.",

I understand the concept of using a VPN for accessing online casinos, but it's important to note that the legality and ethical implications of such actions can vary based on local regulations. While using a VPN might allow users to bypass restrictions, it's not a foolproof method and can still raise concerns about compliance with both casino policies and legal standards. Additionally, KYC procedures are indeed implemented by many reputable casinos to ensure responsible and legal gambling practices. However, it's essential for users to be aware of the potential risks and consequences associated with using VPNs in this context.",

Some casinos don't clearly write it down on their site, so we have to ask the support service. But some casinos only need your connection to the casino for the first time so that the casino can record your computer number or your IP or Mac Address or whatever (I don't know about this because I'm not too clear on this either).If it is about crossing the line, maybe if you are from a country where gambling is not allowed, you should stay away from the casinos and never visit them, even though you can use a VPN. If your country allows gambling but the casino prohibits people from your country from gambling in the casino, you should not gamble in the casino even if you are using a VPN.
