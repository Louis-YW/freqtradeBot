Most crypto firms sometimes engage in some advertisement that doesn't reflect the nature and risk involved in investing in such a product or coin. These rules will enable the UK populace to be exposed to true and balanced promotional material that is void of any form of deception or hidden agenda. If investors know the risk that is involved in a particular project and decide to invest in it, they would have no one to blame. It will be fair if the customer and investor are aware of the true picture of the project and not be fed with fake media hype. The good news is that crypto firms can carry out any form of advertisement without restrictions.",

I don't quite understand what was the motivation behind it. It kind of looks like one of those things that regulators do just to show they're doing \"something\" and to justify their existence.What really annoys me is that they banned \"refer a friend\" type of programmes, whereas similar ones are allowed for gambling websites or CFD platforms, where vast majority of players/traders lose money. So doesn't look like there's much logic behind it.",

So doesn't look like there's much logic behind it.A good amount of money is always allocated to any project, so regulating something is actually also very profitable The governments themselves are to blame for the fact that the banking system is no longer as reliable as it was 30 years ago, and any bank account can be either blocked or attacked by fraudsters with the help of bank employees.",

New joining bonuses work exactly on the same principle, as new members receive profits for joining early.Keeping the ads open is a good step.Probably depends on the kind of airdrop. i.e. if it's organised by a business, the tokens that are being given away are already traded and the purpose is to attract new customers - then I'd imagine it'd fall under new rules. But if the airdrop is for new tokens that are not yet traded, so they're market value at the moment of an airdrop is zero, and a team of developers organises it, then it's probably outside of those regulations. That's just my interpretation though.Quote from: zasad@ on October 12, 2023, 11:37:49 AMIf you are interested in what is happening in the UK, then lawyers advised me to read these commentshttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/29/pdfs/ukpgaen_20230029_en.pdfCrypto exchanges need to obtain licenses both to operate and to advertise their services.And therefore, any information in English for UK citizens may be regarded as operating without a license in the UK and subject to fines.Exchanges will flee the UK.Thanks, that's a pretty chunky document though, with nearly 300 pages. But from the emails I got from various exchanges regarding the new regulations, it doesn't seem like the new restrictions are that severe.And there might be a way to bypass some of them, e.g. Binance partnered up with an FCA-registered entity and will be delegating all restricted activities to them.",

I see this as a cost-effective move for Binance since making a dedicated marketing firm in the UK is probably expensive for their needs. I'm pretty sure the government won't fine or sanction any exchange or business who do the same thing as Binance unless I misunderstand how the regulation works.",

I communicate with lawyers from a crypto company and they share some information with me.Restrictions are always created so that they can be circumvented, but only selected large crypto exchanges will be able to do this.",
