I think you need to move this under Digital goods: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=93.0Hello , I don't think i can move it to \"Digital goods\" i see the category but was too late. Its custom made script ( there have many laravel vendors scripts ) which is free to use by anyone. I'm core developer and i will give warranty 3 months for bug free. Code is very well writen with many comments on it so everybody which know PHP laravel and JS can edit it easy. Design is bought from third party and i have contact with the guy and i will provide it too. Regards!P.S. If some of mods can move it to \"Digital goods\" i will be very thankful!",
