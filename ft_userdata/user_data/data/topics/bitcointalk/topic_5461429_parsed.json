If its not, well I would imagine slowly the egg will rot and decay. Probably pretty smelly for whoever is around it.But if it is a live egg, what happens after it hatches? Project is over?",

This just sounds like someone trying to break a record in the genius book of records.Sound like a joke coin project to me, because from all indications, this project cannot provide the service it promises and this is something we have to look away from in most cases at a time, instead of focusing on the profit and empty promises the coin made for investors, I am yet to see what the unique feature is in this project that ops will say it will revolutionize the market..This won't be any different from all the shitcoins that we have around, that instead of focusing on developing a brand, there tend to compete or try to change the market without any capacity to do so.",
