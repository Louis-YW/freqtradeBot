These includes- own blog website, where you make reviews and etc.- youtube channels, where most videos are used to lure people making reviews.These two should have enough traffic so that your articles and videos will be viewed. - become an advertiser, PPC is something you must try ONLY if this is allowed for freebitco as a way to promot links. This also depends on your budget so you should research websites that has lots of traffic for crypto or gambling niche and make any possible collaboration to the web admin.As you may know freebitco is known for its faucet, referral/affiliates and it is a very old website. Sure in crypto gambling people heard about them and registered already. So your very target are the new comers which is more rare due to current market situation.",

      "body": "If you want to go the SEO route, creating a blog with really unique and helpful content could be a good add-on for your so far ideas.I have a lot of experience in creating affiliate webpages also in the crypto scene. Few tips that have worked for me:- Create a blog with a personal touch. Preferrably with your real name (better for Google E-A-T). In this case a pseudonym could work also if you can maintain a personal touch there and don't want to use your real name.- Create really useful articles like \"How to find free faucets you never knew existed\" etc.- Mention openly that you are an affiliate website (better for Google SEO recommendations)- Try to find legit and trusted backlinks as much as you can. Buying links is an option too, but a little risky as it is agains Google's guidelines.- Be consistent and don't give up. SEO route is really slow compared to other methods, we are talking more like years than weeks or months. But it can be really worth it in the long run.Right now I am creating some content on affiliate marketing to my blog, so why not check that out if you are interested!Cheers,Jaakko",

      "body": "Cool site!Just my thoughts here, I would tone down the animations and the most brightest colors (yellow). Usually more light color scheme (white background etc) can be considered more trusted than black.There are some problems with design, in the about-page the text gets cropped (in my Chrome at least) on the top.For SEO I would add more personal touch to about-page. Who are you? Why the site exists? What are your goals? This will help E-A-T and transparency = better SEO. If you don't know E-A-T, google more about that. Also my blog has some ideas about it.Good luck for the site!

These includes- own blog website, where you make reviews and etc.This isn’t exactly a blog website, but it is my domain for which I purchased for the sole purpose of teaching and then redirecting people to freebitco. bitcointutorial.net ...It’s not perfect, as I made the site before I even knew that freebitco’s most legitimate online presence is here on this forum (aside from their twitter and their actual site which are both run by hardware/software). Having said that, a lot of what could be on the site as far as information about the site, and other mechanics about the site, could be updated and worked on. I would love your or anyone else’s opinion on it. I mostly have problems with SEO and getting exposure, but methods of increasing that are quite costly or lengthy in terms of time and organic progression.I would love to hear your thoughts of if you know how I can get exposure to my funnel site. I figure the site is enough that marketing just the link alone would be effective. I designed the site with beginners in mind. Even after all these efforts I still can’t get any active refs long term.",
