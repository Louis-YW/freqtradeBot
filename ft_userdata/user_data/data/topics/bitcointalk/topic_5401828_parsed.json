      "body": "The casino have a good design in my opinion and accepting different cryptocurrency when depositing and withdrawals which is also a good instead of using only one crypro to use in the casino. Anyway, this is not the right board to post a thread about selling your own casino even though casino is about gambling business. There's digital goods board where in my opinion where it does belong. Trying to access the site but it says address not found.",

I think your site may not be accessible to somr country and this should be know to whoever buys your casino. As I have said earlier, I can't access the website you have given just by opening the link that you have given and it always say \"address not found\", I do agree with acroman08 that the design needs polishing but all in all the design is not bad to start with.",
