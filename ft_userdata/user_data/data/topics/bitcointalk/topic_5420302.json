Some people will ask in case you are close, others will not even bother. 3) As others have said shipping is the killer. So there is also craigslist / facebook marketplace / and so on for selling locally.4) --> Make sure they work before selling them <--5) Be realistic in pricing, an S7 will probably loose MORE then the $1.50 a day that ETF posted once you factor in everything, these will be for people to play with so you are probably looking at just about scrap metal / e-waste recycling prices.-Dave",

An S3 is totally pointless to mine with, but is just about bulletproof, will run off an old 500 watt power supply and with the fans set to low speed makes a just about silent space heater.Yes you CAN do the same thing with a 1 board S9 BUT even the stock S9 fans at low speed make more noise then the S3 ones and it's still not as reliable. It's not about making money, it's about generating heat at not a total loss. You can drop an S7 in the trunk of your car and keep it there bouncing around for months and then take it out to demo mining to people and it will work. Put it back in your trunk and bounce it around some more.If I sneeze too loud near an S9 a heatsink falls off......So not 100% junk if you have a use for them.Scrap heatsink aluminum is going for around $0.50 / lb here and the the circuit boards are at $1.00 / lb-Dave",

My setting is, though, a bit different.Overproduction from the roof goes to the electricity grid and I get paid for it. The mining thingies are decentralized. For example: My tractor's generator is defect. Instead of replacing it, I put a solar panel as roof on the tractor. It loads the battery. Once the battery is full, energy goes to a raspi with a SIM card. The raspi is connected to a little pod (50 GH/s).Then I have a cave under my house. Two solar panels are producing electricity and first filling two batteries. Once full, the solar power is running a dehumidifier which collects the water to a barrel. Once the barrel is full, a pump - powered by solar energy - pumps the water to a cistern. Now all excess power goes into two old Bitmain S1 which hash with crappy 160 GH/s. Their heat is funneld into the cave for condensation. The water goes - you guess it - into the barrel, too. The excess heat is directed out of the cave again.Then there is a solar loading station for my electric lawn mower. Once its batteries are full, the power goes - you guess it - into mining.There are several spots on my land like these, they all run old devices. Does it pay off? No. Of course not. But if every solar powered device which is not connected to the grid would produce some GH insstead of heat when not being used, it would be awesome and a great step towards decentralisation of mining (again).",

Wi-Fi? 4g? and how are you powering that equipment? Or is everything hard wired?I have frequently looked at some places that I can use that have more power then they can use, and at least this time of year could use the extra heat of a miner, but the issue turns into I don't have internet there and would have to get some reliable internet there to mine. With free power and free miners more or less. Even assuming my time was 100% free, just the cost of getting cheap internet would kill any potential money that these miners would make. -Dave",

Even assuming my time was 100% free, just the cost of getting cheap internet would kill any potential money that these miners would make. I agree - for the moment. One solution would be to have a multisig-wallets for hundreds of small miners (like: Three trusted members would administrate this wallet). If all these small miners would send their hashes to one pool, the payout could take place once a year and then being distributed to lightning wallets. Still, it most probably wouldn't pay the costs, but at least the minimum payout of some pools could be eliminated this way.In the best of all worlds - we don't live in one - all micro-miners could pool and solo-mine...",

      "body": "So  I have heard older asics have been used to keep a steady load on bigger diesel generator setups in different parts of the world. One example was a mine in alaska and a friend. That worked in Africa at an airfield to repair airplanes. They had expensive generators and very efficient air conditioners. But at peak times had to run  aircompressor ,drain pumps ect .. and at night alot of lights. They would use the load of the asics to prevent burning out the gennys. But the mindset was different the mtx ran them for load and did not take care of them, like for example rain getting sucked in they were just plugged in and run inefficiently, they did have network cables on them.  Btw the way the whole conversation started was he was showing pics they had a meal kitchen place setup and low and behold there was what looked like the case of an s9 stripped out on end with a teapot on top.",
