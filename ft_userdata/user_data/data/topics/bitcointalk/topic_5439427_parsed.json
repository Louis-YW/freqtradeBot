Stay very transparent as this is one key factor that will get you outstanding in the industry.2. Have an active customer service because gamblers always want to talk directly with a representative rather than a bot.3. Please get your casino licensed and try as much as possible to balance the licensing requirements with gamblers demands.I wish you best of lucks",

Anyway, welcome to the forum and what cryptocurrencies will you accept and do you bave a team or you run the casino yourself. If you did it alone then that's lot of work to do. It seems you really want people to gamble anonymously not that I don't like it but many people want to gamble anonymously and most casinos nowadays is norm to require KYC if necessary.",

You do not need to be a developer to bring the next big idea. All these wealthy guys are not from IT background. You need to be a businessman to be in the business.Good luck.",

If you are going to buy the script from someone else, then they will be ripping you off with the maintenance fees and they will be the secret partner of your business.If you can code your own casino, then you must be a hell of a coder because you will attract all kinds of exploiters, hackers, cheaters and everytime you get hacked you will have to patch that shit up. Sometimes you won't even understand how they hacked your website and that's where your problems will start.Long story short, I think it is not worth it.",

They will surely perform good because they have same games with other top tier casino and they just lacked the license. IIRC their license is already on process with Curacao last year but I don’t have any updates regarding this. I’m not player of this casino but it’s just absurd to play on non-license casino while they have a random KYC requirement at some point for AML policy.Quote from: maudo on February 11, 2023, 07:06:56 AMi would prefer 0 monthly fee, just revenue % share with them It’s delusional to think that you can steady profit without paying any monthly fees for your casino operation. Even top casino spends millions of dollar just for their marketing excluding the operation cost. Maybe you are targeting a small profit monthly which is possible if you got lucky to find loyal players.",
