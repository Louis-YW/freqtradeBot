      "body": "I found a review on PrimeXBT published Aug 3rd: https://www.coinbureau.com/review/primexbtQuoteIs PrimeXBT Regulated?Though founded and registered in Seychelles, with offices in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and a recent move and consideration of becoming headquartered in Switzerland, PrimeXBT IS NOT currently regulated or licensed. This is an alarm bell for many, as it means there is no authoritative body to hold the platform accountable or enforce any sort of laws or rules.Basically, customers who choose to use this platform are on their own and do so at their own risk. If the company decides to do a runner or a rug pull, or even if they decide you didn’t actually win that trade and refuse your payout, there is very little legal action anyone can take against them. Though the platform has a lot of positive reviews and few complaints, and a long history of satisfied traders, this is still an important consideration.At the stage of migrating their head office, there may be most of their policies that will be revised according to the basic regulations. That's why they temporarily have no legal basis for cracking down on users from their previous blacklisted countries.",

Thanks for any helpIf you are a long binance customer why would you switch to primeXBT which is a far worse exchange? Binance has all you need. Derivatives are locked for people from UK, just like primeXBT but VPN wont hide you. They have more tools for that and both have KYC.But ... if you only want to be able to take short position you don't need derivatives. As far as I know margin trading is not banned:\"Can you margin trade on Binance UK?Following the publication of the article, Binance reached out to clarify that margin products are not subject to restrictions although it is mentioned in the notice sent out to users.\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/14/binance-uk-is-threatening-to-block-derivatives-traders-in-a-move-to-keep-regulators-at-bay/Available on you binance account with 3x and 10x leverage.",

Just grab the exchange of what is available in your place.However, you can try if you really want but don't use a free VPN, just use paid VPN because they have a better security feature than the free VPN also you are experimenting with this just accept the possible result of banning an account at least you are ready and spend a little amount that you can afford.

On OKX that I just check their margin trading right now, it offers 10x for both cross and isolated margin trades. 10x is even getting higher and liquidation risks is higher. Trading is fun with low leverage, I have even gone from 3x BTC/USDT pair to 1x or 2x which have been helping me to make profit unlike before that I panic close position or my asset got liquidated easily.Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on August 07, 2022, 05:44:10 AMHe is not looking for derivatives.

Surprisingly, I did not know I can use margin to also short and long position until I saw your post today, I went to OKX BTC/USTD margin pair and I was able to short or long and not different in layout with their future trading. If mckenzie126 can be able to use margin trading for it, It would be a good alternative, but I will advice him not to go more than 1x leverage which he has been doing with spot trading.",

This is kind of why I asked the question here as to how this is possible & was hoping if anyone could shed any light on what appears to be a grey area from a UK perspective. As far as I know the ban is still in place but perhaps the small print somewhere does allow it somehow under certain conditions, I don't know. What I should probably do is just ask them directly what their policy is.",
