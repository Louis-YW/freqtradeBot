      "body": "Check the forum using the search function there have been multiple posts about this and the answer it cannot be moved because it is not included in the general transaction databa. The first coinbase transaction was actually this 50 bitcoin and it was actually not added to overall database transactions there by making it non existence to the nodes who validate transactions before they are spent, in that regard it is as though it doesn’t exist and cannot be spent then. This might be a flaw or might not be a flaw but a deliberate act by Satoshi himself as said earlier, it is almost similar to the choosing of 21 million as the total supply",

Nope. It's either a bug, or Satoshi just decided he didn't want those first 50 BTC to be spendable. There were several bugs in the early versions of Bitcoin that eventually got fixed. This is very likely to be just another bug, and it just wasn't worth going through the hard fork that would be necessary to fix it.",

      "body": "QuoteWhy have the bitcoins never been moved from satoshi's genesis wallet?Because if you start a new coin from scratch, then you naturally start from zero coins in circulation. The first version had no \"Genesis Block\" at all. But: if you have no such block, then you can always erase the full chain, by mining in the past. Then, you don't have to start from 2009. You can start from 1970 as well, and create a chain of blocks for 39 years.So, you start from a version without any Genesis Block, produce some chains, and notice, that it is needed, to block any incentive, to mine blocks in the past, and constantly rewrite the chain. To make the system honest, it is also needed to prove somehow, that you also didn't mine the chain in advance, and everyone had the chance to mine it, after being released.Then, you use some information from the outside, like a text from the newspaper (or the mainnet block hash, as it is in testnet4). You make this block special, which also allows you, to reset the chain, if needed. And during testing, you can check different scenarios, by starting from different genesis blocks.For example: this is prenet Genesis Block: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5355610.0QuoteThey can't be moved because they are like a bank's reserve or is there another theory?Those coins are locked forever. Coins could be locked into OP_RETURN as well (or rather: OP_FALSE, because the meaning of OP_RETURN was different at that time), or the amount could be set to zero. It doesn't matter, nobody can access them, because you start from an empty database, and then add new coins, on top of that. Of course, it was more natural, to use a regular OP_CHECKSIG, with a regular key, to have the ability to prove, that you started the chain, if that would ever be needed.",

The technical explanation that you 've provided is the correct one.One could argue that Satoshi has intentionally \"lost\" access to the coins that they 've mined.There are assumptions, but no proof whatsoever, that Satoshi mined many blocks (~20,000).

It doesn't have to be Satoshi, and the estimation of 20k blocks is also covered with a huge assumption, that a single miner own all chunks of nonces (which may be incorrect, because every time, when extraNonce starts again from zero, there could be another miner, with similar mining power).QuoteThe coins that they 've generated haven't moved either.Some of them moved, but then, they are excluded from the pattern. For example: http://satoshiblocks.info/We have blocks from 0 to 14 with one extraNonce line, and people assume, that Satoshi mined them. But: block number 9 and 12 are explicitly excluded from the pattern, because those coins were spent.And then, we have blocks from 15 to 25, forming another extraNonce line.

Every coin that is not burned using OP_RETURN is by definition spendable. So the coins after the genesis block may be intentionally lost but this doesn't mean they are provenly unrecoverable!Quote from: garlonicon on November 26, 2024, 12:12:38 PMSome of them moved, but then, they are excluded from the pattern.

The 50 bitcoin coinbase reward is unredeemable, as it was omitted from the transaction database. This means any attempt to spend it would be rejected by the network. Whether this was intentional or not still remains unknown.A total of 0.00 BTC ($0.00) were sent in the block with the average transaction being 0.0000 BTC ($0.00). Satoshi earned a total reward of 50.00 BTC $0.00. The reward consisted of a base reward of 50.00 BTC $0.00 with an additional 0.0000 BTC ($0.00) reward paid as fees of the 1 transactions which were included in the block.Genesis Block (Bitcoin Wiki).QuoteBlock rewardThe first 50 BTC block reward went to address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa,[1] though this reward can't be spent due to a quirk in the way that the genesis block is expressed in the code. It is not known if this was done intentionally or accidentally.[4][5][6] It is believed that other outputs sent to this address are spendable, but it is unknown if Satoshi Nakamoto has the private key for this particular address, if one existed at all.",
