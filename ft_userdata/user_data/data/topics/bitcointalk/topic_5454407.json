In the interview Mehdi seemed to comment on almost everything that was being discussed but when asked if Sinbad was a new version of the now defunct Bitcoin mixer Blender, he refused to comment.\"Elliptic\" is a crypto tracing company and they have suggested there is irrefutable evidence $22 million moved from Blender to Sinbad in the very early days after Sinbad was created therefore that doubles the reasons why it will probably be the next mixer to be shut down sooner rather than later.Sinbad.io probably does not have too much time before various law enforcement agencies get together to organise the shutdown of their website and try to arrest the owner/operator on money laundering charges. If criminal activity as taken place on an industrial scale and almost zero protocols were put in place to either reduce, minimise or eliminate the risk of illegal activity by the owner/operator they will end up facing serious criminal charges.",

The prediction that it will be the next to be shut down by law enforcement agencies is mere speculation, who knows another one might be the next because they offer almost the same service. After all, nobody expected the sudden closure of the almighty Chipmixer because no publication predicted it. We can not doubt that these mixer services are needed to promote privacy and limit centralization. But like other genuine services, criminals will always capitalize on this wonderful service to carry out their evil activities. Relating Sinbad with Blender is mere rumors that have not been proven even the website publication used the word \"may\", which means that they are not sure that Sinbad is an offshoot of Blender.",

Even if they are doing nothing illegitimate, for some reason everybody in law enforcement sees them as illegitimate. I will also say, with more and more exchanges that are not requiring KYC going away I see privacy becoming more and more difficult to obtain. Continuing with that thought, I have posted many times about various ways to somewhat reliably break proof of ownership of coins. It requires time and effort a decent knowledge of exchanges and (this is important) hunting down exchanges that consider a simple SMS and e-mail address enough KYC for a certain level of withdrawals. Because, if you deposit coins in one exchange using a disposable e-mail and phone number, convert them to another coin, transfer that coin to another exchange that just requires an e-mail address and disposable phone number, and then withdraw from that second exchange after converting to another coin good luck ever being able to prove anything especially if you used XMR or other privacy coins to transfer between exchanges.Tinfoil hat paranoia, the last mixer that is left standing is run by the NSA....-Dave",

Having another one about the same topic and in the reputation board is just boring.I guess Sinbad is paying people secretly to keep them always in the discussions.

Also, to my knowledge Whirlwind have not been accused of money laundering by any law enforcement agency nor is their owner/operator the subject of an international arrest warrant. Having said that, criminals will use anything that is available for conducting (or trying to conduct) criminal acts.As an example, just because banks can be used for money laundering does not mean everybody using their services will launder money and as long as the banks have mechanisms in place to either reduce, minimise or eliminate the risk of illegal activity by the owner/operator they will end up escaping serious criminal charges as they do not want to fall in to illegal activity. If a case was made against a bank they could fight a lawsuit against a governmental agency to show they implemented various rules to prevent criminal activity. I think exchanges do the same, they blacklist addresses that have passed on them by law enforcement agencies and are obligated to seize funds to hand over various data to those agencies.A test case for a mixer in a Court of law will be thoroughly informative.

Even if they are doing nothing illegitimate, for some reason everybody in law enforcement sees them as illegitimate.There were times I thought this, too (especially after BitMixer and Blender were taking down). But I got some hope when I read the proposed regulation for crypto-asset transfers in the EU. They acknowledge clearly that there are legitimate uses of mixers here:Quote(34d) The use of mixing and tumbling services should only be allowed in circumstances where it can be shown that the use of such services is necessary to overcome legitimate concerns, such as for privacy reasons. Source: Draft legislation 2021/0241 (COD)It is implied that this means no general prohibition of mixing, however, that crypto asset service providers, when registering a transaction coming from a mixer and the transaction being suspicious, \"should\" collect additional data and/or a justification of the mixing \"practice\".Of course this is only a draft proposal in one of the major economic regions, but it could indicate a \"pragmatic\" stance regarding mixers becoming more commonplace. It is also possible that mixing services themselves could be regulated eventually, i.e. for example determining maximum non-KYC amounts and otherwise some form of KYC (which would of course be difficult to be implemented by the current mixers like Sinbad, Whirlwind etc.).Of course if it is suspected that a mixing operator has cooperated with criminals or acted with a high degree of negligence (i.e. not performing at least basic chain analysis for funds linked to major hacks/thefts/ransomware attacks), then further seizures are to be expected.Edit: Unfortunately, the article I mentioned before was deleted from the final regulation draft. Instead a more ambiguos passage was introduced: that the European Banking Authority (EBA) should clarify the rules crypto-asset providers shall adopt when faced with transactions which went through mixers. So we have to wait what's the final outcome of this.",

The body of your post showed clearly that you made a post as a user in the forum who is at liberty to express himself whenever and however. But remembering that the signature and avatar you wear is the one of the major competitor of sinbad.io. You would have been kinda lenient in the choice of your title. Something like this could be more appropriate. After Chipmixer, which mixer is Next To Be Shutdown?Then, in the body of your post you would then mention the article sinbad was linked to blender or so.",

Can I start a global discussion about mixers with something like Is Whirlwind.money Next To Be an exit scam? Or if The Sceptical Chymist wants it to be more global we can include Unijoin in this way, it would really encourage discussion. We just need to change the name of the mixer with passive accusations.It seems like you want to create a war among the Mixer World Campaign participant Do you know one thing? People are interested more in negative things. If you spread negative things, more and more people will engage with this and will find it interesting to discuss. While I believe JollyGood's title choice is a bit weird. He could have used better wording not to poke Sinbad. But the title makes it more interesting to read. examplens, did you see the fact LeGaulois posted in another thread? It seems Sinbad and Blender Owner is the same. Since Blender was seized, and now it's exposed that Sinbad is Blender, they should take action and come up with a new brand name. Quote from: LeGaulois on February 13, 2023, 08:29:52 PMFact 1: the signature campaign for sinbad.io was paid with funds coming from Blender's walletCoincidence? Blender's admin is so kind that he decided to pay the campaign's participants? For a service he has nothing to do with?Blender decided to become a charity person?Fact 2: almost all of the early incoming TXs to Sinbad were coming from the suspected Blender's wallet.Suspected, but blockchain forensics companies are rarely wrongFact 3: Both use approximatively the same methods to obfuscate their transactionsFact 4: Both use a 10 digit mixer codes",
