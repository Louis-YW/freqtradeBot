The reintroduction is aimed at ensuring the functionality and integrity of the system rather than depriving the previous owner of their rightful property.",

One might also wonder about the technical feasibility of such an idea, it would be necessary to be able to withdraw BTC from certain wallets without the actual consent of the owners of said wallets. I think this would open the door to negative possibilities for bitcoin, it would imply that we don't really own our BTC, even when we have our private keys.Personally I find it very positive to have a large amount of bitcoin lost/burned, it allows to guarantee a certain minimum price in theory, if we are interested in the FIAT value of BTC at least. The deflationary interest of Bitcoin would be a bit lost with such a process.",

So the coins in a wallet that has not performed a transaction in 131 years (full bitcoin mining life), will be reintroduced to the network by another cycle of mining. In this way, we wouldn't steal money from people, because they would be able to prevent the reintroduction, by performing a simple transaction, thereby \"verifying their activity\".",

Just randomly deciding to take other people's Bitcoin from their own addresses and redisburse it?!? Even if a wallet is inactive for generations maybe its the long term savings of a family and they haven't touched it and just keep passing it down. It would be insane to unilaterally decide its okay to just take Bitcoin from addresses.I can't believe the first objection you thought people would have with this would be something to do with deflation, and not to do with the fact that you're saying you think people's bitcoin should be forfeit if you simply hold on to it for too long!And in a completely insane world where we wanted Bitcoin to be awful and made this happen, how would it even be redistributed? Who would decide the distribution, how would it be decided?God, occasionally people come up with just horrendous ideas to change Bitcoin for no good reason, this definitely is on that list.

Doing this will make Bitcoin centralized since you will remove the freedom for people to hold in long term period because their coin might be categorized as lost if they didn’t touch it for long period of time.Exactly. I mean even today you see articles about there being like 4 million or 5 million lost bitcoin because people just assume any bitcoin that hasn't moved since like 2013 has been lost, but every couple of months I see an article about how a few hundred bitcoin of some address that's been inactive since 2010 or 2011 was just moved. Plenty of the \"lost\" bitcoin is not actually lost but is still owned by people.There is no amount of time (like 109 years as the OP suggests) that can pass that would make it okay to for the protocol itself to steal people's Bitcoin.This would make Bitcoin no longer sovereign money because in its very design it would steal your money if you held it for too long. This idea would fundamentally break Bitcoin for no good reason at all. There is no difference in Bitcoin's utility whether there are 21 million bitcoin available or 19 million or 17 million.",

The protocol, which would be the neutral entity performing the process, wouldn't steal people's money. An address owner could \"reset\" the clock whenever they make a transaction through it. Much like when you breathe: 131 years would be the time for a wallet to die without breathing, that is, transacting, and the energy (money) into it to be reintroduced into the network.The wallet owner could then provide proof that the coins in the wallet address are still active, potentially able to circulate again (actively managed by an owner).

Honest question, what would you think? I think there is already something like this. It is called the Copyright Act, and its relative Copyright Term Extension Act. It gives us the possibility to channel work into the public domain. An implementation like this would prevent previous work to be directly wasted through loss of coins. Rather, the reward of that work would be reintroduced into the network through additional work, new mining for missing coins. This additional work would \"pay the price\" for having lost them in the first place, while maintaining a fixed amount of circulating coins.",

The coins subjected to this process of recycling would be the ones of \"dead\" wallets, i.e those wallets that have been inactive (no transaction) for a period equal to the full mining cycle (131 years). This same thing happens in nature. The universe doesn't steal energy from dead bodies, it recycles that energy channeling it back into the system. Bitcoin has a curious habit of mimicking nature when it comes to energy, except for recycling. Energy is never permanently lost in nature, it just transforms from one form to another. It seems that bitcoin neglects the recycle of lost money/energy back into the system.",
