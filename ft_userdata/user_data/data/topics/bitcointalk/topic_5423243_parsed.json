The only way to avoid is when you use your own node or 3rd party RPC. Most newbie only use the metamask default RPC that makes them exposed on this new privacy rules of metamask.They said that they will just use it for AML purposes but this a big attack on user privacy without even knowing it. Metamask is the most popular web3 wallet in crypto space so I’m sure a lot of user will be affected.Don’t be a victim of this privacy attack. Use hardware wallet on storing your funds!https://reclaimthenet.org/metamask-starts-tracking-user-ips/",
