It is true that there are other platforms where you can find information that you haven't know yet but this forum is also like that where everyone is sharing what they know and help those who needs help. We don't know the real reason why a person will left but I am sure there's a reason for it or either that person being a bad one that cause problem and many people doesn't like someone bad or causing problem and decided to leave. Anyway, I stop visiting this forum over a year but it doesn't mean I leave that's my point.",

Sounds awkward anyways.The forum has been helpful to everyone - in every ramification I should ever think of.. could you believe I instantly spot out Scammy projects when I see them?? ...and I've also been able to comfortably learn about the Blockchain and the technicalities in BTC Trnx as a whole...

Can there be anything (assuming you did not break any of the rules) that will make you leave the forum or not?Many of us have become addicted to the forum that we must check the forum almost every day. Apart from the quality Bitcoin education I derive from the forum, I have also built a relationship with the forum and some members that will make it very difficult to leave this forum. But issues like health problems or lack of time can be a challenge to be active in the forum. Only sickness can make me leave the forum entirely. Also if one gets a job that is time consuming, the constant visit to the forum might become limited. I don't think I will totally leave the forum because Bitcoin will always be my number one investment and currency. Therefore, I will always come back here once in a while to gather information.

Ending signature campaigns will reduce post counts but people might still visit the forum because they want to be informed about a currency they own. This forum is one of the best mediums to gain knowledge about new developments in the Bitcoin space.",
