  "content": "Sad news shrouded the local board Bahasa Indonesian where one of our contributors was is known to have died of an illness several years ago and we only found out about the news now.A little information about this news:Pandukelana2712 has left the forum since January 01, 2020, 11:27:03 AM (that was the last day he was active on the account), but after that no news from him. Pandukelana2712 had an active loan with DarkStar_ of 0.064 BTC, but he failed to repay it due to his death. The reputation of his account was damaged due to the failure to repay the loan. But the surprising thing is, Pandukelana2712 managed to leave some money with a relative to pay off the loan to DarkStar_ (before he died) but he failed to find the right person before communicating with roycilik. You can skim the story in this thread where roycilik announces the death of pandukelana2712: [INFO]Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un (Pandukelana) ):Loans may be repaid by relatives where Pandukelana2712 has deposited the money. DarkStar_ might already know it. But if this information is wrong, then I hope roycilik and other friends can correct it. Please.Condolences continue to be sent to the trust page of pandukelana2712's account, a sign that most believe that pandukelana2712 has died.On this occasion I want to ask the admin and other friends.1. Is it possible to lock the pandukelana2712 account so that it can no longer be accessed by anyone if in the future hackers manage to find out its login data?Username: pandukelana2712Reason: Died",

But a death is always hurtful especially when you are from the same community. My condolence to the family and friends who lost their close one.There are in few occasions the admin locked a death person's account I guess only when it was confirmed. I think it can be done in this occasion too. Please PM theymos about it. He may not notice a general thread that has posted in the reputation board.",

I'll probably tag that too, and RIP for Pandukelana2712.",

I was one of first to see it but, couldn't say anything just yet, not until now. Hades has evolved many into the afterlife -- a transformation that no sane person would stoop to, if self decisions were mandatory. I can't even say much as I didn't know 'em in person... He died before I was registeredif I'm right. My eyes are still and sweaty; rest on dear friend 🥺Chymist,I don't know how to believe the story -- that he gave his relatives some cash to save his ass, but if SK said so, then it must be true. His post above quotes that he communicated with Roycilik; I'm not sure what it was 'bout but, the user knows the deceased personally..... they'd get the cash and sort out the loan.Sandra 😓",

However, since then his account is no longer active.And a few days ago the real truth was finally revealed.This is a misunderstanding. He was actually responsible at the end of his life, by entrusting money to his relative/colleague to pay debts in this forum (because at that time he was seriously ill and given the mandate). However, for several logical reasons, this fact can only be conveyed several days ago, when 1000 days after his death.Hopefully, with this, his good name will be clean again and there will be no more misunderstandings regarding the debt. And currently, the loan repayment seems to be in process.",
