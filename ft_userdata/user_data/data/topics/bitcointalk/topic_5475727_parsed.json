When you learn then you can start posting. I hope you understand which I said.This thread should be moved to Beginners & Help Board.",

The user is not so new, although he is still a newbie and has spent a month since he registered applying in the bounties section, probably without success and now he is looking for opportunities in the best section of the forum. It is almost better for him that he has not been caught in any bounty, because in many of them he would have worked for almost nothing. In this section he could do better but if he is patient.",

There must be a way you come across this forum in the first place and for you to claim you don’t know exactly what you are running after is ridiculous, so you mean you have been here for about a month running around aimlessly but you registered into a bounty campaign on your first day of registration and have participated in some bounty ever since. It is clear your intent was to participate in bounties from onset so you understood exactly what you were running after OP. If you are unsure about your purpose here then you need to sit yourself down and give it another thought and then maybe when you have come to a conclusion then you can come out to ask for help.",

Share your reason why you are here in the first place, people don't just get stranded on here without a reason, even if you mistakenly come across the forum you still have to create an account before you can create topic. The work part means someone told you that you can promote projects and make money, but it's not that straight up, you have to get to the level before you can start promoting projects, and sorry to say, some are not even worth your time, you are welcome to the forum though, relax and read the rules and regulation of this forum.",

Ask what you should do to the person who motivated you to register an account.You have made 42 posts in the bounties section since your account was registered on October 27 and your first post was PROOF OF REGISTRATION.Or it wouldn't be wrong if we asked you why you are here.By the way, if you feel that this topic is considered useless, under your computer or laptop screen there is a menu that says lock topic. Just press that instead of deleting it.",

This is where it all lies... Majority are being referred to this forum without proper information, explanation and guidance. Most a time, a bounty participant introduced them to the forum and are here with the believe that they are here to work. It's obvious you can not give what you don't have; most of these bounty participants don't know any other thing in this forum other than bounty participation. You know bounty is not always available and that might be the reason why the newbies feel stranded sometimes especially if they joined the forum when bounty are scarce.",

Can you help me in any way?This forum is like any other forum but mainly for cryptocurrency, you will not get any details or information about any other field like cars, medicine, weapons, etc. etc. they have different forums, and this forum Bitcointalk as the name suggested was made for BTC first as it was named as Bitcoin.org at first and then rebranded to BTT. Which I think was a good step, anyway, if you are new here then you might find it difficult to settle for some time.I will say, don't get confused, try to surf as much as you can explore new sections, and read the rules which are pinned by the moderators on top so they can't be ignored and after reading those rules try to read other's posts before making your but I can assume you already have the knowledge of how things generally go like if you need help make a topic in help section which you did here very well, so from this post of yours I can say you will learn things very quickly just spend some time here. And if you are trying to find work here then you should have some skill first if you haven't any then you can join bounties, signatures (which need proper requirements like ranks and merits, etc.), and review campaigns, etc.",

But you have to be real and should not promote or support fake or scam platforms or websites. On observing your posts I can say you are not new and you know this forum's rules very well.For a moment let's agree that you are new but you are learning so fast which raised concerns I am not trying to accuse you of someone pretending to be a newbie here, it's just you learned so many things in less time. I think if you go at this pace then you can find something to earn.If you have some special kind of skills that you think can be of some use to others on this forum then you can create your service topic in the service section, or you can rank to join the signature or Review campaigns. At the current moment you can take part in prize prediction contests, and other than this there are Avatar contests also organized. You can earn good money from them.",
