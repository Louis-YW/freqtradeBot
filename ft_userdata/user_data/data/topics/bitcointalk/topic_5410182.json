  "content": "Heres More proof for the #Bitcoin Maxiâ€™s that #TAGcoin is a way more advanced #cryptoâ€¦.ðŸ’¥ TAG from Tagprotocol is the only crypto on the planet connected to a major social media network. It is attached to Twitter using hashtags there virtually to mine crypto. #BTC uses environmentally unfriendly electricity and is landfill physician machines. ðŸ’¥BTC has no burning and is slow AF to send, meanwhile TAGcoin is instant and cost less to send.ðŸ’¥ BTC halving is every four years while TAG halves every year! ðŸ’¥ BTC has NO #NFT potential, meanwhile TAGcoin is becoming the most powerful NFT crypto on the planet! I could go on and on, but I will hold back on hurting BTC maxi feelings today! Eyes open crypto friends, the game has been already won! ðŸ”¥ðŸ™ŒðŸ¦¾Link: https://github.com/tagprotocol/White-PaperLink: https://tagprotocol.comLink: https://tagcoin.io Link: https://tagscan.info",

In order for the value of the coin to increase by 70%, it was enough to buy TAG coin for an amount equal to 0.00091 BTC, which is only $ 21 at today's exchange rate.",

However, the information you have published is not enough to accurately identify the coin. You need to specify direct links to the project, then there will be fewer questions for you.",
