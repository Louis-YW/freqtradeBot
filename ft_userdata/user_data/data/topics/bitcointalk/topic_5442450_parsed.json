By avoiding linking your bank to cryptocurrency you can prevent that for sure. But think about people from these countries where involvement with bitcoin/cryptocurrency can throw you into jail.",

And these government all over the world will keep using all their mights to fight cryptocurrency because it brings decentralization to the world of finance.",

The only way that government can generate income through cryptocurrency is tax levy and surely it will not be hundred percent because some people will evade it.",
