Without sacrifice nothing reasonable can be birthed. The market demands a sacrificeYes, the market demands sacrifice but not as much as you iterated it above. Naturally, you will sacrifice your time and money for trading, especially when you are in the learning process. But as you get more experienced in it, your money should be giving you more money and the time you need for trading would have reduced drastically. Except for those who are scalping or using the low timeframes, still, they would have mastered their trading strategies and know the time to trade and the time to do other things in life. Therefore, there is no big deal here.As for the friendship and relationship part, well, trading shouldn't disturb that at all. I can talk in this scope because I was so stressed and determined about trading even when I was learning it, and yet, it didn't affect my friendships and relationships.You see, trading is not as burdensome as you take it, just relax and train yourself, and before you know it, you are well-experienced in it. Good luck!",

They rarely go to some event. They are sacrificing that enjoyment time that they can spend in that marriage or any other event. But due to shop he is not going there but he has the option to close the shop and go there for some time.Everything is optional, the same like in trading, you don't really have to give up on friends, or any other relationships but you do have to give money and time to the market but still, you can spend quality time with friends or family. I am not a big trader but from what I have experienced is, we only have to give up on money and time, because we have to use money and our time to perform trading but we can still enjoy our life even can go on vacation.",

Without sacrifice nothing reasonable can be birthed. The market demands a sacrificeSpeaking of what one can sacrifice, I think time is one thing, and another is an unbeneficial friendship or relationship. For example, let's say I have friends who I normally spend most of my free time with, and despite the time I spend there, it doesn't produce any meaningful discussion. I also have some friends and family, and any time I spend with them, it's always worth it. Between the two categories, I think I know the one to ignore and use that time to focus on trading.Quote from: Faisal2202 on December 10, 2023, 03:53:04 PMThe market doesn't demand any type of sacrifice, it's just you have to spend time and you can't exist in two places at the same time, Lol, it doesn't need any form of sacrifice but actually requires your time, and if you are not willing to give in to that time, you definitely will also get occupied by other things, like the fact that you can't be in different places at the same time.Perhaps let's say you have three jobs, each requiring 6, 6, and 4 hours of work every day, respectively, and your resting time is just from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. If you have intentions for trading, you will either terminate one job or you have to ingage in your trading from that 10 p.m. to 12 a.m., depending on how much stress your strength can carry, because you need to rest so you can continue your normal job on the next day.In conclusion, some sacrifice would still be made.",

      "body": "I don't know what it means to give up on a successful trade. For our trading to be successful, we have to learn more about trading. We can read or watch videos about trading, which can provide more knowledge. Our relationship with friends may be a little distant because we are more serious about learning trading so we rarely hang out or communicate with them.And it's worth doing, especially if we want to become a trader who can make a profit. We can contact friends when we understand trading better. And we can also make money from that trading.We may use the time to learn trading better. Everything requires sacrifice, and perhaps sacrificing relationships with friends by not contacting them for a while is a sacrifice we make.",

      "body": "• Friends: Friends are important. The only friends that I would sacrifice are those who discourage me from trading. I will align myself or get new friends who are into trading newbies and experienced traders alike. They are key to a successful trading journey.• Relationships: Do you mean intimate relationships or what? If you mean intimate or romantic relationships that is meaningful, supportive, and non-toxic, I see no reason to let such a relationship go. I will always need to talk to my lover during a hard trading time to find and get all the emotional support I desire. However, if the relationship is the other way around, then I won't even think twice before exiting it. • Money: This is non-negotiable. You must spend money or sacrifice money in your quest for something worthwhile you are bound to spend money. Even if  you are learning on YouTube, you will need to pay money to have access to the internet as it is not free. You would also need to buy a laptop and other things to make learning easy. • Time: Time for me is the ultimate sacrifice. If you have other jobs, you may need to sacrifice some sleep time to learn. Some lunch time to learn. Some play time to learn. Some party time to learn. This is the ultimate sacrifice. And how much you learn and how is based on the time spent.",

Without sacrifice nothing reasonable can be birthed. The market demands a sacrificeEverything you mentioned is important in my opinion but the most important thing is time and money in trading, because you need money to trade and time to do it and also to improve your skills and also you need a lot of time to trade.And besides that, everyone needs friends, and friends who can entertain us and can also be our friends when we are bored, especially if our friends are on the same frequency. Can help and also exchange ideas about trading which can increase our knowledge apart from trading problems and whatever.And relationships are also important, especially if he really supports our trading because he will motivate us and also give us sincere love which makes us even more enthusiastic.Everything is important, but the most important thing is time. Because we have to be able to manage our time well and still prioritize time for trading and if we have good and correct friends and relationships, then everything will be fine.",

Without sacrifice nothing reasonable can be birthed. The market demands a sacrificeAs far as I know, a trader only takes risk of his money and time when trading. If a trade ends up at a loss, then that would be goodbye to your money and time. But losses are not enough reason to quit, because that will serve as your motivation to trade again and improve your what is there to improved. Increase your knowledge and skills if possible, and learn from the past experiences from other traders, that will definitely help you to win your trades in your next attempt.I have been trading for years, and I think there's no need to sacrifice family, friends or relationships. If it happens, most probably you are not doing the right thing in trading.",

Without sacrifice nothing reasonable can be birthed. The market demands a sacrificeTrading does not require any sacrifice as long as you give your best to learn trading and accept the risks that are associated with it. Of course, trading needs money and time to make it work, so you have to use them productively so they won't end up being wasted. While responsible traders always see to it that they have gained and learned their lessons from every failures and mistakes, irresponsible traders might be doing the opposite way, repeating the same mistakes again and keep losing in the end.Friends and relationships is another story. I don't think even if you resort into being a failure in trading, friends and relationships will be compromised, except if you have been highly successful in trading and forget everything you have with them.",
