  "content": "Mission Accomplished!Bitcoin is up $20K since our experiment began on November 4th! BTC $88K 11/11/24How do you like those apples?**Exploring BTC Market Dynamics: Observing Price-Setting Mechanisms in Theory**BTC Price Mechanism Analysis OverviewExchange Price Reset Mechanism: “A single Post Only Sell Limit Order (good til cancelled), matched by an opposing Post Only Buy Limit Order (good til cancelled), can establish a stock’s price at a new specified level when executed, aligning the market price to that level.”Theoretical Price Mechanism Analysis: A single Second Pair of orders- a Post Only Sell Order of 0.00000001 BTC (good til cancelled) at a price of $500,000/BTC ($0.005)..... matched in the Exchange's order book to another trader's identical/opposing Post Only Buy Order of 0.00000001 BTC (good til cancelled) at a price of $500,000/BTC ($0.005)...... may theoretically illustrate how a new price level could be established in the order book........ but only after an identical First Pair of Post Only Sell/Buy Orders (good til cancelled) is already recorded and open in the order book. Thus, the Second Pair of Post Only Orders increases order book liquidity at the $500K price level with repeated matching signalling active buy/sell interest, serving as a theoretical reference point for examining order book dynamics.2 Matched Pairs:   Exchange Protocol Rules require 2 Identical, sequentially Matched pairs of Post Only Limit Orders—one Buy Pair and one Sell Pair— with all unique traders- to move the price (without triggering an immediate self-match or violating exchange rules on self-trading):1. First Order Pair: A Post Only Sell Limit Order, matched by a Post Only Buy Limit Order at the same price and quantity, adds liquidity but does not immediately move the price.2. Second Order Pair: A subsequent Post Only Order—either Buy or Sell—matched by an opposing Post Only Order at the same price and quantity completes the sequence and sets the new asset price.If each trader places their Post Only Limit Orders correctly at the same price and quantity (two matched pairs), there's little chance the orders won't fill. The sequence is designed to trigger the new price by matching opposing buy and sell orders.Proposal for Collaboration:I’m looking to gather individuals interested in exploring theoretical price-setting mechanisms through a collaborative trading strategy using Post Only Limit Orders. This isn’t just about trading but understanding market dynamics and how strategic participation might impact BTC’s perceived value.All interested participants are welcome to join in observing theoretical price-setting mechanisms using Post Only Limit Orders through a transparent, educational research approach. I believe BTC’s value could potentially be viewed differently based on current fundamentals. Together, we can discuss and observe how strategic order placement might offer insights into BTC valuation mechanisms and deepen our understanding of market dynamics.If you’re intrigued by market microstructure, strategy, or just want to be part of something unique, drop a comment or DM. Let’s see what we can achieve together!Sources: Market Microstructure Theory\" by Maureen O’HaraLimit Order Markets by Thierry Foucault and Albert J. MenkveldAlbert J.

      "body": "if you really want to learn about exploring bitcoin value, you first need to understand the difference between value vs priceprice is the market rate.. value is a underlying hidden number of the lowest cost possible(cheapest) someone could possibly get off-market, which then sets the support bottom value which the market price then speculates above.the btc value is usually estimated by calculating the planets most effective and efficient mining cost. as this sets the bench mark of the lowest cost someone on the planet would consider selling for. the market rate then speculates above thisyou then get to learn things like store of value. where by if the btc price is low and near value point its a great store of value. as you get to lock in alot of your funds into the bottom supported benchmark. which as time goes on moves up meaning the risk of loss is negligible and the value point does not really go down(unless a massive mining cost change occurs to bring down the cost)for instance at the start of 2024(pre halving) the value was around $25k.. now its ~$50k and the price then tests amounts above the value points. the chances of value going back down to $25k where by market prices can speculate back down below $50k are negligible. which is why bitcoin is considered a good store of value..of course there is the flip side.. the premium.. which is based on and estimated on the most in-efficient mining cost on the planet, which is more then a few hundred thousand dollars. this premium resistance is where the ATH peaks reach critical spike. whereby if everyone can mine for less then the premium then the market runs out of buyer as everyone can get btc cheaper by mining it if everyone can mine for less. which is where we can calculate the window of opportunity per period of the min and max a market price can swing between per period..as for you to just want to play around with market orders.. thats just price speculation games, and wont teach you anything about bitcoins value...if you want to look at the market price history chart fo this last year, you will observe the market last tested the sub $50k in february(pre-halving).. it then tried to test the new bottom in july, august, sept, but only managed to get the price down to ~$54k.. (post-halving value)since september the market has been perceiving $60k as the bottom, however this is market speculation of testing, and $50k is still at a extreme push a possibility this year, but becoming less approachable due to how mining costs have progressed in last few months where miners are re-evaluating their most efficient bottomline costs they consider worth selling forin short dont expect to ever see a market price sub $50k unless something drastic happened to bitcoin(code break or mining cost drop), and as time goes on then $60k becomes a number not expected to be seen again on the market. and so on",

It will take time even if it eventually hits that level and this must be many decades from now.It is because it is the first and introduced crypto to the world. BTC has lots of achievements already but it can't do it alone without our help. Like any other else, it is still not perfect but it also has lots of downfalls which causes a lot of people to get disappointed sometimes. We can't tell if the acceptance will remain because the government's mind can sometimes change. There must still be governments that will now accept it because they saw a potential on it.Despite the dips, we can still say that BTC is progressive because it can record an ATH after some time. This is what you say that patience is still needed if we badly want to experience or celebrate those milestones together with BTC. It must only be the people's emotions is what leads them to call outrageous prices and they are too serious about it to stick with it. Only time passes by until they are close to their targets but some are achieved already luckily. Don't worry about the coin. They don't have an emotion like us, so they won't ridiculed or discouraged.It is crazy that those who predict $1M for BTC within a short period of time are also famous and professional individuals. They didn't know that a lot of us won't still believe on it. I think they are only doing this to try and pump the price, for them to earn easily.",
