But lacks data to do so as a result of the conversations being made on personal apps, which do not record conversations. This somewhat mirrors much of the gamestop case. Where it was claimed employees were not monitored closely enough.In this case however the allegations are against supervisors and senior executives. Possibly even CEOs, CTOs, etc. This case targets the top of the food chain. The SEC is being extremely active in 2022. They've constantly been in the news over the last few months. A stark contrast to them being mentioned only once every year the winklevoss twins petitioned for a crypto based ETF.",
