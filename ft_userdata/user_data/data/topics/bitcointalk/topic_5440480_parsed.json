Would be nice to wait for a decent correction but yea it can pump far higher from current price because of CEX FUD, crosschain swaps and growing popularity.The few things that bother me is that:1- only 20% of supply is in circulation2- only ~15 mln $ daily volume compared to 230 mln$ on pancakeswap. If we do a volume/marketcap calulation CAKE looks more than twice better.",

A Dex a part of some game? How does the dex have a fiat ramp planned in the roadmap?What makes me even more intrigued is that Binance believes in these by listing them and they do research for fundamentals, or at least they should do some",

Its hard to do any TA based on chart that is less than 4 months long.

A Dex a part of some game? So maybe you should start with a research and then post your thoughts/concerns instead of sayint \"what the hell even is this?\".Quote from: o48o on February 22, 2023, 06:54:31 PMBinance believes in these by listingHFT was a most recent binance lauchpool.",
