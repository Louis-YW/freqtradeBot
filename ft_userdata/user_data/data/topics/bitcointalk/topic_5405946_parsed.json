On the dropdown list select Bitcoin and click on \"Continue\". Ledger Live will then scan all existing Bitcoin accounts that are or aren't part of your portfolio. Give it a minute to finish or stop the scanning process by clicking on the \"Stop\" button. To add a Taproot account, you need to switch on the \"show all address types\" under \"Add new account\". Give your Taproot account a name and click on the \"Add account\" button at the bottom.If done successfully, a confirmation screen will inform you that your new account has been added to your portfolio. You can see it at the bottom of your \"Accounts\" tab because it's addresses are still unfunded. To generate a Taproot address, you now need to click on the \"Receive\" tab on the left, select your new Taproot account on the list, and click \"Continue\".A new address will be generated for you. Compare and confirm that the address on Ledger Live matches the one on your hardware wallet and approve it by clicking on both buttons on the device.You have now successfully created a Taproot address in Ledger Live.Ledger Live (Android)Credit to Husna QA with that postSoftware and Hardware wallet that Husna QA used in this test:- Ledger Live Android v3.3.2- Ledger Nano XLogging in to Ledger Live; On the \"Wallet\" icon, select \"Add asset\" or the \"+\" sign in the upper right corner.In the \"Add Asset\" option, I select \"With your Ledger\".In the \"Crypto asset\" option, select \"Bitcoin (BTC)\".In the \"Device\" option, select the hardware wallet that is connected to Ledger Live.If the hardware wallet name doesn't appear, tap \"Pair with Bluetooth\" (Nano X) or connect it via a USB cable (Nano S, Nano S Plus, Nano X).\"Open the Bitcoin app on your device\".Ledger Live will scan all Bitcoin accounts.Select \"More address types\" to display other Bitcoin accounts.Select \"Bitcoin (Taproot)\" and tap \"Continue\".Here is the newly created Bitcoin (Taproot) account:To generate a Taproot address, tap Bitcoin Account (Taproot), Select \"Receive\".Make sure the hardware wallet is still connected to Ledger Live for the process of creating a Taproot address.Verify address on Device.Select \"Copy address\" or \"Share address\" to copy or share the Taproot address.OneKeyCredit to SFR10  with that postOneKey recently added support for Taproot, so here are the steps for creating Taproot addresses in their Android app [it seems to be \"open-source\"]:When you first open the app, it creates an Ethereum account by default, so you have to change it from the top of the page and select Bitcoin.Then click the \"create account\" button:Choose TaprootClick \"receive\" buttonReferenceTaproot - The biggest upgrade for Bitcoin since 2017 & documents to read.[LIST] Wallets supporting TaprootBitcoin Taproot (Bech32m - bc1p) adoptionWhat is Taproot?

The minor version, which we had been using as the major version, is now the major version. The revision, which we had been using as the minor version, is now the minor version. The revision number is dropped. The build number is promoted to being part of the version number. This also avoids issues where it was accidentally not included in the version number.The CLIENT_VERSION remains the same format as previous as previously, as the Major version was 0 so it never actually got included in it.The user agent string formatter is updated to follow this new versioning.Taproot address on Trezor Suite:v21.12.2 and above.- In \"Accounts\", click the \"+\" sign on \"My accounts\" to create a \"New account\".- In the \"Select coin\" option, select Bitcoin and at the \"Account type\", select \"Taproot BIP86, P2TR, Bech32m\", then click \"+ Add account\".- In \"Taproot accounts\", click the \"Receive\".- The following is an example of the generated Taproot address.",

The catch here is what each one of us understand by \"wallet\". Some sees \"wallets\" as addresses, some see it as a software that can manage several aspects related to addresses and transactions and etc.So, in this sense, what I mean is that a wallet to be considered to support P2TR addresses, it should, not only generate Taproot addresses, but also transact between 2 P2TR addresses and between at least one P2TR address and one other address of other type! That's what I consider a wallet with P2TR address support!",

However, to send back to the taproot address in another wallet depends on the sending client. As in the second example, Electrum v4.1.0 can send from Bech32 to P2TR, while v4.0.9 can only accept and cannot send to the P2TR address.I agree with the following nc50lc statement:Quote from: nc50lc on July 13, 2022, 09:08:43 AMTaproot to other address types shouldn't have any issue since a wallet that can generate a taproot address should be able to spend from it.",

When you generate a new address on the desktop version of Ledger Live, you can actually do that even without connecting your Nano and verifying that the address is correct on the screen of your hardware wallet. This is obviously not a recommended thing to do and Ledger warns you about it if you try it. But, like I said, you can do it if you want. Have you tried to generate a new address on the Android version without connecting and unlocking your HW, and does the software allow it?It must be connected to a hardware wallet to create a Taproot Bitcoin account or any other type of Bitcoin account. A \"Connection Failed\" notification will appear if no device is connected to Ledger Live, and I cannot continue to create an account.   Another option to add an account is to select \"Import from desktop\" (if the desktop version already has a Bitcoin account).Likewise, when I tried to generate the Taproot address from the Taproot Bitcoin account in the test above and tap \"Receive\" at the \"Connect device\" stage, Ledger Live automatically scans the connected hardware wallet. If it's not there, a \"Connection Failed\" notification appears. But, there is an option \"Continue without my device\".   As you said, the \"Taproot address\" can still be created.However, I recommend checking both in the application and hardware wallet. Not only when sending but when receiving as well.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on July 19, 2022, 01:05:10 AMIs there any risk to do this on Android or is it only your personal favorite?I prefer to transact via desktop PC.As far as I know, Ledger Live android or the desktop version is still safe because every transaction requires confirmation from the hardware wallet.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on July 19, 2022, 01:05:10 AMWhat are differences between connecting and not connect Nano and unlocking the hardware wallet?By verifying in the Hardware wallet, you can be sure that the generated address belongs to you.",

Husna QA already answered this. But let's say the Ledger Live servers were hacked and are displaying the hacker's receiving address in the software. If you don't have your Nano connected and you don't verify that the two addresses match (the one on your Nano's screen and the one on Ledger Live), you could be tricked into funding someone else's address. But if you connect your hardware wallet, you should clearly see that your device is displaying a different address than what is on the software. I have never heard about a case like that, but in theory it could be possible. @Husna QAAlright, so the address generation is the same on the mobile version as with the desktop version. They both allow the user to create a new receiving address without verifying it, but the software informs you about the dangers of doing that. Good, thanks!",
