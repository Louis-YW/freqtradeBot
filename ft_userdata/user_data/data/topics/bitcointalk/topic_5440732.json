  "content": "hi all, noob here.in the hurry of a mint i was dumb enough to send two inscriptions to one bitcoin core wallet. from what i found out i need a seedphrase to split up the inscriptions.problem is: bitcoin core doesn't have one, just the wallet.dat file. and sending anything to another wallet could result in the ordinals being used as gas for the tx.is there any reliable solution to import the wallet to either sparrow or electrum, and get a seedphrase that way? from what i read it seems like sweeping the electrum seed also just means sending the satoshis, with the danger of spending the inscriptions.thanks in advance",

And while afaik the new Bitcoin Core wallets are also HD, they are not based on a seed in the way you see it for Electrum or Sparrow (BIP39 and so on).Is having the seed that important? The private key(s) aren't enough for your needs?If you want to obtain the HD seed of your Bitcoin core wallet (but it will be BIP32, not BIP39), you may want to read this on Reddit and maybe try your luck with this tool (but I have no idea if it works and I would not use it with a wallet that may have anything valuable in it).So, as I said, maybe you just get the private keys of the relevant addresses, it should be easier.",
