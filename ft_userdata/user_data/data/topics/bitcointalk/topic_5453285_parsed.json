And it does not need blockchain and NFT. It just works starting from 1970:\"The U.S. Copyright Act of 1970 was enacted to protect creative works from unauthorized use or copyright infringement.\"https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-to-avoid-copyright-infringementand everyone is obligated to respect it. in the event of their violation, the case goes to the court, which will plead guilty. And it doesn't matter whether the proof is the date the image was added to the Internet or the date of creation of the NFT. And so the court, the police, and other physical services are needed to determine and enforce the punishment. I don't think the world needs this product. At least for now.",

      "body": "Hello Mr. Tytanowy Janusz,Thank you for sharing your thoughts and insights on the copyright aspect. Taking copyright infringement cases for 1-minute videos(for example) to court can often be impractical and not cost-effective. Legal proceedings can be time-consuming, expensive, and require substantial evidence and documentation. Considering the sheer volume of content shared on the internet and the frequency of copyright violations, pursuing individual cases for short videos may overwhelm the legal system and burden both the copyright holders and the courts. Additionally, the potential damages awarded may not justify the resources invested in pursuing such cases. As a result, alternative approaches, such as implementing technology blockchain solutions, developing robust content identification systems, and promoting education on copyright laws, can be more efficient in addressing copyright infringement issues in the digital era.While traditional copyright laws are very important for copyright protection processes, and personally having registered patents and value what IP is all about, blockchain technology offers unique functionalities that go beyond what traditional methods can achieve. Allow me to shed some light on these aspects:1. Renting, Selling, and Buying Content: Blockchain enables secure and transparent transactions of digital content. Content creators can rent, sell, or buy their creations directly, eliminating the need for intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation.2. User Rewards from Ad Revenue: Blockchain-based platforms like YouOwn distribute ad revenue directly to content creators, ensuring they receive their fair share. Smart contracts automate this process, guaranteeing transparent and instant rewards based on viewership and engagement.3. Content Creator Loans: Through decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanisms, YouOwn allows content creators to access loans using their content as collateral. This empowers them to invest in their creativity, equipment, or marketing, fostering their professional growth.4. Tackling Unlawful Issues: YouOwn addresses the challenges of unlawful content by leveraging blockchain's immutable nature. Verified content ownership and transparent metadata can help combat piracy, plagiarism, and unauthorized distribution. Users vote on such matters taking into consideration superusers chosen by random that gets higher voting power, also voted upon by users to check their fairness, that take overall consideration on copyrights infringements and such.5. Overcoming Copyright and monetization Limitations: Short-form videos and trends often face copyright limitations on traditional platforms because of the arising of copying another person’s idea, or trend without compensating them for their idea. YouOwn provides a framework for creators to navigate these limitations more effectively, empowering them to monetize their unique creations without lawless infringement concerns unless voted upon otherwise, and short format content gets to monetize their content in a more equitable and sustainable matter.6. Enhanced Advertisement Revenue: Traditional platforms often retain a significant portion of ad revenue, leaving creators with meager earnings as of 45% of the total in some cases and lower on other platforms. YouOwn's decentralized model ensures a fairer distribution, benefiting creators and incentivizing quality content.7. Community-driven Decision Making: YouOwn embraces a democratic governance model, empowering users to participate in decision-making processes. This fosters a sense of ownership and ensures that platform rules and policies align with the community's values and needs.8. Retaining Rights and Data Control: By leveraging blockchain infrastructure, YouOwn aims to grant users greater control over their rights and data. Transparency in terms of data collection, manipulation, and usage is crucial to protect user privacy and build trust. Users get to choose if they want targeted advertisements, which would give them more rewards, and get to choose their domain of interests and change already set ones.We believe that blockchain technology, coupled with YouOwn and The Witness Projects, offers innovative solutions to the challenges faced by content creators and users alike. By addressing issues such as fair compensation, copyright limitations, user involvement, and data control, we strive to create a more equitable and empowering digital landscape.I value your insights and welcome further discussions on the transformative potential of blockchain technology and the feasibility of it in revolutionizing content sharing platforms in this project. Insightful discussions and constructive criticism are a must for fruitful changes and new ideas/Features!Best regards,Ali Awdeh",

      "body": "Ok, but the fact that the owner of 1 min video created it together with prove of ownership writen on blockchain does not guarantee that someone else wont steal/use/monetize it. The only thing that guarantees the preservation of copyright is centralized entities and the law in force in the physical world, which currently probably does not have prepared procedures for dealing with NFT. So it doesn't matter if I have the NFT of my video or not, I still have to go to court if someone breaks the law. I can only use nft there as proof, but the same proof will be the date the video was uploaded on youtube.I don't think the world is ready for this solution and the idea itself will have wide application. Renting your video sounds interesting, but I don't think there will be much interest in such a product.",
