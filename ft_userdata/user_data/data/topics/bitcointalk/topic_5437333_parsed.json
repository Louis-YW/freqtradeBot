Whether that opinion is right or wrong. Therefore, one should not always believe everything one reads or hears. Forming your own opinion is important. It is true that fear and emotions are played with in order to push the price down or drive it up, but unfortunately this game is part of trading and this happens in all areas.  Quote from: goldkingcoiner on January 30, 2023, 12:51:15 PM-snip- Do you consider this FUD-spreading unethical or do \"shaky hands\" get what they deserve?I don't think it's right what's being done, but it's hard to say whether it's unethical. Either way, everyone has their own view and opinion on it and sees it from a different point of view.",

I think any kind of solicitation is unethical, especially the way most people do it (cherry pick information and showing what is positive, sometimes even unfounded). I love when there's spreading of awareness and information, absolutely don't like when speculative hype is being bandied around. Doesn't matter if FOMO or FUD, it's all generally quite irresponsible leading to people parting with money they can't afford to lose.I know it's all opinion but when you're spreading it, even paying for it to be heard/seen...",

Unfortunately, the fact that social networks and mainstream media are something that shapes public opinion and that they are structured in such a way that it is very easy to abuse them for any purpose, what is unethical has become quite normal.However, I would like to emphasize that not all FUD is intentional, because if we just look at this forum, we can see that some, under the influence of the media, are spreading information that is not supported by any facts and has no logic. In other words, those who try to manipulate the market are to blame, as well as those who spread such information thinking that they are helping others.",

That is actually a big issue on the internet nowadays. We don't know in what to believe anymore, because there are many fakes or unlikely to be real stories being heavily disseminated.",

Creating FUD is part of the market movement. Earlier only through FUD the market have been manipulated by the whales. By the time the market is small and now things have changed and so will be the difficulty in manipulation. Nowadays for FUD the market won't respond for a long term as people are well aware to analyse the reality of the incidents connected to manipulate the market.
