  "content": "Reflection on pizza day, what would it be like to build a city from scratch, accepting Bitcoin?For the past 6 years I have been studying bitcoin and how it could improve our lives.I've already thought about several business strategies involving bitcoin here in Brazil and I came to the conclusion that none of them will work if we are not the example.I live in an area of 60 hectares that in the past was completely taken over by family farming where we had 12 families helping each other. Over time, some were leaving and going to look for something better in urban areas because of the suffering lifestyle of the countryside, natural for human beings, to evolve!My parents own this area that we now operate with local tourism, the business is well and functional, but it is not something I want to see in the next 30 years of my life.Why I brought up this topic: the idea is to get out of the btc bubble concept and start building adoption naturally.It will not be in highly urbanized areas that will bring adoption, because in those places, most are comfortable, they don't need to plant, drinking water, energy, basic sanitation, etc, arrive at the doors of their homes, that is, they will be the weak, (rural areas) unexplored places that will create true adoption, because “if the poor are getting richer, then the ego of the rich will start to start true adoption” !When money was invented, it was not the kingdom that created it, it was people, the kingdom saw that it was an opportunity to share wealth, to \"help\" society, but society did not need help, everything was flowing naturally, or either we saw the opportunity of a big guy, wanting to dominate over the small one. Today we can create our own colony and start using bitcoin, reducing this risk.I would like to hear your opinions, I even know some people who have a lot of money, but I realized that if I accept their investment, the concepts of natural colonization will not be applied in the place, but another super profitable business where they will want selling more expensive to other people and the place will not be populated naturally and the consequence of this is that we will not have bitcoin adoption.*Remember: the “OBVIOUS” is not clear! Something only becomes “OBVIOUS”, when the demand for people speaking increases stating that it is “OBVIOUS”, and if not many people are speaking, then it is not “OBVIOUS” yet!* Bitcoin had everything to go wrong! But from what I've studied, IT'S VERY RIGHT!If you are a visionary person of great knowledge, please give your opinion on how we can start building a city that can bring the “CLARITY OF THE OBVIOUS” to create true bitcoin adoption, please start bringing your ideas for us to evaluate together how can we build a super colonization of people living and trading bitcoin in a rural area, the beginning of digital colonization can start to be written now!",

      "body": "results of recent events is that the FEE to use bitcoin is more then the cost of a pizza. so no one can buy pizza with bitcoin. so bitcoin is not longer a good association with \"pizza\" due to not being able to buy one without spending more then the cost of a pizza just to pay for one.. (\"buy one, pay twice\")this has caused many 3rd world countries to not want bitcoin because fees are more then their wage for 1-10 hours of labour. where as other payment methods are far cheaper fees. the solution is not to invent a new network to tell people to move over to. because thats not solving bitcoins utility cost, thats not adopting bitcoin. thats abandoning bitcoin.. . the solution is not to promote bitcoin right now to those that cant afford it because it will just pee them off that they have been talked into using a currency with higher fees than their wage. thus they will hate bitcoin and never want to use it in the future if their first experience is badright now the solution is to get fee's back down to reasonable levels on the bitcoin network. to then make it worthy of adopting in 3rd world countriesbuilding a city is a gimmick. especially if the fees are more then a days labour of a farmer. it will not help the farmer sell his produce, people would just get their produce from other villagesfirst what is needed is to make bitcoin affordable as a currency then and only then use that to build out a real world community and utility of produce. goods and services payments with bitcoin in an area",

The market is easy to manipulate. Too many scams in the market. Solving all the above problems is a long-term problem for the marketThank you for your cooperation!As for the fees, I believe it won't be a problem, today we are seeing a test done with the \"lightning network\".I see this type of maneuver as a traditional bank and I think it's great.On the one hand, we have a centralized network, but with low fees, it is as if we were carrying a prepaid credit card.You don't need to carry your hard wallet everywhere to buy bread and milk...As for regulations, I don't see a problem with bitcoin, anyone who wants to attack btc will spend a lot of money, the more transactions the more the fees go up, this feeds the value of bitcoin!I would like to remind you about my thesis:\"Bitcoin adoption won't happen in urban areas, it will happen in rural areas!\"*this adoption they are creating within urban businesses, they are called \"bubbles\", because they are creating startups to resell to banks and devalue shareholders' money in IPOs!**in urban areas, people are less encouraged because they are in their comfort zone and are afraid of change, that's why they tend to be fish trapped in big fishermen's nets!***just a note: I see this city, with at least 70% of internal resources, so two things can happen:1: People with a lot of btc will want to live in the place to be able to use bitcoins in a quiet life, without a state devaluing their capital.2: The state will ask to provide resources such as basic sanitation and energy (electricity and oil), in this case we will be able to ask for a reserve in XYZ bitcoin as guarantees in a contract, if they do not honor the projects and deadlines, they lose the reserves (agreement is democracy).Thanks again for your collaboration, your opinion is a concern of many people in this new world!",

I believe that as an example would be a solar, wind or nuclear energy farm, correct?",

And the last suggestion is that you have to be someone who can mingle with all walks of life, so that when you start forming a bitcoin city or bitcoin colonial, it will be easier.That's why I put together this post, I want to meet people who can contribute and build an orderly and mature planning together with me!*Perhaps, a first model for testing and spreading around the world.About the internet, today we have optical fiber, 5g and via satellite with star link, so we have several options, without thinking about the apocalypse.Internet connection is important, but I believe that soon we will be making our transactions in a semi-offline format... as I mentioned in the previous post, the Lightning Network can be a new model for managers (banks), today it is like a prepaid credit card, recharge and use.Soon new competitors will appear that will offer a service where (if) you leave a part of your real bitcoin as a reserve, you will earn interest and still have credit to use in Lightning as they always did in traditional banks, with the difference that there is no legislator to execute or not, to take or not to take your reservation, only in a smart contract.* People will question me: We still need the internet!I would say no. Soon we will have a certificate inside physical devices such as a cell phone, ring, nfc, etc., which will store the signature of your offline certificate, which today is already replaced by the current credit card, that is, we already have a device to authenticate offline transactions.Probably cities will have their own banking networks like Lightning in \"intranet network\" mode, which in the future will also be decentralized and they will be able to work offline. For example, if a wallet has not undergone any movement, then it is because the reservation is still there, why not LN (Lightning Network) give the credit to your client and let it run in offline mode as long as you authenticate with your certificate?At the end of the day, it's up to LN to synchronize and update the tables, so that the banks return to their original role at the beginning of time.About the habits of society, in my view people will adapt normally as long as it becomes a habit (using bitcoin).To become a habit means that it will be people who don't know any urban vices...I think I have a plan for that, hehehe, I commented in the first post that there were 12 families living here, none of these people knew how to read and write, they learned here, and when I introduced the microwave oven to them, they made the maximum effort to learn how to use it (hehehe) that's why I commented on the first post, \"WE WILL NOT EXIST AS LONG AS IT COMES FROM THE URBAN PEOPLE AND YES FROM THE RURAL PEOPLE\" so I reinforce.. ..the city is for great visionaries who really want to take care of people, show the right path for evolution and expand knowledge, just like \"the great master Satoshi did it!\", remembering that this has nothing to do with political systems, but with rules to be followed.They will have freedom and wealth, (freedom is not land without law.)Once again, thank you very much for your cooperation.It is important for people to hear problems that may occur on the road to building bitcoin city.",

That's why they don't like bitcoin because it gives people a way to leave the system and they don't want them to. More people in the system means more sheep working for the elites. I understand about the fear of huge corporations fearing bitcoin...because the traditional market has 500 trillion dollars, so if only 5% of that value enters bitcoin, many people will become millionaires...I know that soon, in less than 8 years we will have these new multi-millionaires here and I want to be ready for that.I've dealt with a variety of audiences my entire life.In my tourist trade I found several profiles of people, from the poor to the millionaire, I am friends with some professional soccer players, businessmen, etc... I guarantee you, they are all \"loose\".I already made the proposal to everyone, but they don't think like colonies and much less in the common well-being within society, they only think of themselves, (and to think that they became millionaires consuming the poor's money).But returning to the case of governments \"intervening\", I find it very difficult for governments not to want to participate together.I cannot see a village forming without the participation of the state, even if it is small, the state will have to participate.But remember one thing, always! the money will no longer be in the hands of governments.We will pay every cent of the tax as long as it is 100% returned, or we take the reservation.*I'm going to tell you a fact that happened around here: B*nance had to open a company with the Brazilian government.*A curious fact is that the BR stock exchange has a maximum of 4 million participants. That same year, 44 million Brazilians invested in crypto assets, that is, there was a flight of capital from fiat money to bitcoin...Brazil has 220 million inhabitants, only 5% are mega entrepreneurs, 15% are people who earn less than 800usd per month where they leave 65% in taxes, the rest are poor, they work to put bread at home every day.What I mean is that it was not the brokerage that forced itself to have a tax address in Brazil.... Brazil had to buy the brokerage because 44 million people left with the country's reserves for a brokerage!And it will be like this with any city where the poor adopt bitcoin.I was once poor, I don't want to be poor again and I don't wish that life on anyone... I want people to evolve!",

For now, what is available is your determination(vision) and land (location). But I am afraid that this type of project will succeed if it has the support of the government. You cannot build a bitcoin city without the approval and support of the government because they can frustrate it. I also think that you only take bitcoin awareness to people but you cannot force them to use bitcoin. The rural area is not an ideal place for Bitcoin to strive because they are mostly occupied by the less privileged that might not be able to use bitcoin. This project might be workable if you have an immigration plan to attract people from other countries that will occupy the city because I doubt the ability of the current rural dwellers to sustain the project. This is why you also need the government. QuoteI would like to hear your opinions, I even know some people who have a lot of money, but I realized that if I accept their investment, the concepts of natural colonization will not be applied in the place, but another super profitable business where they will want selling more expensive to other people and the place will not be populated naturally and the consequence of this is that we will not have bitcoin adoption.If you know people who have money to invest in the proposed area, I will advise that you allow them to invest. But you need to have an agreement with them to accept Bitcoin for payment. Accepting bitcoin will be a major clause in the agreement. Their investment will attract more people to your area and the income of the people will also increase because jobs will be created. This will naturally attract bitcoiners to the area and adoption will grow. Sincerely, I will like to live in a rural area where people will be free to buy and sell with any currency they like.

Your desire to start bitcoin adoption from your area seems like a very prudent decision. This is where we need to start, from the streets, districts, quarters, so that it eventually grows into a bitcoin-city.You are completely right!I've been thinking about this very carefully... in the organized world, the bank makes the \"loan\" to companies... I've been thinking about bitcoin investors, investing in poor people with a lot of willpower to get out of that life, but I remember that I don't think it's prudent to start without an organization... I need an infrastructure engineer to modulate the regional and separate territorial lots to organize at least basic sanitation, I don't want to have problems with diseases or with the state hehehe.I imagined playing the role of a bank and lending her money so that she could build or produce something that her neighbor could consume and bitcoin could circulate in the region...I've seen some land subdivisions in China and Japan, they seem very organized, easy to modulate and expand, if you have an engineer willing to leave your comfort zone, please contact me!",

I think they are still active. Last week President said Liberland's financial future is Bitcoin. There's still a long way to go but we see some progress.https://cdn.liberland.org/files/raw/006cd7c4e86f7294a67cc6b4b068aedd59c61354/16847600355040.6134071991268428-screenshot-2023-05-22-145355.png?width=500&height=500Quote from: https://liberland.org/en/news/442-liberlands-newspaper-bitcoin-miami-editionLiberland continues to pave new paths, from embracing Bitcoin to building a decentralized autonomous government (DAG), all the while championing a vibrant seasteading project and welcoming global citizens to its promising shores. The country's recent activities, revealed in its festival newspaper for Bitcoin Miami, are a testament to its pioneering spirit in the realm of digital governance and personal freedom.Liberland has firmly cemented its commitment to Bitcoin, utilizing it for governmental operations, the basis of its economy, and holding state reserves. To further advance its Bitcoin adoption, a dedicated digital wallet is being developed, ensuring secure management of national reserves and providing a revolutionary tool for a seamless transfer of power.Beyond its economic strides, Liberland has also announced its groundbreaking plans for a DAG, a governance system combining voluntary taxation and blockchain transparency, and promising unprecedented citizen empowerment. The government also plans to partner with Aisland to establish the world's first seastead in international waters, marking another exciting milestone in the nation's journey towards building self-sufficient, autonomous communities.Brazil has no problems with geopolitics and our legislation allows BITCOIN, it is a country in expansion.... The international airport is less than 30 minutes from my farm.I took a look at google maps, it seems to me that nothing has been developed there yet and there is no neighbor to buy the excess production, it must be at the beginning, it seems to me that they started in 2015.https://goo.gl/maps/Vcc6VJeSUkcY45o56",

If you're really have the vision to build a city like that where everyone loves to adopt Bitcoin as their main currency, then you'll have to make sure that the city meets every technical requirement's which are needed for the proper functioning of Bitcoin. One of those basic requirements is that the city should have proper infrastructure to allow everyone to access internet for free because without internet such city can't fulfil the purpose. Another important requirement of such city is to provide smartphone or computers to every individual living in the city because if they don't have such device then even with a internet connection they won't be be able to access the Bitcoin network, and there won't be any transactions in the case. If those requirements are met, the final step is to promote such city with the help of marketing. The ones who find such facilities in a city will at least love to visit the place.You can also offer some extra perks to the citizens of the city so that they would love to stay in the place and would like to have their families in such place. I must say that creating such city is truly is high effort work and it requires a lot of investment to start such cities.",

After El Salvador became first country which accepted Bitcoin as a legal tender, their president also announced, a while ago, that he wishes to build a Bitcoin City.As fillippone explained here,QuoteEl Salvador, the only country in which bitcoin is a legal tender, announced a debt issuance to raise capital in order to \"accelerate hyperbitcoinization and bring about a new financial system on top of Bitcoin,\" according to a blog post by Blockstream. Half of the Proceeds of the bonds will be used to build a new city, nicknamed “Bitcoin City”, in the Gulf of Fonseca, in the immediate vicinity of an active volcano, whose geothermal energy will be used not only to power the city itself but also to mine bitcoins. The city would have no income, property, capital gain or labour taxes but would be financed only by a 10% sales tax.Of course, the news also appeared in press. According to a CoinTelegraph article, President of El Salvador stated thatQuote“In #BitcoinCity we will have digital and technological education. Geothermal energy for the entire city and efficient and sustainable public transport.”Other than that, we'll see soon first Bitcoin Tower in Dubai. Indeed, it's not an entire city, but it's a start. According to BitcoinNews.com,Quote [...] the hotel chain designed in the likeness of bitcoin is anticipated to go beyond incorporating state-of-the-art technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence. It is also set to prioritize material sustainability and achieve zero CO2 emissions. [...]The forthcoming Bitcoin Tower is set to become a 40-story skyscraper, serving as a testament to Dubai’s homage to bitcoin and embodying the principles of its enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.",
