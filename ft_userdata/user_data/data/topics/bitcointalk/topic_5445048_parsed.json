There have been times when ETH gas fees were terribly high and that's no doubt why such posts like this were no longer surprising to me. But currently, the gas fee for ETH transactions isn't that high.If you've got the option to do the transaction on another chain where that altcoin you're sending is also supported and possible, just go there and do the alternate network for you to save fees but yeah, no one on his mind will transfer such amounts with that kind of fee unless he's sending millions and has got no choice or did it on a mistake.",

The question is did you wanna try to do some swaps or something like that? The gas price is not as high as what you have posted based on my mycrypto wallet. Did i get this wrong or what? You shall at least explain what you were trying to do. If it was involving swap transactions and it's possible to happen caused by swap needs to did some transactions in a row. so, what is that for?",

The solution for you is using an alternative. Sad but true. If you don’t want to pay them high fees, move to the competitor of ethereum. You can also wait for the things to calm down. The financial markets are boiling right now and people want to cash out their assets left and tight. In these situations the fees always go up. If you are not in a hurry wait a few weeks and then enjoy them low fees again.",

You only got a big transaction fees based on the reasons Ive told yah. Usually its due to congestion and it necessary to increase the fee to make it transfer faster.

That's 3 years from now. You're kind of late .To answer your question regarding how that's even possible, it was the demand for transaction at that time. Many wanted to enter the DeFi hype at that time thus, many people are willing to pay higher fees just to be in the project, and that's the reason why it went to as high as the screenshot you shared.Currently, the fees of Ethereum isn't as high as you posted OP so I'm wondering did you look at the date where the fees of Ethereum are that high?",

However since Exodus is a non custodial wallet, you can try to import the seed or private key to Metamask wallet, just try to send the transaction in ETH network, let's see if it's still high or not. Metamask doesn't charge a lot fee AFAIK.",

There's a lot more nonsense going on in DEFI so don't be too surprised.The cost is ridiculous and we have to accept that for a certain time. You can choose the right time to execute your trade. I used to remember my transaction delay for 1 month to get the best transaction cost. If you want to be fast you have to trade off high (or low) transaction fees at that time.
