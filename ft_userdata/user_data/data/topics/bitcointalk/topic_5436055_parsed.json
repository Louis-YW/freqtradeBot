Or is it someone who somehow infected thousands of computers and mining without them knowing?This is a total mystery for me.Â  There is not an official ASIC miner as of yet for Verus Coin if you read anywhere in the internet,in websites that deal with mining,in websites that sell asics,I searched a lot and found not a single one up until now.For FPGA I have absolutely no clue but anyway 100k computers is big enough,there may be some crazy persons who have rented AWS,GCP,Digital Ocean and other cloud providers.That crazy person may have as well infected some cloud providers,not long ago Cybersecurity Hub,a page on Linkedin showed a severe flaw that let users execute commands remotely into Azure cloud such systems,today another huge,severe flaw rated 9.8 in CentOS (Linux) Control Web Panel let a user execute commands remotely into the system,unless all companies have upgraded their systems as per the mitre and osint websites it is probable that some people are taking advantage from such vulnerabilities found,I also find it very difficult to think that a single user to have 100k computers.",
