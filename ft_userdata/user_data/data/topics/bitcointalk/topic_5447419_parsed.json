But the problem is that if you only play with faucet money they will block your account and tag you as faucet abuser, and they even have some rains in the chat but for that you need to be lvl 2. But again, if you only play with the rains they will block your account for abuse. So, is a double-edged sword.If you want to use a faucet that you can get prizes each hour I would recommend: https://freebitcoins.com/faucet/That one let us claim multiple coins too.",

And from the time that they've taken the number that they've projected after having this promo, they might just stop the service. But if it's one of the reasons to make them have more traffic and make their users stay, they don't have to remove the feature just like what freebitco.in has done over all of these years. Aside from faucets, OP can just join those promotional threads on the Games and rounds(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=71.0) and join the raffles and contests there.",

As I checked they have been here for long and I see no reason to be shilling about their casino.No, it seems like most crypto businesses, especially in the gaming/gambling field, have stopped issuing free crypto - BetFury for example changed it to Rank #2, FreeBitco.in cut the free statoshis they give out from 28 to 2 every hour (unless you spend more on their site and then you can increase it).This is a genuine post trying to see where such sites are heading because clearly people are becoming more skeptic about crypto now - feel free to watch this for example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA3ayh2OmU0And yes, the future does seem more concerning than it was before ... PS we also run our own faucets, hopefully you can see the full picture now, we have nothing to do with BSpin, but BSpin is the only one out there giving out free crypto more than the others. It just seems like this \"strategy\" doesn't work so well for gambling sites - hence, it's in the gambling forum.Quote from: ralle14 on April 04, 2023, 03:40:47 AMI honestly think OP just wants to know more casinos that still offer free balance or faucets because you don't see most casinos give any reward for free unless you gamble regularly.
