The latter could happen too and its proven in the past. Best example is bitconnect. Also some others well known projects that collapse and got their dirty tactics exiting the market.  It doesnt mean that if you invest on a popular one then your safe. What you need to invest in are those big projects with a lot of proven legit and has a major background. Well for that you need to check top projects, some of them arent popular but indeed more trusted than those popular one.",

There's no guarantee if top coins will give you safe place to store your money. Your money will not be safe. If you wanna put your money into the risk and then use it as investment rather than store of value. There's no safe place in the crypto other than owning fiat balance. Truee haha .

A popular project does not mean a legitimate project. We have so many examples of the same, since my time BitConnect became a massive hit, but then turned ponzi, probably you never heard of it and recently the Terra project.These project may initially look legitimate, but you can never understand when they reveal their true colors and by then it is too late. Properly done research might sometime reveal the red flags, but often the scammers reveal very little info so as to keep investors in the dark while giving out lucrative offers for taking the money.Since the crypto space is not regulated a large number of scams may be going on right under our noses, but they will be caught in the coming 10years, not now when the hype is at peak.",

There is no certainty that the term popular could be established to firmly stand whether some projects are safe or not. There is more assuring effort like analysing the token/business model, and the underlying technologies which could be used with more weight compared to popularity.Popularity only affects within pump and dump scheme, but be in mind a scam scenario like Squid Game exists.",

There’s a higher chance that your money will be safe from scam since usually a good project can attract more investors and that makes them more popular though there’s a case already before that they are very popular with their ICO and after the period of investing, they just vanish and many loses their money. Investing is very risky, if you are in doubt you can choose to invest with the top coins/tokens which I can say is more safe.",

Well i would say that if you are choosing projects that are already big and established, then i think that your funds are definitely way safer then if you choose a very new project. With big and established i mean projects that are withing the top 100 in terms of market cap. The danger that those projects are pure scams is just very little there in my opinion while a new and upcoming project that was only listed on uniswap or pancakeswap so far always has the threat of a potential rugpull of the team after a few days.Of course even with big and established projects there always is a very small chance that you will lose your funds. Just take a look at what happened with Luna a few weeks ago and that project was even in the top 10 if i remember correctly. So you will never be 100% safe i assume.",

None can exactly guarantee it. But by investing in popular projects, moreover, the top projects that have been listed on the top exchanges, we have been more careful and tried to decrease the scam probabilities. However, the new project is a very high risk to invest in. Although we have analyzed the project seriously and carefully, the new projects have bigger percentages of scam probabilities. Additionally, even if they are not scammers, new projects also have more challenges to be successful in the market, not failed after listing. That is why new project investment may have higher risk.",
