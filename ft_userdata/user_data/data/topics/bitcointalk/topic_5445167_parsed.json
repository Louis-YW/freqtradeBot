  "content": "I hardly know any BM on this forum as I am still new. I never thought any BM would have a human side as they are more into the professional attitude towards Hunters & the client. But BM like @Royse777 is either kind, intelligent, or opportunist. I would say our BM is a combination of all three attributes.Considering the projects that he manages that are similar to ChipMixer I feel he/she has utilized all three characteristics to get the best of this forum under his management after the closure of ChipMixer's signature campaign.What I like about it this situation is that he did everything to convince his clients to increase their marketing funds and help those incredible forum members that were suddenly left with nothing to earn due to the sudden government intervention.Quote from: Royse777 on March 16, 2023, 11:02:51 AMMassive update!Sinbad management decided to increase their weekly budget which means we have OPEN SLOTS! Please apply until I announce CFNP later today as the week already started.PS: To fit these new members in the campaign we will not consider the queue which means you will get paid for the rank you are applying. Whoever already is in the campaign stays in their assigned payroll.",

You seem to know a lot about chipmixer camp's participants and their quality of work already. Quote from: elevates on March 16, 2023, 01:48:31 PMI never thought any BM would have a human sideYou are forgetting here that humans are the BMs, lol.Quote from: elevates on March 16, 2023, 01:48:31 PMWhat I like about it this situation is that he did everything to convince his clients to increase their marketing funds and help those incredible forum members that were suddenly left with nothing to earn due to the sudden government intervention.I agree here that Royse777 is a very smart person and knows how to convince and take advantage of the situations to deliver the best to his clients who show trust towards him. One thing I found cool about the situation is SinBad didn't get worried about chipmixer's seizure and instead went for more marketing and increased budget. I thought they would fear about them being the next but seems like they are thinking the other way around. Nice!",

Nice!It might they took advantage while Chipmixer was down.  We've seen a lot of Bitcoin mixer services have been down in the past and no doubt they will come at that point whether they like it or not.  So it's a pure business and it could be a wise move, just like in saying \"strike while the iron is hot\".  IMO, there's nothing permanent in this world and we don't know what will happen to them in the future but hopefully, the Bitcoin mixer services will not be stopped. All I can say, the BM has a wise decision and it could be the BM know very well how to market the project while the big competitor has been down, IMO.",

So that's not something unique and different here, even if offline business this is being practice.So not sure what you are trying to say here as if this hasn't been done before.Most of the participants of CM in it's beginning came from Bitmixer.io when it closes, how do I know? because I was part of Bitmixer.io and when it closes, majority of the participants moved to Chipmixer. You can check Chipmixer spreadsheet for that.",

Knowing the manager's attitude towards high-quality posts, Royse777 will kill two birds with one stone: get people who cannot be blamed for poor-quality postings and increase the project's advertising.",

      "body": "What keeps projects longer on the forum is positive results. If a CM can provide results that makes the project feel like they're not throwing money into the river bank, they'll remain in the forum. Royse is known for providing such results, I could remember he was suspended for sending mass PMs to reputable members to join his Coinplay campaign, which was considered an offense in the forum. That shows he wants the best for his clientele, himself, reputation and profits. So, in my view, he saw the Chipmixer campaign closure a good opportunity to reach out to those reputable members again who could land his campaign the quality results he needs by increasing the funds for VIP participants. Personally, when managing a project and I discover that with extra money I'll get the results required by my client I'd take similar step. What matters is doing a good job, instead of trying to save money and end up submitting bad results.",

      "body": "It's wise of Royse777 to do that. But this is not something unique. Even outside this forum, you have to recognize and grab the opportunity as soon as it comes knocking on your door. When a star athlete is about to finish his/her contract or when he/she decides to become a free agent, offers begin to flood. The wise move is to court him/her. The same goes with the best employees, brilliant consultants, lawyers, and others. As soon as there's an opportunity, grab it, or at least try to.We all know that the campaign that holds the best posters here on the forum is Chipmixer. When it ended all of a sudden, there's a window of opportunity opening up. Royse777 wanted to grab it right away. It's just perfect that he's promoting an alternative mixer. Chipmixer leaving the scene means a huge market is looking for another option. It's a great time for Sinbad to step up and become aggressive. On a different note, I'm happy that this happens. While I know that Chipmixer participants are principled, it certainly matters that their posts are paid. To a certain extent, they're incentivized to remain active, join discussions, and share their valued knowledge and ideas.",

I am not giving much attention to the service board in the recent days that is why I am not aware of what happened to Chipmixer for a while. But I asked this question on multiple occasions still not get any convincing discussions so I am coming again with the same question, how the mixing service platforms will survive after such huge pressure on them by these governments.",
