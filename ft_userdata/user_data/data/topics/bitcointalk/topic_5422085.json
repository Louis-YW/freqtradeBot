Indeed the Blockchain is the Central server, which  is decentralized. How about the Bitcoin Core ?  When some one download the Bitcoin Core, do they down load it from the decentralised blockchain or they have down the Bitcoin Client from the Bitcoin Core Centralized computer ?  Bitcoin Core is now literally Bitcoin QT which is an US based centralised commercial company. How the Bitcoin Core become Bitcoin QT ?  There must be something secret, and I must dugout it for the sake of original plan. Mr Franky1 aka Souvlaki, you are really lucky because you found Bitcoin in 2012 according to your own testimony. I really like the way you have explained clearly for people to understand that Bitcoin really is the decentralised first cryptocurrency. I understand, that you are one of many who understand Bitcoin Protocol very well and you are teaching the Bitcoin and blockchain to many people without getting tired of and I think you work very hard to educate all the newbies here in this forum. Well, some people, think I am just a Newbie and have no knowledge of the Bitcoin Protocol. Some other think I could be dangerous for the  Bitcoin Forum and Bitcoin community and Bitcoin multi billion business enterprise. Very of then the Bitcoin Forum dictator delete my posts and uses abusive word to make me feel uncomfortable. Skin of my body is of elephant's so I don't get angry or get annoyed when I have been bullied by the forum members. I will forgive all your sins very soon with Bitcoin Cobra, which is about to hatch when Bitcoin killer switch I turn on. When people push to eat donkey's mean ? Usually when there is food shortage in the land. People eat any thing they can just to survive. There are Bitcoin Whales hoarding too many Bitcoins for the time when there will Bitcoin shortage in the Bitcoin exchanges in few years time. Now, the truth is if whether there is a Bitcoin secret or nor who knows better than its inventor ?",

Any one can claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto but there is only person who is the real inventor of Bitcoin as you know the truth. You love truth and you have high moral which I admire your good sense. I hide the truth for some times for some reason. For morality, I am 100% agree with you. But you need to understand that honesty is the best policy and I honesty and moratlity are the embodiment of my self entity. You do, do not lie, neither I like liars. As you have suggested for me to go and do some research, on this regard I have to say, that is good but the man who has  built this very forum and design the Bitcoin and invented the blockchain technology, what do you suggest him to research about ? I was doing some research about Souvlaki and Greek people who were having shortage of foods and they even killed their Donkys and ate their flesh just to survive. That is Souvlaki, it was a not a joke for you. I do not make joke anymore. I understand you love Souvlaki and lucky to spend Bitcoin money to enjoy and live a luxury life, while billions of people need your support and you are not helping them but hoarding bloody Bitcoins in cold vault. When my account says, \" I Am Satoshi Nakamoto \" it's mean I Am Not Satoshi Nakamoto but it is just my JAPANESE Pseudonym. Why do I have to pretend to be my pseudonym ? I am Who I Am ! If you do not understand my language and get annoyed then you must know, BitcoinMoses is the Grand Father of BitcoinJesus. As for the Bitcoin killer switch, I am the Remote of the Bitcoin Killer switch. Only my request is do not provoke any further. I might get influenced by your wrong judgement and it will be your fault. If I want, I can trigger the Bitcoin Killer switch on simply by creating a monopoly Bitcoin Derivative as the US PM did created US $ Dollar as the Monopoly derivatives to Gold. I wanted all the Bitcoin Gremlins to leave me alone but as they have not left me alone so I thinking to pull down the BTC price to create balance for some unknown purpose which I can not disclose. You can ask to BitcoinJesus about it.",
