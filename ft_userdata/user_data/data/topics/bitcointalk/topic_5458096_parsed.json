  "content": "I am not sure what is happening but I have gone through the app multiple times. It happen to be complicated to find the import option anywhere within the app. Am I looking in the wrong direction or the option is not really available in the new version of the app?After opening the App below are the options which I am seeing right now:1. Balance Screen: It has the mycelium logo, show main account balance, send and receive option. One other option that can be visible is Cold Storage. 2. Account: This is second screen that is available. It has list of all active accounts. Shows main account and other accounts which I have made earlier. On the same screen as you know we can make new accounts by clicking the + sign. However, after clicking the + sign only new account can be generated there are no advance options or nothing which will take me to import previous wallet. On Account creation page only these options are available: LabelPublic KeyView transactionsMake currentArchive AccountDelete Account3. Transactions: Well this is basically third screen with all transaction history. 4. Settings: The last tab within the wallet which has various options to change the wallet features and also has About the app information. The list of options goes like this:CurrencyExchange Rate ProviderInviteBack up AboutP.S. One of the member told me to go through three dots on the right hand side but it seem there are no three dot option, neither such menu exists in the wallet.    I am definitely missing something. Please point me in the right direction, that would be appreciated. Thank you.",

From what I have noticed, the wallet should give you the ability to restore a wallet when you're first opening it, so if you're not trying to have two wallets at the same time, that could work.",

I think they have not added the option in the iOS version which is insane. Moreover, the iOS and Android version looks way way different mate. There are bunch of option which are not available on the iOS version. It seem they are not even trying hard to make it more like Android version. It means it does prove that we don't have any option to import the other wallet using mnemonic phrases OR private key. I only wanted to import new addresses which I have generated using the GitHub bitcoin address generator. I received the transaction on it, and thought to import it whenever I will require the funds. It seems Mycelium is not the option for it.  -> I think I should import this on Electrum over my laptop. Hm.",

      "body": "Based on other users said there is no import option on IOS Mycelium unlike on Android phones.What is your current backup? Is it a paper backup/private key or a seed phrase?If it's a private key then switch to another wallet but if it's a seed backup you can restore it by deleting data and reinstalling Mycelium because you can only find the \"restore backup\" option on the first opening of the app look at the image below",

And they just continued its development i guess just a year past for a reason.",

Hm.Indeed, you should look for much better alternatives like Sparrow wallet or Electrum, but just give up on Mycelium iOS Version. It has not been maintained for so many years and is also very buggy. It will only continue giving you more headache.The only update which took place in as many years was just their two month ago, and it was just a “warning about a technical issue affecting BTC send/receive functionality” lol – https://github.com/mycelium-com/wallet-ios",

I have created paper wallet which I wanted to import into the mycelium but it seems iOS is literally broken. How could their developers be so lazy and not to add that feature. I’m pretty sure there are numerous ios users too who must be thinking what they have coded? Funny eh?I think I am better off with the paper wallet and other Back up address I will import over electrum now. I see that there are some suggestions like sparrow and trust wallet which I can use. Definitely I will need to go for desktop application rather than mobile one. My goal was to have some funds in mobile wallet for easy spending. Hmm mycelium need to work hard.",

I’m pretty sure there are numerous ios users too who must be thinking what they have coded? Funny eh?It has been an ongoing problem for years. People have complained and given up. Apparently there were 2 independent teams of developers. The Devs for the android app and external Devs for the iOS app. It's why the iOS app looks different from the android app.This read post is from 8 years ago, but it will help you understand what has been happening – https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/36ke99/mycelium_iphone_vs_android/I personally gave up on mycelium when decided advertising scam sites like 1xbit.com. It meant that they even no longer gave a shit about their reputation, so long as they got the money from affiliates. Best option is to just save yourself the headache and try better alternatives.",
