  "content": "QuoteWith more people owing more money, utility companies are getting more aggressive about shutoffs. A “Tsunami of Shut-Offs” Is Coming US electricity prices surging and more people than ever are struggling to pay the power company. More than 20 million American households have fallen behind on their utility bills, about 1 of every 6 homes, and the amount they owe has doubled since before the pandemic.  With more people owing more money, utilities are getting more aggressive about cutting off delinquent customers. Many states imposed shutoff moratoriums during the pandemic, but those policies wound down just as record inflation made power – and almost everything else — more costly. That’s going to trigger a “tsunami of shutoffs,” Jean Su, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, told Bloomberg News for a story I co-wrote this week on the coming crisis.  The basic problem is that electricity is more expensive, up 15% from a year ago, and there's no sign of relief. That’s because power prices are linked to the cost of natural gas, which has more than doubled in the past year and is expected to remain high at least into next year. Meanwhile, climate change has triggered extreme heat around the world, driving up power consumption, and power bills, as people seek refuge in air-conditioning. And in many hot regions, cooling isn't just for comfort — people who lose power during a stifling heat wave can die. While 41 states have some kind of protection against winter shutoffs for exactly this reason, only 19 have similar policies for the sweltering summer months. New Orleans last month asked its local utility to halt summer shutoffs as temperatures climbed, and this is going to become more urgent amid the global climate crisis. Government aid is helping avert some shutoffs, and Congress this month asked for additional emergency funding on top of the $4 billion already set aside for a federal assistance program this year. Many states also have assistance programs, and utilities are generally willing to work with struggling customers. Most will agree not to shut off power to people who have applied for assistance or signed up for some kind of payment plan. But that help is just a band-aid that masks the underlying issue, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Low-income families already face a high energy burden, with a greater portion of their income needed to cover utility bills than wealthier families. For some, electricity is becoming too expensive to afford at all.  “The bills just aren’t affordable,” says Wolfe. “People on the bottom, they can’t pay this.” —Will Wadehttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-25/more-americans-than-ever-can-t-afford-to-pay-their-electric-bill....According to this, 1 in 6 american households have fallen behind on electricity payments. Installment payment plans and state assistance are some of the options available. But the situation doesn't look good. It seems most are suffering in silence as there hasn't been much public discussion on the topic. Is it possible that rising electricity costs could fuel a trend towards mass adoption of renewable energy for residential use? As people seek alternatives due to grid energy being priced outside their budget? Is there a silver lining and positive note to this doom and gloom?As the cost of natural gas and petrol rise. Many have speculated it will create opportunities and accelerate adoption of alternatives to traditional fossil fuels which are superior. While much of europe is unsuitable for either wind or solar power. The same cannot be said of the united states. Maybe we have a chance for energy independence. Although, it doesn't seem as if many care about things like that.",

The fact that they have less population as compared to other developing countries and yet they are able to fulfil the fuel/energy needs of their peeps is amusing. USA over the time has kept their reliance on the outsourcing a lot and thus they are more or less reducing in numbers of employment causing direct impact on what they earn per capita. Subsequently bills are looking bigger than bread and butter due to such situation. Changing source of energy is not a problem. They should reduce the consumptions with day light savings or some other measures which can save up back ups on the substations and bring down the prices by using Demand-Supply formula. Works in most of the asian countries with highly dense population.",

As people seek alternatives due to grid energy being priced outside their budget? Is there a silver lining and positive note to this doom and gloom?If I compare things to Europe, I don't think it's very likely. Energy has always been much cheaper in the US than in Europe, and that's why Americans consume more of it. The average American household consumes 10,715 kWh of electricity per year. In the Netherlands, that's 2,479 kWh. I expect similar numbers when it comes to fuel, cars here are much smaller (although they're getting bigger lately).So the best thing to do, is reduce energy consumption. Insulate those houses. Solar panels are nice if you have space for it, but as long as grid energy is cheap, it won't be a viable option for the people who currently can't afford their bills.QuoteAs the cost of natural gas and petrol rise.

While much of europe is unsuitable for either wind or solar power. The same cannot be said of the united states. Maybe we have a chance for energy independence. Although, it doesn't seem as if many care about things like that.One of the problems with the European \"Green Deal\" is that it focusses on the ideological side, and not on availability of energy. Here, we have a minister of \"Energy and Climate\". The combination of the 2 says it already, he studied Public Management and he's more of a minister of \"Energy Reduction\" than \"Energy Security\". Needless to say, that backfired big time with gas prices up 20-fold and electricity prices up 10-fold since he came to office. It's not even his fault, but I doubt he even understands where energy comes from, so he's not going to resolve it.So from what I've seen: energy policies should be based on technology, not on ideology and especially not on \"required innovation\".",

Spending has been ramped up over the last decade, but it was going on for much past that. How many subsidies, defaulted loans, tax credits and such, have gone out to \"green\" enterprises that haven't posed a positive ROI? Climate change expenditures are not only the funds associated with building more wind turbines. The opportunity cost isn't factored in either (as in taking the billions spent on climate change initiatives that have accomplished nothing, and factoring what those funds might have returned had they been invested properly)I've tried looking for accurate figures of total climate change expenditures and can't seem to find it. If you have a figure that's more accurate, I'd be informed of a more reliable estimate.",

In Europe a lot of families are going to have trouble paying for electricity.I'm pretty sure it's going to be far worse for Europeans than it is for Americans.QuoteFactbox: Europe's efforts to shield households from soaring energy costsMany countries have either lowered energy taxes, or are now subsidizing energy. My country is now even subsidizing large industries to keep them compatitive.There's a fundamental problem with that: it doesn't solve the shortage! If everyone would consume (say) 20% less energy, there wouldn't be a shortage, prices would be back to normal (90-95% lower than the current prices), and we'd all spend 20% less.If, on the other hand, everyone pays 10 times more (with or without subsidy), and uses the same amount of energy, we still have a shortage that won't be solved in the short term, and drain money out of our economy towards other countries. Part of that money comes from increasing government debt, made possible by the low interest, and all it does is fuel inflation.QuoteBut I think about it from a more global perspective: what else will an increasing number of families not be able to afford as energy prices affect everything and produce inflation.I just checked: at our current household energy consumption, the cheapest new contract would be €550 per month. That's an energy supplier I've never heard of. There are a few other offers around €700 per month. It's crazy, especially since this country is sitting on large natural gas reserves. We used to be a large exporter of natural gas (when it was very cheap), but now gas production will shut down in October (that's a political decision).QuoteIt is clear that they are not going to stop eating, even if they are looking to save more on groceries. I understand that the leisure sector and other non-essential sectors will be the most affected.Here, supermarkets increased their revenue while they sold less products. We don't stop eating, but we're either eating less or cheaper products.",

Other energies have also been very cheap, I actually paid a bunch of bills today and my gas bill was about $1 and my water bill was a little less than a dollar.I should point out that part of the low price in dollar is the terrible exchange rate Rial has which is why I intentionally used the \"bag of chips\" for comparison to clarify that generally speaking utility bills are indeed very low here, for example total of what I paid today (electric, gas, water and phone bill) would be barely 1% of the lowest salary in my country.Quote from: LoyceV on August 27, 2022, 12:30:33 PMHere, we have (for both gas and electricity) a fixed cost per day for the connection and consumption rate.

So if you don't use much in summer, you can get very low or even negative costs. But, we pay an average amount per month so people can still afford it in winter.The rates here are fixed (may change every decade with inflation). And we always pay exactly for the amount we used and usually every 2 months. Some exceptions apply like for those who use a lot of electricity, where the rate goes up incrementally to prevent abuse (BTW this doesn't apply to licensed bitcoin miners, they get a slightly higher but fixed rate which is still lower than anywhere else).Electricity prices also differ based on the city, for example in the south where it is a lot hotter than closer to north where I live, the electricity price is even lower since people naturally consume more electricity for air conditioners and such.Quote from: LoyceV on August 27, 2022, 12:30:33 PMA 9.6% hashrate would put you in Canada. I how no idea how power prices are build up there.My data may be a bit outdated since I computed the share last year (~6 months ago) and I basically reversed the amount of tax the government had claimed to have earned from miners to get the total hashrate percentage which put it a little less than 10%. However official statements have claimed it is about 5% at the time and the historical chart at Cambridge Bitcoin Mining Map approves it too but it puts the current percentage at 0.12%.This makes even less when you consider that Iran has been using bitcoin as payment for international trades and considering trading bitcoin is not regulated, the only way they can receive bitcoin is if they take in form of tax from miners.The Cambridge thing may be reporting based on news instead of actually computing the percentages. The 5% they reported before was a public announcement and the 0.12% is also related to another news 2 months ago where the government claimed they would be shutting down miners during summer to prevent power outages.But considering that there has been no power outage until today (third month of summer) and on a Persian forum miners claimed they never received any new regulations telling them to shut down, raises some questions about validity of those stats by Cambridge (not saying they are for sure wrong though since I don't have enough information and the government doesn't really release any clear statistics!).",
