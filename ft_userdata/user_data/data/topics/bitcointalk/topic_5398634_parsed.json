  "content": "Finally Luna V2 News / Plan Reval check here https://agora.terra.money/t/terra-ecosystem-revival-plan/8701The Terra community must reconstitute the chain to preserve the community and the developer ecosystem.Validators should reset the network ownership to 1B tokens, distributed among:400M (40%) to Luna holders before the depegging event (last $1 tick before the depeg on Binance should be reasonable), bLuna, LunaX, and Luna held in contracts should also be recipients, minus the Terraform Labs account at terra1dp0taj85ruc299rkdvzp4z5pfg6z6swaed74e6. The new chain should be community-owned. Preserving decent ownership of the network in its strongest believers and builders is important.400M (40%) to UST holders pro-rata at the time of the new network upgrade. UST holders need to be made whole as much as possible100M (10%) to Luna holders at the final moment of the chain halt – last-minute marginal luna buyers should be compensated for their role in attempting to provide stability for the network100M (10%) to the Community Pool to fund future development.All Luna besides the third tranche should be staked at the network genesis state.The network should incentivize its security with a reasonable inflation rate, say 7%, as fees will no longer be enough to pay for security without the swap fees.what do you think really works?",

The trust is already broken among the old investors and it would probably take another bullrun before it goes back to its previous price.I agree that only time well tell on what will happen in the future. I also think that if terra team will do that plan then those people who wanted to get out with as little loss as much as possible or as much as they can will be very happy. I wonder if the plan will work with terra team and continue making people believe in it and they don't lose their investors in their company. My guess is they will lose some of their investors if the price doesn't go back to it's previous price or close as the previous price.",

He's just trying to appease the community with sweet words that he knows can't be done. There are still a lot of valuable coins in the market to invest in, as long as we are determined and try, I believe everyone will soon overcome and regain what was lost.",

I believe that real USD or other well-known cryptocurrency is better compensation and investors are free to swap to the new coinI know that the team is trying their best to save what is left of the Terra system but after such events, many many investors will definitely abandon Luna. So how can development proceed if there are only a few investors left? Terra is one of the biggest flaws in the cryptocurrency world.",
