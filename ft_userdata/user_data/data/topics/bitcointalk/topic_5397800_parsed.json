      "body": "Its very true that we need to take responsibility for the happenings in our lives. Blaming others or the government is not the solution to the problem, hence one need to focus on how to overcome the problem or obstacles. But how would you explain a situation where the government is fantastically corrupt. The basic facilities that would have made life easy for the people is not provided because of embezzlement of government funds. How would entrepreneurs survive when there are no stable electricity supply, good roads, security and so much more. How can a state hospital don't have even a tank of oxygen and the only ambulance they own have no fuel in its tank. My in-law had to use his phone torchlight to assist the midwife when his wife was been delivered of a baby because the hospital's generator has no fuel. Why won't I blame the government for police brutality when they fail to prosecute anyone of them. Why won't I complain when in a community of close to 200,000 people has no police presence and criminal elements a taking over our lands. When we protest, they shoot us. During elections they rig for themselves and their cronies. You cannot beat a child and expect that he wouldn't cry. Although we would always seek solutions to our problems but we would keep blaming them until our government change from evil to good.",

Do you really make research before writing the content? The topic is very good, but the content is contrarily to my thoughts. The masses blame the government because the government do not want to do the Manifesto. All the promises they promised the masses in their election campaign period were abandoned and making the poor Masses perpetual in poor. In that case the subjects or the citizens have to blame the government for their failure. Concerning your TOPIC OP. \"The Blame Game\". It is only present government and passed government blame themselves not the citizens blame the government. Citizens blame government Base on the failure of ideologies. But present government Blame the pass government Base on incompleted projects, corruption, in security, unemployment etc but all these things can be done by the present government if they are really there work for the masses but they will/would shift the blame to the pass government and also left the project to siphon the public Treasury. Therefore, please remove the people from the blame game. But it is the government within the government.",

At the end, we are not here for the government, the government is here for us (that's it's purpose), so if that same government is at fault and the cause of issues than simply reverting to ourselves won't do any good. Point the finger of blame to those that diserve it.",

This is a disease that is hard to heal because it needs you to accept your own fault no matter who you are. people like this are helpless because they don't listen, they only want their own opinion and they won't accept yours no matter how logical you are. They called it nowadays \"toxic minded people\". these guys have no friends or they might have a little but the same as them. But in reality, it is rare to find a person who thinks otherwise because most people nowadays have some traits called \"self amazement\" that doesn't want to be called low class rather they think of themselves as higher than the others.",

If you find yourself in a bad situation, and then just sit back and do nothing and blame the government, then it's difficult to justify your actions (or inaction). However, if you try your hardest, then it is certainly fair to blame the government for your situation.No government is perfect, and some are much worse than others. They should definitely be held accountable for their failures, and in particular for inequality of opportunity.But equally, it is incumbent on us as individuals to always try our best.I think these are two separate things.",

A pious life allows you to build these habits and, above all, to pass them on successfully to our children.",
