The idea behind this project is to create an inclusive discussion space where forum members, along with experts from various fields, come together to review the week in the world of cryptocurrencies and highlight the best forum posts and more things.BitcoinTalk podcast goals:Community Interaction: Encourage active participation from forum members in dynamic discussions and conversations about the hottest topics of the week.Inclusivity: Invite experts in cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and finance to enrich discussions and provide diverse perspectives.Weekly Recap: Provide a concise summary of the most significant events of the week in the cryptocurrency space, keeping our community informed(no media control).Showcasing the Best Forum Posts: Recognize and discuss the most relevant and valuable posts made by our own members during the week.This podcast/talk show it wont be dense, because the main point its to inform people with transparency, bring to light the most OG people in this forum and in the bitcoin ecosystem. I want this podcast to be a collaborative effort. If you have ideas, suggestions, or would like to be part of the panel or even be a special guest, i would love to hear from you! Leave your comments in this thread. I would also ENHANCE the moderators, ADMINS to reply AND JOIN , im tired to see the twitter media and this ''crypto influencers'' misinforming people.",

The idea behind this project is to create an inclusive discussion space where forum members, along with experts from various fields, come together to review the week in the world of cryptocurrencies and highlight the best forum posts and more things.I think it's a good idea worth pursuing. However keep in mind that there's tons of youtube channels covering every aspect of crypto. about the only thing I don't think they ever talk about is the bitcointalk forum!   also, I'd recommend a bi-weekly or even monthly. i think weekly might get to be too much of a chore unless you have a sponsor.",

      "body": "This is a good idea, somewhat similar to the bitcointalkshow on YouTube which sadly is not so active anymore. It would take a lot to get members that would be willing to 'speak' weekly, every two weeks or one month may be a better idea. I would also advice you book speakers for at least 3-5 episodes before you kickstart the program,bthat way every week or two weeks is notba struggle to get the next willing member to join.Best of luck.",

      "body": "This idea is quite good where in this podcast there will be many things that will be discussed and it will provide a lot of knowledge to the members of this forum and the wider audience. But the problem is that it becomes difficult when you want to invite several members of this forum to join the podcast because most of the members prefer to be anonymous and not known to the public. Moreover, not everyone has time to attend the podcast event, perhaps due to time differences or other reasons, and you need sponsors to be able to host the podcast. So that's why podcasts like this are not very relevant in this forum.",

But the problem is you used ChatGPT to come up with the idea for you, so I don't have faith that you'd personally be capable of organizing such a podcast. You also have already been tagged for basically trying to buy merits. Your forum career is not off to a good start. LOL.Quote from: jpbh81 on January 16, 2024, 03:16:23 PMWe've all been there, that moment of realization when you remember selling your precious Bitcoins years ago and wonder if you missed the boat.  Well, take a deep breath, because im here to remind you that in the world of crypto, time is always on our side!It might sting a bit to think about what could have been if you held onto those BTC, but let's not forget the golden rule of crypto: it's a marathon, not a sprint. The market is dynamic, and opportunities are ever-present.^^^also ChatGPT. Congrats on your 5 merits for it, too bad they are useless now.",

I remember when I was first getting into bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general I tried to look for some podcasts that could help me but found nothing useful at the same time entertaining I do wonder on which platform do you plan on releasing the said podcast? I do think Spotify would be a good idea it is a good platform and has a lot of usersGood luck to this endeavor!",
