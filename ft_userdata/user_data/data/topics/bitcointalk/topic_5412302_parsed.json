Could the name of the file have changed?I searched '0201010420' using a hex editor but i found a lot of results (890). They all look a like starting 'D0 30' it's ending '00 00'. I don't know if there is another program that creates this order ??I don't remember putting a password on the wallet.( if there is a password I remember my possible passwords ).I used jackjack/pywallet Â scanned the hard drive but found nothing. I used this code :Code:C:\\Users\\Hoss\\Documents\\pywallet-win-files-master>pywallet.py --recover --recov_device C: --recov_size=465Gio --recov_outputdir C:\\Users\\Hoss\\Desktop\\found_walletGives a fault : ''pycrypto or lib ssl not found'' where is the problem??old hdd : IDEwindows 8.1python 2.7now i am trying to convert all hex codes and try, and waiting your help.",
