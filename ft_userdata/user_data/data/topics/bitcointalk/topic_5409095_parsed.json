Do you have any recommendations?How long does it take a state-of-the-art mining machine to mine a Bitcoin? Maybe you know all this, but since you're newbie and your question looks more like jumping in head-first, I feel have to write all this:Mining bitcoin is pretty much a business. Mining machines are far from cheap and if your electricity price is not overly cheap you'll end up mining bitcoin more expensive than buying it.So I advise you read more and understand better what you're planning to do.Also, if you will have only one miner, you will probably use pool mining, gathering tiny amounts from each block mined by that pool, you won't exactly \"mine one bitcoin\" directly.Actual miners would give you more info about machine and approximate time frame for getting 1 BTC (assuming the difficulty doesn't change much)",

      "body": "Let's take the Antminer S19 XP (140Th) as en example:We'll disregard price fluctuation or electrical price, because you asked how long would it take to mine 1 full BTCSo the remaining variables are difficulty adjustments & halvings (in ~2 years the reward will decrease to 3.125 per block)If today you would start pool mining, a 101% guesstimation would be ~10 years if you're lucky (there is no exact math formula for this)P.S - My guesstimation can have some errors of +/- 99%, but mostly + - This is not the way you analyze if mining would work for you ! Electrical price and eventual BTC fluctuations need to be taken into account and many other aspects !",

Do you have any recommendations?Check Canaan units it seems they are selling cheaper right now compared to Bitmain. And also if you are a newbie at least read this sticky thread here \"First time/Small miner reference for getting started\"Quote from: Selena-01 on August 08, 2022, 08:56:48 AMHow long does it take a state-of-the-art mining machine to mine a Bitcoin? Depending on so many things if you talking about the whole Bitcoin you won't be able to mine 1 BTC with a single miner you need 8PH/s to be able to mine 1 BTC every month.",

If  all gear were 29 watt a th  s19'squite a bit of gear growth. Plus power use.264 kwatts = 7 coins about $2.64 in power1,125,000 kwatts = 7 coins  about $112,000 in power there are natural limits to just how much power can be tossed at mining.Ie going from 264 to 1,125,000 can be done in fact it was done.going from 1,125,000 Kwatts to 4,794,000,000 Kwatts  is not likely.but Solar has huge growth commercial Panels now are 21% effective  the best of the best are 37%.  Perfection may be a 48-51% possiblity.Translation a 400 watt panel may get as good as 800 watts in the future.So 2x is easy peasy.How much space for panels. Tons every parking lot in the world from 45 lat south to 45 lat north could have panels.https://www.nj.com/news/2019/06/six-flags-is-now-one-of-worlds-1st-solar-powered-theme-parks-more-clean-energy-is-on-the-way.htmlEvery time some one talks about BTC using power just show them this image and tell them instead of governments letting this happen below",
