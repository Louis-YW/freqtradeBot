  "content": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biomemory-unveils-groundbreaking-dna-cards-revolutionizing-data-storage-technology-302003996.htmlBiomemory, a trailblazer in digital data storage solutions, has today announced the launch of its DNA Cards, the first time DNA data storage has ever been available for sale to the general public. Available now this year, the groundbreaking DNA Cards, whose credit card-sized format boast a capacity of one kilobyte of text data each, serve as proof of the practical ability to utilize molecular computing for storage needs, a departure from and more sustainable alternative to traditional silicon chips. Biomemory, the creative force behind this unique format, ensures a minimum lifespan of 150 years, setting a new standard in data longevity.You could literally store a bunch of 24-word seedphrases on one DNA card. While the DNA Cards are the first instance of the practical use of this storage technology, Biomemory plans to scale up this DNA data storage technology for data center usage. Looking ahead, in 2026 Biomemory plans to release the Biomemory Prime, designed for seamless integration into data centers with a planned storage capacity of 100 PB, marking a significant step towards a sustainable and efficient digital future for data storage. Not only that but they're going to have 100 petabyte form factors. Now everyone can afford to store the blockchain forever! 100 PB  is ALOT. for those of you that don't know. 1000 terabytes equals to 1 petabyte. no more crashed hard drives.",

It's very interesting. But let me tell you something I intentionally skipped yesterday, it seems the company claimed it can store alittle bit of data on DNA, but that's not really the case. What it does is to replicate the original data synthetically on the so called DNA via translation. It's doesn't really store the original data on DNA. That doesn't make sense by the way because computer data aren't compatible with DNA.",

It's very interesting. it's an interesting technology but it's not useful for storing private data.https://www.biomemory.com/product-pageEncode your most precious text in the language of DNA on a DNA Cardyeah right. like i'm going to trust some company to decode my private data and then return it back to me UNREAD. i must be really dumb if I do that.To test the retrieval of your data, we included one free sequencing by the world-renowned leader in DNA analysis, Eurofins Genomics. They will handle the decoding process and send you back your ACTGs. In our DNA Card kit, you'll find everything you need for hassle-free submission to Eurofins Genomics. so I have to trust a company to decode my private data AND to not read it. i'm not sure i can trust them. also, even if I trusted them, how do I know they're going to be in business when I get to a point where I need my data decoded?

That doesn't make sense by the way because computer data aren't compatible with DNA. We all know how DNA works. the problem here is, this DNA card service someone would have to be a moron to use it for storing something like a bitcoin private key. even dumber than storing it on google drive... let me know when they include a \"home decoding kit\" and then maybe I'll change my mind...",
