      "body": "If you are uncertain and has doubt don't invest yet.  Try to dig into more information and check if NFT investment is for you.  Not because you have seen many people getting rich because they invest in NFT, then think that they are not you.  Your situation is different from theirs.  They probably got in before the NFT is overly hyped and sold their holdings when the price is on top.  Now the hype of NFT is almost gone, you can probably buy some in low prices but the question is who will buy your holdings.  So better do your research intensively.A quote from two of the articles I read about NFTQuote from: https://www.annuity.org/2022/01/14/from-the-experts-8-pros-and-cons-of-nfts/The Future of NFT InvestmentNFTs are an exciting creation, and they’re garnering more and more attention as their use cases multiply. The headline-grabbing price tags attached to some NFTs are fueling the fire. However, prudent investors should tread very lightly when thinking about buying these assets because NFTs are highly illiquid and volatile.Buying them with the hope of achieving triple- or quadruple-digit price returns is not advisable. The real value of NFTs lies in their potential to transform the way markets function and enhance the way we manage and control sensitive information. Here, the sky is the limit.Nevertheless, if you want to participate in the blockchain movement and see NFT ownership as your way to do it, go for it. However, please do so responsibly. Don’t put a lot of money into NFTs and always strive to establish low-cost positions. Otherwise, you could find yourself in a painful spot — financially and emotionally.Quote from: https://www.investopedia.com/pros-and-cons-of-investing-in-nfts-5220290The Bottom LineThe bottom line is that NFTs have pros and cons, but it's probably a bad idea to invest in any asset just because it's tokenized. The fundamentals of investing still apply, regardless of whether an asset's ownership is indicated by a blockchain. Your best move as an investor is to identify quality assets that you'd most like to own, and then do what it takes to acquire them.",

This would only apply into those NFT's which does have actual utility and not reallyjust focusing into those HD or Pixelated images.  If you do see a certain NFT which you do seem that it has potential to be valuable then its up to your call but if not then you could simply ignore.Its your money then its your fulldecision you would take.Dont let others do make decision for you since its your money then its your call on what to do but its not bad to snip out some ideas and advises but still the final decision would be still yours.",

But the uncertainty is more in the NFT world because most projects there have been riding the hype for the entire crypto market.If you think that you can't bear the risk that it has then don't invest yet. But if you believe on the NFT project that you're looking out, invest only what you can afford to lose.",

Research on NFT technology and on list of NFT projects are considering to pick one of them for your investment.NFT technology is good but at this moment, people only think of it as a fastest and easiest way to get rich. It is not true. Investment does not mean to get rich quickly. Get rich quickly is for speculation, not investment.Like you see Facebook (now Meta) invested in Metaverse and have been developing it after a few years. Do they get profit from what they invest in and develop? They have yet gotten profit from it. No get-rich-quick game.",

It's hard to predict how many years needed for the market to recover from the dump and this is the choice that must be made by anyone whether they wanna go for long term or short term. I have been trying to accumulate some projects tokens related to the NFT development and for me that's quite good for long term. I don't know about short term but if market can recover or doin bulltrap and it can give decent profit as well.",

The majority of NFT projects including the biggest name is down more than 50% since ATH while most of there P2E system and NFTs is almost worthless due to the declining token value which no one already interested on investing more. Follow your feelings this time because it was right to doubt on NFT investment. This is not a good time to invest on high risk sector of crypto which is NFT since most of them are rug pulling there investors slowly.Everybody on defi is slowly exiting the crypto market right now.",

Though as of the moment, there’s still a good numbers of NFTs currently listed in the market, and you might want to do more research about it before investing.

But why and what if we say there are? Will you use that as your advantage and you will invest more? Well that strategy is a good one only if you will apply that on the standard cryptos but for the nft's? Nah, I don't think so.There are really uncertainties going on even on the top crypto projects because we are on a bearish season but the uncertainties going on for the nft's are different. It was permanent because their hypes are already over and even if the bear season ends and bull run takes its place, the situation for the nfts are still going to be the same so think about it before you invest on them.",

All members are very friendly and will give you various answers.In my personal opinion, not only NFT but altcoins are currently in a state of uncertainty as the bear market starts to turn bad for all prices. Talking about NFT it will go much further due to excessive price and image manipulation. So if you are interested in NFT, then reconsider undoing the intention. Try to research further as far as you can. There is still a lot of time to learn, make sure you really have the right decision. It should also be remembered that investing in NFT is one of High Risk and High Return, NFT is also for me very different from crypto in general.",

If OP still decided with NFT, better to analyze again and go for the top NFTs, I just don’t advise to buy any NFT art here, that expensive art might not be worth it anymore in the future.",
