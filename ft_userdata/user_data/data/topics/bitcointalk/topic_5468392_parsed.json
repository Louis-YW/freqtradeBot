Therefore, it is better to say the fastest bot or more efficient than the rest of the bots or any features through which we can know why it is the best.Your account is new and no one will risk sharing the API and entering it into a bot of unknown origin and expecting that its data will not be exploited and that it will make profits. These are things that will not happen, so it is better to talk about the bot’s characteristics and gain more confidence.",

Can I buy a bot that I do not know about? He supposed to have given introduction and what the bot is all about so that people can know if to get it or not, but this simple way to make easy money are tactics deployed by scammers. My advise is that people should avoid him, he be is only here to scam.",

And that appears to be the case.Because that doesn't seem like a natural approach to trade in the crypto world to me. The risk is also considerable since if you make a mistake with the setup and haven't begun trading, you don't know if you'll lose straight away and merely lose capital for sure.",

If you can make a bot of your own, then you can freely use it without any risks. (doesn't include trading risks) But for that, you need proper knowledge of programming, trading, and other stuff. Why go so far just to trade? If you focus your time on learning advanced trading, that will be more fruitful in the future. And yes, AI and trading bot does the same thing. Maybe because AI is capable of something better than doing it manually, people may choose AI over manual bot setup. But how can we be so sure that it's going to work the way it is designed? And using bots or AI bots created by others is a big no-no. The struggle is real for both of them. So why bother? Doing it on our own gives us the advantage of learning and gaining experience. Which are investments of time for a successful future.",

My advise is that people should avoid him, he be is only here to scam.He will not come back to tell us why it is the best and I think a new account will be created stating that he used a bot and that it is a scam.These bots need trust because they are not like news bots. I can try them and I will not lose anything if they are not true or fraudulent, but to try them you need to deposit your money or link your accounts, and even if they are not able to withdraw your balance, they can misuse your money, you will lose a lot if you use them.",

If I am willing to buy it, on what basis should I buy it?  And you are a newbie how can I trust you?  Also I think bot usage can't be best.  There are many people who are not aware of its setting, they can face a lot of loss due to it.  The topic of using bots is not suitable for everyone. I think it is not right to use bots without sufficient knowledge.  And you have given a lot of information so no one will take risk based on your few words.",
