I was only concerned about the community to be more focused on cryptocurrency whereby any new commer may finds it enjoyable to read post across without having to keep asking for guidance and guidelines for what to say and what to do, apparently, some of all these rules can be translated into local Pidgin and got them pined on the beginning of this board which I believe too well that we may get our subforum sooner or later than expected.",

You're not far from the truth but the thing is that the board will be less active if other post aside bitcoin is not supported because we will be having less discussion. Even in the general board, you'll discover that majority of the post are being repeated in most cases due to lack of new bitcoin discussion. The most functioning board is gambling base on say na daily basis e dey happen. I'm not in support of sharing every piece of news to this site neither but if it's educative and has to do with the community development then it's not bad. By the way, some people are more active here than in other social media platforms.My problem with this board however is the way topics are being abandon and duplicate. Instead of Following up the previous topic with related conversation, we end up creating new topic and thereby having numerous topic with less comments.",

You make a point there to identify the fact that the local board or even the general forum is not only about crypto/bitcoin related only which is true because if the forum is about cryptocurrency and bitcoin discussion alone it won't be accommodating like it is right now. After all, not all Bitcoin or cryptocurrency users have technical or theoretical knowledge about Bitcoin so at that we welcome all discussions as it relate to us,  our environment,  and everyday collective life. But then also we have to know that,  for some time now there have been tons of none bitcoin or cryptocurrency-related topics for discussions,  and the reason for that is because the local board is still settling down and at the right time we will start dropping more crypto-related analysis that is organically formulated tested and proven to be useful. Not just sharing crypto-related news or all the other topics that have been discussed and are perceived as crypto-related but lack substantial details or proven data that can help the readers not just create awareness but proffer solutions to problems facing us as members of the local board as crypto community representing Nigeria here on bitcointalk.",

OP I disagree with you on that, the little I understand from local boards is not only for crypto discussion but also other issues relating to the country even in times of schooling we have extra curriculum were things that are not related to school is normally done so as local boards, I believe if it was only for crypto related topics this local boards wouldn't have been created because there are many sections that strictly focused on crypto talks, so local boards was created to enable people who have issues with English to communicate via there local language and matters concerning them.",

OP, you are welcome back to the forum. As for you post,it will be difficult for us to only focus on cryptocurrency discussion alone because it will lead to less contribution and boredom of the board. There are some people who are very good on other discussions apart from crypto which will also add value to the board and us too. The most important purpose of being here to learn about cryptocurrency (bitcoin),which you don't need to know about the tech side. Only the basics of bitcoin, which is the right wallet to use,how to send and receive bitcoin and how to hold for long. The other angles are based on personal interest. The country economy is alarming and the politics is corrupt,which we are also part of the country and it has being a pain on the neck. This is why you seed other topics,and moreover other he good to dey updated for every aspect of live not only finance. Economy is investment and investment is money.",
