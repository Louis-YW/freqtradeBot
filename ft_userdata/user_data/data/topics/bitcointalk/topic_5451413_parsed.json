  "content": "This topic is a heads-up for all Telegram users which may want to contact me there: it is not possible.Somebody told me recently that there is (was?) someone on Telegram with my username. When that person asked the impersonator, he said he is GazetaBitcoin. However, later he changed his name. I don't know if the impersonator appeared again, as I do not use Telegram.As a consequence, do not trust anybody from Telegram saying it's me. It is not me, as I do not use Telegram. Those interested to reach me can do it here, on this forum.I don't know exactly what username the imposter used -- if it was Gazeta Bitcoin, GazetaBitcoin, just Gazeta etc. but this is less important. The important part is to (1) never look for me on Telegram; (2) never trust anybody from Telegram saying it's me; (3) if anyone is interested to contact me, I am available on the forum.If there would be a (very less likely) situation where I would need to talk to someone outside the forum, I would instruct that person myself (on the forum) about the ways of communicating outside the forum. Therefore don't let yourself scammed by any imposter saying it's me on Telegram.That's all",

That's the normal and safe way of handling it anyway. Everything else is just risky and asking for trouble. If someone PMs you on Telegram and says, it's me Pmalek, and offers you some kind of deal, a conscious individual would want to confirm who that person is. If we have never spoken before and there is no history of previous conversations between the two of us, the standard routine would be for you to PM me here and ask if that is me who make contact with you over Telegram. If not, you only have yourself to blame for whatever happens because you believed an impersonator.",
