  "content": "I have been considering discussing this for a while now but didn't see any strong need for it. I think it needs to be considered now for several reasons. Some of which are, to make the forum hard to take down, to have post of members preserved even if the forum database is destroyed/corrupted from a single point etc. Incase of the latter, the forum copies can replicate and continue to exist possibly with another domain name (if necessary). The right domain name which should be accepted as the real forum domain name could be choosen via consensus involving most/all forum participants So, I'm suggesting the development of a forum that works offline with members forum data saved in their devices, more like how Telegram or similar messagers do it. Such offline forum would enable members create posts, change forum settings and have them synced later with whoever is having the full forum data. Forum members can hold any amount of forum data the wish, whether it's the full/whole data or parts of it, such as their posts, threads they are posted in and their (members) forum settings. In regards to holding the full forum's data, I think it should be done in such a way that forum data that should not be seen or accessed by the holders is thoroughly encrypted, only the owners of the data can decrypt and access them. This would mean no one will be able to access or change Satoshi forum data (not even theymos or other high ranking admins) except Satoshi, who will be the only one with the decryption keys for his forum data... All other members including theymos will have their own decryption keys too. The forum can exist in one or two forms/versions: the offline and online forms. I remember Gmail existing in similar manner (offline/online Gmail) with the offline one use for composing, sending email (and for other uses) offline, which later synced probably with the online version, with the latest state of the owner's account updated. For example, if an owner sends mail with the online version, the offline gmail will be updated to the latest \"sent message\" when the owner connects it to the internet... and vise-versa . Unfortunately, this Gmail method is still centralized, as users can only have copies of their own data rather than the whole Gmail data encrypted and saved in holders devices. With my method, any Bitcointalk members should be able to hold the full forum data in very secured manner.. It should be impossible for the holders to access people private data more like the Bitcoin system and Blockchain. This would also make forum moderation decentralized, open, community-based, transparent etc. With this method, members can rank up automatically to become moderators, moderators ranked up to become higher mods. Higher ranks will automatically get higher moderators access. And moderators should be ranked based on merit. I have developed and discussed a merit-based ranking system that's fraud-proof/fool-proof ... it can only rank up reputable moderators/members. Incase you are interested, let me know and I will share it here.I guess the \"Gmail offline\" is available for both PC and Android devices assuming it's still in use. The forum offline version could exist in similar manner mostly for the sake of flexibility. You could either download the forum on your laptop/pc or on your android (or other mobile operating systems) devices. You may move this post to the  right section if this is not the right place to post it.Post Edit History:Last edited:  10:38am GMT, Nov 7 2022Post before the edit can be found here: https://archive.ph/sdklz",

If this forum works like telegram, it does not mean it is still safe as long you have to still send posts online. PMs and anything you want to send on this forum with data, you have to go online. This forum do not nead any app for now, what matters most that members are demanding for is the new forum software, maybe it is going to come with apps or not.Quote from: Ucy on November 07, 2022, 10:11:55 AMI guess the \"Gmail offline\" is available for both PC and Android devices assuming it's still in use.

You want people to also pay before they can be able to make use of the offline version? It is not an easy work, it will cost than you think.I am perfectly fine with how this forum is.",

So far the forums have been great and there's no need for changes that can look like wild social media.This is indeed a Bitcoin forum and as we all know that Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, it is not necessary for this forum to be decentralized.

A place like a forum which is subject to tens of thousands of spam posts every week, probably isn't the best place to have a popularity contest for moderators or ones that have simply been here the longest. That's not how you get a system that keeps itself in check. Decentralisation is brilliant, but only when correctly implemented into something that actually works better decentralised. For a currency that makes absolutely perfect sense. Potentially for holding certain records via the blockchain, that aren't data sensitive it makes perfect sense, but a forum it doesn't, and the moderator selection issue is only part of the problem. Very likely, users would've stopped using the forum before this issue even became apparent.",

It would be filled with spam posters if we think of going decentralised and it's not at all good idea with complete delegation of powers.But yes we still enjoy the freedom of posting and share ideas with each other like the open discussion forum but why you want more freedom? As a member I feel free to write and see any board and mods are doing their job unless you make any mistake you don't need to worry but @OP idea doesn't seems to please me as well because we have seen that part which he is ignoring but see this is still freedom that you can share your opinions in the meta about what changes you want or forum related discussion but this doesn't imply all will get accepted.",

Downloading all posts from a forum will easily fill tens of gigabytes, and it grows continuously.Satoshi isn't around, so giving Satoshi access to any data won't work.Gmail is a bad example: any POP3 email client used to have all emails available offline.

Because you are obviously not an engineer and cannot code. And because the blockchain is not a magic wand that makes everything possible.
