Some places might download backup files as json.aes or aes.json (which are json files encrypted with your password - didnyou input one?).

The keystore is nothing but your wallet keys encrypted with your password. You can use it to restore your wallet anytime as long as you have the password to decrypt it.The most important thing now is to be sure the wallet you are using is legit and you downloaded it from its official website.",

If you want to make sure that your wallet is safe then run it on a PC with no internet connection and never connect it online after that generate a wallet seed and JSON file backup.Save them to any storage that is never connected to the internet for safety purposes. Don't worry about JSON file if you added a password recently when generating a wallet it should be encrypted but if someone stole it they have a chance to brute force the wallet.So offline wallet or cold storage wallet would be the best and most secure for any online attacks.",

As far as I know, there are such things as your backup file for recovery in case you misplace the copy of your 12 seed phrase. It is better that you perform a scan with your updated anti-virus to allay your fears in case your device is infected.",

For example, with Myetherwallet, you can have different formats for backup as well as access your wallet: Keystore file, Mnemonic seed phrase, Private key and more.One of most important things in crypto areLearn how to and practice to back up your walletTest that backup's utility (sometimes you will make a unusable backup by typos when writing down seed phrase, etc.If you can use your backup to import that wallet (same as when you need to recover it) successfully, you can use it to store your coinIf you follow these steps, you will never feel panic that you lose access to your wallet by forgetting password, don't have usable backup",

If it is, you can open it via notepad or any text editor you have to see what it contains. AFAIK .json file are not a virus and not an executable file that will put a malware on your computer without your consent. Writing down a recovery seed also has some risk because there is a possibility that you will misplace it or someone in your house might throw it away so keep it properly and make multiple copies of it.",

      "body": "I think Vvang wanted to store their seed only on a piece of paper but their Wallet downloaded a JSON file and now they are worried their wallet could be compromised due to the JSON being digitally stored.Vvang, I suggest you create a new wallet with Electrum or Bitcoin Core and move your coins to it.  I am not aware of any non custodial Wallet that generates JSON's automatically and I strongly recommend using a non custodial wallet to avoid unnecessary problems like your funds being frozen.  Anyway, back to your JSON file.  I had one before and when I lost my wallet, I tried using the JSON file as recovery but it was encrypted so I had some trouble getting to my coins.  Did you encrypt it with a strong password when creating your wallet?  If so, chances are your wallet is secure since even if someone gets to steal it, they will have to crack the password before accessing your coins.Electrum and Bitcoin Core are available on multiple platforms and they do not download any JSON in your computer.  But, they will generate a 'wallet.dat' file instead that you can find in your AppData folder if you are on Windows.  You will want to encrypt your Wallet with a strong, random password and maybe even use a seed passphrase if you want extra layers of security in order to avoid negative events such as your .dat file being stolen together with your coins by some malware.Or, get yourself a Trezor and use a Passphrase with it.  It is the safest option long term and there is no digital storage of any sensitive information about your wallet.-Regards,PrivacyG",

Unless you downloaded something that contains malware from an untrusted network, you should be fine.Just to be safe, you can post the wallet link for users to check if the file you downloaded is free from any malware/viruses.

Since you said that your Windows OS was still very new at that time, we can assume that you did not have any malware on your computer that could steal the data contained in the json file. Did you use any kind of antivirus at that time? Most relevant antiviruses will successfully detect and block trojans, keyloggers and similar attacks. For absolute safety, I recommend creating a new wallet, writing down a new recovery seed, and saving it in a safe place offline, then transferring all funds from the old wallet to the new wallet.",

I do not think that there are any embellishments needed, as in our forum. The site justifies its paramount importance. For example, the Electrum wallet download site also offers software downloads.
