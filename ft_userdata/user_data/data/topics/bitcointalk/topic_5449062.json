Hmmm, First of all, bro this question is not belonging to this section, anyway it's Bitcoin-related so I will put my words on your query. There is nothing permanent in the market as today the market is highly bullish and seems like its hard to touch again the bottom of $20K but you never know about tomorrow so my suggestion is even if Bitcoin is Bullish or BEarish you should need to focus on the accumulation and its possible to achieve highly efficient accumulation with the DCA.Any other approach in the current market condition can be more risky so my recommendation is go for BTC rather then asking for the others opinion on the pricing because if you really know what BTC is then go for it and Start your DCA",

I don't think that Bitcoin price will drop below 20K anytime soon. Everything is in favor of Bitcoin right now, and some people even predicted a way higher price range for bitcoin in this bull run. But, investing in it is your own decision, it can still drop back to 25k, or it can also reach 35k. If your intention is to hold it for long period then investing in it now is a good thing, but if you want to earn some profit at 35k range then you can wait for a drop in it's price but that's unlikely to happen. I believe that Bitcoin will reach 35-37k range in coming months and it can even cross those price ranges. But, still I recommend you to do your own research before investing in it.",

However, when Bitcoin was hovering around $16K, you did not feel comfortable purchasing it. Perhaps you believed that Bitcoin would experience further declines before you could accumulate it. It is likely that many others are also anticipating a similar dip. Nonetheless, it is uncertain whether or not this will occur. As a result, there is never a wrong time to invest in Bitcoin. You must simply calculate how you can profit from the market's volatility.. But we don't know this will happen or not. So yes, always right time to buy Bitcoin, there is no wrong time. Just make your own calculation how could you make profits from the volatility.",

The all-time high tends to pull back to the previous all-time high, sometimes breaking it but not by more than 8%.In this cycle it has already regressed and even broke it in the month of NOVEMBER 2022.This means that it is very unlikely that you will visit that area again. I say this because in previous cycles he did not visit her more than once.The halving is already close, in approximately 12 months.The halving is always indicative of an upcoming bullfight.What do I expect? Buy bitcoin and wait for its new maximumHow long am I willing to wait? Until 2025 to make my profit.In the same way, it is not an investment advice, it only gave him, owning bitcoin is always a profit, not only monetary, but also in educational, computational terms and in the art of waiting.

The time for a good entry has passed. There is no fear in the cryptocurrency market now - people earn in giveaways, retrodrops, etc. The price of 30k is quite high. And it is necessary to enter the market at the bottom. I think it will be possible if bitcoin becomes less than 23k in price. This is the forecast for the medium term. It is better to do those analysis for several years and look based on it.",

I think we don't have to wait for the BTC price to drop anymore before we invest in it because I think we are lucky that the price is still below $40k by this time even as we are expecting halving by next year 2024; waiting for any price dump to me is waste of time because $30k is a normal price to invest in BTC compare to its initial All-Time High of $69k.",

When bitcoin price is down, people don’t seem to be interested but at every slight increase in bitcoin price, newbies suddenly are interested in buying bitcoins. It’s recommended that you buy bitcoin at the bottom, but what’s the bottom? In my opinion, there is never a bad time to buy bitcoin, it only depends on how long you plan on hodling. If you have a 10 year plan and you buy bitcoin at the current price you will still be in profit in the long term.",

You've watched too much of those youtube traders who don't know shit. They're the same people who were waiting for $1k bitcoin in 2019 and now are waiting for $12k. Some people are just permabears, you can't reason with them. They wanted bitcoin to go to 12k in 2022 and made fools of themselves, so they're doubling down on it.  It's a normal sign of every transition that a group of people gets wasted by the price action and stays in their imaginary world. In 2021 there were people who were screaming that we'd go to 100k and were buying bitcoin at 65k. The same people were telling us that a drop from the ATH in 2021 is nothing and the price is going to keep going up. Just read this:\"One of the crypto world’s most vocal bulls has predicted that Bitcoin will be worth between $250,000 and $400,000 by March 2022 — with Ether surging to unprecedented highs of $20,000.Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund executive at Goldman Sachs who now runs RealVision, told the Bankless podcast that he has now gone all in on cryptocurrencies.\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-price-will-be-between-250-000-and-400-000-by-march-raoul-pal-predicts\"The bitcoin price hit recent highs of $52,000 per bitcoin this week before crashing to around $42,000. The price of ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, came within touching distance of its all-time highs this week before falling back.Now, U.K.-based banking giant Standard Chartered has issued a bitcoin and ethereum price prediction sees the bitcoin price rise three-fold from its current levels with ethereum potentially rising by a factor of 10.\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/09/09/crypto-price-prediction-bitcoin-could-hit-100000-in-2021-but-this-bank-sees-ethereum-soaring-10-fold/?sh=6ef99dcf706eThese are all articles from 2021.

That is why it is difficult to time the market and predict when is the \"right\" time to invest. I would say it is important to have a long-term strategy in place and be prepared to weather the ups and downs of the market. Of course, there is always some degree of risk involved in investing. But with careful research and a long-term perspective, investing in Bitcoin can be a rewarding and exciting opportunity. It is certainly possible that the price could continue to rise and reach $40k or even higher.",

But in fact, the price of Bitcoin is getting stronger and currently reaches $30k.When the price of Bitcoin stabilizes at $30k and may continue to $40k, they argue to buy because the price is too high and hope Bitcoin goes down. The truth is that there is no wrong time to buy Bitcoin, it's just that you should enter at a price where people are starting to exit. Imagine if you buy at $15k you already have a lot of profit. it also depends on how the strategy you use and where the target price you will reach. Some people even bought at the last ATH price of $60k and may still be holding on to it today because they believe Bitcoin will strengthen again and reach a new ATH. Making purchases gradually as the price continues to fall is a good choice as long as you have money to spare. Therefore, management is very important.",
