His caustic comment follows recent regulatory actions taken by the SEC against major cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. The Congressman, who is well-known for his anti-crypto stance, took issue with the idea that cryptocurrencies could benefit the economy or consumers, stating that their primary use was to evade the U.S. government and sanctions.

It suggests that crypto will become an even more partisan issue.The document instructs Democrats in Congress to attack Republicans on multiple fronts. Including, on hammering them on the funding of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and backing Gary Gensler’s classification of “nearly” all crypto assets as securities. So yeah, in the next election majority might lose their seats in Congress if they continue with their attacks and hard line stance on crypto.As for the end, I doubt it, even US can't and won't stop it as this is the future. Just wait for the next bull run, and how huge it's going to be.",

In fact, for now there is no serious action, only nonsense.You have to read the whole thing to the end.QuoteSherman expressed skepticism at the high valuation of certain cryptocurrencies, arguing there was \"no logical reason why Bitcoin is more valuable than Hamster Coin or Cone Tribe Coin\". He suggested that the market's obsession with these digital currencies had drawn \"charlatans\", but predicted that crypto would \"fade because of crypto\".Sherman's attacks and criticisms, are more towards one type of crypto, namely Bitcoin, he is annoyed because Bitcoin's price is too high, I believe that if Bitcoin is currently in a price position like in 2010, there is no attack from Sherman, he buys as much as possible.Remember, crypto cannot be destroyed by one person or parliament, remember that.",

Prices and adoption of cryptocurrencies can be affected by government regulations, investor sentiment, and general economic conditions.Due to their fundamental properties and principles, such as decentralization and blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies are resilient and independent of centralized control even if certain actions by exchanges or regulatory bodies disrupt the market for a short time. So, the right way to stay informed about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market and to understand the risks associated with investing is to stay informed about the latest news. Investing in cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin is most effective when you diversify, manage risk, and maintain a long-term outlook.",

It could be challenging that this issue could lead to a price dump, just as people are saying it would. But dammit, nothing lasts for ever; it's just for some period of time (months or years, and everything will become history). There's an old saying here that goes, \"After rain, comes sun.\" which means Bitcoin will still bounce back after some time. The only way in which I feel crypto can be stopped is to stop the internet, which is not possible. As long as there is an internet connection, and blockchain technology still exists, crypto will continue to exist.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",

Especially in the Beginners & Help section, this seems off-topic to me.There will always be some who oppose the idea of Bitcoin, including some high-ranking officials. But that does not mean that the government is going to ban it. And even if they did, they wouldn't be able to do so immediately and completely. There would still be a lot of people who use Bitcoin, including those who do not care about what the government says or does.But here in the Beginners & Help section, we try to bring all those who are new to Bitcoin together, including those who may not have heard about it before and might be afraid of what they see or hear about it. So, I think it is best to move this topic out of the section and let us focus on helping newcomers with their questions.",
