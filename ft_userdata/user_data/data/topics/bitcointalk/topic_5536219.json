There is no such thing as quick money making process and they should by now know that people are out there to always brainwash them with sweet talk in order to lure them to invest in something they can get little referrals bonus from. They may not want to scam you but persuading you to believe in them is enough for them to achieve their aim. Bitcoin investment has its good and bad sides and it’s important that any aspiring investor should know very much about what they want to invest in, the risks involved and should also be well prepared to take on the risks involved in what they’re about to invest their money into. The volatile nature of the market is of great importance for every investor because that form one of the most important basis of whether an investor can really go on with their investment in bitcoin or not. Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, it requires patience and trust in the process.",

In norms, she supposed to make research before investing, but she was carried with sugar-coated words of making profit in bitcoin investment.",

When there is no guarantee, it means there is risk involved. That's what we should know: actually there will always be risk in any kind of investment. So Bitcoin investment also won't guarantee to make us rich anyway. But we are investing with a hope to make money. When I introduce Bitcoin to anybody, I explain how the price of Bitcoin works. I describe the potential risk besides the possible profits. Those who understand the reality, I prefer them to invest in Bitcoin. Otherwise, I don't influence them to invest in Bitcoin.

But because everything that involves investment has their own risks,  people tend to dive into which risk they can afford to bear. Same thing is applicable to Bitcoin and every other digital assets.I prefer lecturing people on the risk involved in Bitcoin investment than asking or persuading them to invest. I rather allow them make their choice afterwards. For good return on investment (ROI) Bitcoin doesn't smile much on low budgets. And the risk of falling for FUDs are always high for starters and newbies so I rather allow them do their own research.",

      "body": "Before reading through other user's reply, let me quickly make my contributions while I still know what to say. You see, the word \"investment\" has been termed to so many supposed financial opportunities, but there has been some exception when it comes to Bitcoin. When a real estate investor wants to talk others into investing in real estate, there is always a ground basis of long term investment. Same thing goes for other areas or things we can invest in, but Bitcoin has always been an exception. Truth is, this is clearly not Bitcoin or the community's fault, but it is as a result of wrong interpretation by most investors(I think the majority).And one other area that I think so many people might be getting it wrong is when your investment happens to be your source of living. I don't know about others, but to me, I believe that your investment should be your reserve, or backup. Just like how few exchanges uses the 1:1 reserve for backing up user funds(can't really remember the actual name). Truth is, there is risk in Bitcoin investment, but that risk reduces overtime. So, in a case where someone invest in Bitcoin for a short term, thinking that it will bring riches, will most likely end up being a disappointment. There is no logic to any of these, get something doing, invest in Bitcoin and make it your long term reserve.",

As we tell people about Bitcoin, they deserve to know the risks and possible losses that may happen from our mistakes. They must be aware of the possible things that may happen, not just by saying all positive. We are not just encouraging them to invest in Bitcoin but rather educating and helping them understand how it works. Sharing our stories and experiences could help them as well to decide whether they invest or not. We should know that this is not for everyone, but this is only for those who dare to take risks.",

You tell someone who’s financially drowning that Bitcoin is a life raft, and yeah, they’ll jump in headfirst, no life vest, no prep. But Bitcoin isn’t salvation. It’s self-reliance with code. You wanna invest? Cool. But first: can you hold your own keys? Do you understand halvings? Do you even know what “finite supply” implies for long-term economic behavior? If not, don’t press “buy”, press “pause.”We’re dealing with a generation that wants outcomes without process. But Bitcoin is process. And pain is part of that. You’ll hold through dips, question everything, and if you’re lucky (you’ll come out with more than just capital) you’ll come out with clarity. And that bar story? That’s not rare. It’s just louder now. So yeah, tell the whole truth. Bitcoin is freedom, yes. But freedom has a cost. Belief is cheap. Understanding is work.",

Bitcoin investment if been held over a long term has proven to be profitable with the coin able to give an investment at least 2x in four years period but this it’s self isn’t guaranteed because the market can be in bearish condition for a very long term too, so bitcoin investment isn’t more of a get rich scheme but actually more of a thing that saves your money from inflation affecting the fiat currency.
