      "body": "Should we say it is panic or rather this is done by traders or people using bitcoin as a means of payment method. With the bitcoin transaction high it will be costly using it for daily transactions. Some people then converts their bitcoins into stable coins or even fiats just for transactions and that’s is why the rate of selling off increases. With the transaction fee also having negative impact on the bitcoin price there traders that panic at very little dump and they sell off.I believe that one might be a little different because as the bitcoin grows in adoption so do People see the value of holding on to it for a longer time than just selling. Also with the bitcoin halving around which signifies the bull run many people will like to hold on to there bitcoin or even add more regardless of the price fluctuations it faces before then",

      "body": "While true that the two periods before with high transaction fees have been the beginning of a sell-off, this has previously been matched with transaction volume. Whereas right now the amount of BTC transacted on the network remains relatively low. This is why they say two instances can be a coincidence, it's only when there is a third reference point it becomes the start of a pattern.So while price has corrected so far from $31K down to $26K where the 200 Week MA is, I'm not expecting it to go below $20K or return to the lows personally.",

      "body": "Ok, I'm looking at similarities on your chart and here's what I see: We're at the tx cost levels from January 21. The cost rose, but the price rose with it. As you can see, fees went 2x from here in 2021 and the price per bitcoin did the same (30k-60k). Since you're concluding that after high fees there was always a dump, I feel like it's the bearish mood that's affecting your judgement. Do you think that if we ever go to 100k the fees will remain at current levels? More likely they will be at the 2021 high, if not higher. Without second layer solutions, when people see th BTC they used to buy in 2022 is 5 times more expensive, they'll be willing to pay at least twice the current fee to move it. High fees are probably here to stay and what ordinals did is just a taste of what's coming in the next bull market. We got high fees now, but we'd get them anyway in 2024.",

Some examples of their thinking:Last time the bitcoin bear market took 400 days, so we're going to be in a bear market for at least that long.In the last bull market bitcoin made 20x the former ATH so this time it's gong to do the same. Last time bitcoin lost 75% in the bear market so this time it will also do it.Type 2: This time is different.These guys contradict type 1 analysts by looking for things that can mess up their predictions.But this time we're in a recession.But this time we're also in a stock bear market.But there's a war in Ukraine.But this time bitcoin can't go 20x because there's too many altcoins that take away from the total market cap. In the last bear market there was no FTX.OP is obviously doing the type 1 kind of work.",

Then what after that? There's nothing we can do about it if ever it would happen or pushed through because there's no way on predicting on how it would be ending up.If we do have those sell off past then it could neither happen again or not.It would all be depending on the community because we know that it would be always the main factor on which it would be determined whether the price could hold up still into its positionor would really be that going negative.If ever the price would really be going below 25k then i would definitely say that this would be the best time on accumulating or would really be making some DCA,considering that this price is really just thatgood for you to enter. Halving is fast approaching and it would be more sensible and be more worth if you do make yourself enter on cheaper prices. You cant really make yourself that able to utilize these low price if you wont really be making such act.",

All significant supports were broken, so I would not be surprised if we see the previous bottom again. It reminds me a lot of 2019.",

Just thinking about what it is  I believe the major difference is the number of people in crypto as compared to before. That's true.Even if there's a pattern that we can refer to, we still have no guarantee that such trend will truly happen. And after like a couple of weeks, seems that the mempool is going down now with tx fees.So before another important event comes to btc market, we can always stash more if you think there will be good things that will happen eventually.",

So the fee spike was caused by ordinals, but people who are moving coins in/out of exchanges were probably contributing to the fee spike too, because for them 200-300 sat/byte is not really a lot if they can make thousands of dollars on arbitrage or from short-term flips.",

Gambling industry for example, the gamblers are switching to another currency because big amount of money are being wasted just for transaction fees instead of being used in their gambling habits.Where would we get the buying power, the demand, if they are gone? They will probably sell too especially those who are using it in daily basis. Ethereum had the same problem, and a lot of their buyers are also gone but it doesn't mean the fall will be for a long time.",

We've seen those conditions or situations in the past on which there's no way that we could be able to precisely tell on whats happening on the network but one things for sure that it doesnt really reflect out whether we are on a sell off or not. This time it is really just that having that Ordinal thing that had been injected which it causes out for the network to congest.We might able to make up some patterns and comparison back in the past but its not something that we could precisely tell that it is truly that penning as of this moment.Checking out om mempool.space as of this moment which the fees is already just sitting around 29sats/byte which came from high from 500 as i remember on previousdays which it is really indeed high.",
