  "content": "Hi therebeing GDPR compliance in EU privacy law [1] is going to make trouble with decentralized systems based on blockchain and all suggested solutions till now just could mitigate the scope of problem [2]. but it seems there could be a concrete solution that we need to discuss it first:Just talking about a new command in messaging protocol across peer-to-peer network of nodes, as a subset of \"reorg\" situation. in other words, when we are talking about Article 17 of the GDPR [3] - the right to erasure - when a user decides to be forgotten, in fact a very special fork is happening in the platform that calls the nodes they should \"reorg\". now if we label the new fork situation by command \"reorg_gdpr\", then our upgraded nodes should remove the targeted data under its mentioned hash value of an old tx, that exists as a new request in the mempool, and as you could see, nothing with the integrity of ex-blocks changes and the whole blockchain remains trusted in continue..however blockchains that contain numeric values and their balances (like bitcoin) need more jobs to do, but blockchains with general data could simply cover it. all you need is a request from the owner of an old tx value, that has the same sign (hold the same private key) and asks the nodes to run a \"reorg_gdpr\" command on a specific tx record. so we save the users \"reorg_gdpr\" request in new block and erase the data that belongs to its tx value in the targeted old block.any feedback welcome.[1] https://gdpr-info.eu/[2] https://cointelegraph.com/innovation-circle/zkp-could-help-resolve-blockchain-tensions-with-gdpr[3] https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/",

      "body": "See chapter 10 in the whitepaper: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfQuoteThe traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the \"tape\", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.That means, if you have a bank account, then you need to reveal personal data. However, when it comes to blockchains, there is no need for that in the first place. You have to reveal a random address, and nothing else behind that.Quotethen our upgraded nodes should remove the targeted data under its verified tx values that exists in the mempool, and as you could see, nothing with the integrity of ex-blocks changes and the whole blockchain remains trusted in continue1. If you want to change your transaction on mempool-level, then full-rbf is the way to go. It is already implemented in the latest 24.1 version.2. When it comes to removing data from confirmed blocks, then you should consider pruning.3. Removing data from full archival nodes is a backward-incompatible change, because then it will no longer be possible to do Initial Blockchain Download, because every transaction has to be fully verified.4. As pointed out in chapter 10 of the whitepaper, placing any personal data in a transaction is a misuse of the system. If you want to attach any data to your transaction, and have an option to remove it in the future, then you should use commitments, instead of putting your data on-chain.",

It is already implemented in the latest 24.1 version.True, working on GDPR in mempool-level is important. but as you see the article 17 is going to affect the whole blockchian from the genesis block to the last confirmed. so the question here is, when we should code our nodes to run the suggested \"reorg_gdpr\" command for old record on confirmed blocks? while the request is still in mempool or after write it down in the new block?Quote2.

All what you can do, is to remove data from your own node. You won't track all computers in the world that potentially could store some information, that should be removed. There could always be some of them outside EU, that will still store removed data, even if developers will introduce all changes you want. Also note that even if developers would do what you want, then it would be backward-incompatible, and then people could just stick with the old version. That means, the solution is not to remove the data, but to avoid putting personal details on-chain in the first place, if you need them to be removable in the future.",

It's not going to happen.this is exactly what I try to assess in this post. the possibility of removing a certain record without re-creating 50'000 blocks! the best way to understand it is work with examples:so imagine we have a blockchain that ONLY holds people's EMAIL address in its block's payload. and I've been an employee in organization X for the last 5 years but now I'm going to work in organization Y, so I have to change my email address in that blockchain and somehow for some unknown \"abuse-preventing\" reasons no body should see my previous email address anymore. in this case I could add my new address to the new incoming block, but have to remove the old one. therefore, this is not about change a record, this is totally impossible and need to re-create those 50'000 blocks as you mentioned above.as you could see a blockchian for emails doesn't need to verify user's balance and her historical transactions, so could simply remove the pure text under its hash on merkle tree. in this scenario, your blockchain just acts as a static repository - so no need to re-create all those 50'000 blocks before my old email address.but things could get more complex in blockchains like bitcoin that work with numeric data and their balances based on historical transactions to verify. in these types of blockchains using a ZKP layer to find a solution is inevitable - but I'm not going to discuss it in this post at all.",

GDPR is an old law that doesn't fit the reality behind new advances in technology and even breaks other rules like AML [1]. in other discussion with a good lawyer, have mentioned a subtle conflict among Article 16 of GDPR â Right to rectification - [2] and AML, because this section demands: \"the controller has to edit data without undue delay\", which means I could fabricate an identity, break the law and ask for rectification! at least blockchain never ever let you change anything and by removing data your fingerprint remains that one day you ask for removing something - on the historical blocks. so just offered there should be a 7-days of \"data preserve guaranty\" just like 7-days of \"money back guaranty\" we have in e-commerce! in other world, just think if we look better to the concept and behavior of the system, blockchains are more GDPR compliance than other centralized databases.

But in that case, you can just enable pruning, and stay with the original chain, without forking anything. So, why people want to fork Bitcoin, when no fork is needed to achieve their goals?Also, using pruning is easier, because this option is already implemented. And even if developers would release a version, where all nodes use pruning during IBD, then still, people can stick with the old version, so those transactions will never be removed.

There are only some unlikely cases where a problem could emerge (e.g. an European company which has to comply with GDPR storing personal information of a person on a blockchain - this company could get into serious trouble).However, I wanted to point out that there are already some blockchain models which enable a kind of \"right to be forgotten\". Perhaps the most prominent is the \"mini-blockchain scheme\" (Bruce, 2014) [1], where all old transactions which have been completely spent can be pruned. Compared to Bitcoin, however, it has however some additional attack vectors. There is also Ardor [2], which could be described as a \"partial\" mini-blockchain, as pruning is possible for sub-chains or child-chains, but not for the mainchain which should only contain financial, no personal data (Ardor has no scripting language which allows something like OP_RETURN or Ordinals).A third way could be the way Grin [3] operates. Grin stores data in a way only a few bytes per transaction could be used for arbitrary (like personal) data, and if you wanted to use these bytes to store data you'd have to publish a \"scheme\" somewhere else, and then the scheme would be the place where the personal data were stored. We have discussed this in the thread about Ordinals.[1] https://cryptonite.info/files/mbc-scheme-rev3.pdf[2] https://www.allcryptowhitepapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jelurida-ardor-Whitepaper.pdf[3] https://forum.grin.mw/t/ordinals-on-grin/10336",
