      "body": "For me i believe mavericks will win on the game 7 against suns and will advance to face warriors ,because on their previous game it's very clear that mavericks team has good chemistry compared to suns this season reasons they dominate the game 6. So no doubts that mavericks vc warriors is possible in the finals.",

      "body": "I think have the Warriors winning the WCF. They dominated the 1st and 2nd round as there was no game 7, and they are so clutch as a team. Though Memphis put a big lineup, the Warriors were still able to beat them with their good outside shooting and ball movement. So whether it's Suns or Dallas, Warriors will still win, That's my opinion.",

      "body": "Mavericks are doing their best to get into the WCF, it’s very unfortunate for Suns if they lose again on this conference without reaching the finals since last conference they are still the number one team but fell short. I’ll go for Mavericks on this since the momentum is with them and it will be more exciting to see Warriors vs Mavericks. Warriors have more time to prepare right now and hopefully, they can get the title again.",

      "body": "Mavericks game was good enough to face the other team for now. My predictions will be the mavericks going to win the game of 7. The chemistry of the players in the mavericks was huge as compared to most of the team, which includes the Sun. Warriors are the next extraordinary game in the tournament. So warriors and mavericks gonna rock the final will be huge interesting one.",

Warriors did a great job on their last game with a home court advantage, if they continue to play like that most probably they can get the Championship, Yeah, Warriors are already waiting for the winner of the Suns/Mavericks series, and we will find that out tomorrow. Odds are out early so people could start betting, and since no changes on the betting odds, most likely there are good action on both sides. Despite of the high spread and the result of game 6, Dallas still remained as an underdog in the last game, so let's see what would happen.

If Thompson will be more healthy, I'm pretty sure who ever wins with SUNS/MAVS they are more ready to face it. Warriors will take the championship again this may not look easy but the way they are playing right now, it looks like a whole team effort. Mavs is also a good player, but for this one I will go for the SUNS and give them a chance to enter in WCF again because they miss it last year and for sure they really want it right now.",

Thomspon and curry are carrying currently the team and they are the main key if they will even win NBA overall. They look so good that i dont see any team in the nba stopping them. Plus with poole and wiggins they look amazing",

Nevertheless they have players that can defend Booker. But let's wait for the outcome of the Suns vs Dallas first. This could be one of the biggest upset though, if Mavs wins tonight.Actually, in a Game 7 pressured game series, homecourt is just a slight advantage. I know both teams are winless playing against the crowd. Suns are dominant on their homecourt while Mavericks are likewise too. But that doesn't guarantee that Suns is an automatic winner.Another thing I want to happen is the big recognition for the Mavericks once they upset the strongest team in this season.It's been a while since the number 1 seed is being eliminated in the playoffs round.",

It's tough to defeat them on the last 2 quarters of the game because they're ramping up their defense and they're just tough to go around by then. We need some of that Luca magic for the Mavs to pull through, but whichever the result is, the Warriors can take them head-on with the way the three guys (Curry, Thompson, Poole) is playing right now.",

Cheer for your team now, what team do you think will be in the NBA Finals?As someone who has been cheering for GSW ever since 2016, my money is with them throughout this palyoff run!I really think that Warriors has the capability of winning this playoffs given the nature of their experiences, individual skillset, group chemistry, and great shooting. While Curry may be somehow inconsistent in this run, with the return of Klay it somehow solidified their position as a contender for this playoffs. I just think that with the support Curry has with the surrounding talent he got with his teammates, and Wiggins getting consistent, GSW has the potential of winning!",
