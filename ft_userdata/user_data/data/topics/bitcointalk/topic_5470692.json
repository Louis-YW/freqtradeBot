  "content": "Recently, I came across Hodlie, an intersting and new platform where AI digs into BTC trading to offer insights for making better trading decisions. The idea is pretty solid, and I found myself delving into it.Before you dive in, you'd need a Binance wallet. If you've got one, you're ok. If not, no sweat, you can sign up for one or try Hodlie through a Virtual Wallet for a simulated experience as they're working on integrating other exchanges.The setup is a breeze. Just head over to the WALLET page and link your Binance wallet using the API-Key. It’s safe and secure – Hodlie can place orders but can't touch your assets. If you switch to Pro, you can enjoy a 30-day free trial to test the waters. The cost afterward is pretty decent too – €4.99/month for a yearly subscription or €7.49/month if you go monthly. Creating and launching your bot is a cakewalk. There are three bots to choose from:Deep Scalper - A quick mover, capitalizing on market inefficiencies.Grizzly - Plays the long game, minimizing risks during bear markets.Dynamo - Learns on the go and swiftly adapts to stay efficient short-term.Pick a bot, allocate your amount, select your currencies, and you’re off to the races!You can monitor your bot’s antics from the dashboard or dive deeper into each bot's performance. And remember, good things take time.I’m enjoying the ride with Hodlie and if you fancy joining me, here’s my referral link. https://app.hodlie.finance/signup?ref=RLPAVD31BWe both score some perks with your signup. Transparency is key, and I appreciate a platform that rewards for spreading the word if one is happy to use it.Currently I'm working only with the virtual wallet, and I would like to get other opinion before investing real BTC.Thanks CrazyPS: As reported by different users you have to pay attention to protect the access to the app and to your api key and secret. Even if the API cannot reclaim or move money, it can generate orders on Binance with the potential risks that you can lose everything !",

I myself have read about Hodlie only recently in the news, it was intensively promoted especially in Italy (where the developers come from as far as I know): Hodlie changes the face of crypto trading: the project founded by 3 LiguriansPersonally, however, I think very little of automated bots, especially when the buzzword \"AI\" is used immediately. Despite AI, these bots can't do magic either and can only analyze the past at most. The biggest disadvantage is therefore that the bot cannot react to news/market sentiment/... because it simply lacks the information to do so. However, it is always worth a try with virtual BTC and it is certainly fun. I would use my precious BTC at most in play money amount, just with the certainty that the money is most likely gone. In whatever form.",

This is a basic marketing strategy for a service like this. I've seen at least three projects in the last few months that require API access say the same thing, but can't completely convince me that they can secure the API data. I'd advise people to be cautious if a centralized service requires your API key, especially if an open-source trading tool becomes freely available.Btw, OP just woke up from a long period of inactivity, his last post was in 2018, and then he made a promotional post with a referral link like this. Anyone should be aware about that issue before they try the service. Better to be safe than sorry.",

When creating an API key on binance, you can protect it with an IP address, so that binance will not accept orders from others even if they have an API key. The problem is that its not bulletproof in this case if the bot is not open source, because it is enough that it is programmed in its code to launch an attack on day X at time Y on trading pair xxx/BTC and, using your machine and your API address, it sends an order to binance using your API key. My point is that when using this bot you have to TRUST and BELIEVE that you won't be robbed because they have tools for it (unless the bot is open source and you have checked every function)",

Others will come, but there is no ETAThen what does this mean:Quote from: crazy72 on October 17, 2023, 02:23:54 PM-cut-Pick a bot, allocate your amount, select your currencies, and you’re off to the races!-cut-Quote from: crazy72 on October 19, 2023, 05:39:43 PM4) NoThis option be only reason why i would be interested, but they already blew it with their answers, so i wouldn't use it even if it had that option.[/quote]I've just studied PSPO and this is what I'm expecting of a new product. Frequent releases, frequent failures to better define and have a good product. I'm testing it, and I'm testing it now. I don't want to wait for 2 years until all the features are in place.  For sure you are a skilled and expert user. This product seems to be not for you effectively. I don't have time, so I need something automatic to contain the loss and let it run when necessary. I will report my experience in one month or more. For the moment the results are not reliable because the bots got already +12% in 6 days.",

      "body": "I actually hate the concept of bought trading and when people add AI to it, it becomes more suspicious to me. I know AI is a great thing but is it yet capable enough to give out accurate results? Let's keep that AI and bot stuff to the side. The more concerning part of this is the API key. Binance is a centralized platform itself, and giving its API key to another centralized platform is not appealing to me. They can claim whatever they want. Can't touch your assets, can't move your funds blah blah blah.... But what's going inside no one knows except for the owners. I only approve of trading bot if you have created it yourself. Using centralized or something that has been created by someone else should not be the top priority when it comes to trading. You are dealing with money and you are okay with giving it access to other people? Not me! I will never do that. I have saved this multiple times in some of my previous posts. I will say this again for you. If you are trading with bot, you will rely on them. You will become dependent on them. So imagine a time when those are not around and totally gone. You will be left with nothing. No knowledge no experience. You will not know how the market works and how you should trade. What happens then? My suggestion is, do it on your own, gain the knowledge and experience so that you can continue to trade and become a better trader in the future. Or else you will have to learn everything from the ground up and that could be a time-consuming thing. Better to start it early and not to rely on others.",
