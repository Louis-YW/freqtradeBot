People need to be aware that you don't need to connect or input your phrase to any type of website or something. The steps are quite convincing TBH.That usually happens when the hackers/scammers have a bot pointed at a specific or multiple discord servers. Mostly it's not even the fault of those servers, hackers are simply targeting them. So basically what happens is, the bots are pointed to target the newcomers in the server. So when you join it, their \"verification bot\" DMs you, which certainly is FAKE. It asks you to verify by captcha and stuff, just to make it look legit and it shares a link as well I think, which no one should click without proper verification. Once that link is clicked, the metamask wallet opens and asks them to approve the application and once the user does that, BAM, their wallet gets hacked. It's as simple as that for those scammers. They don't care what a person goes through because of their actions. Recently I myself have been a target of some hacker group and lost 3+ BTC and other assets. I still get sad because of it... So please make sure not to click on scammy links and always store your crypto in a Hardware wallet. Thanks for reading. Stay safe.",

I don't think approving would be able to hack the wallet but inputting your secret phrase would make it vulnerable to attacks for sure. Just be careful with that. Those hackers are expected to not care at all about the users that they are attacking. As long as their benefit from it, they wouldn't care at all.Quote from: vv181 on October 11, 2022, 11:53:04 AMThis is a new insight for me, seems scamming scheme does keep evolving on Discord. @crwth, do you mind if you share the particular Discord server that you experienced regarding this issue or any server that you any aware of?

I do get an invite to many scam groups though. It seems like Discord is really not that different from Telegram if we're talking about scammers' modus operandi.If you are in multiple groups like signal groups or something. You would receive unsolicited DMs from bots saying that you have won X amount of ETH or BTC. That's the usual thing that scammers do or something.

Quote from: lobo13hf on October 13, 2022, 11:31:33 PMlol thank you for this information. I just know that if hacker is starting to create scam bot to be used on discord as well. Shit this gonna be a problem for discord to remove such bot. Asking for recovery phrase and password have become a red flag if that discord server has been infected by scam bot. The creator is a scammer. im sure about this. The verification is having a purpose to confirm if you're not bot but not for asking that our wallet, password or even phrase. Be careful what you browse and see. Never give out recovery phrases etc.",

I didn't clicked I dont want to risk my device to get compromised but I am curious to know more about that website.That's what I experienced. Upon checking of the bot recently, I see that it was banned already and it's really not an official one. It's really somewhat of a close replica of something that would ask for your connection or something to your wallet. It's really something that would be convincing to others that might not be familiar with those kinds of things yet.Quote from: malcovi2 on October 17, 2022, 03:18:54 AMscammers and hackers are ruining discord and it might turn into telegram where its infested with tons of bots.I know. It's really annoying with all the DMs that you would receive and all the *Contests* that you have won. Probably everyone has won that's worth 0.41923952 BTC or some shit like that lol.
