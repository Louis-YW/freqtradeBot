Even though the CBDC will be recognized and accepted world wide but the control of CBDC will still be in the hand of the government/banks. They can print any number of digital coins and it will not be a hedge against bitcoin.Yes, people may keep their wealth in CBDC's and not in the currently used stable coins like USDT or USDC But we need to know how much CBDC is centralized. People usually save taxes while having their wealth in tether, don't know why they will keep their money in government issued stable coins.",

      "body": "@VirasogNope! It's not a good idea for commoners like us! CBDC will take away whatever little anonymity we still enjoy with fiat money. Also CBDC is not an investment or anything similar to crypto stablecoins. So people who are parking their surplus funds in stablecoins, are highly unlikely to move out of that comfort zone to CBDC which is strictly regulated by government.",

Let's not forget that USDT is not really decentralized and can still be frozen by Tether at anytime even if it's stored in you non-custodial wallet. USDT or USDC can be frozen by the authors of the smart contract, but they cannot regulate your spending and tell you how many tokens you can spend per week or month. And the functionality of the CBDC allows the central bank to set any spending limits and in the future will be able to regulate the types of goods that are allowed to be bought.",

It looks now as if every country has started a race to create their CBDC and popularize it. China and India have already done it and now US as well. I don't really understand the point of this, if the government will eventually control the whole supply and demand of this currency what's point having a different name for it. It's been so much time India has launched their CbdC haven't met a single person using it.",

Let's not forget that USDT is not really decentralized and can still be frozen by Tether at anytime even if it's stored in you non-custodial wallet. I am talking in terms of taxes. If you put all your stable coins in government issued CBDC, government can easily know if you are paying tax on them or not. Many people haven't declared their crypto assets to the government and when suddenly they transfer their wealth in CBDC, it will raise questions as to where this wealth came from and why it was kept hidden for all those years.Yes, moving forward if you have fiat money and you want to convert it into digital currency, it is far better to use CBDC than the tether. Also, when every country has their own CBDC, the role of paper money will be limited.",
