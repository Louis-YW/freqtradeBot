The way I see it, the Trust System is decentralized for people using the forum.  Each user can change their own trust lists however they want, adding or removing members as they please and  this shapes how they view trust feedback on their end.  But zooming out to look at everything you could say parts of it are still kinda centralized.  There's central authority that can boot members from DT1, although they still have the right to vote.  Quote from: Bitcoin SV on November 30, 2023, 11:42:14 AMHow can decentralized decision making be instantaneous? Only a centralized decision can be so instantaneousThat is not correct. The Bitcoin system is decentralized and operates on a consensus mechanism, allowing for near-instantaneous decision-making. This decision-making process occurs approximately every ten minutes, resulting in block confirmations and subsequent updates to the Bitcoin ledger.",

I want to say that Ratimov was treated unfairlyWhile the Bitcointalk trust system may appear to act swiftly, its efficiency doesn’t necessarily undermine decentralization. Instant actions can result from automated processes or a well-designed decentralized consensus mechanism. And for the matter of fact the negative reviews could stem from genuine concerns, and the absence of positive reviews might reflect the community’s standards rather than a coordinated attack. It’s crucial to consider the broader context and mechanisms in place to appreciate the decentralized nature of the trust system.Yes I agree that true decentralization involves a balance of perspectives, and the current situation raises questions about the fairness and impartiality but at the same time silence from other party and zero justification or no explanation whatsoever (about his questionable actions) will automatically produce baised results.So you can’t really blame the trust system specially in this particular case.Edit:Apologies for going off-topic, but I have a quick question.Are you associated with \"Bitcoin SV\"? Or you are the Bitcoin SV?",

Because the gang frowns upon such actions, therefore nobody risks their reputation to stand on the right side, that makes the whole system vulnerable.
