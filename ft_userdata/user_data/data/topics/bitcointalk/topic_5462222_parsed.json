Installing and still worrying about getting scammed would likely get you hacked/scammed in the first place if it's fake. You can be infected by doing that.Don't think about it too much. If you believe that you can earn at it, do it. Just make sure you are risking a capital that you can risk.Copy trading is the easy route. I would prefer to study on my own and make my own decisions.",

I believe that it is always better to trade on your own especially if you are trying to improve your skills but yeah there are people who only want to gain profit as easy as they can that's why they rely on copy trading. It's an easy path honestly but yeah the return is not that good sometimes especially if the trader you choose is not performing well, you will lose on either fees or lose on the performance on the trader you choose.",

I really give no importance to copy trading and I would also recommend to avoid it as any cost. A copy trader is worse than someone who losses 10 out 20 trades because that trader at least know that what he/she is doing. If someone does copy trading then that person is throwing his money into river in hopes of getting higher amount then the thrown amount. I would recommend you once again to avoid this type of activity if you don't want to get scammed by the fake trades of a trader.",

You are blindly following a trader whom you don't know and who don't know you and don't even know about your financial stability. A very inappropriate match or you can say combination which can be deadly for your portfolio.This is a general view there are a lot of demerits of copy trading which is annoying as it doesn't guarantee any profits even if you get profits there can be terms on every trade you follow. A very tightly restricted medium for your portfolio to play in the market. Obviously, I do support following the analysis of others in your trades, to educate yourself and learn about trade management and some sentiments as well.I really don't think buddy this topic need a discussion because if you really want to learn something you dig in past topics where can find more valuable insights.",

There are scam and to be free from it is not to bring it close to your phone. As for copy trading, the reason for that is when someone wants to be a trader yet they don't want to learn. My advise is learn and make your mistakes then you can be better.",

I've tried using several copy trading apps and picked the most trusted traders with a large following. It may be profitable in the beginning, but it also depends on how you manage your capital. I keep the management to a minimum so that I know how it will perform after a few days of using it. It does give pretty good results without requiring thinking from our own brains. But be careful because every platform comes with risks.A really good suggestion is to learn first how trading works and what you need to know.If you only rely on copy trading and do not understand the whole of trading, then it will be very risky.",

But from what I know about its trading, I think this copy trading system is a complete scam. Fraudsters usually do this to deceive. It is easier to depend on others than to learn something by yourself but it is never safe to depend on others. How can you trust someone you don't know or have no idea about? There is no need to rely on such trading systems, you should gain practical experience of trading yourself. If you try everything is possible, if you try you can definitely become a skilled trader but if you depend on others you will never learn trading so instead of relying on others depend on yourself.",

You can have the data of the trader you want to copy trade from his previous months performance and it's good to know some techniques to determine best trader before you pick.

It was quite a few years back though and while he didn't lose much (or earn much really), it didn't really prove as a learning experience for him. Accurate to the name itself, copy trading is a method of, well, copying others after all, and in this trade, you'd never see any profit no matter what if all you do is copy trade. While I won't judge you if that's what you want, then why bother copy-trading in the first place? This just gives you an outlet for venting when your trades are lost when in the first place you could've taken the time to study up and earn on what you learned instead. While it is one option for beginner traders (which I also considered as a good one, but that was in the past), it might be better to experience losing money early on instead and learning on what you did wrong and what you didn't know instead. Losing money is part of the process, so if you're not happy with that, I'd honestly just stop trying to trade (or just DCA on a good coin).",

It's better you learn how to trade yourself and try maybe getting a strategy into trading botsWell, I'm thinking of doing it for some time, but after sharing your own experience to it, I guess I will have doubts now as to me trying it or not.TBH, the first time that I saw this term \"copy-trading\" was in eToro where they are offering copy-trading so that you as a copy trader will just sit there while the ones you are copying will make successful trades for you. I mean isn't it like you are leeching in some ways because you aren't learning from it, but you have a chance of earning money. Well, I guess that it wasn't in your case because you loss money like you said after a long time, and I might experience the same as well, so I guess learning how to trade is always the best way, and not copy trading other experts out there.As for trading bots, may I ask if you already tried it? What is your experience to it? Did it make you money, or is it worth it? Thanks for sharing.",
