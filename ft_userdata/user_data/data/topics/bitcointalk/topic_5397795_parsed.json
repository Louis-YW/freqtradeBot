  "content": "Hello fellas. I know it's an old subject, but I've been trying and trying to find an answer but still nothing.HiveOS, rig with 8 of those 1660 Super (6 of them being Hynix, and 2 of them being Samsung) and one 3060TI LHR.Tried to flash the bios on the 1660s cards and HiveOS fails to boot. The flash is done correctly, but when I try to reboot I get a watchdog soft lock on boot error. I've tried to flash on a friend's rig with EVGA 1660s and everything went fine.I've scoured the internet looking for answers. The only thing I've found was a russian guy on a forum saying that the bios \"didn't work\" on his cards, same with me. nothing else.Has anyone been through this? Any help or ideas? I'm really out of luck here...Thank you.",
