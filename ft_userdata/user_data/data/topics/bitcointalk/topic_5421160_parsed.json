  "content": "This includes those who self-mod their threads to be able to delete comments made by others.... And possibly those who delete their own threads together with people's posts... I wonder if the latter is even possible, as I have noticed couple of times that threads can't be deleted after awhile.Why exactly I'm writing this you may ask, well because I prefer to have my posts immutable and the record preserved for the sake of posterity or just so that very valuable information is not deleted or even altered. Â If it becomes necessary to delete/change a post, we should atleast have a dublicate that is undeleted/unchanged. It could be archived, unpublished, push it somewhere anyone who is interested could access, push the deleted dublicate to the owner's inbox after one has been deleted, etc. Â From what I can tell, this forum handles much of deleted posts in similar manner. But how about threads? Are there sections they are sent to after they're deleted? I think there should be, assuming there aren't yet, so that those who have post they considered valuable can have them saved for the future use. I honestly don't believe in deleting posts without leaving their duplicate/copies behind. I think the only time I strongly considered deleting people's posts/comments was when I self-modereted couple of my threads, and I would have even archived deleted comments on sites I use for archiving posts/records, then post the links to the archived posts to my self-moderated threads for the future just incase they are needed by anyone for good purposes, like to investigate if the posts were justly deleted, if they of any use etc. Here are couple of things to know about posts that do not deserve to be wiped off record...they could be used to save lives, they could actually be great contents of historic values etc. Wiping them off records is akin to primitive tribes/people burning great books in the old days because they are afraid of the truth Â or don't want to be enlightened for good. Books that make societies better/good must never be destroyed. I'm sure everyone will agree with me that the destroyers of rare, good and very useful things like that deserve punishment. Well, I can guarantee you they are punished for the destruction whether by man or not. So, we should avoid wiping things that could be of great benefit to us/society off record so we don't get punished. I have had few of my posts deleted in the past...in one of the posts I spoke about \"post deletion\" ... It was probably deleted and later restored by a forum administrator then moved to Meta from off topic section, or maybe it was just straightly moved to meta (from off topic section) then I assumed it was deleted when I couldn't find it in the off-topic section...i later noticed it was in Meta section. If that post was deleted and later restored, I Â commend the one who restored it. I thought an admin with high privilege could have made that decision. I have noticed a superior admin made decision like that or atleast promised to restore post of a forum member who probably don't deserve having the post deleted. If you are reading, consider going through a post of mine that was deleted in off-topic. In it, I gave conditions to work with anyone... part of which include respect of my beliefs, like belief in a CREATOR of the whole Â Universe/existence and Mankind. my future coworkers was meant to know that with the CREATOR nothing is impossible... Atleast this will help him/her stay strong when hard-to-believe things begin to happen when we work together as team. To cut this short, the post may have eventually been deleted, probably last year or early this year. I looked for it to share it with someone I was discussing a project with when he started saying things that shouldn't be uttered about my CREATOR and my faith. It will be nice if the post is restored because I intended to use it as part of my Terms and conditions for working with anyone. It was probably deleted as I could not find it when I needed it. I will very much appreciate it if you consider preserving all deleted posts, assuming this is not done already. Maybe email them to their owners if you are worried about preserving garbage atall in your storage space.

It wasn't possible to bring it back though as posts had been wiped from the database and were inaccessible.",

No. Most archive sites do as you say but archive.org seems to function differently. Iirc it's attached to a US state library and tries to collect as much online information and as much literature/facts as they can.I had a quick look at 2015 and if you search for the snapshots they take of the forum you should be taken to the landing (/main) page where you can then browse the site as it loaded for them on that day.In case it needs to be said, don't try logging in as that feature won't work and it's an unnecessary risk.",

      "body": "Yeah UCY... I'm rightly your support.I don't see any essence in post deletion - most especially if it's a mega thread that conveyed an instruction/guide or rules pe-say. Alright...now I've learnt alot behind closed doors, without asking too much questions and that had been made possible with the help of Old threads; those autographs on black, fine prints from peeps i didn't even meet, that was left in here to keep telling their stories and rekindling the legacies after them; some of which had been plunge below the bowls of some bottomless abyss, beneath us all., Shouldn't be reprehended... THEY CAN'T TALK ANYMORE but those words would stand to attest for them and also, teach new toddlers what the forum ONCE was like.I'm not saying that mods shouldn't do away with some unwarranted/ absurd post( that's their jurisdiction and I see 'em as being imperative) but even the slightest, constructive fact (gimmick or not) should be Allowed to stand the test of time. ONE DAY, NEWBIES WILL LIVE TO GAIN PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE FROM MY HISTORY.Sandra ðŸ’‡",

Please stop constantly mentioning the creator and your religious beliefs, because it has nothing to do with the forum or Bitcoin. I don't know what religion you are, but in Christianity, mentioning God's name in vain is a sin and one of God's commandments. If you want to discuss the creator of the universe and similar things, limit yourself to Serious discussion, Off-topic or Politics and Society.",

I think it's because not much changes that much and it might be due to how big the forum is and how often the archive site feels it needs to be snapshotted.It's very likely there's a queue somewhere that lists how significant sites are (especially time wise) and perhaps a lot of news sites have started taking over as the main thing they consider worth archiving (would be my guess - especially considering the last two days saw about 300 snapshots a day of a Russian news organisation - maybe the number of snapshots relate to how popular they are too on the archive site).",

Deleting useless data makes the remaining data easier to find.Also, I think a lot of users might be underestimating how much space over time that useless data actually uses. Normally, system admins tend to prune even old databases, because of the storage it uses up. I think you've come across certain issues with archiving certain data from the forum. While an individual post doesn't take up all that much, chuck a few hundred thousand on it, and you're soon looking at issues. Anyone that's worked with data will know the limitations of software when opening up traditional text files that are over a certain size, and likely having to resort to using Vim etc.I guess I get to see the amount of work that goes on behind the scenes, but it only takes monitoring the modlog, and that isn't displaying all the actions being taken on a daily basis by a pretty decently sized moderation team.",

They always find there way off the forum.Replies definitely gets deleted and where it becomes questionable is in self moderation as, I practically don't need no reason to delete a comment. All it could take is, I don't want you posting in my thread and at that point, it doesnt matter how vital your comment might be or the amount of work you put in to its composure.Threads on the other hand are moderators job and a few might just be moved to there supposed board, others find themselves in off topic while, the others might just find there way out.

No one cares about your beliefs. Keep your beliefs to yourself or share them only in the sections where that is appropriate, like the Off-topic board, Politics & Society, etc. Most parts of this forum exist so we can discuss various topics related to bitcoin and crypto, not who created the universe.
