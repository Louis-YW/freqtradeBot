On the world map included, you can see the extent of the crypto adoption per each country. You can click on any country on the map to see the countries index score and rank. QuoteWhat is grassroots adoption of cryptocurrency? Think of it this way: We could easily rank countries by raw cryptocurrency transaction volume, which would give you a straightforward view of where the most cryptocurrency activity is happening. But that’s not what we’re interested in. The goal of our index is to measure where the most people are putting the biggest share of their money into cryptocurrency. While institutional activity is important to that, we also want to highlight the countries where individual, non-professional investors are embracing digital assets the most. You can read our methodology below to learn how we do that, then keep scrolling to see the top 20 of our index. You can also see where any country ranks using the interactive map above.Methodology used is based on five sub-indexes, 146 countries were ranked between scale of 0 to 1, the ranking from 0 which is the lowest score, to 1 which is the highest score. For the sub-index calculation, countries transaction volume for different services and protocols based on web traffic are estimated.

But this is how crypto market has been, there are both bull and bear periods, the bear would follow the bull but as the adoption slows down in bear time, it is still above the bull time. This has led to the over increase in crypto adoption since bitcoin was created.You can read the summary in details:https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/",

Bitcoin adoption thrives more in a friendly environment. So tax breaks on Bitcoin, for example, is a strong drive for adoption. Such supportive policies boost the people's confidence.

The Philippines has risen sharply in the rankings since 2021. The reason is known. It is especially popular there to make money with the help of cryptocurrencies, for example, through P2E applications, where you can earn much more than if you go to a regular job. Eastern European countries such as Ukraine are also rising in the rankings for obvious reasons, due to their difficult situation and hostilities. It is strange that South Africa did not make it into the top 20, despite the fact that this country has a fairly large increase in GSM transfers of bitcoin, without using the Internet.What a huge adoption for the Philippines and actually that rise is because of P2E games especially with Axie Infinity and that was the start that many gets interested to know more about cryptocurrency. It’s actually good to see my country on the top list and now our government is showing some interest to introduce cryptocurrency and educate more people about it. This is a good opportunity for the developing country, this helps a lot of many people. Anyway, I’ve heard some good news with African countries already and maybe they are still not on the list because data is not available yet, let’s see by next year if there’s a big improvements.",

With so much control of the very wealthy ones with Fiat and this rich guys relationship with the government making laws, tax evading and other means to keep enriching the already wealthy. Crypto-currency (Bitcoin) is a hope for the average man. So am not surprised that top of the list is packed with developing countries.Personally I see Nigeria climbing upward the list, and I can attribute the drop in positions due to the stands of the Nigerian government against crypto usage. Regardless citizens of Nigeria still believes in Nigeria and adopts it. With the general elections in Nigeria coming up and if the right person is selected, Nigeria can become a great force in crypto-currency.",

So this year, adoption from countries in the African continent should be much more than from China. like nigeria. although recently there was a ban there.for India I believe the country fits in 4th position because before there was an increase in crypto taxes in India. Of course we know from there that many good crypto projects have sprung up like Matic (polygon). and many other projects. and if we look at the indian crypto community in telegram groups. then it is true very much and continues to increase.although lately crypto transactions have decreased dramatically after the policy of the Indian government regarding the increase in crypto taxes.for China, if you look at it before there was a ban from the Chinese government, it is natural that China was in position 10. But after the ban there was a decline. but considering the Chinese population is indeed a lot. so I think it's still reasonable. but I still believe that there is more crypto adoption in Indonesia. I even now at work almost all of my friends talk about crypto. even artists in Indonesia have their own crypto projects. Even now universities and ministries are collaborating in Indonesia to build a crypto project about Metaverse University. even I hope my country can imitate Indonesia.but the data from the survey is sometimes not always the same from every survey agency.",

What kind of adaptation are they talking about then?Let us take China as an example. China banned crypto and crypto mining in 2021. Bitcoin mining hashrate in China went to 0 in July 2021. But now, China bitcoin mining hashrate as gone up to significant level again as I read about it in early days of this year. China banned bitcoin and bitcoin mining, but I do not see it surprising to see China among the top countries on the list, even now the second, after US which is the first. Taking the place of Kazakhstan, which was second after the ban, now the third. You can check Statista data about bitcoin mining hashrates here:https://www.statista.com/statistics/1200477/bitcoin-mining-by-country/Check what I read about this some months ago:China returns as 2nd top Bitcoin mining hub despite the crypto banIt was news, but according to what I have found out, the news was never a lie.Let us differentiate between implicit ban and total ban. Any ban that is related to the the arms of government not involved are just implicit ban. If the ban is not passed into law by the legislative arm of government (I am using my country as an example), that is not a total ban and the citizens still have right to buy and sell crypto individually, but not for businesses etc. Central Bank and Security Exchange Commission ban are all implicit ban, they can not stop citizens to totally stop the use of bitcoin or other crypto. Quote from: https://beincrypto.com/thai-crypto-ban-did-thailand-just-prohibit-cryptocurrencies/Thai crypto ban: Payments banned Even though Thailand is leading the world in the proportion of internet users owning cryptocurrencies (20.1% of Thais aged 16-64), the country's regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced that it has banned cryptocurrency payments for goods and services - starting on April 1st.Quote from: https://www.euronews.com/next/amp/2022/08/25/bitcoin-ban-these-are-the-countries-where-crypto-is-restricted-or-illegal2On 16 April 2021, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey issued a regulation banning the use of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, directly or indirectly, to pay for goods and services.Quote from: Rikafip on September 15, 2022, 08:19:29 PMAs you pointed out, our country has pretty good crypto laws and is one of the rare countries where you can go to a physical crypto exchange and buy/sell crypto without doing any KYC (up to a certain amount) + that you can also buy and sell crypto in our post offices, yet we are far behind countries that have completely opposite laws and where is much harder to do any crypto related thing. Same goes for our neighbor Slovenia that is ranked even lower while its probably ahead of us when it comes to crypto adoption and should have been much higher.Let us take Nigeria as an example, the Central Bank of Nigeria banned (implicit ban) the use of bitcoin and other crypto in the country, but it is the first country in Africa on the list. We that lives in Nigeria knew that Nigerians are so much involved in crypto trading and other usage because Nigerian Naira is declining at a higher rate and the inflation has so much more gotten worse. I think we should also take the methodology used into consideration.Nominal estimation is not used. Instead, purchase power parity is used. If the cryptocurrency value received at centralized exchanges, weighted by purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita, on-chain retail value received at centralized exchanges, weighted by PPP per capita, Peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trade volume, weighted by PPP per capita and number of internet users, on-chain cryptocurrency value received from DeFi protocols, weighted by PPP per capita and on-chain retail value received from DeFi protocols, weighted by PPP per capita are not estimated in PPP, but instead nominal, the result would be differ and likely be towards the direction you think your country should be.",

I've seen how American consumers get screwed over by endless fees and can only imagine what banks in some of these countries are able to charge - which had an even bigger impact when the customer has less money in local currency and overall earnings. At least the blockchain and crypto give the ability to keep driving down fees with new innovations, even if certain groups of miners will end up cornering most of the transaction fees eventually. It also helps people in these countries, which often have overseas family doing work, send money back without having to pay even more excessive international transfer fees that banks still charge.",

However, I think that we as a country are very unknown even in Europe in terms of how crypto-friendly we are, so you can often hear how countries like Germany, Portugal or Slovenia are favored in this sense, and no one mentions us. On the other hand, it may be an advantage to some extent - because we want to preserve some freedoms as long as possible, although I think that the loss of our national currency will have an impact on some things that we are used to.",
