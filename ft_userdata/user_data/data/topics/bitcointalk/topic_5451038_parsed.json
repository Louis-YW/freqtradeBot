Ie, halving no longer equals that bull market is coming. If that happens, then we need to adapt to it, I was thinking about that too, because the market will change at some point, it's not easily as predictable as it is now. Things will get mixed up and become more unpredictable as investors get smarter. But in the end, as long as the demand for bitcoin continues to increase while the supply cannot be replenished, I have nothing to worry about regarding the future bitcoin price. If the bull season doesn't come after the halving, we just have to wait patiently for a while, and everything will come.",

Ie, halving no longer equals that bull market is coming. 50 BTC each block times 788 040 blocks = 39 mln BTC - we would have such a supply of bitcoin today if there were no halvings. 19,5 mln BTC - current supply. It means that all 3 halvings together reduced current supply by half. so if we assume that the capitalization more or less corresponds to the amount of capital pumped into the project (project with fair coin distribution) and we assumed it to be a constant in the equation, then all the halvings we have had so far can only be responsible for doubling the price. Nothing more. 20x after first halving was not caused by halving. I still think people confuse correlation with causation.Especially now they pay too much attention to halving, when in real terms each subsequent halving is less important for the foundations of bitcoin.Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on October 27, 2022, 08:53:31 AM1st halving was important. It reduced monetary inflation from 25% to 12%. Thats a big deal. Second halving decreased monetary inflation from 9% to 4,5%. Now we are getting closer and closer to the 4th halving that will reduce bitcoin monetary inflation from like 1.5% to 0.7%. Both numbers are negligible compared to 8% official CPI in US, 10% in EU or 80% in countries like Turkey. So my bet is that halvings fundamental impact on bitcoin price is getting lower and lower with every next halving in oppose to macro data, FED decisions, interest rates, recessions etc. Bitcoin will be more like an asset that act sometimes like gold on steroids sometimes like sp500 on steroids rather than it will fallow \"bubble x days before each halving scheme\"",

I'm not sure that we'll see 20k again in 2020 (though it could happen), but I think that 10k+ is quite likely several months after the halving. Historically, the post-halving runup has happened some time after the halving, presumably after people started to really feel the reduced supply.My take: each halving, the supply reduction is less, which means it has a smaller effect on the price. But don't underestimate the power of expectation: if enough people expect something, it can still happen.My personal expectation (based on the price history, so no guarantees): we'll see a new ATH a year after the next halving.",

This set of people will always move the market during the halving period, even if nothing technically serious happens.",

Ie, halving no longer equals that bull market is coming. It's not important whether that chain of \"halving equates bull market\".It's only one fine line of perspective. There is a lot more dimension as to how price is trading. Yes, halving is a fundamental part of BTC and sets an outlook of bullish prices because it will affect the mining of BTC within the limited supply. It still lies down to the purpose and use of btc. As an asset and as a reserve currency. As long as people see Bitcoin, it will remain on the positive side.",

This smaller effect will still likely take btc to 2x-3x from current prices while in early halvings there would have more effect just because price was lower. Just like it's easy for coin to double from 1 satoshi to 2 than 10k to 20k.",

Ie, halving no longer equals that bull market is coming. I mean, it's still a reduction to the yearly supply, plus people entering the scene aren't exactly capped as of yet, even if we do consider that a lot has already been invested and know of Bitcoin, the same could be said for the other side who hasn't bought it yet. The matter of when can't really be answered since even if we know how much the rewards get reduced yearly, we don't have an exact number as to how many people go and leave the Bitcoin market. If you were to just solely base it on the rewards, then I'd say by the far end, which is stillÂ  decades away.",

The halving was one of the factors that helped drive bitcoin's new ATH, but it's not the only one. We still have many other factors to drive the growth of bitcoin such as supply and demand, government recognition of bitcoin...We still have many factors to expect bitcoin to create many new ATHs in the future.",

Well, if the chain gets broken, it doesn't mean Bitcoin will get broken; it doesn't even mean 1 bitcoin will be less than 1 bitcoin. Let me just take, for instance, the Christmas saying that \"faith is when you don't see it but believe it will happen,\" but I, as a Bitcoiner, believe in hope, and for a lot of us whose hope for Bitcoin is still high, it can still turn out to be that the bull market will still come due to other factors, even after the halving cycles have broken. Some other things, like good news, will still stand as a factor in whether a bull market will start, but if it's not so, then we have to get used to it. Perhaps Bitcoin was created to give individuals full control of their financial management.",

Both supply and demand will be affected by the halving, of course it could trigger a post halving tradition i.e. new ATH. But I agree that such an impact will lessen over time, it's just to prevent an easy pattern to predict when it will hit a new ATH.
