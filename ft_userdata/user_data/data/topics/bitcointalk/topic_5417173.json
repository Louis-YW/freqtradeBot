      "body": "I'm not going to take the risk of downloading a game app like @OP said because I'd rather use a virtual machine or my computer to download and play it. If there's something I don't know, it will be dangerous for my phone. It will confuse me to work it out. Apart from that, some casinos also offer the same thing, so I prefer that casino. Nowadays, Google Play does not protect users from malicious apps, so it is our job always to be careful to select the apps. But thank you @OP.",

I've been like that, and I have to reinstall my PC, because I can't uninstall the application.",
