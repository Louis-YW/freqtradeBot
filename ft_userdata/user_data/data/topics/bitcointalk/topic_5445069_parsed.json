They were mining, but for themselves, not for you, or any other person who had a contract with them. Mining contracts were there to allow them to borrow money in the form of low interest loans.",

Speaking of cloud mining, few months ago  Binance started its own cloud mining service[/url]. I haven't tried it though, but it would be kinda stupid to risk everything by running something like that. Then again, even smart and sucessfull people tend to do stupid things so this may very well be scam as well.",

They want to steal their customers’ capital completely, and they put these advantages only to entice potential users to fall into their malicious traps. Indeed, whoever will use cloud mining and believe their false promises is undoubtedly someone who has no experience and does not have an iota of reason. Bitcoin cloud mining is common and promoted by scammers because the victims do not have the ability to check the mining equipment used. They may undoubtedly promote nothingness, and we cannot prove what they have, so these massive profits are just a trap, and investors certainly won't get them at the end of the plan.",
