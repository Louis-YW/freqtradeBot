      "body": "In order to invest in altcoins, you need to identify for yourself the category of altcoins that you understand best. Before you do that, it's worth doing some research of your own. I would not recommend investing in altcoins that are not traded on major exchanges. Such projects have poor liquidity. Short-term investments in altcoins are only justified if you bought your coins on some token sale and the price of the coin increased a lot immediately after listing. If you buy coins at the market price, the efficiency of short-term investments in altcoins is very low.",

It used to be much easier back in the day but now anyone can make a useless token. 99% of tokens released right now are scams and will rug in a few minutes to a few hours.This means you can also just ape in and hope for the one that pops. Or you need to do a lot of research into the project and see if the token is actually real and will be used/supported in the future.",

This is a comprehensive platform that provides users with access to news and information about thousands of cryptocurrencies, including upcoming initial coin offerings (ICOs). This can be a valuable resource for investors who are looking to narrow down their search for potential investment opportunities. Additionally, investing in tokens that are listed on top-tier exchanges such as Bitget or Binance can be beneficial, as these assets typically have good liquidity, which is important for attracting investors and maintaining a stable market. When considering potential investments, it is also important to look for projects with real-world applications, such as ADreward, which offers marketing solutions. These types of projects are more likely to succeed and thrive in the market due to their tangible impact and utility.",

So if you are a beginner, you might only want short-term trading. The easiest way to do research is by sorting the coins by their market cap.So many coins can only come and go and a few can pump huge so hurrying up does actually matter. If we are late, we should not insist of push our selves on the coin who just pumped because there is a big chance that we will get trapped inside it. There are still plenty of fish in the sea so it's better to just move on the next potential one.A poor coin will look decent in the hands of a big exchange and there are people who scout them there so it won't run out of liquidity at first. New risky coins are only good for short-term HODLing. Only the risk is going to rise the longer you HODL them and not the reward. If we want a coin for the long-term, active old coins are the only way to go. This is also perfect for the beginners.",
