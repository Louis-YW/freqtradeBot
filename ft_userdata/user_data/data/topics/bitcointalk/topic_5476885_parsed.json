  "content": "Hello, I am a newbie fo this forum. I am a son of a poor family. My father was an employee of a government school. At that time my father's monthly income was $150. Our family had to survive for a month with this salary. My father was very old, then it was time for my father to retire, in that retirement he gave my father $1000 as retirement money. Two weeks after retirement my father unfortunately lost one of his legs in a road accident. At that time my family was very broken, after my father was admitted to the hospital he was treated with that retirement money. The doctor said my father will never be able to walk on two legs again. Since then my family started suffering. Father's retirement money was exhausted due to treatment. Due to lack of money, my family could not eat and drink properly and could not give my father proper medicine. Having no means, my mother started working in people's homes. My elder sister started tutoring to pursue her studies. And I started working in a motorcycle garage.  I had a wish that I would become a cryptocurrency investor i.e. I would earn money from cryptocurrency. For this I had no device i.e. no computer or mobile. So I give two-thirds of the money I get working in the motorcycle garage to my family and keep one for myself to buy a mobile. And finally I bought a mobile worth $100.  I am very interested in crypto currency, so as soon as I bought the mobile, I started looking everywhere. When I get home from work I search and research about cryptocurrencies all the time. And finally I found this forum. This is my very first post on this forum. I have a fair understanding of Cryptocurrencies and I have also done a lot of research on Bitcoin. I found that investing in Bitcoin long-term can make a lot of money. So my next target is to invest in Bitcoin. I will work in this motorcycle garage as before and give two thirds to the family and keep one for myself (to invest in bitcoins) as before.  Now that I am new to this forum, what should I do first in this forum? What is my first job on this forum? And how can I proceed to this forum? please tell me.I want to continue working on this forum with my best.",

Investing directly in Bitcoin might be heavy in your current situation; Bitcoin is more for the long term. However, during a bull run, there's potential for profit if approached wisely. Learning the fundamentals quickly is key. Once you grasp the basics, exploring Altcoins becomes an option. With some, you can start with a small investment and potentially gain larger profits, but be aware, they come with higher risks and volatility compared to Bitcoin. Take your time to understand before diving in.",

And as a newbie, you have a lot to learn to make it in this space. With the present situation of your family, I think investing all your savings in Bitcoin isn't a very nice idea. With your post, you are more dependant than others in the family for money, then what happens in case of any emergency and all savings has been invested on bitcoin? I think you should double your hustle. Get part of your savings for real life investment (visible business) that can give you instant profit and invest the remaining on Bitcoin for future use.",

Crypto won't change your life overnight, but it could. You have to learn and struggle to earn decent money. Then you may invest in Bitcoin to grow your capital.

We have had people that their stories isn't as bad as yours yet instead of them to look for what they'll do to elevate their situation, they keep begging and looking for favours. I most commend you and encourage you to continue living as there's hope for the living and no hope for the dead. Channel your energy into building a brand for yourself on the forum and you can use the forum as a platform to sell your skills and look for other crypto related jobs on the forum.The forum wasn't created as a job seeking platform so you need to remove that from you mind if you want to move forward but that doesn't mean you can't get one here. Before thinking about earning from the forum, build yourself and make your presence useful on the forum. When you're useful, your posts will be rewarded and your rank on the forum increases then you can apply for signature campaign or get more trust when you sell your skills as a newbie is less likely to be trusted irrespective of how well you know your skills but a higher rank give you some advantage.I'll love to see you grow here as we all deserve a second chance at life and I believe hanging around the forum with users of high intelligence in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general will help you a lot. It has helped some of us here and I look forward to see you celebrating the forum for its impact in your life like others.",

I will work in this motorcycle garage as before and give two thirds to the family and keep one for myself (to invest in bitcoins) as before.  I must have to tell you that investing in Bitcoin for long term is surely profitable but you won't make a lot of money by investing in Bitcoin. The current price of Bitcoin is already over $43k and if you start investing in Bitcoin $50 a month that would not make you rich or a millionaire by any means. I know that if you're looking to have a better future and want to be financially stable in future then Bitcoin investment will be very helpful but it won't make you a lot of money if you currently don't have a lot of money to invest in it. I would say that it's still better to invest in Bitcoin instead of depositing your money into a bank because the fiat is highly affected by inflation and that means your money will lose its value overtime, but if you invest that money into Bitcoin then you'll at least make some good returns if Bitcoin price reaches or crosses $1 Million per coin.Quote from: GIF-JOBS on December 07, 2023, 10:09:21 AMNow that I am new to this forum, what should I do first in this forum?

And how can I proceed to this forum? please tell me.I want to continue working on this forum with my best.I would recommend you to learn about Bitcoin in detail first as that's the most important thing you need to learn about. Your first job on this forum is to learn about Bitcoin and read as much about it as you possibly can. Once you learned enough about Bitcoin then you can create good threads or posts on the forum to help others or share your own opinion about Bitcoin which might be helpful for others. If you want to earn basically from the signature campaigns then you'll have to be at least a full member in rank and in order to reach full member rank you'll have to make good quality and helpful posts. The good posts will help you to earn some merits which are needed to rank up on the forum. You can begin learning about Bitcoin by reading posts in Bitcoin discussion board as that should be a good starting point. Best of luck!",

I read what you wrote and feel sad about your struggle but, that what is life is all about. You made the right decision to invest in Bitcoin and I am sure you know how to buy Bitcoin but, do you know how to store it safely? There is a child board which you can visit and take a look at. Wallet Software is the board where you can find recommended Bitcoin wallets and discussion about them, if you have any questions about wallets you can ask questions to get your answer.The forum was not created to earn money in general but if you have any online skill that you want to sell for Bitcoin then you can visit Services child board. Remember that you need to grow in rank if you want to be part of a Signature campaign or other Bounty campaign. To understand how the rank and merit system work you can refer to this thread by the admin, Merit & new rank requirements  The last thing you need to do is to stay active and by active I mean to respond to posts and ask questions on Bitcoin and crypto on their relevant board. Follow the rules and make new anonymous friends and you will grow in the forum gradually.",
