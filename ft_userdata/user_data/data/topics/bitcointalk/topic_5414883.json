  "content": "Introduction to Vkax NetworkVkax network is an experimental project and also a part of the vkax technology which is born out of the need to create easy mining algorithm that are user friendly and devoid of asic mining. It uses its own algorithm called ‘Mike’ a variant of ghostrider algorithm. It's a digital experimental project that enables instant, private payments to anyone at any time of the day with no limitations. Vkax technology also would power its own platform called the vkax platform where smart contract, Web3, NFT etc can be created. Vkax uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Vkax Core is the name of the open-source software which enables the use of this network to power all its technology. Vkax is a complete fork of Dash coin which uses Masternodes and other technology to secure its blockchainThis project is created to bridge the gap that other crypto have closed. It is born out of the need to create easy mining algorithm that are user friendly and devoid of asic mining. It uses its own algorithm called ‘Mike’ a variant of ghostrider algorithm to achieve such. It's fast, private and secure payments platform were Vkax is exchanged to anyone at any time of the day with no limitations. Vkax with its peer-to-peer technology operate no central authority like dash etc: managing transactions and issuing vkax are carried out collectively by the network. Vkax Core is the best in crypto transactions, and it is an open open source software. Vkax is a complete fork of Dash coin which uses Masternodes and other technology to secure its blockchain.Vkax Network is a community project, and it does not have any developer fees which other project have used to steal from their community. Vkax developer can simply propose for fees through the governance system were Masternodes votes on any proposal be it for development fees, the project developments etc. We do not just implement anything, but it is determined by the community through our voting system. This is totally decentralized Project with no greedy developmental fees. Our governance proposal fee is none refundable 400 Vkax which is burned in the system. MiningVkax uses the mike’s algorithm which is a variant of the ghostrider algorithm and uses a smooth difficulty processRewardInitially Mining of vkax gives out the sum of 10,000 VKAX which is still active, out of which 2,500 as of old goes to Masternode owners. This 10,000 VKAX would stay until height 1950005 and within that period subsidy at every block height 210240 would take place. After height 1950005 reward would fall back to 500 VKAX and so on. Currently, the reward for mining Vkax is 3000Vkax and 6000 Vkax for masternode.

It is a trojan!Pump&Dump! No future in this project.Are you able to show in the source code where the virus is? There is no dev fee in this project, the source code seems okay, From what I understand there was a mining pool that operated a shared masternode service and there was a mistake somehow and lost user funds. Around this same time geckocoin was identified as having a virus payload, (which only affected windows systems.)VKAX has been forked to a new repo and the windows wallet has been built using github actions. I am not a security expert but I feel pretty confident if there was a virus it was not distributed through the source code, something had to have been added in or someone made a security mistake to have their system compromised. Running what I suspect a shared masternode service on a windows machine using binaries available for download that you did not build yourself was probably not a great start. I have a belief that a coin is not the coins but the code, and VKAX is based on dash and bitcoin and is secured using asic resistant cpu mining. The loss of the shared masternode service, abandonment by the origonal dev and accusations of virus did not make VKAX a great start, but the code still works and can be changed. It provides an opportunity for those interested in learning about masternodes and dash to get started without spending thousands of dollars before they know what they are doing. as of now this project still has interest. I am attempting to provide development but realistically for severe updates we need more participants. There are tests I want to change (like some fixes ive identified) and this could be a great way for people to play around with code without feeling like they have to be apart of a severe project which is always trying to pump.",

Its really hard to tell who is responsible for what, its such a sophisticated attack. It makes me wonder if its a state level attack.I have forked the vkax repo and made a new website and explorer. All past coins are compatible still. The current windows wallet qt has been built using github actions, meaning its straight from the source code. I also included a simple two part copy and paste instructions on how to install VKAX on ubuntu and build it from source on the new github archive. https://github.com/vkaxcore/VKAXThe code is based on bitcoin, there is no dev fee! and its cpu mining and asic resistant. It still has some merits and traded on active exchanges. Anyone who runs a masternode is a voting member of the new team.",
