Where is your thread? have your accusations been proven?I didn't have any deal with TimtheYoutuber, so I can't vouch for him, but this is certainly not the way to slander someone's work. although your trust rating says everything about you, so say people without any moral standards are not worth much.",

If you are scammed, post all details on the proper board of this forum with all evidence. communication screenshots, a transaction that you really paid for his service (from the address signed by you).otherwise, you're just unnecessarily spamming here. no one will believe you because of your previous actions here.note: you klien_br don't have to answer me here anymore, I don't want further discussion and endless discussion. I showed you what to do, it's up to you.",
