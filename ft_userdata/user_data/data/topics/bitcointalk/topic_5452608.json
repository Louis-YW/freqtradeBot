  "content": "Is anyone surprised that a Republican politician with big balls and who is proud to stand up for what he thinks is the first to sign a law against CBDCs? Certainly not me. What would have surprised me is if he had been a Democrat.The other day I was listening to Ted Cruz talking about how Bitcoin is freedom and why Democrats hate Bitcoin, just like cash, because they are things they can't control and he sounded like a forum Bitcoin maximalist to me. Explaining that every Monday he buys Bitcon (DCA) etc. etc. etc. etc.But let's get down to business:Governor Ron DeSantis Signs First-in-the-Nation Legislation to Protect Against Government Surveillance of Personal FinancesQuote Today, Governor Ron DeSantis signed Senate Bill (SB) 7054 and SB 214 to protect the personal finances of Floridians from government overreach and woke corporate monitoring. SB 7054 prohibits the use of a federally adopted central bank digital currency (CBDC) by excluding it from the definition of money within Florida’s Uniform Commercial Code. Additionally, the bill prohibits foreign-issued CBDC to protect consumers against globalist efforts to adopt a worldwide digital currency...“The government and large credit card companies should not have the power to shut off access to your hard-earned money because they disagree with your politics,” said Governor Ron DeSantis. “Biden’s Central Bank Digital Currency aims to increase government control over people’s finances, and we will not allow it. In Florida, we value personal freedom and won’t allow self-interested elites to chip away at our liberty.”I don't know to what extent he has powers or Biden could pass a superior law to counter this but bravo Ron DeSantis.",

The Order directs the U.S. Government to assess the technological infrastructure and capacity needs for a potential U.S. CBDC in a manner that protects Americans’ interests. The Order also encourages the Federal Reserve to continue its research, development, and assessment efforts for a U.S. CBDC, including development of a plan for broader U.S. Government action in support of their work. This effort prioritizes U.S. participation in multi-country experimentation, and ensures U.S. leadership internationally to promote CBDC development that is consistent with U.S. priorities and democratic values.I've been waiting for over a year on their explanation as to how CBDC's protect the interests of the citizens. I suppose by \"Americans\" they mean elected government officials.",

How shocking. I can't believe it!The bad thing is that there are very few politicians who are against CBDCs. Politicians in general like control. And with CBDCs their power to control will increase exponentially. I had originally opened this thread in the P&S board but since it has two components, one on politics and one on economics, I am moving it to the Economics section where I think it may get more responses.",

It annoys me when a single person just decides for the whole people simply because they climbed the mantle of power. Well, the CBDC initiative can't be perished due to the views and opinions of a selected few.There are genuine concerns about the project truly, and it's the reason why the central government has been hesitant to push it through yet, but it's so ill of a state to be fast to label it an abomination. As time goes on, we will see as the situation unfolds.And as to your last question, one thing in the US is that it does matter what the central law states at times, state laws might still be valid at times. In other words, they let each state decides what they want.",

He's anti-abortion, pro-gun, anti-LGBT, anti-immigration, and the list goes on and on. But Republicans are against the bigger control of the state over the population, so being against CBDCs makes sense here, and that's a valid concern that I think the Republicans point out correctly.I'm personally not against CBDCs, though, as long as using them is totally optional and as long as they aren't allowed when decentralized cryptos don't have the same privileges.",

This is good for the Bitcoin community in Florida as this legislative proposal frees and protects businesses and consumers from federally controlled CBDCs.  Granted, not everyone has to like Bitcoin but at least he's not like Trump whose only reason for seeing Bitcoin as scam is cause it competes with the dollar!

But I am I am concerned when it is used as an investment to distract or force people to abstain from using bitcoin. Most governments introduce these CBDCs because they are scared that their citizens will ditch the local currency. Let every citizen be given the privileged to choose the currency they want to use without being forced by the government. Ron DeSantis's support for Bitcoin seemed to be growing. He is a supporter of privacy and freedom which is why he is against CBDCs. I think the federal government will have to seek redress in court if they want to stop the enforcement of this policy. And Bitcoin will receive a more friendly relationship with the US if he wins the presidential election. But he has to defeat the undisputed heavyweight of the Republicans: Trump.",

Right now the government is interfering too much in our privacy in the name of national security and CBDC is definitely another tool to monitor our financials. Not sure the president could interfere directly in a state law unless there is an involvement from the Supreme court or the legislative body.",

Be rest assured different countries would abuse any system which allows them to. China is usually the most talked about when it comes to dictatorship but almost every country experience such issues as their governments look to gain more control. CBDCs allows the financial sector to be completely transparent to the authorities and can very easily be manipulated.In the long run I think the adoption of CBDCs would not much affect Bitcoin or privacy.

In the US ideology is just a political tool for winning votes, politicians don't believe in what they say.
