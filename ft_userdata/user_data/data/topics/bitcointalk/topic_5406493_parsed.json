  "content": "Russian league is very competitive and have great teams, mostly from Moscow. Although Spartak Moscow has the most championship these are from early years of the league. Zenit won last four seasons and they have eight championships total.If you count Soviet days Spartak Moscow still got the crown with twenty two championships, CSKA Moscow has thirteen and Dynamo Moscow has eleven titles.St. Petersburg team Zenit lately put an embargo on the league. They also won UEFA Cup and Super Cup in 2008. I hope this year we will watch a good season where we don't feel the effects of the war and the players play freely in their teams. I wish that the unfair situation applied in European cups will be corrected as soon as possible.",

The Russian championship is completely destroyed by the sanctions (foreign players have the right to unilaterally terminate the contract and leave) and will not be of any interest next season, since its level will be very low. As for the return of Russian clubs to the Euro Cups, this can be forgotten in the coming years - even if the war ends tomorrow. This is a long process, plus the championship has fallen very much in its level and it will take years to return at least to the previous level.",

Off course there is! Don't Fvck with LiveScore alone, guess you didn't using other football Applications. I did take a look out and some games are on. Sanctions has them roles to play they also must have created a level of awareness for the Russian Premier League.Zenith Saint Petersburg use to be my best team, as I won couple of my major best. I can recall sometime 2018 during May, I had one of my biggest wins from gambling and Zenith Saint Petersburg contributed to it. They won with the total number if goals I placed my on.So in conclusion, go take a good look with other Apps they are present.",

Well this dosent mean that the Russian league wont be intresting at all. All clubs in Russia have gotten some good transfers and players arent leaving their clubs. The only thing is that you cannot fight for europian place but you can fight for the title and not to get relegated. Also you can follow on flashscore",

I just vote for CSKA Moscow (I hope they win the league title this season). Even though Zenit have dominated this league for the last 4 seasons, but I'm not sure they will win it for the fifth time. They also didn't make a good result in their opening match against Khimki, the match ended in a draw which means Zenit only get 1 point. How about you guys? Which team do you think will win the Russian league this season?",

Here is no good place for talking more about politics but still feeling bad for these great clubs and their fans which are having serious problems due to this ban which is surely unfair for me and millions others.I just check new season started, and first matches are going to be interested as defending champions Zenit is held by Khimki even they take early lead in this match and now CSKA Moscow already won his first match and Spartak Moscow is also held by Akhmat Grozny with the same score.",

I know that many legionnaires fled from the clubs and at the end of the last championship the teams had real problems in order to find a full-fledged team for the game. As you can imagine, the level of the tournament has gone down a lot. Rich clubs like Zenit seem to have kept greedy players on their roster, but the overall standings in the league are terrible.",

They need to be fair and balanced for all policies and commitments but here they are doing all things which are completely nonsense I personally against war and things like this, but you also have to accept realities and just give punishment things which are involved in politics.",
