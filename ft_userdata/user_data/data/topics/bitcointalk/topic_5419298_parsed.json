The only requirement I have is to leave here a review with their opinion of the article.  Hope I can work with you! Have a nice day!Here are some examples of my previous work, just to make an idea:QuoteYou probably already heard about bitcoin and its rising value. On January 1st 2017, one bitcoin was worth $1,000 and since then it went to $19.000 in December 2017, and lost more than 50% during the first part of 2018. The story of bitcoinA person, or a group named Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin in 2009. The main goal of this project was to create a “new electronic cash system” that is decentralized. After he managed to came up with this new technology, Nakamoto gave this source code to others in the bitcoin community and decided to vanish. What is bitcoin?It is a digital currency which doesn`t need any coins or bills to be minted or printed. The owners of bitcoin are anonymous and instead of using social security numbers, tax IDs and names, bitcoin connects the buyers to the sellers through encryption keys. Bitcoin is mined by powerful computers that are connected to the internet. Bitcoin is mined by doing a combination of record-keeping and advanced math. When someone sends a bitcoin to somebody else, the network records that transaction and all the other transactions that are made in the same time. The “miners” which are actually computers running special software inscribe these transactions in a gigantic digital ledger. The blocks that are generated by miners are known as the “blockchain”. The miners convert this blocks by using special hardware into sequences of code. Producing hash requires some serious computational power and a lot of miners compete in order to do it. As time goes by, the amount of the awarded bitcoins decreases. What determines the value of bitcoin?The value of bitcoin is determined by what are people willing to pay for it. The value of bitcoin is similar to what happens on stocks. Satoshi Nakamoto made a protocol which stated that only 21 million bitcoins can ever be mined and about 12 million have already been mined. There is a limited supply of bitcoins. This is what makes bitcoin different from stocks. Value is opened to interpretation without a central authority controlling the supply.The volatility of bitcoin also invites manipulation and also speculation this is why it is a great idea to don`t mortgage your house in order to buy bitcoins. How to buy bitcoin?There are a lot of digital currency exchanges on the market which you can choose from such as CEX, Kraken, Coinbase or Coinmama. Coinbase is the largest and most established of them where you can easily buy, sell and also store bitcoins. Is bitcoin legal?The short answer for this question is: Yes, but as any currency available on the market, the answer is yes if you don`t do illegal things with it. For example, bitcoin was the only currency used on Silk Road for purchasing drugs and other illicit goods or services. As it attracts more mainstream attention, bitcoin is always under increased scrutiny. Are there any risks?Yes, when you wake up in the morning, you will probably see another price of bitcoin. The financial value of bitcoin is volatile and may swing a lot from day to day.
