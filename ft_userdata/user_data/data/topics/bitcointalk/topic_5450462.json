Learn more. That's what you need to do.By the time you've done that, you'll know that a \"global known wallet\" doesn't mean anything. Don't \"start trading\" when you have no money, it's like gambling and you'll lose. For the mining part: don't even think about it, you're most likely to fall for some cloud mining scam. In short: if you have to ask, you can't mine Bitcoin.Quote from: KriszHUN49 on April 28, 2023, 06:44:38 AMI just realized im a still a.child..That's great, if you want to learn.
