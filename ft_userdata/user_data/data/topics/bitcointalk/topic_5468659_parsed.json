I don't know why they would ban anyone who is consistently winning, maybe because a constant win is possible in physical casinos  I never knew anyone who is able to constantly be on a winning streak in online gambling. Also even if someone wins more often than losing (because of his own luck or whatever reason) the online reputed casino will never ban his account. Rather, anyone who wagers more, the casino will usually give him high ranks and badges in the online gambling sites.",

You’re right. The only fear for business owners is to see their business collapse that’s why if they can still prevent it from happening, then even banning the said professional gambler is possible. So I’m not actually surprised with this type of scenario because the casino’s house is supposed to always win and not the gambler itself. But in the case of Dana White, its banning serves a very obvious purpose.",

It is not proper though because some of these casinos will never ban someone for loosing too much money, and that is because it benefits them. What can a gambler do in this case? Is there any kind of protection for gamblers, is it possible to follow up the matter in a legal way? like the person taking the casino to court for banning him from their casino when he has broken no rule?",

I think putting a max on the person is much better than banning them completely, but even then a player may be unhappy and decide it's basically a ban and play elsewhere.

They put such games that will make sure the gambler will lose more than winning. That way they make money. Any casino will never risk that and let professionals play there. I guess in gambling, being too good is bad for you. Then again, it's all about luck, right? I don't think any casino has the right to ban anyone if they are not cheating. But it's all in their TOS. Or they will make up new rules for that certain person. Just because they have the power to do so and you agreed to it before joining. But in the end this is not right thing to do.",

At least in my country that's how it works, obviously there cannot be a discriminatory reason for this, as it would constitute a crime.So, looking at this rule, I see that casinos would also not be obliged to accept a \"successful\" customer who only brings them losses.However, it is necessary to understand how this ban works, because if the user has not done anything illegal, the casino could ban the player as long as he pays what he has already won, as it is illegal for him to retain amounts honestly won by the player.If this is not what is happening, then the casino is in fact taking abusive and irregular action.",

No, right so basically they can't able to maintain the business so they kicked him by implying actions of providing a blackjack champion title. Land-based casinos do that often but people may give a reason for them to do even they can because if the casino feel suspicious but whereas in online casino if they do then their business will go down to zero for sure because the reputation matters more when it comes to online business so if someone can't maintain the integrity of their promises will soon fade away and the business is getting more competitive so they can't afford to do such mistake as well.",

      "body": "Increase in consumption can as well cause diminishing return. It's a both side game. The casino wins when players lose and vice versa. Nobody loves it, losing money. Running a casino business is risky especially when a good number of players are high rollers. I've seen multiple issues with winning big, not only on casinos, even bet shops find it difficult to pay big winners. They're always delays and disputes before the money is sent to them. So, the correct cause of the problem is loss of money. But, on their side, when we lose big, no problem arise. Instead they're happy and encourage the player to stake more or try again another time. It's common in online casinos, I'm surprised to see offline casino having the same attitude to high rollers, who win big. I'm sure not all casino execute such a behavior, yet no house is glad to see a player win big. That's why we must always stay prepared for them, because they're ready for players. One rule or term will be tagged to the player, that they broke or failed to comply. Players are expected to also follow due procedures, when playing casinos. So that on the big lucky day, they'll have no allegations against us, the player. I was marveled to see a casino ask a big winner about the source of his wagered money, before he'll be paid. Additionally, big players should own a capable lawyer, in case of familiar problems as these. Sue the casino to court and they'll get penalized.",

Casino is literally betting against players and who will love to keep playing with someone that keeps beating you on your own game while you have the authority to ban them to save the profitability of your business.As players this is unfair since it’s ok for casino to continue when we are losing but if think about that casino is still a business. We don’t have a choice than to follow it since it’s either they will bankrupt or just kick players that giving them negative profit is their choice for their business.",

Because when casinos face such problems, they lose potential new customers because their image is tarnished. So, if you have a problem in a casino, you create negative feedback about that casino and you inform your close circle about it. Then that casino becomes a tainted place and loses customers. I think casinos don't take that risk. But I think they can organize rigged games, of course I can't prove it. But I think they are not 100% transparent and reliable.",
