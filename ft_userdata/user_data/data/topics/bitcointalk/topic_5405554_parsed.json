      "body": "\"Singnature\"Is that's the correct name for the project that you're telling us that will be a good place for our money for long term?And as you say long term, it's not just going to be around 2-3 years because that's more than that. But if that's definition of your long term, then that's fine. While with the name of the project you've left, I don't understand if that's the real name or you made a typo because I can't find that project in cmc.",
