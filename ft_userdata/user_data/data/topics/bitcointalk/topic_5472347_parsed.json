And that's basically how all wallets and exchanges work. They give you the same address across all networks.If you want to know on which network the address is \"active\" I believe BlockScan should help you achieve that: https://blockscan.com/",

      "body": "This belongs to Altcoins board You cannot tell the difference between their addresses because the binance smart chain which is the network for BNB shares similarities with the Ethereum network because it was a hard fork of Go Ethereum, the tokens are compatible with each other. One of the easiest way to actually differentiate a different network address is by the prefixes but this two are similar because they start with 0x. If it is something like doge it will start with D and T for tron network.  So there are no much difference between the bnb and Ethereum network except the gas fee maybe and speed of transactions.

The two are different networks, but both are EVM Compatible Blockchains, Ethereum and BSC are just two of them, there's Avalanche, Optimism, Fantom etcThese networks can use a similar or the same address, and you can also use https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com to find out which networks have funds in the address.",

Based on the prefixes of address. I am familiar with L1 and if its looks like eth then its likely from group of L1 networks like avalanche, fantom, bsc, polygon, arbitrum, optimism, and many more that uses that kind of address. Of course if its a coin with own chain its quite different from normal L1 project.

Now on your comment about prefixes, I too can differentiate something but not it's not if what L's network is it but it's about if the address is SegWit, or Legacy. Yes this was about Bitcoin I'm referring to. It's interesting that some crypto or network has their own unique prefixes or addresses.@OP, what I usually do to know it, is I paste the address on different crypto block explorer websites. They do have a big search box there. If there are results shown, well congrats, you just find out that the address is also from that network/crypto.",

Both bsc and eth networks use the same address format. So use the respective blockchain specific to that network to check. For looking for an address in etherscan (eth) and see transactions, that address is active on the eth network. So, if you put the same address into BscScan (bsc) and see transactions, the address is active on either bnb or eth network.",

No, it is not possible especially since ETH and BNB networks share the same address format which is prefixed with \"0x.\" But if its in your wallet then obvious know the address belongs to what network but if you are trying to find the address of someone else then you will always get two results no matter on which explorer you choose to search the address.",

It will tell you which network that address was available. You can also easily track in what blockchain you have stored your money. It will be very useful as it has been also conneting to the all of available blockchain this time. Just like this https://debank.com/profile/0xeb2eb5c68156250c368914761bb8f1208d56acd0that address was just an example. Quote from: SteveF1975 on October 31, 2023, 04:02:52 PMIs there a difference between the Ethereum Network and the BNB Network,  if so how can you tell? If you meant native BNB network and there is different, but if you meant BSC network and it's EVM compliant. You can use ethereum address in binance BSC blockchain but not for BNB native blockchain. Binance has two blockchains, binance BSC and Binance native. These blockchains used different mechanism.",

After making sure that you are scanning the correct blockchain, the same private key can have coins on a specific blockchain and zero on the other.",

Yes, that is difference between Ethereum and BNB networks, and you can often identify the network by examining the wallet address. Simple that, you can find at Coinmarketcap, type your token in search (top) and you can find in contract address. Also BNB addresses can also be identified by checking their activity on the Binance Smart Chain Explorer (bscscan), like Ethereum addresses can be checked on Ethereum explorers such as Etherscan.",
