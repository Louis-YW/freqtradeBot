Good joke   Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic JPEGS SystemI think that Satoshi is hitting his face on the wall after see all those ordinals on the bitcoin blockchain.Quote from: philipma1957 on November 16, 2023, 12:47:51 PMThat 8.48 cents becomes 4.25 cents at the ½ ing which is a disaster.This means that we are going to see higher transactions fees in the future and more if those ordinals keep spamming the network,Something that bothers me is that todays there are near ~300K transactions and fess are over 175 sat/vB, But some monts ago the number of pending transactions was over 600K and the fees don't get that high, i remeber only fees of some 50 sat/vB",
