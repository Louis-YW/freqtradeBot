I know that it's hard to talk to someone like you OP while dealing that tough situation that you are.There's still hope and things are going to be better, it may not be this time or soonest but the time will come that all of these sufferings and unfortune things happened to you will turn into a positive one. You have a purpose while you're still here and as they say, everything has a reason why it happens. You're a tough guy and you'll recover from this hard situation.",

Just because others experience worse does nit mean that OP doesnt have the right to feel bad for theirselves. Each person's struggle is valid and it's important to acknowledge and address their feelings without comparing them to others. We have experiences and challenges that are unique. Salute to us having our bad years and still starts a new year better!",
