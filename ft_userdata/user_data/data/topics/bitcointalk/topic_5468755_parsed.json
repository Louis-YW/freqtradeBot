  "content": "Hacking cases are still the biggest scourge on any crypto exchange. It doesn't matter whether the exchange is large or small, this incident can have fatal consequences for the exchange and even go bankrupt, even though there are several other factors that cause an exchange to collapse, such as FTX and so on.The impact of this incident was none other than traders/consumers who saved/had funds in crypto on the exchange and had not yet had time to withdraw the funds. In this incident, the exchange's customers will lose time and materially. The long process of recovering customer funds and the amount of funds returned also does not match what the trader had before. Not to mention the added terms and rules that make it impossible for traders to get their money back.If this continues to happen, there will be a lot of potential for consumers to lose funds in the future. To avoid something similar we might need to do:1. Take care of your money, manage it properly and carefully.What I mean here is that you need to be wise and careful in storing, organizing and managing it. If you trade on an exchange, then when you finish trading, put your money back into your personal wallet (take your crypto out of the exchange and move it to your hardware wallet or mobile wallet)Do this after finishing trading. Because actually the most dangerous thing is storing money/crypto on an exchange.2. If you are forced to store your funds or crypto on an exchange, don't forget to take a screenshot of your balance and account. This SS is useful if at any time something bad happens so you already have proof that you have funds there. Usually SS balance is a requirement for claiming recovery money. Sorry about the screenshot, I mean this is to remind us, what is our balance, what crypto do we have on the exchange and the amount.3. KYCKYC is now important because usually in the process of recovering funds in cases of collapse or hacking on an exchange, we will be subject to KYC, where the data we input will be checked against each other. If it matches, the fund recovery process will run smoothly. If we do not carry out KYC when registering on an exchange, we will likely have problems when faced with fund recovery requirements.4. If you choose not to do KYC then do point 1 in a disciplined manner.If you have some other advice, try sharing it here. And if this post is useful for you, give me merit",

Take care of your money, manage it properly and carefully.What I mean here is that you need to be wise and careful in storing, organizing and managing it. If you trade on an exchange, then when you finish trading, put your money back into your personal wallet (take your crypto out of the exchange and move it to your hardware wallet or mobile wallet)Do this after finishing trading. Because actually the most dangerous thing is storing money/crypto on an exchange.Just as you have pointed out the best advice is do not save on exchanges, right there is No secondary advice attached to this except that they have their risks. The first is since it will be harsh or probably just too much of a problem on traders to be withdrawing their funds everyday back to their individual wallets. Personally I think this might even lead to send to a wrong address either by mistakenly typing the wrong one or during copy and paste which would be easier one could fall into the mistake of getting affected with clipboard malware. So my advice which still Carries its risk will be if you are still trading just everyday then you might have to leave your coins but make sure it is an amount you can lose. But make sure you’re not trading on just a single exchange try to diversify this amount into different exchanges and as such should one faces any hack or shutdown you can get back to the other and withdrawal your funds because it will certainly be hard to have top exchanges shut down same day. But make sure you are taking off your funds on exchanges every time you’re taking a trading break. Quote 2. If you are forced to store your funds or crypto on an exchange, don't forget to take a screenshot of your balance and account. This SS is useful if at any time something bad happens so you already have proof that you have funds there. Usually SS balance is a requirement for claiming recovery money.If you have some other advice, try sharing it here. And if this post is useful for you, give me meritI don’t think this will count because no exchange will actually accept screenshots when returning people’s money. Graphics Designers have evolved as technology also evolves there will be multiple of scammers that could design a screenshot perfectly and put in ridiculous amounts there so it will be just a waste of time for them to accept screenshots as proof.",

Now the question is, are screenshots valid evidence in your opinion?",

I am not getting that or you are wrong.Also that you can download the statement of account on the exchange that you are using which stompix also talked about. If you are a trader, it will not be easy to continue to screen shot your balance on an exchange. That can not be convenient for people like me that is using several exchanges. If an exchange is hacked, that will bring inconvenience if you have money on that exchange if the exchange stop to function during that time.I have small amount of money on exchanges but I am using several exchanges for it. Instead of having $500 to trade on an exchange, I prefer to use $100 on 5 exchanges or more exchanges so that the money can reduce. That is how I am doing it if I want to leave my coins on exchanges, it would be the amount of money that I can afford to lose. But nobody is forcing me to leave money on an exchange, that is my own choice to make.",

Email receipt is more admissible than screenshots of your balance since it’s an official receipt coming from the exchange itself instead of screenshots which you personally capture.You mention already that we should not store our funds on our exchange so there’s no need to do this screenshot thing normally but it’s not wrong to do this too as safety precautions. Remember that exchange can deny your screenshot if they deliberately remove your balance for unknown reason. Also only scammy exchange steal balance from its customer so make sure to use only reputable exchange to minimize risk of experiencing that scenario.",

There shouldn't be any problems if you didn't undergo KYC because you're supposed to provide basic information like your full name, email address and often a phone number. This, along with your country of origin known to the exchange through your IP is enough to confirm that you were the owner of the account. I'd say that rule number one for everyone should be to move your coins out of exchanges if you're not planning to sell for at least a few days, but people are often too lazy to do it.",

That's a good point OP, well I've never thought of it as never encountered any accident like that, as well buddy there is always a record of total assets in your mail, as whenever we deposit and withdraw as a record platform provides the mail record. So whether taking a screenshot or not does hold any weight. I'm not sure about how the FTX refunded the users. For those who hold a lot of money, it does matter because they prefer going with custodial wallets, trading, and finance because they really can bear the fees. Screenshots are not gonna help in any case because there can be edited versions possibly better to keep your email safe.Proper management is required while holding the funds and it is never recommended to hold the funds on the exchanges for long terms, because they don't offer any sort of insurance to your funds any any case of hacking, so better to deal with your own choice self custody always.",
