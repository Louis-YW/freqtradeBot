Maybe you can get a better average buy-in price because you will never know when it will go down or perhaps go up in price now. It's now or never.

He expects the world’s largest cryptocurrency to fall that low in 2023.In fact, in the past two days the Bitcoin price has experienced an extraordinary decline compared to the previous week, I judge, what you say is at least a possibility and not a good time to buy, maybe, maybe, something will happen, before buying Bitcoin there is a good time to do it.",

Gotta love how fast the fiat banking system works. My mouth was watering last night watching the drop to $25K. Unfortunately it will probably be another few days and I’m stuck watching the price recovery while waiting for funds. Ironically, that’s why people get into crypto. I always forget how awful it is to move money around using bank transfers until I’m forced to do one. I think the only thing capable of dropping prices to new lows is the mtgox coin distribution.

I wonder what could be the answer but we all don't know, no one can predict the bottom nor the peak, but one thing is for sure is to DCA, don't put all your money on one asset and in a bear market it's always advisable to do DCA, go to stable assets or don't do anything at all and wait for it to come back up (though this one was for those coins/tokens that survived the blizzard in crypto, I'm referring to Bitcoin and Ethereum).",
