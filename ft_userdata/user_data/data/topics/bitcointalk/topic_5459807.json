I am asking because I honestly never heard about this exchange, and its a prety common scam tactic, scammers pretending that they are interested in person and slowly shifting conversations towards great opportunity to make money on some unknown exchange. Quote from: Yurkov on July 14, 2023, 01:28:51 PMPs. I know that we shouldn't use new, small and little-known exchanges, but I have my reasons for being interested in them.I see that they are no listed on Coingecko and on CMC only as \"untracked listing\" which is not good sign at all. Being listed on those two sites doesn't of course mean that exchange is legit, but not being properly listed there is a huge red flag in my eyes and I would never deal with such exchanges.I just hope that if you decide to use it nevertheless, that you will send only small amounts that you are willing to loose.",

How lazy can you get?It's pretty obvious that their failure to pay attention to detail seriously calls into question their competence and reliability. Honestly, I wouldn't advise anyone to put their money in the hands of someone who shows such laziness and carelessness.",

Why would Coinmarketcap be the only source we should trust when Coinmarketcap itself is not trustworthy? Of the 621 Coinmarketcap reviews on Trustpilot, 83% of them gave the site 1 star out of 5. Overall, CMC averaged a very low 1.6 stars.  Had Bitcorse been listed on Coinmarketcap, would you trust it? Had Coinmarketcap indicated that Bitcorse has $9 billion in 24-hour volume, would you immediately believe it?What if Coinmarketcap registered Bitcorse but Coingecko, CoinLib, LiveCoinWatch, CoinCheckup, and others didn't?",
