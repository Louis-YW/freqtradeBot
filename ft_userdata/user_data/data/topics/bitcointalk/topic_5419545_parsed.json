I think winning big is luck. It is luck because you bet big but you don't win and you bet small you win haha.",

I would share the story with friends because I feel good. Sharing good stories with friends is awesome. And also, most friends treat each other if one of them gains easy money.

But I do not share stories with non-gambling people because I do not want to be the one to open them to gambling. I know gambling can be addictive, so I avoid influencing non-gambling friends into gambling.",

      "body": "Not surprising if there are any cases. People are easily carried away by money. Observe how they asked \"how much money did you get from doing...\" and \"can you tell me about that\". It creates interest and influence especially in gambling. The activity itself is tempting ; winning jig time in a single night. But the problem with influence is that people only see the good part of the story. They won't be interested to know how much you've lost, they would only care how much you've earned as a player. They will just realize it eventually wherein they're close to regrets. Gambling is different. You've more likely lose double your winnings,it is just that the moment you win makes it rewarding which boosts the interest or confidence of non gamblers. But if you are a gambler who cares for your circle, make sure to educate them first of the risks involved. Y'all know what follows if not.",
