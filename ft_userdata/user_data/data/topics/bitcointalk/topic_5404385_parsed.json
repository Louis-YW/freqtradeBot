  "content": "WEB  | Telegram Hello Everyone.I would like to introduce myself before telling You the content of my offer. 1. I discovered the cryptocurrency market in 2016 for the first time and was greatly astonished by this kind of technology. That is why I started to write articles about prospective digital assets and became a pro in copywriting.During 6 years I managed to deal with a sufficient number of customers and participated in projects’ development. Due to this practice I was able to monitor the situation on  market and be aware of the most innovative ideas.In my opinion, crypto-currency technologies remain prospective. This innovative concept is changing the modern world and I am excited of its further development possibilities.2. Nevertheless, the main field of my activity is game writing. I have created a large amount of plots and quests for them, as well as many unique characters. So it is possible to state that my scripts formed the basis for entire virtual universes development.3. Ukraine is my motherland. War brought me a lot of pain, but also became an inspiration to create my own project from scratch. My offer Generally speaking, I decided to develop a blockchain game about the war in Ukraine considering my skills and interests.I prefer to monitor events in real time. What is more, communication with people of different social groups, such as soldiers, volunteers, refugees, entrepreneurs and journalists makes me understand current situation.Many Ukrainians today are not ready to share stories about their dramatically changed lives. Despite that, information which is possible to gather now will be a great background for future articles.By the way, some foreign media used to hide or rewrite truth about horrible events in my country. Therefore, I am ready to tell everything without censorship and present it in interesting game form. For example, quests.Quest is my favorite game genre. Unfortunately, I am not a programmer, but writing and developing scripts are definitely my strongest skills. They can be created in both text and visual novel formats.If You are not aware of that, I highly recommend to read the following articles on Wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novelI’ve already developed the first test quest, so you can try it right now. To start playing, just open link below:PC: https://ukrplay.itch.io/power?secret=VGmb3EhUVdSm31oZvIxFzJWEIz4Mobile: https://ukrplay.itch.io/powermob?secret=V40rOrTgCRMwZV2qv2RRGjrJRM    Having been playing this quest, I’ve already created the first NFT-tokens: https://rarible.com/power_and_chaos Inside this game characters and locations haven’t yet been developed, and Net images are used as visual elements since the main purpose of this quest is to broadcast the story of ordinary civilians who turned up to be in a war zone. There may also be some grammar inaccuracies.However, in case of the further project development, there will definitely be created detailed characters images, locations and other elements of the game space. In addition, the designer will process images in order to create a unified visual style for the entire game.Working on the game developing, I am going to implement monetization as well as earning money for players and investors. Moreover, I need funding in order to continue working on this project. That’s why I appeal to You. If there c will be commercial success, you will definitely make a good profit.If you want to see the continuation of the game, you can support it with a donate.Payment can be transferred to one of the following addresses:    • USDT, BUSD, DAI (ERC20, BEP20): 0xec07D15db3c3bE77e3C9A263bfC425f1912186eC    • USDT (TRC20):TRLZZBaPUcWJz8gGgF5avfUiW5cjBKvaitLet’s observe some possible options for monetizing the game:    • Sale of in-game objects in the form of NFT.    • Implementing of in-game digital currency.    • Commissions for trading game items on Your own marketplace.    • Advertisement placement, including ads, banners, video and audio.    • Placement of native advertising like the information about a company or a product in the game itself.    • Placement of links in game texts.    • Built-in purchases.    • Interactive and game advertising.    • Sale of various boosters in the game.    • Different types of paid subscriptions.    • Payment for download.    • Donations.There are some earning options for players:    • NFT earnings.    • Earning game digital currency.    • Staking.    • Playthrough the missions.    • Participation in battles.    • Trading game items and objects.    • Referral program.    • Participation in the game revision and improvement.There are some earning options for investors:    • Hangouts of NFT.    • Hangouts of game digital currency.    • Staking.    • Payment of monetization interest.    • Participation in management and development of the project.The level of my game modernization as well as its general volume depends on the amount of money I’ll be able to get.The roadmap may be represented in the following way:If I get less than $1,000 I will consider my project to be of no interest to anyone and I will abandon this idea. In this case, I’ll give the received money back to the investors.If I get more than $1,000I’ll just get down to working on my project. I am not a native English speaker. That’s why I’ll access to the services of an interpreter since he/she will definitely render correctly the whole idea of my texts.The gained sum will be enough for writing a few more short quests and translating them into English. As soon as I do it, I will publish them in the browser and mobile versions where you can test them.Besides, I indent to create a small landing page for my project.I will create NFT-tokens of each quest that will be given to investors right on this stage. If I can get enough money, I’ll use all of them in the game.I suppose I’ll do it within 1-2 months.If I get more than $5,000This sum will be enough for releasing a demo version of the game. There will already be detailed characters and locations and all the quests will form an entire story. So, the player will be able to beat them sequentially.The demo version of the game will also be presented as a browser and mobile game, therefore you can play it.Everything will be translated into English and digitized as NFT-tokens, which I will hangout to investors.I think I’ll do it within 1-3 months.If I collect $10,000I consider several options for further project development at this stage.For instance:• Decentralized app setup.• In-game currency setup.• Voting token setup.• Creation and promotion of accounts in social networks to promote the project.Moreover, I'm not a programmer. That’s why I’ll have to access to the services of other parties in order to perform such tasks.Otherwise, I can continue just refining the game, developing new levels and objects.As soon as I’m concerned I will discuss with investors further actions and take their preferences into account.If I get $20,000This sum will be enough for completing several points highlighted in the previous section. By the way, I’ll refine new game levels and objects.There will be possible to develop a trading platform on this stage. The users could  buy and sell gaming items on this platform. There will be the function of adding the ability to stack.In addition, the game can be made multiplayer which will make it possible for players to create groups to complete group missions, participate in battles and achieve certain goals.If I get from $20,000 to $100,000I’d like to develop a visual short story. This means a bit more advanced version of the game compared to the text quest since it can contain various multimedia elements such as images, GIF animations, 3D objects as well as music and sound effects.I’ll need to collaborate with designers in order to develop my idea. The more money I get, the more multimedia elements I’ll be able to set up into the game.Besides, I’ll also create NFT-tokens by all multimedia objects and hangout them to investors.It’s worthy to point out that money can be spent on other described above tasks. For example, they can be used for developing apps for different platforms, creating in-game currency, trading platform and more.Moreover, some money will be spent on advertising and marketing.I’ll definitely discuss with investors these issues and we will decide the best way of project development.Further developmentI believe that some of the major gaming companies may be interested in my project. Thereat, my text quest (or visual short story) will be the basis for developing a full-fledged video game. Nevertheless, I’ll retain the copyright to all quests, characters, locations and other objects that will be hangout to investors by NFT-tokens.Undoubtedly, I’ll continue to develop the text game as an independent project. This means I’ll be able to create an infinite number of quests and levels as long as they are demanded in the user community.If you want to see the continuation of the game, you can support it with a donate.Payment can be transferred to one of the following addresses:    • USDT, BUSD, DAI (ERC20, BEP20): 0xec07D15db3c3bE77e3C9A263bfC425f1912186eC    • USDT (TRC20):TRLZZBaPUcWJz8gGgF5avfUiW5cjBKvaitWEB  | Telegram",
