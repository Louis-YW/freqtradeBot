  "content": "Update 3/8/2023: Intel has pointed out a translation error with the report from UDN — the presentation shared with the press covered the previously-announced tape-out of internal test chips for the 18A and 20A process nodes, and test chips for a large potential foundry customer have taped out, and silicon is running in the lab. The development of the nodes is not final. We've amended the text below. https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-completes-development-of-18a-20a-nodesIntel has completed chip tape-outs of its Intel 18A (1.8nm-class) and Intel 20A (2nm-class) fabrication processes that will be used to make the company's products, as well as chips for clients of its Intel Foundry Services (IFS) division, reports .Maybe mining on new processors will be profitable.",

For the processor, you also need to make special motherboards on which you can install several processors, otherwise for one processor there are a lot of additional costs for buying other PC components. And modern server hardware is very expensive, so I have not seen it in mining.",

This is 2 or 3 generations away, so around 5 years before see them if all goes well. Considering how long ittook Intel to get 10nm working, the schedule is a little optimisttic.And when they do come out they won't be competing with today's CPUs, they'll competing with Zen6so expectations need to be moderated in assessing their impact on mining.",

Then when we got the Radeon 7xxx series I think those were based on 28nm tech.Then we had a big jump to the RX series which was 16nm if I recall and I assumed it would be at least another decade when we broke the 10nm barrier but I guess technology advances pretty quickly.",

It doesn't offer a lot of density increase compared to their 3nm process if I understood it correctly but still gives a 10-15% performance/watt boost. Not sure how it will translate to hash rate power though.Quote from: adaseb on March 14, 2023, 04:42:52 AMThen we had a big jump to the RX series which was 16nm if I recall and I assumed it would be at least another decade when we broke the 10nm barrier but I guess technology advances pretty quickly.I think one of the reasons is that manufacturing companies define numbers differently. IIRC, Intel claims its 10nm process is comparable to TSMC's 7nm[2], its 7nm is comparable to TSMC's 3nm[3], and so on. Basically, nanometer numbers in a vacuum don't mean much, Intel/TSMC or others can simply change the name and voila, we break another nm barrier.

Back in the early Pentium days CPU models were named after their clock rate. AMD decided to name their CPUs based on whichIntel CPUs they thought they could compete with. Historicaly Intel has been more \"Italian V12\" and AMD has been more \"Hemi\"Lithography, like CPU clock rate, or engine RPM, isn't the only factor in determining performance but it's a big one.",

Can you use Intel CPU to mine them profitably right now? Or is there another bottleneck that a faster CPU doesn't really matter for the hash rate/profit? I think as I said it is profitable with any processor including a i5 3470 and up and if you are using your PC daily at work and if you are free to install an app or you get permission from the IT administrator go ahead and run the miner there.Now not a single CPU is profitable mining this coin despite the AMD Ryzen 9 and Epic server processors are really powerful ones that produces you the most number of such coins.Keep in mind to only venture it for the long term,for example if you have a powerful processor you can mine for 3 months to get like 7000-10.000 coins and then wait.The energy cost whatever you have is higher than the CPU power consumption so only try this for the longer term if you believe in the project.",
