Can you imagine that? - someone made up his own currency and now it is worth more than a dollar? What a nonsense\"I was like ... \"What a nonsense\" Who is buying coins that he (as centralized identity) can produce as much as he want. If I only spend 5 min after arriving home to do a research to know what is blockchain and why BTC gains popularity instead of mindlessly accepting the journalist's narrative ... I was too focused on chicks and alko-party.Next time I heard about BTC when it broke 10k $ A 10 000x after... I did research that day and my face was like:Why did I not do my research almost a decade ago! Made my first purchase at 19k $. F.king +1 900 000 % from \"what a nonsense\" day. At the top of 2017 bubble XD",
