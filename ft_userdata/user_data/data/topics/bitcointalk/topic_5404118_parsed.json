You have high inflation due to fuel, inflation due to supply chains and inflation due to climate changes and other factors that Make the tightening of one monetary policy lead to more problems.Therefore, the best solution for now is to keep as much liquidity as you can and try not to sell your investments and buy real shares / assets if you have excess money.",

However they forgot one thing, peeps were loosing their jobs, companies were not doing well, supply chain stopped so as to inward of money and taxes thereafter. Central banks required to print even more money but it was above the income of government through taxes and businesses. So it was but obvious to have higher costs and in short followed inflation.",

In reality, both things are possible. In one scenario, inflation is rising, people are feeling unsure about the economy and engage in panic selling.

Moods can differ and cause different results for the overall marketRightly said mate, and to add to the OPs assumptions, the matter of fed printing more money and how it leads to bitcoin pumping in price is a two way thingIn the first way, fed or Central Banks printing more money does not guarantee that the price of bitcoin would rise, though it's likely to drive the price of bitcoin higher because printing more money means  there will be more paper money in circulation for investors to throw into Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies in general.On the second way, it's already known that printing more money causes devaluation to the fiat currency, and devaluation of paper currency causes the price of commodities to go up, and when the price of goods go up, this can lead to bitcoin crashing as a result of people selling it to keep up with life most especially when their day job no longer afford them enough money to keep up with their daily expenses.",

The government should instead adopt Bitcoin and save the economy from future hikes and instabilityEven though you are right, there isn't any people who will stop doing that, and all governments will keep on doing that whenever they have to. Of course it is not going to be something simple, and of course it is going to impact the world, and inflation will go up, but printing is something nations have done forever and they will keep doing that.Maybe not as radical as they did during the pandemic period because during those periods we had a situation where nobody really worked, no people, no companies, only a few places, and the governments had to print money and distribute that, which caused inflation but at the same time it wasn't really that much of a problem since that was the only way out.
