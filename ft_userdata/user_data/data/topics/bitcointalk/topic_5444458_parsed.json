Even if a country, state, or province legalizes casinos, there will still be a minority group of racketeers who will take advantage of the taxless underground businesses. Regardless of how the government handles the situation, there will still be bad actors who will find ways to bypass any legal issues.The real problem here is not the gambling rings itself, but how casinos are being advertised openly to the public and how easy it is for children to be exposed from such marketing campaigns. And perhaps the government's lack of control mechanism to prevent people from being addicted to gambling that could eventually lead to debt.",

Why risk jail or a huge fine playing somewhere it's not legal if you can go up the road to a legal establishment and play? Of course that is also assuming the legal establishment is fair to the players.",

I see no reason why illegal activity would exist if the said activity was allowed in the first place, albeit with rules and laws enforced on it. Regardless of the limitations placed on it, it still is a matter of fact that the activity is completely legal already. In the first place, I reckon with it being legal, people wouldn't necessarily risk being fined for doing it illegally. They could possibly just register it themselves as a legal business. There'd probably be a few more who would still do it, but it might be because the entity behind casinos is supposed to be only owned by the government or something similar, kind of not giving them a chance. I highly doubt they'd get much of a customer base though which makes the idea itself kind of not worth it.",

It's up to the government to enforce laws and regulations to prevent these bad actors from exploiting the system. Legalizing gambling can also bring in more revenue for the government, and provide a safer and more regulated environment for gamblers.

But if it's a casino that wants to be legalized, I guess it will depend on the regulations on gambling itself. If gambling is banned in that country, the casino can't ask for the casino to be legalized either. It would probably be better if the casino stayed on the illegal side and operated underground especially if the owner had some influence in the illegal business circles. But although gambling is legalized in many countries, it does not guarantee that it can eliminate fraud because it depends on the casino itself. If the casino really intends to cheat its customers, they do not have to have a legal license from the government.",

We have had questionable gambling casinos even in this forum existing side by side with legalized casinos. Scammers will always find ways to beat the legal system. To create a strong law against scammers to punish and prosecute them when proven on their attrocity will help but yet won't stop gambling rings.",

It is not an activity that people will consider to just stop because their government has asked them to, many might turn to gambling rings. If gambling is legalized in such places, these people will no longer see any need to patronize these secret gambling rings where they are unable to report whatever happens to them. They will prefer the casino's and gambling places that will want to operate in line with government policies. Gambling legalization will reduce gambling rings.",

Though it is better if gambling will be legal to avoid people having  violations but government should be strict in implementation or in reminding their people to avoid too much addiction on it. In my country when there are news that affects people too much that causes harm to the players there are laws implemented that will eliminate that specific game to avoid more damage.",
