  "content": "During an interview with Tusker Carlson early this year, president Putin said before the Russia/Ukraine war, that about 80% of Russia foreign trade was in US dollars and Euro. So the sanctions placed by the western countries made Russia to begin to look for ways to circumvent them and Bitcoin was the answer. As we know, recently, president Putin has signed crypto bill into law legalizing Bitcoin mining, as well as crypto taxation. He's also urged BRICS to adopt crypto. Today, during a speech at the world trade center in Moscow, he said nobody can ban Bitcoin. You can watch the video here.We've many topics about Donald Trump on the forum and he's been putting in good words about Bitcoin. With the world leaders, US president-elect Donald Trump and president Vladimir Putin now pro Bitcoin, do you think this would have any effect on mass adoption?",

Bitcoin if adopted by the BRICS nations it would boost it's adoption world wide. Bitcoin if adopted by the BRICS nations would cause the Dollar to not seem as relevant as it is right now. But this isn't about the dollar but about saving all of our economies. Still bitcoin if adopted with a solid fundamental economies will make us miss the dollar.",

With the world leaders, US president-elect Donald Trump and president Vladimir Putin now pro Bitcoin, do you think this would have any effect on mass adoption?World leaders move to adopt bitcoin will definitely make bitcoin a more adoptable currency in the future. A lot of people will have more trust in it and with the urge by world leaders to adopt crypto, we will see more mass adoption and use of it in the future and may serve as alternative to the current monetary system. USA and Russia are two big countries that their support for bitcoin will drive more adoption to it and possibly become a legal currency in the whole world and can be used for international transactions more between countries and not just as a reserve.

The likes of bitcoin and the BRICS currency, I don’t see dollar losing its relevant sooner, it may take a while as the stance dollar has now cannot just come to an end and be powerless within a short time of having this alternative currencies to be used in place of them in the future.",

The West will also have a smart leader next year who knows exactly what bitcoin is and what it can accomplish. In the end the real winners will be the bitcoin hodlers. Thanks god Kabala the disastrous mess didn’t get elected. Because of Trump bitcoin has almost reached $100k but it is still early to make celebrations. Let’s come back when bitcoin hits a million usd.",

We need more adoption and usage of this currency to have solid ground why it can continue to rise its value. Without solid reasoning behind its existence, the price rise can easily go down hard. So much better to have organic rise and well-established foundation in order to support its market value, to make it viable for long-term investment purposes or better yet, less volatile nature to be employed in the payment sector.But all in all, the sentiments are already positive as the newly-appointed SEC is pro-crypto. It may for sure drive noncrypto users to have positive approach towards this market. And besides, we don't need to convince people to get into this market. Would be better if they found it on their own and experience the benefits of dealing with it.",

We can say that I will have a better and positive effect on bitcoin this bull run as it will help to spake more gains than the 2021 bull season. As it is already bitcoin is past it's advertisement stage so and we are now in its early adoption and since high profile countries are dealing with bitcoin and planning making it a reserve than we are in good shape or we are making a big move. Brilliant presidents always make brilliant moves.",

Cryptos aren't in any way different from what their decisions and opinions affect, whether negatively or positively. Lately, we've seen how Donald Trump's comments have continued to make Bitcoin soar even when he hasn't been sworn in yet. More people are going to be onboarded on Bitcoin by next year and that will be because of positive vibes from world leaders who are going to toe the line of what Trump will be doing. Back home to my country, the negative attitude of our government on cryptos have made it look like a crime getting involved in it.",

With the recent reports about top country leaders showing support for bitcoin I think if they relax the restrictions it will help the bitcoin awareness reach the people and will help grow the adoption higher",

For sure, if governments are publicly accepting and promoting Bitcoin usage, there will be great adoptions that will come with it aside from the price increase it will drive. There is a high chance of the citizens adopting it as long as the government promotes it.  ETF approval alone creates room for bitcoin, as it removes the doubt that some people have about it from their minds, and they now see it as something worth investing in and legal. Just imagine it being legal and publicly recognised by all countries; the adoption will definitely be there.",

I don't know if their influence could give bitcoin more legitimacy, I mean, it's not like it's been dysfunctional even before their support, bitcoin has been doing fine even if a lot of governments are against them so I don't know if recognition from this highly influential figures of the world politics really lend any kind of legitimacy to what bitcoin can do because bitcoin already does what they're talking about, they're just realizing the potential now because there's money to be had in bitcoin.",

His words can bring positive news for Bitcoin market, but it's news effects and I don't value Putin's potential contribution to Bitcoin adoption growth too much. Without him and his national policy on Bitcoin, Bitcoin will continue to thrive more in future, it is already globally accepted.https://newhedge.io/terminal/bitcoin/legality-map",
