      "body": "Easily done with Electrum on Android.Create a new wallet, give it the name you want, select \"Standard wallet\" and then \"Use a master key\". From there you can either paste in a master public key or scan a QR code of the master public key.Alternatively, to watch individual addresses, create a new wallet and select \"Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys\". From here you can again paste in individual addresses or scan the QR codes of individual addresses.On your desktop wallet, you can find the QR code for your master public key as OmegaStarScream has explained above, or you can right click on an individual address, click details, and then click on the QR button to get a QR code for that individual address.",
