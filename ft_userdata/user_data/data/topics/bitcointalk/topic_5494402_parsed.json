  "content": "Some days ago the \"Buy Bitcoin\" sign was sold for over $1 million dollars and I thought I had seen it all... I mean the craziest and most expensive Bitcoin artifact ever sold, but I was wrong. Also, few days ago, we witnessed the fourth bitcoin halving and many persons were willing to splash out ridiculous amount in fees just to get their transactions in the first halving block. ViaBTC mining pool was the first to mine the halving block 840,000 and according to bitcoinmmagazine, it has auctioned the first ever epic sat for 33.3 BTC, that's about $2.1 million dollars. Crazy right? If you were super rich, would you spend such amount of money on an epic sat? NB: Since there have been four Bitcoin halvings so far, there are only four rare epic sats and this is the first one ever sold.",

It seems crazy to us because to us that is a lot of BTC that you could do a lot of things with, however for the purchaser they're simply making a statement - whether that's buying the Bitcoin sign or owning the first sat from the latest halving. So to answer your question, yes I would if I was rich.However I am not, so my next option is to either start mining and pray I get some great miners fees or make a similar sign myself.",

Crazy right?Converting 33.3 BTC to a dust, 1 satoshi, is crazy.It is a great way to waste your precious bitcoin and the buyer must be very big Bitcoin whale with so many bitcoins to spend 33.3.BTC for fun like this. Or there is OTC deal behind the auction scene, that we can not know, to make this crazy auction that makes people feel jealous and greedy.What do the buyer expect?Value of it increases to 66.6 BTC or 99.9 BTC?It's unrealistic and I don't know about future, just think it's unrealistic.I would like to hold my 33.3 BTC and wait for Bitcoin price to double or tripple, it is more realistic and I will never lose my 33.3 BTC for unrealistic hope.",

Does owning the first sat after the halving has any significance and would bring me any profit? If the answer is no, then no. I don’t know how rich these people are but they must be since they are so comfortable wasting money around they probably don’t have anything to do with their money anymore.But maybe I am talking like this because I do not know what it feels like to be rich so every penny to me is valuable and shouldn’t be wasted.",

I don't want to believe that someone who has nothing will be willing to throw all their money on this, those people who play around with something like this are always very rich. Who am I to say that they wasted their money? It is only the spender who can know why they spend so much money on something that may never be worth anything someday. Either ways they should be fine, if they cab spend 33BTC plus on something like this then they must have more than 300s BTC or more? Just a guess, or maybe they are acting out on a info they got from somewhere, whatever the reason might be, this is for the super rich, we move.With my own present stage, to hell with any epic sat.",

It might be a piece of history that's also auctioned in other auction houses or what we see on the pawn stars. But, I'd pass on that thing. There's also a probable significance about the runes protocol at this moment but with this start, I guess that we'll start to see some of these auctioned mined block for every halving that we'll get and they'd put that into auction and up for sale. And gone will be the days that we'll just see the halving pass on as if nothing happened. The next halving on 2028 is likely to be a race for who's going to mine the 1,050,000th block.",

You have undeclared money from drug or arms sales and you sell something worth one satoshi for a couple of millions, that's it? The only thing is that you will pay 20% tax or so depending on where your tax residence is but you already have clean money.

He created money out of thin air, gave it a fake value and sold it to someone stupid.I think that we are experiencing the same here. They try to give fake value to fakely invented \"rate sats\". Someone stupid with money will think that it's a good opportunity to invest in rare sats and some people will make lots of bitcoins via this scheme.",
