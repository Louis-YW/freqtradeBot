  "content": "Hi, In my last post I advertised my developing skills to the people on this board, you guys reacted badly for a few reasons I can see now so im just gonna clear up a few things.In my last post I said that the casino would win 100% of the timeI am not rigging games, I am not a scammer but any smart person would know that Casinos are in the winning business, not the business of losing. If someone deposits on your site chances are they will not withdraw for a number of statistical AND psychological reasons. House edge can be changed by the owner but they usually sit around 2%. To all the gambling addicts on this board check out this link:https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/110415/why-does-house-always-win-look-casino-profitability.asp#:~:text=The%20house%20edge%2C%20which%20is,to%20a%20bit%20over%202%25.You guys accused me of selling nulled scriptsIf you want (request) me to install your shitty nulled scripts I can do that for you. It's not something I do regularly because they are often not worthwhile for the owner. This is because they are often riddled with malware such as backdoors and trojans and 100% of the time they will have holes.If you have any other questions, or simply want to comment calling me an arsehole do it in the comments and i will try to answer. If you are one of the people who commented \"stay away\" on my other post because you cant understand my english, shame on you.People asked me why I didnt use the site myselfI do. but it is risky and It lost value due to this recent crypto crash.Hope this has cleared some stuff up and proved im not some scammer. dm me on discord digby#9927 if you have any proper questions from a business perspective.",

Just like @PX-Z said, It is the attitude that drives other members react negatively on your last post. Criticism is important and believe me, Majority of the casino that has an ANN thread even those who are on the top right now recieves the same criticism as yours. I also suggest to put your advertisement on getting a potential client on Services because it is the proper board for your potential client finding. You can also strengthen your advertisement by showing your portfolio so no one will judge you as a scammer. I know you know that portfolio is important for a developer and it is one of the best thing to put in finding clients.",

I 100% agree since I'm one of those people. Well if I do win big I tend to withdraw, but for small wins, I just use them again to gamble later on, so I almost lose everything I deposit, but it's not exactly the case for everyone. That's why I reckon the \"100%\" profit brought the idea that you have some sort of malware or script hence the accusations (which I don't blame them for), not to mention the, well, attitude.Quote from: casinodevservices on November 21, 2022, 12:24:39 PMHope this has cleared some stuff up and proved im not some scammer. dm me on discord digby#9927 if you have any proper questions from a business perspective. Doesn't really clear up much since it's just your words. Though I guess anyone that is curious can pm you and ask about some past services you've given, if any, or a sample of a published site.

To answer your questions, I usually make custom scripts for people in the 5-10k range and in that case yes its turnkey. I do make cheaper ones but of course they are lower quality. Yes I sell the source code with it. I mean anywhere from 1-10k I'd suggest. The bankroll will build itself if you market correctly.",

IMO it's not proven anything yet. Also you should take any critizm from people if you offering your skills. You can just answer them by your way to prove you aren't scammer but not like this post only. (Maybe you can hire someone trusted on this forum, give them example your casino site, and let them vouch for your skills about that)",
