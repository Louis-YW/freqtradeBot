Some people speculated that if Tinubu becomes the president that it would be reversed and old naira notes would be spent with the new naira notes. But the court reversed the CBN naira redesign that caused suffering in Nigeria at the time. That was not long after the election, but before Tinubu was sworn in as the president.Quote from: Liliana1304 on June 10, 2023, 05:29:47 AMAs mata dey like dis, e go dey probed for him actions. How una see dis issue? This him suspension nah case wey dey long over due or he's just being the sacrificial lamb?Nigeria news was boring for me to read at that time and I was frustrated over what was happening in the country at the time as Nigeria completing becoming something else as people suffered more. But I read that 3 trillion or so of old naira was gotten from people and removed from circulation, but only 400 billion naira was redistributed at the time, into circulation. Which we should expect hardship for, and what that happened. After the court said people should be spending old notes with the new notes, and later as CBN told banks to follow the court order, the old naira notes I first collected in banks were all very new, clean and like what has not be spent before. The new notes (the one that was redesigned) were not as plenty as the old notes.Recently, in every 100 old notes, hardly will you see 2 new notes among. So what did CBN used the money for redesign for? Also hope he did not has hidden plan?Or maybe some people release their old notes to CBN that time and into circulation while storing new notes now that causing it. Let the government probe Emiefele, but I wish the government should do it right to know if he is guilty of misappropriation or not.",

      "body": "For me, I see the whole matter as political, because I can remember vividly well that before the election,  there was a rumor that the main aim of that newly designed Naira note & withdrawal of old notes from circulation was to prevent \"Bola Ahmed Tinubu\" from having the means to buy vote on Election Day & not the other cock & bull stories they claimed to have said, and Tinubu knew it very well and played his game the smart way which finally made him emerge the president of the federal Republic of Nigeria. So with that alone, I think was enough reason for President \"Bola Tinubu\" to have had him in mind since & long to have had him pay for what he did, which is what I see is happening right now. Because when it comes to corruption, Godwin Emefiele is not the first to have been mentioned to have mismanaged public fund. So why is he the first to be probe & arrested by DSS? You just think am.But that's my view on this, I don't know about yours",

No he has been suspended, there is no way back for him. But then, the man has stolen enough to live well after all the dust has died down. Well, I don't know about you but I am not surprised about his arrest by the DSS. Remember some months back when DSS was on his trail he had snuck out of the country when he was accused of funding terrorism. He had good intention because he wanted the terrorist to leave the farmers alone so that they can go to their farms and be able to repay their loans which was given to them by the CBN but then, as long as he gave the bandits money for it, it is funding of terrorist no matter his good intention. Another allegation he faced was the stamp duty charges which he is being invested by the DSS. They accuse him of turning a blind eye because he's colleagues in the banks were refusing to remit stamp duty charges from the thousand of transaction made by the banks. You know why I do not pity him? It is because he is a selfish man who instead would have done his bit to fix the economy was pleasing himself and the his political godfathers. I would never forget how he went about business - AbokiFx and freeze the funds in young Nigerians who were protesting, including the ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Also he gave out too many loans than Nigeria has ever had to the government and was not independent from them, Now they have thrown him under the bus. Sadly, this is Nigeria and we know nothing would happen to him.",

El-Rufai, the former governor of Kaduna state and some other APC governors made some investigations around thqt time as they believe what Emiefele was doing may affect APC candidates during election. It was from what he said that I suspected that Emiefele took this to Buhari directly without the knowledge of the Finance ministry, and Buhari told him to ahead. If Emiefele did not say any other thing than what has been revealed to the public that way as I believe he is also reading what is going on news, people will think it is his initiative.

That’s a first class treatment for a man who’s supposedly charged with all these crimes, don’t you think? We can all see how people suffered after the new naira was introduced. Emiefele just went ahead to Buhari without notifying the ministry of finance. Likely he did not speculate and analyze what could be the negative effect of inadequate new naira, but only giving the positive reasons to create new naira. I hope no mistake is found about this man, and it is not bad for justice to be done which is a lesson for other people.",

What I sense here was a deliberate act and they should sake him for jeopardizing his office as the Governor.

Naija na cruise and dem go just dey play us make we know understand wetin dem dey do.Na better cruise we dey so. It is just unfortunate for CBN  Gov., Emiefele, as he is the scapegoat in this case. We all know how former president Buhari stood behind him. He has served his country and even though we know some things are not clear fact, like how he managed to throw a whole country into jeopardy at a very crucial time, with the Naira redesign and other stringent new banking policies that were and is partly the result of why the Dollar rate was high, almost about #760 -$1. We as citizens at least know we would get to see the drama that would unfold and heave a sigh of relief or disgust in the end.The DSS that was reported to carry out the arrest, now say they do not have him in custody, the confusion has just started o. The issue should be how to settle the economy right now though, with looming strikes, hike in fares and charges, pressing debt margin, removing the CBN governor anyhow is just the right move, ahbeg.",
