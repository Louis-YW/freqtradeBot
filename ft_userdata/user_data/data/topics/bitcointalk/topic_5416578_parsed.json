The poor always buy from retailers because they are the final consumers, while the rich buys in bulk this means they buy directly from the wholesalers. Last week the bakery in my area closed down,due to inflation in flour price,thinking this will be the solution. There was no bread for three days. After three days,the bakery opened and everybody was happy but this time,the bread price increased with 40 naira. A pack of 6 was sold at 410 naira wholesale price,80 naira for one retail price.This shows that the retailer gets 70 naira profit after selling a pack of 6 which is 480 naira. When the bakery reopened a pack of 6 is sold at 450 naira to the retailer, the retailer now sells 100 per one,i.e 600 for the pack.The wholesaler buys from the bakery at the rate of 360 naira for a pack before shutdown and sells 410 naira, after re-open he buys at 400 to sell at 450 naira.  From calculation we can see that before the bakery shuts down,the wholesaler was making a profit of 14% but after the bakery reopened he makes a profit of 12%. The retailer was making a profit of 17% before shut down but after the bakery reopened, he makes a profit of 33% which is almost double of his profit. Is it that as long as you are selling essential commodities, inflation doesn't affects your business instead you make more profit.",

The retailer was making a profit of 17% before shut down but after the bakery reopened, he makes a profit of 33% which is almost double of his profit.Do you think reduction in calculation of the wholesaler profit down to 12% is correct ? He also have increase in price after reopening the bakery, so if there is an increase his profit should increase also. It won't drop from 14% to 12% because his price didn't drop. Price increase is what every business benefit from. It is a circle but maybe the retailer can benefit more for selling each one but to compare the turn over, the wholesale has more profit and advantage to sell more and have more return. And bread perish more in the store of a retailer than a bulk/wholesaler store. You also need to calculate the amount of bread that likely to perish in the retailer shop and remove it from the profit expectation.Quote from: Frankolala on October 10, 2022, 08:16:31 AMIs it that as long as you are selling essential commodities, inflation doesn't affects your business instead you make more profit.What I see is during inflation and the increase in price that the percentage of increase result in more profit than what it is before the inflation and this is why it is inflation. When price change profit increase and the money lose value to the ability to buy more product. It move from one store to another, one commodity to another like a circle, you gain profit while you are selling your commodity in your store but you also can't purchase with at old price of the goods or commodity you need so you add more money to do that. That is how inflation is. It affect the business because you need more capital or money to restock your goods/commodities when they finish. The market price won't remain the same in inflation and it affect the economy.",

The poor always buy from retailers because they are the final consumers, while the rich buys in bulk this means they buy directly from the wholesalers. Your analysis might be correct from some perspectives. But during inflation, the currency loses value and there is an increase in the price of goods and services. This would definitely lead to an increase in the cost of production. What the manufacturer simply does is increase the price of the goods and the wholesaler would push this extra cost to the retailer and finally, the consumers pay for all the extra cost. There might be some benefits of buying in bulk but the difference is sometimes not significant. Also buying in bulk also depends on your family size, house space, and electricity supply. It is also important to note that there are some essential goods that you cannot buy in large quantity because they are perishable or easily expires. Generally, inflation doesn't have any positive effect on any of the actors in the chain of distribution except the prices of goods and services are not adequately regulated and controlled by government agencies.    QuoteFrom calculation we can see that before the bakery shuts down,the wholesaler was making a profit of 14% but after the bakery reopened he makes a profit of 12%. The retailer was making a profit of 17% before shut down but after the bakery reopened, he makes a profit of 33% which is almost double of his profit.Is it that as long as you are selling essential commodities, inflation doesn't affects your business instead you make more profit.You just calculated only the selling price of the bread. You didn't consider that the value of the currency has been reduced because inflation reduces the buying power of people. Also, the wholesaler incurs other costs like transportation, shop rent, etc, that would have also increased. Yes, the wholesaler is making a profit but inflation has the tendency of making it lose value. Inflation affects all businesses regardless of the goods they sell because they have to buy raw materials and pay for other services.The sizes of your pictures are too large. I think it would look better if you reduce them. You can consider reducing their size using this  Code:[img width=350]https://i.imgur.com/onSwodf.jpeg[/img]",

The price of goods and assets is determined by the value that sellers receive for their goods and assets. The only way for sellers to receive more than what they get for the goods and assets they sell is if the goods increase in value.",

The poor always buy from retailers because they are the final consumers, while the rich buys in bulk this means they buy directly from the wholesalers.I don't know how did you come up with this conclusion. You should find and post some valid and accurate statistical data to backup your theory. Using one bakery shop as an example isn't enough.The rich don't always buy from wholesalers. The rich are rich because they have big income and lots of assets, not because they are buying from wholesalers instead of retailers. The retail shop owners have costs and their costs are increasing during times of high inflation. The same thing applies to the manufacturers and the wholesalers. The retail shop owners usually increase the prices as the last resort. They don't want to increase the prices, because the retail industry is so competitive. Maybe the bakery shop in your area doesn't have any competitors, so the owner wants to take advantage of his \"monopoly\".",

Especially companies that sell essential commodities are aware that consumers can't stay away and have to keep buying no matter what the prices. The politicians keep talking about economy downturns and that things will get worse, yet many companies have strong revenues and pay their employees big bonuses. I wish the government would keep an closer eye that companies don't increase their prices too quickly. Every price raise that is not necessary except to make higher profits will increase the inflation even more. Once the overall inflation is above 10%, the government should step in. Otherwise we face the risk of a downward spiral.",

Those two are technically owned by those who have made the biggest investment (vehicles and machinary) in order to produce the flour and deliver it so I think it makes sense they're first to put up their prices from inflation (it might not be or seem fair though).",

Also, the wholesalers have no other choice but to keep their markups at the minimum to still make a sale and may even result to them closing shops or slowing down their restocking since not a lot is buying anyway. It's a chain reaction that is not pretty to look at.",

Err.. retailers make more than wholesalers all the time. The business of wholesalers is selling in bulk and making their money through shifting stock at a large scale. In fact it is always a tug of war, where retailers are usually able to apply more pressure to wholesalers, in the form of demanding better pricing, because they actually call the shots in this business relationship. Wholesalers often cannot replace their customers easily and will usually accept lower margins to keep business going. For wholesalers they simply have to pass the pressure on to their suppliers or lose a proportion of their revenue. None of this is new and doesn't change much during recession type circumstances.",

He is having chains of people coming but the retailer is not that way. The patronage is not much but individual number is small comparing to number that wholesaler have and that is meaning greater chance of profit also.",

The producer doesn't have this problem, he knows in advance because of long contracts what he has to produce each day and who is going to buy, the retailer has to deal every day with up and downwards demand and take the risks.",

So instead of paying for the safe destruction of food (which is expensive), some even manage to sell the meat and make money, but some would just say \"what's new in the Balkans\" - everything and everyone has its price and every product has its buyer.Most people consider inflation as a negative phenomenon, but some people welcome it with open arms, because it is a time for extra profit for those who know how to use it.",
