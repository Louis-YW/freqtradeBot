  "content": "Hello,maybe you can help me here?I've been trying to make a BTC transfer from my ledger for a few days, unfortunately without success because the Ledger Live software crashes every time.In the Windows task manager, I can see that the app's energy requirements are very high, I think that's why the app is crashing.I've now tried it with Electrum, unfortunately I can't get any further there either. The stocks were loaded correctly, but if I want to send an amount, a window comes up saying: \"Transaction receipts are being prepared... (phase1, 3/349)\" I just let the program run, after approx. 9 hours, it was at some point 103/349. after sometime, there was again an error message and the transaction was not executed. Hardware and software are both updated, I tried it on different computers/systems (Mac Book, Windows), unfortunately without success.I wrote to Ledger 2 days ago, unfortunately without an answer so far. I have the suspicion that the programs are overwhelmed with the many small BTC inputs, since I have been getting smaller amounts transferred every day for a long time. Anyone have any ideas on how to get my inventory?",

I had a similar problem as you when I first used Electrum many years ago and the way I solved it was to extract the private key from each address and enter it in another wallet. Of course, you have the problem that your main wallet is actually a hardware wallet, and accordingly you cannot see your private keys in Electrum - and not even in Ledger Live as far as I know.The last option would be to try to extract your private keys from your seed, but that would mean that the seed is compromised. You can read more about it here - but I recommend that you use it as a last option, and that you be extremely careful in every step.How to find out your private key by SEED phrase.",

So, with Ctrl-click you select some inputs, then right-click and press Spend. Only those inputs will be used in the next transaction.You had an address in clipboard, now go to Send tab and send the max amount to this address (CTRL-V). The max amount will be only from those selected inputs.Repeat this a couple of times with the smaller inputs until you get much shorter list of inputs. But not too small inputs.That 50 I've said .. you'll adjust depending on how long the operation takes and whether it fails.Also, if the transaction fee is way too big (even at 1 sat/vByte), then you may want to do the operation again with a different set of inputs, by skipping more of the smaller ones.Quote from: Moeter81 on February 24, 2023, 04:01:54 PMthe nano s has no BTNano S has no BT, but with the right cable or adapter I do use mine with smartphone now and then.However, that's not relevant for now.

However, for 10-15 inputs it took me too more than a minute (yeah, it cannot really compare with your 10 minutes for 2 inputs).The problem is that each such transaction you make is on-chain, hence it costs you transaction fees, so it would be advisable to try to get more inputs together.PS. Be careful to not pay too big fee either (but I'd advise not the smallest either, i.e. at very least 1.1 sat/vByte)",
