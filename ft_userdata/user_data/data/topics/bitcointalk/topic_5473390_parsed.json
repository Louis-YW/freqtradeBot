Avoid. If you want to trade volatile coins, you can see them on common exchanges like Bybit, Mexc, Binance, OKX and many others. I mean coins among first 500 in marketcap, unlike the one you asked that is not among first 2500 coins.",

Its understandable on why you are really that planning to touch up these low liquidity coins but if we do try to look up on the risks then i should say that its never been worth to take up the risksnot unless if you do accept it out and could bare it.",

If it does not appear on centralized exchange, only is available for trading at decentralized exchange, it is risky if you have the token.

If you take a closer look, PulseX is like an instant exchange similar to Uniswap, but it supports only a few coins. The good news is I saw PLSX/USDC listed there, so you can definitely swap it directly on the original PLSX platform.Because this coin doesn't have a strong reputation, you should be cautious when holding it. In terms of the 24-hour trading volume, according to data on CoinGecko, it's a bit underwhelming, with over $2 million. I'm not entirely convinced by the available data myself. As a consideration, if you're thinking of buying a \"shit coin,\" it might be safer to get one from well known exchanges like Binance or Okex. I believe it's a more secure and trustworthy process.I found this coin, traded on safetrade https://coinmarketcap.com/id/exchanges/safetrade/",

This is a trap before entering just check the market price and the buy/sell price of these tokens as there will be a huge difference in buying and selling price, reason I am mentioning this here is that people usually think that low liquidity coins have good fluctuation and it can give them quick profits and obviously that comes with a high risk factor but here even if the price increases you will not find buyer to buy shit coins as buy orders will never be even close to the market price. I have even tried other aspects like ETFs but got similar result, better to stay away from these low and low liquidity cap shitcoins.",

Usually people who trade coins with low trading volume because they only want to sell their coins because it is the result of an airdrop or when they enter a pump and dump group, because coins like that will be targeted by groups where the way to make a profit is by trading pump and dump, or have you heard or read news about the development of this coin? and hope that there will be a pump that benefits you because you already have the coins.If you want to be serious about trading and choosing a coin like that will only make you stressed because the movement will be very slow, so I suspect there is something that makes you ask about this coin.",

One of my golden rules is never to trade low market cap coins (I never trade anything under 1 billion market cap). With such coins, the swings can be triggered by very small orders and shoot you out of the market, so they are much more difficult to assess than Bitcoin, ETH and co. If you like the thrill, you can bet on x1000 leverage with Bitcoin, which will give you roughly the same result.",

With such coins, the swings can be triggered by very small orders and shoot you out of the market, so they are much more difficult to assess than Bitcoin, ETH and co. With small cap coins, people think they can find hidden gems but they have to gamble with hidden gems that mostly won't make them a fortune but big loss. Small cap coins can be from small developers team with limited resources to build up their projects and don't have good marketing too.Big cap coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum are safest choices in cryptocurrency market and if an investor can hold Bitcoin or Ethereum, profit will come. Less risk, more safety and profit is like guarantee. They will not find it with hidden gems and risk to lose money through hidden gems is very big.With small cap coins, small trading volume and big buying or selling order can cause price change a lot. Big investors don't pick hidden gems as their most favorite because of price slip from their big orders.",

Nobody bothers you to keep most of your main portfolio in Bitcoin, and at the same time buy several tokens that, in your opinion, can show very good growth, but another question is whether you can find that same token among thousands that can grow so much that it it was worth the time. Tokens with low liquidity are easier to manipulate, this is true, and if you see that in this token there is a manipulator that accumulates a position and you expect that there will be growth, then you can try to take advantage of this, but I would not place high hopes on such investments.",
