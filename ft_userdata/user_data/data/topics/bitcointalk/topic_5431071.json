But my question is whether the rules for accepting payments with bitcoin in your area are allowed? I'm just worried about you. However, if there is no special attention from local government regulations regarding this matter, then maybe it will not be a problem. and of course it would be very interesting if you really accept payments with bitcoin. this will interest people who want to experience their first experience of making payments with bitcoin directly.and how to receive payments by bitcoin is quite simple as explained by the others above.",

I believe others who know you would definitely follow your steps as it would be a competition now since they have seen you do such. This would ease your customers some stress for those who are into bitcoin and also it would help create awareness to those patronizing you and are not informed properly about bitcoin. You will have a work to do by explaining to them how the process works. As for the barcode, it is very easy to generate. As far as you have a bitcoin wallet address, automatically you have a barcode attached to that particular wallet address. If you are using trust wallet for instance, when you open your wallet dashboard,  you click on bitcoin then the next page pops up and you will see send and receive, you click on receive then your address and barcode pops up that's it for you. You can screenshot it for printing. That would be very much  easier and faster. I hope this suggestion helps a little",

Just a few tips that before accepting the payments, make sure that cryptocurrencies are legal in your country, else if it isn’t, then you might seriously face legal issues. Moreover you can’t send BTC to bar codes, rather a QR code is attached with Bitcoin addresses. Many popular wallets like Electreum and Blockchain.com have QR code feature. Just print it out, and whenever someone wants to send Bitcoins, they will scan the QR code and will send the desired amount.",

You may want to generate a new address every few buys.",

It’s custodial wallet but most of the people here that has Bitcoin use it in there everyday transactions so I’m the one who adjust and use this wallet to received there Bitcoin payment and just transfer it to my wallet for fast transfer since it’s transaction is just internal transfer which doesn’t need confirmation.Congratulations in advance for implementing Bitcoin as payment to your business.",

I know some 3rd party apps as well which provide this facility. Even Binance pay is an option but obviously it's more like a 3rd party wallet as they don't provide you the key.",

You might consider using QR code instead of barcode. QR code is widely in use right now and most of the smartphones today can read QR code compared to the barcode. Most wallets today have a  QR code address generator which can be use for receiving bitcoins. I also suggest to use static bitcoin address for receiving payments given that there might be a unseen confusion when you audit your sales. But if you have a wallet address in mind to use on your sales, You can follow @bitmover instructions",

Yea, the idea is pretty good, or you may use the payment gateway to change address every time.

Imagine when you go somewhere and they ask you to scan the paper that's attached on the window with adhesive tape. Cmon, I wouldn't enter that store again.Invest a little bit and implement payment system where unique address will be generated for your customers. I suggest you to let them choose between Legacy Address and Segwit Address. It will be better if you add not only bitcoin but other useful and popular altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple, Matic, Litecoin, etc.This payment method should be comfortable for you too, that's why I suggest you to invest a little bit in payment system. It will be comfortable if user has a touchscreen panel where he chooses coin type, address type and then scans the QR code from that screen.",

For local business, bitcoin payment is not the primary option of payment. Just a small, well designed cardboard with a QR code on it for scan and pay can make the job done.
