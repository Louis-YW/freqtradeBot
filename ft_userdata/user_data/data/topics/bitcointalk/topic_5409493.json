  "content": "Hi All,I have had this idea from the very start of the Bitcoin Colouring Book project andI think and hope people findit interesting and will participate apologies for all the \"ands\"The idea is to have a group of people around the world colour part of 1 book, lets say #50and then raffle it off for free!The group of people would be chosen by raffle also.I kick it off, colour 1 page and then post to the next person who in turn colours a page oftheir liking and posts it on. Obviously you will incur a cost of having to post it to the nextin line.The last and 12th person in the line holds the book until the raffle is complete and thenposts it to the winner.Its supposed to be a fun project and another give back to the community and should alsogain added value from being created in part by the group and potentially some legends of the Collectibles BoardSo post up what you think!Quote from: aoluain on August 22, 2022, 06:35:52 AMHere is the list of participants from 21/08/2022Markzellers mx12.levinsxSlyyCryptogreatdaneowlcatzdoblezerominerjonesgiammangiatoMoparMiningLLCZipRegTimelordTimelordRemsjackOk so this is how I see it happening:1. One page for everyone except Timelord2067 as he would like two of his mates tocolour a page each, and he bought 2 books which I guess are for those mates, I'm ok with that.[/i][/sup]2. As mentioned above its freestyle so you can colour a printed page how you like, pencil,pen, marker*, paint, pastel**, airbrush if you have the skill or collage, but I wouldlike if the blank pages are kept blank. Everyones ability is different, I think we all understand that,so no worries about what you can or cannot do, it has to be enjoyable.3. You can pick whatever page is available, obviously except person #12 on the list, but thosepeople who are the last positions on the list get to see in the flesh all of the other work!4. We have 3 continents involved, Europe, Australia and America, I guess we send the book East,there is no point sending it to Australia to come back to Europe then on to America and back againto Europe, So I think we keep it as fluid as this:I know doblezero is in Europe so I will lost the book there, when he/she is finished they post theirwork in the thread and the next European puts their hand up and doblezero posts to them. what do you all think?I have made a list predetermining the journey of the book.5. Once the book is posted initially by myself, I wont see it again. At the end the person in 12th spotholds onto the book until the winner of the raffle/auction is decided.6. Raffle or Auction? a free raffle for the BCT community or an Auction to be split 11 ways for all the Artists?or charity as mentioned earlier on?* using felt tip markers with result in a lot of bleeding I'm suspecting and may not be handy in finer details** pastels, chalk or wax, will need fixing when complete.",

You would set the rules like what size/style pen etc, then we draw stuff to color. Either way, I'm down for this, it sounds like it may be a forum-legendary thread/coloring book someday! Ofc everyone should sign their page IMO so we know who did what too!",

I certainly wouldnt be the person to persue that avenue, and I would concurwith @Cryptogreatdane.But! maybe some of the legends who have been on this board and are still here would be up for participating?I really wanted this like the original Colouring Book to be specific to the forum and tomake it \"our\" community event.@owlcatz - yea thats a nice twist and something which goes with my idea above.@xSlyy - sounds interesting! especially the beer part!",
