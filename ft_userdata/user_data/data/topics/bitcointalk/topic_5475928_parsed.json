Welcome to BSV community. Be our friendI can't promise anything about payment. Assistant positions are already occupiedListen, did you read what I said about my girl etc on meta? I wasn't joking. Now since I'm a sick person, at least I'm not desperate like you, I mean look at your own post.I wanted to post and say \"well, that was fast\" and laugh at you, for being so desperate and gullible. But I spared you.Now one thing you should know, when someone insults me, they will pay the price, and if you believe I insulted you first, think again, I have your post where you tried to persuade people to use your scam coin.In here we strive for freedom under the rules of law, you on the other hand, advocate for censorship and dictate your the opinions of a few to your userbase.You are a disgrace for anything related to fighting for freedom, therefore your opinion is NOT valid.OK, welcome. LolWhich services do you refer to? I mean I can't even remove my own tags no matter how wrong they are.Also if sm posted here, don't quote her, I will put you on ignore as well, I will never talk or engage with such hateful person anymore. You along with anyone else, can show yourselves to my trust page, Â and remember, a miserable jobless clown has nothing to lose, you bullies however.",

LolzI don't see anything wrong in my suggestion, as I have said this in the past, we don't care who is satoshi in real life because he doesn't own the name Bitcoin, that is why we believe anyone trying to claim to be him and demand ownership of the name Bitcoin, is considered a fraud.So when I mix jokes and profanity to convey a meaning, because I don't want to explain myself in long posts.Â  By reading that strike through line, now you realize that we are not interested in knowing satoshi's real identity, why? Because it will destroy his legendary image in the world.Can you imagine him being active here and a nobody like me, talks like garbage to him? How humiliating it could be for him? I mean even now I have some criticisms posted from time to time, but since he is not active here to respond, his image will remain the same \"legendary\".So spare me the dignity lessons, you can not indignify me, because your opinion is NOT valid.",
