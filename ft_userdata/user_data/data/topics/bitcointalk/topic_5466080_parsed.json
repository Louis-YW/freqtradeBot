  "content": "I introduced Crypto payment to my farm some months ago when we were suffering from a NO CASH SYSTEM. During this period, there was a crisis with Nigeria currency as new naira note was introduced but this new note wasn't in circulation. This really affected alot of businesses as transaction was mostly done with bank transfer. Due to our bad banking system, sometimes most money transfer was delayed and this made business transaction to be abit difficult. With this, I thought of a solution and I came up with the use of crypto as part of my payment method. I decided to add crypto as part of my payment option on my flier.This was done because of two main reason, which includes:ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ Crypto are very fast when it comes to transfer. This will help to make my transaction fast therefore solving the bad Network system of some banks.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰It will help to make people aware about crypto especially Bitcoin in my localty.After the introduction of crypto, the no cash stuff ended and no purchase was made with crypto from me. I never give up, I keep advertising to people that I accept both fiat, BITCOIN and USDT as my payment options. With this people start asking me questions about crypto within the farm and was able to convince some into the crypto world. This has helped me to achieve my second aim of introducing crypto payment into my farming business.Recently, a customer made a purchase with USDT. This was the first purchase made with crypto since the introduction of crypto as part of my payment option and this made me so happy as my long term aim was achieved. I'm also full of joy as my aim of introducing crypto into my farming business was fully achieve. I decided to share this post to encourage others with similar issue.CONCLUSIONNever relent in anything you believe in. It may take sometimes for it to happen but if you believe and work towards it, it will definitely happen.",

ThanksWell, it doesn't really change my argument. What I was saying is that someone who pays you in cash or with a debit or credit card is not going to pay extra, but if they pay you in Bitcoin or USDT they are going to have to pay fees to send you the transaction. So, I think for this reason it will not become a very popular means of payment, although in some cases, someone who has a lot of Bitcoin or USDT may prefer to pay you with them. About guiding you, well, the only thing I recommend is to keep your Bitcoin and USDT in a Hardware Wallet, but other than that I can't think of much.",

Some banks don't have a strong network that can perform 100% for a few hours, but with the help of crypto currency (Bitcoin as number one) the stress can be reduced.Anyway, you have done well to spread the awareness of Bitcoin in your locality. Moreover, it would be nice if you told us the type of business you do. Maybe we might need your services here  . Most of us experienced that issue in Nigeria, and that redesign of the naira note helps Bitcoin to spread. People who have not used Bitcoin for the first time start using Bitcoin because transactions have been delayed and limited. The lightening network helps make Bitcoin transactions faster and unlimited.",

It may take some time for it to happen but if you believe and work towards it, it will happen.You have done a great job by creating a means of keeping your business going by accepting Bitcoin and USDT as a medium of payment in your business and also sending a positive impact on Bitcoin. When the new naira was redesigned in Nigeria people found it difficult to withdraw money and received money in their bank account, even the Binance exchange gave up to 48 hours of going to appeal if users from Nigeria did not receive their money in their bank account in Binance P2P trading. I believe those newbies who managed to pay with Bitcoin or USDT in your business have seen the benefits of Bitcoin when the government is not there to help its citizens and they will want to learn more about Bitcoin in case something like this happens again.",

For this reason,you should move your topic to altcoin board.

Not sure how it works on establishment or does an owner need a personal wallet for this or a machine has built in system for crypto payment.

You said you started accepting crypto which I think it should be \"started accepting Bitcoin payment.\" If your business has started accepting crypto payments, does that mean that even if I come to your shop and decide to pay you with XRP, ADA, or perhaps some new altcoins, you will accept them? In my shop, I accept Bitcoin payments, and my notice is only for Bitcoin payments, but I have also received BUSD and USDt payments based on requests the customer made. Someone can come to your shop and say they have some shitcoins they want to pay you with and buy your goods, but if you decline, they will ask why you then gave notice that you accept crypto payments, you should be specific.",

Most bitcoin transaction takes on average 10 minutes for a single confirmation. Since, I guess the amount isn't high, you wait for one confirmation or more? Or do you accept the payments without network confirmation (as long as you see they have paid enough fees of course)? But don't you go back to FIAT after selling something in bitcoin? I mean, don't you sell the crypto later so you can pay the bills and purchase necessary things for your business since I am almost pretty much sure you won't be able to use crypto. In this case, aren't you back facing the same issue with your local currency and banks?",

As much as we want Bitcoin to be used as a mode of payment, that seems can't be especially with its current 'state'. Fees are still high and market price is still volatile and these factors would make you hesitate to do so, and that's just normal. For now stablecoins would be better with daily transactions if circumstances won't prohibit you in your area. Bitcoin and orher decentralized cryptos are being used with huge transactions 'coz in such way, paying extra would be fine in exchange for anonymity and avoidance with taxes. Many people are aware of this industry already but not everyone would be too eager to face losses and some disadvantages in exchange for vision for this industry.
