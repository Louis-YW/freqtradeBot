So I've got to pay them. Are they regulated enough that I can be confident that they won't just run off with my money once I've paid them? The exchanges are not regulated but they are centralized which makes it similar to been regulated since it is controlled by a body. You can buy from them but do not leave it on there because they could encounter any problem like hack or something similar which will affect your funds saved there.Quote from: Arbuxy on April 28, 2023, 11:37:25 AM Can I pay be credit card? Then, once I have bought from the broker or exchange, do they transfer the crypto to a wallet that I control? Or do they keep the crypto in their own wallet as a custodian? If so, again, how can I trust them? Yes some Exchanges support the use of credit card but it depends on your country’s restrictions on cryptocurrency, if you can’t use the credit card then you have to use the P2P method. They do not transfer to your own wallet but rather they keep it in a custodian wallet they created for you on the exchange. So you can withdraw to your preferred cold wallet which is the best to do. Quote from: Arbuxy on April 28, 2023, 11:37:25 AMAlso, is there an advantage to buying from a broker over buying on an exchange?It is almost same if it is not a P2P transaction on a centralized exchange. It is more secure to buy it physically from someone known but this could also be risky in a country where cryptocurrency is banned.",

      "body": "I've bought bitcoin from a broker at their office, used an ATM and of course an online exchange. If a broker has an office, just go there. Payments depend on where you're located. I don't know if they accept credit cards in Africa, for instance, but in the EU card payments are more common than cash. You can call them beforehand and ask what payment methods they accept. My local broker accepts cash, cards, paypal, even traditional bank transfers, although in such case you need to pay more for instant transfer, or wire money a day before you come to the office. If you're afraid something can go wrong, take a friend or a family member with you, so that you have a witness. I've never heard of a broker running away after being paid, but better be safe than sorry. Check if there are ATMs somewhere near you. It works pretty much like a broker. You can install a phone wallet, scan the qr code in the ATH so you don't have to worry about making a mistake in the address and then you choose how much you want to buy, pay with your credit card and the coins are automatically sent to your address. When you buy from a physical exchange, DEX, or an ATM they always send it to your own address. Only online exchanges like Coinbase, or Binance assign a custodial address to your account, but you can move your coins to your own wallet right after buying.

Very nice!Quote from: Arbuxy on April 28, 2023, 11:37:25 AMIf I want to buy crypto, then I believe I have to go to a broker or an exchange (assuming I don't know someone who wants to sell me some). So I've got to pay them. Are they regulated enough that I can be confident that they won't just run off with my money once I've paid them? Can I pay be credit card? Then, once I have bought from the broker or exchange, do they transfer the crypto to a wallet that I control? Or do they keep the crypto in their own wallet as a custodian? If so, again, how can I trust them? You have to keep your eyes open, since the space is full of scammers, some even claiming to be good businesses (or even impersonating such businesses).So you have to do a proper research on where you buy your coins from and pick a business/method that has already passed the test of time.And indeed, you have to make sure you withdraw the coins to your own custody, just this means yet another learning curve, since it has plenty of security implications.If you don't have computer management/install skills or the amount of cash you want to spend on buying coins is 4 digits or more I recommend you just do a quick research and buy a hardware wallet, they're the easiest path for \"safe enough\" self-custody.It worth mentioning here that some exchanges may offer you (cheaper) bitcoin withdrawals on other chains (usually BSC or ETH). Beware, those are not bitcoins, those are altcoins (\"wrapped\" bitcoins) and I would stay away of those.Quote from: Arbuxy on April 28, 2023, 11:37:25 AMAlso, is there an advantage to buying from a broker over buying on an exchange?Some ask for KYC and not everybody wants to give that out.Then the known exchanges have quite some not-so-small withdrawal fees (they falsely call them transaction or network fees, but it's more than that), hence if somebody buys small amounts sometimes the brokers come out cheaper (although the price is bad/expensive, if we consider/add the withdrawal fee too then it may come out cheaper).",

Nope, they don't transfer it to your own wallet and that's something that you have to do it by yourself.

      "body": "When buying cryptocurrencies, it is important to ensure that you use a reputable broker or exchange. There are many established and regulated exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, which have a solid reputation and have been operating for many years. These exchanges are regulated by various authorities, such as the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK or the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US, which helps to provide a level of trust and protection for investors.When it comes to payment methods, most exchanges will accept payments via bank transfer or credit/debit card. However, it is important to note that some payment methods may be subject to additional fees. Credit card payments may also be subject to a credit limit, so it is important to check the terms and conditions before making a payment.Once you have purchased your cryptocurrencies, you can transfer them to a wallet that you control. This provides you with greater control and security over your cryptocurrencies. However, some exchanges also offer custodial wallets, which means that they hold the cryptocurrencies on your behalf. While this can be convenient, it is important to remember that the exchange is responsible for the security of your cryptocurrencies.When it comes to buying from a broker versus buying on an exchange, there are a few differences. Brokers typically offer a simpler buying process and may accept a wider range of payment methods. However, they may also charge higher fees than exchanges. Exchanges, on the other hand, typically offer a wider range of cryptocurrencies to buy and sell, and may offer more advanced trading features. It ultimately depends on your individual needs and preferences",

Someone was definitely a newbie for FTX at that time and they didn't expect it.Recommending Binance? You never know when they will freeze your account, the chance is low but there's still a chance. You possibly know that Binance has detected a mixer transaction from a user and freeze their account first though later, Binance refunded them? Because the amount was somewhat big and at that time, almost all the media covered the news so Binance had no other choice but refunding. When it comes to a small amount, no media will know, nor they will cover the news. So, your account will be frozen forever lol.
