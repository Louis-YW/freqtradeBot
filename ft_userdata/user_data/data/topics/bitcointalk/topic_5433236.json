      "body": "Celcius stopped paying core scientific so core scientific is shutting down their miners. No different then any other hosting company shutting down equipment that they are not getting paid to host. It's not a lot in the grand scheme of things in terms of BTC mining. If the $2 million cost per month is accurate then it's good for them since they were obviously never going to get paid. I'm surprised it took them this long, although they might have had to follow their contract about keeping them on until payments were a certain number of days late.-Dave",

The rest of the reason for shutting down the mining machines is explained in the article and DaveF explained them above as well.",

Is it profitible to buy miners now and sell them nearer the halving? Would a production company want to buy then to make sure their prices don't fall further?",

Since this did not happen means that there was nobody willing to buy this part of the business. So we can assume this business was loosing money anyway and this could only the beginning of difficulty collapsing.",

Source: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/core-scientific-shut-down-thousands-bankrupt-celsius-bitcoin-mining-rigs-2023-1It's a managed mining services for a bankrupt company that are getting shut down. Celcius has already filed for bankruptcy so they are unable to pay the maintenance fees for the miners which were being managed by Core Scientific. So the decision is fair! I don't think there will be any issue in the crypto ecosystem due to this decision of Core Scientific. If they find any other company willing to buy their managed mining services, they might turn them on again!",

For any business that is last resort if they fail to achieve given goals and pay offs. They have taken good decision because keeping the mining farm alive without any income is like burning energy and resources to achieve nothing in return. In addition to this, it won’t be affecting bitcoin or its price or anything else. Only other miners will get benefited because there is one competition less in the market.",

      "body": "reading previous news CORZ was charging its customers $0.10c/kwh electric(higher than previous months, and higher than national average electric costs) which put the costs at more then the market rate of bitcoin (unprofitable mining)thus many customers can rightfully so. stop paying ongoing hosting contracts, and retrieve their asics via corz sending the customers asics back to the customer or forward the asics to another hosting business. celsius was already debating with CORZ about thishttps://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-network-defaults-on-payments-to-core-scientific-causing-financial-unrestQuoteIn the court filings, Celsius alleges that Core Scientific delayed mining rig deployment and supplied them with less power than required under their contract. Celsius is reportedly seeking a court order holding Core in contempt and ordering it to fulfill its obligations. Meanwhile, Core requested the court to compel Celsius to pay past-due bills or allow it to serve the contract.massive cost changeus national rates went from a average$0.0744 ->$0.0861 (oct 21-oct22)yes corz charged a $0.0752 -> $0.0943 (2021-july 2022)then asked for over $0.10 from august onwardsbasically $0.014 extra than national average (16%)the initial 2021 ask by coz was a 0.0752 ask which was 1.1% above averagein short corz was trying to demand an extra 15% profit for corz, while supplying celsius with less coin value thus not break even or profit compared to market rate(celsius losing value by continuing contract but corz making excess profit by continuing contract)anywaysthere is alot more to this celsius-corz saga where it appears that corz is being shady in parts too",

      "body": "It seems like a business decision, if mining bitcoin stops being profitable, then they would stop mining and instead they would use the ones they have to sell and make a profit for a while longer. Not like they were making a profit and selling every single bitcoin they had when they mined, they were probably just selling the costs, and keeping some of the profits in bitcoin.This way they could stop now, have very low cost (operational) and they could sell the ones they saved until bitcoin is profitable again to mine. This would be a smart way to approach for sure, not a great way but a smart way. I think they will go with that route very soon.",
