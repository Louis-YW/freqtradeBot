My reasoning was that governments would eventually win the war against decentralised finance. I'm still not sure but I give BTC a chance.Current financial situation:About 55k euros left in savings, originally intended as a deposit to buy a house. Car is paid. It would make me 15k if I sell but I am hesitant about it.That would require me to buy a new car for at least 300 euros/month of downpayment.

One year for now I consider paying cheap rent rather than taking an expensive mortgage.I'm engaged and my fiancé has a job.

I think I'll keep it. Is 100/week on DCA solid? If we do take a mortgage, that would put a lot of pressure on us and there would be no money left for DCA.Also, do people generally DCA throughout bull markets or only when BTC is in a bear market?I don't intend to sell my BTC. I don't know how much BTC is realistic to end up with by 2030 with this plan.I guess it depends if the price of BTC will explode or not.

It's not about the amount of money you are going to spend because if you bought BTC at the current price then the amount of BTC you will get is almost the same value as what you have spent (that's already deducted with the fee if there's a fee when buying BTC). Well, if the BTC goes through the roof then the 400 you spent within the month won't be the same value as before. If you bought BTC in one go, let's say you have 25k and bought BTC where it's price is at 25K per BTC FOR EXAMPLE then you will have 1 BTC but if you bought BTC at different price for 5 times like 25K per 1 BTC, 20k per BTC, 15k per BTC, 10k per BTC and 30k per BTC then you would have more than 1.something BTC unlike having only 1 BTC in one buy.

If I am wrong about this, I won't be in trouble.These are all great plans and it looks like you already have everything laid out nicely. Regarding the amount of money for DCA, : There is no \"best\" amount as it is largely dependent on your capital so it differs per user. Given the amount of £100 per week you mentioned, that's a pretty based amount. If you have more then you can increase it. Only you would know the suitable amount since it's your capital. What I would add is that you should be patient enough to time your DCA entries so when your buy-in price gets averaged out, it would leave you in a more better position.Best bet would be to buy during dips - not before.",

You can buy a car with cash after investing in bitcoin for some time and get returns - but of course you need to consider all the risk consequences.Most investors recommend me not to invest more than 15% of my portfolio in one asset. I had 67k and put 12k into BTC last week. I can go larger but I don't know if this is smart for various reasons:1) All economists I know, say that we are heading into an economic depression and this is bearish for BTC. Most people tell me that there will be better times to invest. They tell me that the idea of BTC price explosion is now being sold, so that we buy at a high price. And that later on we could be scared into selling when the price comes down a lot. For example in an economic depression, or when the government goes after BTC holders.2) Investing more than 15% of my portfolio may cause the bank to contact the tax office. 3) I still have to learn how to manage my wallet. I'm studying now about how to avoid risks. I take this very seriouslyQuoteThis is definitely not financial advice - but the potential future price of bitcoin is much better than you doing a $100 per week DCA. If I were you, I would place 20% to 50% of my budget in bitcoin, while the rest would be used for emergency funds and other needs.I felt a lot of FOMO last week, just prior to buying.I sleep better now because I have some exposure to BTC. If the price skyrockets, I'll profit from it. If the price comes down a lot at some point, I have an opportunity to buy more. Either way there is a positive side to it. But in both situations it is important that I keep enough savings to live comfortably.Buying more now at 41k euros probably is not bad in the long run. But with the economic situation ahead I am not convinced that we'll never see the price get back under 25k. I think it' more likely the price will come down again at some point. I just invested last week in case I am wrong.",

Even you are living in a developed country, if you can do it, you already do better investment plan than many people.Enter $100 and time (months) you want to DCA, and see how it can help your investment.https://dcabtc.com/https://costavg.com/",

Your plan to invest €100/week could be a solid one as DCA is a proven strategy. Maybe €30k savings is in line with financial prudence, I think. This is really necessary for unexpected expenses, emergencies, or other investment opportunities. If you believe potential, investing a portion of your savings could prove fruitful. But do remember, btc and other cryptos are highly volatile and thus come with risks. Try not just Bitcoin and housing could be beneficial for diversification. Consider a mix of cryptos, stocks, ETFs, bonds, etc.",

Regardless of the season, it is important to do DCA so you can consistently place a purchase and increase the volume of your bitcoin portfolio faster. And my only advice is that, only invest an amount that you can afford to lose, an amount that is not intended to pay your bills or buy a house or car. Otherwise, once your investment did not work as planned, your life will also turn into mess.I agree when you said that doing DCA is not on how much you invest but on how consistent you are. If you are quite hesitant about 100 euros per week, then adjust it lower than that as long as you can perform DCA in a consistent manner.",

It's not about the amount of what you have spent per week but about the total amount of money that you will spent buying until you are going to do what you are planning. Right now, you have 0.3 BTC which is atleast around 12k Euros and if you spend 100/week then your total BTC will be different compared to buying BTC in bulk and if the time comes then you'll gain profit. I know you have that balance but you didn't explain how much you are going to spend.At 100 euros/week that would be 400/month or 5k per year. I intend to do this for 5 years, so about 25k. Unless BTC goes through the roof so much that 400/month becomes insignificant. I would think differently, and you said you have 55K in savings already which means you can go all in now like buy for 25K straight and wait for the next 5 years that is definitely a lot more returns than investing every week a 100 but still it is your decision and how much you are willing to risk.By going all in still you will have 30K balance left with you and the 400 euros that you want to invest can be used on your other chores but I will not be buying a car right now and just keep the old one for as long as it runs then buy one for the downpayment.",
