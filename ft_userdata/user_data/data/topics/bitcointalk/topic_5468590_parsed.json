Before asking for the loan you didn't have any negative trusts but now your account's ruined.Quote from: amazingseller1 on September 29, 2023, 08:30:00 PMthis will sound crazyand maybe the Legendary ranks will start make jokes as they always do but i need 30 BTC ASAP in 1 week they will get back 31BTC",

How's a user supposed to give 30BTC to a stranger. Your account's showing bad trust. You won't get small loans without collateral so why begin at 30BTC you should've lowered the amount.Quote from: amazingseller1 on September 30, 2023, 08:41:22 AMand thats why i was waiting for the stupidity of these legendary !!didnt i said if u cant then dont reply ?plus i dont need 30BTC i was testing how this forum IQ and all the legendary had -1 thank you all i got all i need already",
