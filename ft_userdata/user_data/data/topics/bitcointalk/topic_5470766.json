It's not really good to rely only one user when you want to trade with big amount of money, there's a chance he might not face a problem because he trade small amount of money. Some services are selective scammers, although I didn't mean to say bitsar is scam when there's no evidence.",

The golden rule of the crypto market is to always DYOR not the review made by the user of the forum no matter the person's rank because we have a situation where a good online project turns back and we have seen it in many exchanges (an example is FTX).I checked the exchange one of the red flags I see is there's no support. You shouldn't have used a no-KYC exchange that didn't provide social or telegram you can reach out to them if you have an issue. All the reputable decentralized exchanges I know Fixedfloat and Bisq have would an unpopular exchange wont have it.I looked through their website and I see an email address here. You can contact them if you're lucky. Hope you still have your order ID",

There is nothing we can do about it, even a worldwide trusted exchange can scam; that's why I hate the idea of central bodies however internet will always have some problem in trust I sadly believe.Let's start with the fact that I never said that the exchange was good, and even more so, I never recommended it to anyone as a reliable exchange. I wrote a review about this exchange, where I fully tested the capabilities of this exchange, and then wrote about its advantages and disadvantages. My review is here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5457393.msg62834156#msg62834156OP himself made a serious mistake when working with centralized services, he sent a large amount in full. I have always recommended and advised one and all that large sums should be divided into several parts. Always:Quote from: Ratimov on June 13, 2023, 07:13:29 AM6. Deposit/Withdrawal- Never try to make a large exchange with one transaction. For example, I want to exchange 10,000 USDT for Bitcoin. I will never deposit the entire amount in one transaction, it is better to break large amounts into several parts, then the risk of losing the entire amount is greatly reduced. Of course, you increase your fees, but it's better to lose 20 bucks in fees than to lose everything and then write numerous complaints all over the Internet that the exchange is holding your funds.- It’s definitely not worth sending large amounts to low-liquid exchanges, especially if you don’t pass KYC there, this increases the chances of blocking, since the exchange makes good money due to such cases. If you look at all the complaints about the blocking of user funds on this forum, then there we will most often meet various no-name exchanges.If OP used risk diversification, he would split his $6,000 into 4 or 5 parts and send them one by one as the funds come back. Of course, he would have spent a little money on extra commissions, but he would have saved most of this amount. He saved on commissions, but lost all his sent money.Sorry Ratimov, I was quoting the OP when saying you said Bitsar.com is a good exchange; it seems like those are OP's words. Sorry for the misunderstanding.",
