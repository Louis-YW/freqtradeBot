  "content": "It has been a while now that I have been watching (FIAT) financial advisors on television being guests on talk shows or Breakfast shows talking down at Bitcoin, whenever they get a chance. This morning another so-called financial expert was invited to a breakfast show and he smashed Bitcoin as an investment option. Now let's get behind the real reason for this : 1. Those so-called financial advisors (brokers) gets paid a fee to manage other people's money. Why would they promote Bitcoin investment, if people do not need them to trade Bitcoin? 2. They get commission on the financial products that are being sold to their customers. (They get nothing if you buy your own BTC)3. People do not need \"expert\" knowledge to invest in Bitcoin. You go to computer... navigate to a local Crypto exchange... open an account online and link the account to your Bank account. Then you wait for the price to drop and you buy some bitcoins.  4. They are also butt hurt, because Crypto currencies are not regulated to protect them. 5. The percentage that you invest in Bitcoin or Crypto currencies..are not available for them to invest in their investment options. So, next time when you see those financial advisors on TV bad mouthing Bitcoin, think of the things I mentioned above. A balanced portfolio should have a mix between \"low\" / \"medium\" / \"high\" risk investments.... and Bitcoin will fall within the \"High\" risk investment category .... so do not tell people to avoid it, because you cannot make money from them making their own investments.  https://cointelegraph.com/news/at-8-990-000-gains-bitcoin-dwarfs-all-other-investments-this-decade“It’s the best-performing asset of the last decade for sure,” said Daniel Polotsky, CEO of CoinFlip, one of the largest bitcoin ATM companies in the U.S.Say you got into the game when a bitcoin was 10 cents, around October 2010. If you invested $100, you’d have been able to buy about 1,000 bitcoins. <=== $29 610 000 worth at today's value. What will you say in 12 years from now?",

Bitcoin is now being covered by traditional social media like CNBC, and so if those beginners see that the host or the guest are attacking bitcoin, they might experienced some qualms about their investment. Nevertheless, they will have to experience this negative sentiments and learn how to channel it in a positive way by just laughing at in and then buying some during dips.",

Then you wait for the price to drop and you buy some bitcoins.  It seems so simple, but is it really so? - Does one average potential investor know the difference between Bitcoin (BTC) and various clones also called BitcoinXXX? People buy what's cheaper, and they often buy altcoin, and it's even worse when they send that same altcoin to the wrong coin address - so have someone explain to them how to fix it...- In case someone still buys BTC on their local crypto exchange, will they keep it there or move it to a non-custodial wallet - do they know what an on-chain fee is and what a service fee is? - People who approach the Bitcoin investment without knowing exactly what they are getting into are very likely to fall victim to scams, hacks or sell at a loss in moments like the ones that happened recently.",

In my opinion it is still in it's experimental phase, because we do not know if the tx fees will be enough to sustain the mining... when the Block reward fall away.  I will label it as a high risk short-term investment ....or a medium risk long-term investment.",

Usually, the same regurgitated crap that everyone else says. You're right though, they have bias for speaking that way. Quote from: Kakmakr on May 26, 2022, 05:55:54 AM3. People do not need \"expert\" knowledge to invest in Bitcoin. You go to computer... navigate to a local Crypto exchange... open an account online and link the account to your Bank account. Then you wait for the price to drop and you buy some bitcoins.   So, while I do agree with most of your points. This is where I don't agree, while buying Bitcoin might seem easy from a user that has been doing it over several years. You present the idea to a person of the general public, and they wouldn't have a clue. I still have people around me asking whether you can buy real things with it...that's how misinformed the public are. That isn't of any fault of their own, the news has pushed this idea that Bitcoin is rather worthless, and limited, which at the beginning could have been somewhat true, though times have definitely changed. Anyway, the reason I disagree with this somewhat is; basically as soon as you buy Bitcoin you're effectively your own bank. So, if you wish to hold a large amount of Bitcoin you do need to be security conscious, and hopefully have some knowledge about it. Now, this isn't common knowledge. Securing money is something we've relied on banks for years, and years. We don't need to have any knowledge to rely on these, since they do all the security work for you. Whereas, that isn't the case with Bitcoin. Obviously, users like you, and I might see the lack of a third party as beneficial, but not everyone will due to the lack of belief or knowledge they have. Effectively, to be able to purchase Bitcoin, and secure it properly you need to learn about common security practices i.e strong passwords etc, isolation be it physical or virtual, and the drawbacks of that. Plus, social engineering prevention, securing credentials, and/or wallets physically. There's a ton of work including learning the software that Bitcoin relies on i.e Bitcoin wallets. This is much more than just linking up your bank account, and buying some Bitcoin. That suggests that the person is leaving their Bitcoin on the exchange, which is definitely not recommended as we all know. Fiat as become somewhat easy to use over the years, Bitcoin has a long way to come, and probably won't ever be as simple as fiat, due to the fact you cut out the third parties which do much of the work for you.",

Anonymous bloggers can be more honest and reliable in contrast to most major media sources.Most professional journalists I have seen in recent times are so bad at what they do, its shocking to me that anyone listens to anything they say.",
