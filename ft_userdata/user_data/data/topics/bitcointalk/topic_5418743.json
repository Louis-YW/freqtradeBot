I recently came across a thread that discusses trust but does not provide a comprehensive explanation, so I went back to my BTT profile to check the trust and add members to my trust list. I read through and saw where I was asked to add members to my trust list and how I could only add 4 members to my trust list. I still don't understand how the Bitcointalk Trust System works; how I can add members to my trust list; whom to add to my trust list; and why the trust system is important or less important.

There's no need to rush things on adding person in your trustlist if you donâ€™t have any connection or transaction to any user here. Trust system original purpose is for the marketplace safety on trading. It will help you to know whether the person you are dealing is high risk or not. That time will enter the importance of your trust list. You can add the person that you made successful deal in the past with you so that you can mark them as trusted for you. It will help too other people that will deal to this people to trust him easily due to your feedback.Â  Simply just use it for your transaction/deal here and never use it politically if you want to make things simple.",

You can go to someone's trust page and post a feedback. With your feedback, you actually say that I don't trust this user. You can also post a comment and tell the community why you don't trust this user. Â You can also tell the community I trust this user. Take note that with posting a feedback, you don't make any change to your trust list.With adding someone to your trust list, you actually tell the forum (not the community) that I trust this user's judgments. You can also go to your trust list and tell the forum that I distrust this user's judgments. With creating your trust list, you actually tell the forum which feedback you want to see and which ones you don't want to see.",

It's within your power to do that but, you must do that with reasons and not just adding any random member just for the sake of exercising your rights as a forum user. Clearly there is nothing stopping you from randomising those that appears on your trust list but, its not the best of ideas.When it comes to the trust system as per tagging someone, its entirely different from the trust list. They convey similar kind of message. One is clearly on the positive and that is, the truth list while the other could ether be negative or positive. It goes out to those that sells some stuff, runs some programs, heads some organisation, renders some services and those to have shown signs of untrustworthy behaviours.In all, its a personal opinion and subjective in interpretation.",

For example, if you are going to exchange currency with me, here trust system stands for. You can see by previous records and history of trading from the trust system if any. If there is nothing then you have to take help from an escrow service who have enough trust here. This is the main theme. On the other hand, the trust system helps prevent scammers from the forum that example I give you above. Regarding adding people to your trust list, inclusion or exclusion depends on whether you trust a user's judgment or not. I believe the above users give a better explanation.",

Fortunately, compared to other forums I've been to, the trust system is solely based on past transactions with other members and not based on a so-called reputation system where anyone can give each other positive or negative feedback without too much backstory. This way, you can't be targeted if someone doesn't like you based on what you're posting, but only through your transactions.I was in a similar forum a few years ago, and it was easy to receive both negative and positive feedback with no background to back it up. It resulted in non-legitimate feedback in many users, which ended up in me getting scammed because you could never be certain if it was valid feedback or not. Not only did I lose money, but also the ability to be trusted, since the reputation system was so broken that you'd get negative feedback from the scammer's friends.Fortunately, this isn't the case with Bitcointalk.",

      "body": "It would also be useful to ask for what purpose did you come to the forum? Most of the answers above were given to you about the trust system in case you are going to trade with someone. Do not be lazy about looking into the trust of a person who can become your trading partner. A lot of scams were made on the forum by newbies, both on the part of the seller and the buyer. People do not read the warnings and subsequently, fall for the bait of scammers. The second part, which is taken very seriously, is getting negative trust from DT members, which entails the refusal to participate in subscription companies. To prevent this from happening, do not try to deceive the forum. Cheating, plagiarism, and other dishonest acts can show up quite late. A person may already rise in rank, but his deceit is still revealed sooner or later. Anyway, until you have fully met the forum participants, it is not necessary for you personally to create a trust list.",

It's just the feedback users will firstly read when they're going to have a deal with the particular user. Trust list is more of a list which you can make conclusions about a certain user, according to others' integrity. For example, if a user is being included into many trustworthy users' distrust list, you ought to take into account his sayings with a grain of salt. Feedback exists if you've had a personal experience with the said user.
