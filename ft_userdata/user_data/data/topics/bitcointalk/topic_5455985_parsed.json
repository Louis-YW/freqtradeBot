The US and Nato keep pushing themselves deeper and deeper towards poverty.New Energy Market Order: Russia, China, Iran sign over a dozen new trade agreements – mostly concerning energyhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-06-09-russia-china-iran-energy-trade-agreements.htmlChina, Iran and Russia signed over a dozen agreements with each other in the first week of June alone, mostly concerning energy, showing how the three nations are creating what has been billed as the “New Energy Market Order.”Moscow signed at least 10 new cooperation agreements with Iran for the benefit of both of their oil sectors by May 18. China similarly signed new cooperation agreements with Iran and is also significantly expanding its influence in the Middle East to secure sufficient hydrocarbon supplies to fuel its own economic growth. (Related: Iran’s trade with BRICS nations SURGES 14% as it eyes joining bloc and divesting from the dollar.)On May 18, Iranian Deputy Minister for Oil Ahmad Asadzadeh bragged that 100 Iranian and 80 Russian corporations took part in the signing of two agreements and eight memorandums of understanding on a wide range of fields, including projects to increase oil production, smart technology transfers and the completion of a transport network that will link Moscow to the Gulf of Persia and India while avoiding Western sea lanes and American sanctions.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak led the Russian delegation to Tehran to discuss boosting bilateral trade and said the two countries are also in talks to discuss the signing of future agreements, including one that may establish an electronic gas trading platform in southern Iran with the help of Russian investments.China expands influence in Middle EastChina’s recent new agreements with Iran are part of its overarching “One Belt, One Road” economic growth strategy.According to an Iranian source that spoke to Simon Watkins of OilPrice.com, the agreements signed simply “nail down some of the remaining details on financial, investments and energy cooperation” contained within their 25-year cooperation agreement, known as the “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the People’s Republic of China.”...",

Since it will happen, why not make the most of it, and drive the world to war? It seems that that's what they are doing, but so far, Putin is not letting them trick him.Are the Biden warmongers strong enough to drive the world to war? Will the collapse of the US money system convince people to join the military and the arms manufacturing companies? Will economic collapse in Nato countries drive their people to fight with Ukraine?So far the people who are in the Biden group have been right about not seeming to be able to push Putin to nukes. If Medvedev were running Russia, we might have been in nuclear WW3 months ago, or even years ago.",

If Medvedev were running Russia, we might have been in nuclear WW3 months ago, or even years ago.Most of the warmongers pull the strings behind the scenes. Even conservatives are amenable to such pressure. Remember the 2017 Shayrat missile strikes Trump ordered in Syria? Trump surrounded himself with horrible military advisers in 2017 so maybe he was coerced into intervention because he didn't know any better, but he  did hire John Bolton in 2018. Bolton loves regime changes.Anyway, Trump could be more hawkish than he lets on, there's a lot of influence and money that go on behind the scenes that Trump may be amenable to. I'd still prefer Trump over Biden.",

I always said that Trump was bad because he would only slow the inevitable and it would be way worse afterward. And that he did... slow hostilities down. Biden is making up for Trump's slowness. Do you think Trump 2024 can slow the things down on time to avert the final world war? provided Putin doesn't loose nukes before then?",

You only need to look at the destruction of California and some other states to realise this. In the meantime they are killing the population with lethal injections and poisonous food. When they own all the assets, and have got rid of most of the cannon fodder population, they will build an AI automated world. There are many of us who want to be outside this rebirth, and I like to thin k I am one of them.",

It is called proxy wars and their purpose are to try to expand the interest of big nations through indirect participation in other's nations conflicts.It is exactly what happened in the Korea war, it was a proxy war between the communist regimens in China and the Soviet Union, versus the American forces and their allies in the west.The point is not to directly face your enemy so the conflict wont escalate out of control towards a complete mutual destruction. So I highly doubt we will se nukes going off because the conflict in Ukraine, hopefully the USA government won't let Ukraine to get too much confidence on their advances and try to retaliate in Russian soil.",

I wonder if Russia is poorer or richer from this war but I would assume much poorer as himself Putin in a conference from Sochi said that \"we are in a difficult time,however we are more united than ever\".I see a lot of regret from Putin as he is doing a war since February 2022 and I don't know what Russia has achieved in this war except killing civilians which is a genocide and terrorist act,they have not made any gains in terms of the occupied areas,they have not a single area of such under their full control and Ukraine counter offensive has just started in many fronts now.China would never want a fight with the West or Europe which is their biggest market for their products so even if they are really sending weapons they would stop as soon as the West is 100% sure that they are doing this.Bottom line Russia is all alone and this move for me was a bad one from Putin putting Russia on their knees.",

By cutting themselves off from Russia through the sanctions, the US and Nato are all alone... except that now it takes other countries to be middlemen between Russia and the US/Nato. The products and services still flow.The benefit to Russia is that before, Russia was moving into a direct trading market with the US and Nato countries. Since Russia's options have changed with the sanctions, they are simply developing all kinds of modes of operation that they had no need for in the past - the past 30 years since freedom became popular in the Russian government.",

The US and Nato keep pushing themselves deeper and deeper towards poverty.Most Western economists predicted that the Russian economy will not survive these multiple sanctions. Many even said the Russian rubble will lose value in no time. But all these analyses now look fake because Russia has diversified its economy and attracted new trading partners. NATO ad the US have also ditched many Russian products and have built alternative means of suppliers. Many European countries no longer depend on Russia for gas because other sources have been discovered. The war is costing NATO and the US so much. Funds that would have been used to solve internal issues have been used to fund Ukraine. Russia is not also finding this war cheap because it is also eating deep into the finance of the Russian economy. So both parties are suffering from the negative effect of this war.",
