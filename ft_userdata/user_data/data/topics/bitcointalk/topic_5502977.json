Another thing is to seek other sources of income so you can have enough to sort out your needs. With other sources of income, you can comfortably HODL.",

The market is liquid enough for anyone with consistent income to accumulate Bitcoin over time.But, no need to stress about owning a full coin.  Just consistently put whatever you can afford to invest towards building your Bitcoin position and  that pragmatic approach is way more realistic and less stressful than worrying about whole coin targets.",

I don't know how much you earn and spend so it will be difficult to ascertain your ability to buy one Bitcoin per month. But it will be better to buy using DCA because it will enable you to purchase it based on your ability.QuoteHow do I stop myself from selling before the 1 BTC mark?Cut your expenses and ensure you have an emergency fund. Reducing how much you spend on things that you don't really need is important for savings. And planning for uncertainties by having emergency funds will also help you not to sell your coin prematurely.",

Once you have calculated the number of Bitcoins you need to buy monthly to reach your 1 Bitcoin goal, take your eyes off your wallet balance and work assiduously to get in that number of Bitcoin in the wallet every month. Secondly if you feel you need to share this goal with someone (very trustworthy) so that they can hold you accountable, then go ahead and do it. However, if you feel your safety will be jeopardize, then don't. If there is a way to lock the goal in the wallet so that you can get any of it out until you reach 1 Bitcoin, then do it",

DCA with weekly buys or whenever you get your paycheck.2. Keep doing this until you hit 1 btc.How do you stop yourself from selling?? Uhhh why would you even be attempted to sell before you reach 1 btc when you say your goal is 1 btc? That doesn't make any sense.Just DCA continuously over the years. If 1 BTC is your goal and you are going to stick to that as your goal then keep saving until you hit 1 btc. Keep saving beyond 1 btc if you want, there is really no reason to ever stop saving money as long as you have income to save. But also you can spend your bitcoin whenever you have something you want to spend it on. Personally I find retirement is the best thing to save your bitcoin for, but it could also be a house, or smaller stuff along the way. Saving for retirement is a great way to do it because then you have no reason to sell any until you are retired, at which point you can start living off your bitcoin.",

Invest in bitcoin to the highest level, in terms of your attitude and in your eagerness to sustain your investment goal. DCA can help a lot with a lot of discipline and good decision making. If you can DCA regularly, regardless of the amount, I’m sure your bitcoin accumulation journey will be more visible and possible starting this  year. Also, patience is the greatest virtue in crypto.

But in this case you have to invest monthly or weekly, you can invest in Dollar Cost Average DCA method by understanding the market conditions. You are never going to buy your bitcoins all at once. You will monitor the market daily and invest when the market becomes suitable for investing. Since you plan to hold for long term, you need to be patient and invest slowly in a planned manner. No one can control you but you, selling the investment before you reach the one bitcoin mark. If you feel that you should sell your investment, no one is going to suggest to you that you can sell your investment. It will depend entirely on you because your needs or wants will not depend on any other person.",

If you don't have enough money, you need to purchase bitcoin gradually with time. It's DCA, Dollar Cost Averaging.You can do it on monthly base or quarterly base or yearly base. I would like to DCA on monthly basis because I can be more discipline with my saving and use part of it for DCA Bitcoin.https://dcabtc.com/https://costavg.com/",

Can you save any meaningful amount after you pay your bills?Is owning one btc really that important to you? If that one btc will be all of your savings, is it wise to tie everything you have in one asset?I think you should have a diversified portfolio no matter how much your monthly income is. (Assuming that you are able to save some money every month) The amount of bitcoin you have usually doesn’t have much meaning anyway. It is the percentage of btc in your portfolio which is way more important and no, 100% isn’t the answer. (Not for me anyway)",
