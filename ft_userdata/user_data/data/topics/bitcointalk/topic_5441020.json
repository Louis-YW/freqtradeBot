I mean the bitcoin logo does not have a specific motto, vision and mission to translate and there is absolutely no relationship like a company.Decentralized and unmanageable is proof that there is no specific motto to the value of the logo, because bitcoin has its own uniqueness that is not owned by any company logo.",

But I believe there is mission, reading the bitcoin whitepaper you will come to understand and appreciate the purpose of bitcoin which is liberate the masses from the machine they have been programmed to feed. I think Satoshi was/is a liberal, who believed decentralized cryptocurrency could give the people some control and privacy of their money and how they choose to spend it. It’s been 14 years since the bitcoin white paper was published, governments are fast making plans to revolutionize the banking sector with CBDCs and we don’t see it coming because we are distracted by “social issues”, the definition of a woman has become more difficult than a math equations.",

I think no official one but rather many people create their own motto or saying about this since we have different approach towards what we think about bitcoin. Maybe Satoshi just want to have decentralize option in finance side that's why he create bitcoin and he's so successful for creating it since this is very well known until today and global adoption is nearly coming for bitcoin.",

If you want to understand the purpose of Bitcoin, I suggest you take time to read the white paper. It's just 9 pages https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf",

But I also don't know if Satoshi ever made a Motto for Bitcoin because I also never came across this before, and I think that's a natural thing too because Bitcoin is not the same as other companies or certain businesses that require a Motto to be more easily recognized by many people.",

Does bitcoin have any official motto or phrase used or released by satoshi or the developers?While Bitcoin does not have an official motto or phrase that has been released by Satoshi or the developers, there are several phrases that are often associated with Bitcoin and its ethos.One of the most well-known phrases is \"Be Your Own Bank,\" which highlights Bitcoin's decentralized and trustless nature, enabling individuals to control their own financial assets without the need for intermediaries such as banks.Another popular phrase is \"Hodl,\" which originated from a typo in a forum post but has since become a rallying cry for Bitcoin holders who believe in its long-term value and are committed to holding onto it through market volatility.The phrase \"Digital Gold\" has been used to describe Bitcoin's scarcity and its potential to serve as a store of value similar to traditional gold.These phrases are not official mottos or slogans, but they have become part of Bitcoin's cultural identity and are often used by its community members to express their beliefs and values.",
