If there came to be a problem again in the world that would stop the development tracks, there would be a crash. But if we continue like we are now, it can reach a new high. There are most likely problems with the world now that there are industries that need bailing out because of what the pandemic did, but it would still be something that we need to face, and we won't know if the results of it would be a positive one. It would be hard to predict, and it's best to do what you believe in and possibly hoard what you can.",

So investors investing in Bitcoin when the price is the seventeen thousand (17k), it's people or who forecast the future of cryptocurrency and especially bitcoin. I believe that since the price is fluctuating at twenty three thousand and twenty four thousand (23k/24k) i believe that it will still increase more. And when it increases those investors who invested during the time of seventeen thousand (17k) is in the better chance of making a reasonable profit.",

A good opportunity for Buyers. Your opinion will be acknowledged. For me at least a peaked of $30,000 at the end of the year is not that bad. $40,000-$50,000 might be too far stretch as we are still in the bear market.That's why we have seen the price just moving sideways and get can't over the next psychological barrier of $25,000. Yes, we wanted to see $50,000 but with the war still in the background, inflation, world economy at a standstill, I doubt that we will see such kind of money right to pour to be able to move it to that price.",

Hahaha.Right, short term we might not be looking for $50k threshold, we are still in the bear market so I doubt that we will have a break out run this year. We already find the support line above $20k, so this seems to be the movement that we are going to see in the next couple of months. So the best approach is to still buy and then simply be a HODLer. Nothing beats a strategy than that, continue to accumulate as much as you can in this current scenario, and put in in a wallet that you have total control.",

Hahaha.Maybe the first time was difficult, but for us who have been with Bitcoin for years, every big crash or correction should be nothing more than another good opportunity to buy more Bitcoin at a lower price. The loss is only temporary and actually unrealized for those who do not decide to sell, but it is not realistic to expect that everyone has such determination and strength that they do not break down in difficult situations.Cold storage makes sense only if access to it is disabled for a certain period of time, something like a time lock. Otherwise, people always find a way to their storage and sell when they panic.",

Its pretty easy to guess or state a price but its more convincing if there is a reason on that like how it can achieve at that price like historical data or even a possible investment that will correlate with the initial prediction.In my honest opinion, Im not sure when we can see btc nearing ATH since theres a lot of bad news ongoing and this could affect investors to shell out a lot of funds. Either theres a miracle to get a quick reversal or any whales that risk a lot of money to get it up.",

Hahaha.If you don't care about the price then you may not be an investor or a trader but you are simply using your bitcoin as a currency when you buy and pay something. That is more important for btc as this is what the founder wants to happen, not when people buy and hoard btc for their personal gains only. If you want to buy bitcoin at the dips then you are a certified investor/ trader because you are taking advantage of the volatility of btc.It would be better if you hodl and then experience a temporary loss than when you sell at the dips because that will be a permanent loss already. It's already their problem if they feel uneasy, no wonder why they are losing on this game.",

No one holds what will be the future price of bitcoin but I always believe that bitcoin is always bound to create peaks and high value in the future. But to be honest, I’m not expecting this year’s reasonable peak price, instead I’m more convinced that bitcoin will surge to its new ATH the following year. Although we can always expect for price recovery for bitcoin, but seeing it at a new heights like $50k or above, it seems less possible for me.",

Well, opinion is a free thing and anyone can express one. However, what guards one's opinion is what matters. Generally, from hindsight, I've come to believe in what Bitcoin can do whenever it goes down. It has that ability to rise and record a fresh ATH. That's what gives me reassurance whenever I see it bleed. What's your assurance? What makes you think it will hit >$50k? Are you seeing that from a TA (technical analysis) perspective or it's just a regular FOMO? I ain't saying there's anything wrong with speculating that price will go up, just the same way that anyone can FUD that it can crash further (people don't like reading about this part though).",

That is way too high in my opinion, it seems easy to say a number that bitcoin could reach, after all bitcoin already reached a price like that before, so how difficult can it be? But for bitcoin to reach a price like that it would need to be in the middle of a bull run, and I really doubt that the market will make such a fast transition and go from a bear market to a bull market almost immediately, also such a high price prediction could make more sense if the year was just starting out as bitcoin will have a lot of time to reach your prediction, but we have less than 5 months left for your prediction to happen, which makes the chances of your prediction actually happen to go even lower.",
