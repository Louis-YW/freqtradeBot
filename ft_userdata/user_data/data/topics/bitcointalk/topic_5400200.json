  "content": "Introducing a newbie to bitcoin is one aspect of adoption, but there are other elements that we overlook and that are not intended to be that way. We undervalue these things, they threaten our safety and confidentiality, yet we constantly ignore them, which is not supposed to be that way.As a newbie, these things are very common, we do them not because we want it to be that way, but because we don't understand how the world works when it comes to use of bitcoin. We view them as ordinary things and become careless about them, but they are the most crucial things we should constantly be reminded. Below is the list of some common mistakes we do and take them as normal thing in cryptocurrency.1. Doing KYC:KYC is a horrible concept, it exposes your identity to everyone. KYC demands you to sacrifice your privacy to the exchange in order to use their exchanges, but you never know what will happen to the information you gave to someone you've never met before. Some exchanges hired third-party companies to complete KYC for them; but, what happens within those companies is kept private; you have no idea when they make deceptive moves with your identity or sell it to other individuals who buy it.2. Leaving our coins in Centralized exchange: As a newbie, we may want to make deposits and withdrawals in some centralized exchanges because it appears to be easier, but what really matters is the safety of our crypto assets, since many of these centralized exchanges can be hacked at any time, so storing your crypto assets in centralized exchanges is risky, if the exchange's security is compromised, one may lose all of his savings on the exchange, so it's best to keep our crypto assets in personal wallets.3. Telling people you hold Bitcoin: Your assets are to be private, it makes no sense to tell people that you own Bitcoin for security reasons. We have seen and heard of cases where friends kill friend just to get their friend bitcoins and investments,  educate them about bitcoin but do not tell your friends about your bitcoin for your safety and  self protection.4. Using Custodial wallets:From the word Custodial, your private keys is in the Custody of another person, which means they are in control of your keys. When Your private keys are in the Custody of another person, it implies they have control of your keys and bitcoin, always remember the phrase \"Not your Keys, Not Your Coin,\" so it is best to use a non-custodial wallet where you will have control over your private key or seed as well as your bitcoin. 5. Not using of Tor or VPN for SPV (Simple Payments Verification) wallets. Learn to mask your IP address from other nodes, especially those that observe people's addresses and use them for statistical assumptions, whether you're using a full node to send transactions or a lite wallet. The VPN and Tor will assist you in hiding your internet protocol address.",

There are some noncustododial wallet which are not recommendable because they are luring people to get verified, a good example is blockchain.com wallet sending email to people that did not get verified to get verified and receive $5.

Leaving our coins in Centralized exchange......so it's best to keep our crypto assets in personal wallets.Exactly, not to leave coin on exchanges, but not only exchanges but also any company providing custododial services. Personal wallet can be custododial wallet, why not just refer it to as noncustododial wallet.Quote from: Hyphen(-) on May 25, 2022, 10:14:49 PM5. Not using of Tor or VPN for SPV (Simple Payments Verification) wallets.First, I can not dispute that VPN are good to certain extent, but they are centralized and very possible the routing is through only one server unlike Tor that relays traffic through three different servers which are designed to be decentralized.Second, it is also advisable to run full node with Tor, not only SPV wallet. Using Tor with SPV wallet only will help to achieve anonymity.Also, if using SPV wallet and you want to use a site to check for especially transaction on blockchain explorer or making use of mempool on a site, using Tor is advisable.",

So, it is bad to do KYC at first, not minding if the company handles it themselves or contracts a third party. Quote from: Hyphen(-) on May 25, 2022, 10:14:49 PM2. Leaving our coins in Centralized exchange: \"Not your Keys, Not Your Coins\". It is always not recommended to leave once coins permanently in exchanges, but for day traders who trades numerous coins on exchanges, I don't think they can afford to transfer coins to and fro exchanges every day. So, it can be said that they leave coins on the exchange. So, the most important first step is to choose a reputable exchange. Quote from: Hyphen(-) on May 25, 2022, 10:14:49 PM3. Telling people you hold Bitcoin: Yes, same thing applies to fiat. I do not see anyone boosting in the street about how much they have in their local bank accounts. So it should be applicable to bitcoin and other valuable assets  Quote from: Hyphen(-) on May 25, 2022, 10:14:49 PM5. Not using of Tor or VPN for SPV (Simple Payments Verification) wallets.

These makes such transactions to be best remain private or anonymous.Once an attacker knows about someone having bitcoin, that is deadly. A thief that visit someone at home will refuse to accept bank transactions but will prefer cash or to rob his victim with bitcoin or privacy coins like monero. The best way to deal with crypto generally is with you having privacy.",

However, despite it maybe being a good idea for specific cases, it has quickly turned into a marketing ploy that companies are basically abusing. Although, having said that I'm not even sure we can blame the companies themselves, usually this information is required by the government of the country they operate in. Some being much more invasive than others. However, I have no doubt that this information being collected is not only being used for verification, but being used to better their marketing.",

You could setup a solution to you passing away today, to assure that they get your Bitcoin. This is actually being discussed at the moment over in the Bitcoin Discussion section, see this post for details. However, I'd recommended taking a look at the whole thread. I'm of the belief that no matter what the circumstances are your private key should be only known to you, and you only. As it suggests in that post, they can unlock it via their key after the defined amount of time, however you can prevent it any time you want with your private key.",

People don’t take KYC serious anymore, they give their details out so easily because of the little money they’re been offered by those exchanges when they want to be fully verified or access to some services that are important for one. They lure you to do KYC by giving you limited access to their services or by promising you some little dollars. The repercussions are always worse as we don’t know when our pieces of information can be sent to or used illegally without our consent.It was also posted on this forum where Binance was accused of sharing their users' data to Russia which can lead to even sanctions on such persons because of a transaction they did long ago.

Almost all centralized exchanges require you to pass KYC and you have no choice if it has become a rule that all customers have to follow. Maybe KYC is not completely secure because there is always the possibility of the data being leaked, but try to use a platform that is very trusted and has a good reputation so that the security of our personal data in the form of KYC is not used by other parties. Avoid KYC for a few bucks in the bounty, it's recommended. Right now we can't go against the government with KYC policies, but of course we have an alternative to always take good care of privacy and that can only be done by staying away from centralized exchanges.",

This is very true and I have experienced it myself.  When people hear the name 'Bitcoin', they immediately think about something very expensive, very hard to afford as an average person.  Too few know more details such as how you can own just a small part of it so you do not need to pull out a multiplier of $30,000 to invest in Bitcoin.  So when you mention you own Bitcoin, they immediately think you have a large holding.Maybe saying you have a small portion of Cryptocurrencies is smarter.  Bringing Bitcoin directly into discussion is almost equal to saying you own a luxury Penthouse.  Everyone will think about a multi million dollar Penthouse, nobody would ever think about a cheap, luxury looking apartment in the middle of nowhere.-Regards,PrivacyG",
