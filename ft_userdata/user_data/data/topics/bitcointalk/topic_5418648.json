Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.[edited slightly]And this is what everyone who has any family  should do.Don't let your bitcoins die with you. Tell your family how to recover them if you pass away",

He was cryopreserved by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, so I guess this foundation has to be paid to do this? I do not know if you pay for this before you die... or do they put money into a trust to pay for this?",
