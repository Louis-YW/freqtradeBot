Clearly I was wrong but now my assumption is that it‚Äôs highly unlikely it will go below 20K. In my opinion, bitcoin is not going anywhere and it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it‚Äôs back at new historic all time highs. When you‚Äôve seen enough of these corrections over the years, you‚Äôre not as affected emotionally and can stay rational. At the end of the day I‚Äôm still bullish on bitcoin. I'm still a long hold on BTC and until the economy levels out and the war in Ukraine is resolved it‚Äôs difficult to say when we‚Äôll see Crpto making big gains.",
