  "content": "Every day by day this hard drugs called weed, loud, and lce dey drag our youth closer to their grave this same hard drug matter don mak many of our youths go incensed and mad for the street in fact I been watched a shot video clip on how one guy kiss tranforman just because him go dey on cruise mode, I fit boost tell una say most boys no fit dey without moding two or more raps of loud or weed only say because e dey mak them fresh and eat well, But why most boys dey say smoking no dey kill???QuoteThis poses a question. Why does a country that currently ranks as the country with the most people living in extreme poverty (according to the  End poverty organization), turn out to be so dependent on drugs? According to a UNODC report, Nigeria ranks as the top user of opioids in Africa and the third-highest user of opioids in the world. See world rankings here.Another report by the UNODC shows that over 14 million Nigerians use one form of opioid or another, and have the most level of prevalence in the world as of November 2020. This number is projected to increase rapidly if the situation of drug abuse in Nigeria persists.https://radrafrica.com/radrwrites/high-times-nigerians-on-using-drugs-and-surviving-nigeria,/Quote [quote/]I been see this post about how Nigerians are one of the most poorest country but them still dey smoke the painful part be said poverty no wan gree go self people dey suffer  And all the time na poor Nigerian youth dey tak all this hard drugs pass u no go too see this rich men children dey too smoke am like the poor once. my advice to us be say make we tak am easy e go better one day one love .",

But we don forget the health benefits way he day also bring, for yankee they don even legalize am because he good for people way get Parkinson. If health benefits no day am I no think a whole country like the united state for agree to legalize am. Doctors sef day prescribe am as drugs to some patients way get anxiety problem make them use calm their nerves. No quote me wrong smoking is actually bad for the health no doubt but it mostly depends what strain you’re on.   We Nigerian we sabi over do our own thing, all these colos way boyz day do now no follow all this on don day tempered with na why ee day be like say he wan wound person, anything way day add chemical to enhance the reaction is not advisable for you cause even the chemical fit no day good for your body. If you wan know the benefits of smoking Marijuana enter google do research your self . Na why practitioners go advise smokers to de-toxify, as a smoker you suppose day take good care of your health and eat well so that you no be like person way suffer pass.",

There is no genuine reason for a chain smoker to smoke. They love smoking and smoking is very addictive. One thing you should understand about smokers is that they really love the feeling that comes after smoking, it makes them feel like they are out of the world and that feeling is called euphoria which is very addictive. I don't see smoking as something that is bad but the too much intake of it is what feel is not worth it.

Why does a country that currently ranks as the country with the most people living in extreme poverty (according to the  End poverty organization), turn out to be so dependent on drugs? According to a UNODC report, Nigeria ranks as the top user of opioids in Africa and the third-highest user of opioids in the world. See world rankings here.Another report by the UNODC shows that over 14 million Nigerians use one form of opioid or another, and have the most level of prevalence in the world as of November 2020. This number is projected to increase rapidly if the situation of drug abuse in Nigeria persists.https://radrafrica.com/radrwrites/high-times-nigerians-on-using-drugs-and-surviving-nigeria,/ I been see this post about how Nigerians are one of the most poorest country but them still dey smoke the painful part be said poverty no wan gree go self people dey suffer  And all the time na poor Nigerian youth dey tak all this hard drugs pass u no go too see this rich men children dey too smoke am like the poor once. my advice to us be say make we tak am easy e go better one day one love .All these people that always say that smoking no dey kill, they are illiterate and they don't know anything, weed it self is not mean for everybody, if you dey smoke try and make sure that you still dey chop better thing for body, but some people will not have money, still be smoking that is suffering and killing of body, that's what our young youths are doing this days, you see small small bois wey be under age go dey carry smoking like a joke, i don't even know where we are heading to in this country, because some of the youths are turning to something else with smoking, the funniest part be say no be all of them they smoke better weed sef, some know even get money to get better weed, you know say some weed dey wey be say e dey make person dey dry,  na waiting majority of them they smoke.I ever saw one guy dey smoke Oris, the guy sef never reach 18 at all, then he read what they wrote on it that smokers are liable to die young leave it now, base on say he dey on a high mode, he said he will leave it tomorrow,  make them no worry, seriously this youths wey dey smoking are just killing themselves, because that thing sef dey make person run mad, they will see say na waiting cause this person problem be that, but if they chose that path, it's hard to do without it even a single day.",

Smoking na norms as it stands because from the general notion, e dey help Dem in its own special way. Some will say it keeps them warm, some will say it relieved them from depression, some will say it contains some kinda herbs or afterwards they'd detoxify. They know the truth but they just gats find way to cover am up. Well you won't blame them. Normally we dey like go extra mile with our own thing.    The people wey even start the smoking and even need am more cos of their weather no dey even consume am near half of the way we dey consume our own. It's their own decision to change. No matter the level of conviction, if them never decide to change, Dem just no fit change. But nonetheless, let's do our best to stay away from it, no be now wey we go see the effect, the effects na always a long run something, the proper thing to do is abstain or quit if started already.",
