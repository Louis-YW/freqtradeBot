But if will ask you why don't you want to trade on reputable exchange instead of being scammed by users because i believe you could be sent series of pm and you might not know the real person or trusted users to deal with.",

You haven't specified I think seller specifically mentioned what he needs from the title, he said of accepting cash which is fiat and usdt. He could send you BTC while you pays back with any of those coin, I think OP would have been active here because I believe lot might have been going on and any opportunities like this scammer easily picks interest to attempt if they could succeed.",
