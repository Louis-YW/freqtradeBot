The rx580s are the cheapest around him like 150-180$ per card, what do you think pro miners?.. He said he has cheap electricity bill.If that is his cheapest option and if he truly has cheap electricity bill which I would define right now up to 0.05 and for long term like your friend is looking a maximum of 0.07 cent would be the max limit of what can be considered \"cheap\" electricity compared to us in Europe which the prices have skyrocketed and most likely we will see further increase this very September.6 such cards would cost him like 900 dollars plus 200-300 dollars for used other parts that would be 1200 dollars for a 6 cards rig,of course he should get a very good PSU that may rise the cost but it will be worthwhile in the long run,so for 1500 USD he can buy the parts himself or from what I have seen in local market where I am plus in Ebay and others you can get a rig with 6 such cards in the above mentioned price.It can be as jump starting for your friend,if he likes what he sees and start to thoroughly understand cryptos even more,I am sure he will expand.",

The profitability for anything GPU mineable will be very little. I don’t think it’s wise to invest this much per GPU for such a old GPU. You are better off buying something newer that you can sell to a gamer in the future.Gamers won’t want the rx580 due to its age.",

It's hard to say if 70 or 80 USD are good prices, but if you have cheap electricity, maybe it's worthJust do the mathHere in my country for example, my electricity rate is .20, so it's barely profitable, like 10cents per day per card (rx 580), putting 5 in a rig will be .50 cents a day = 30 USD monthNot worth the time and noise in my opinionBut let's say you have 0.05 rate, things start to look betterAfter ETH POS we'll have a better understanding about which cards will continue to mine in profit (if), but I'm doubt about Polaris generation. I suspect only RTX 3XXX and AMD 6XXX will continue on the game",

For the remaining 20-25 days of Ethereum mining, you will not get a big profit.I would also strongly suggest the same also,as when Ethereum mining will go away these cards cannot do that much other algos except ETC which most people will flock into it,we already have 565 T difficulty in ETC network while before the news of Ethereum mining it was maximum of 382 T,it shows people have already migrated here,beside this algo the Rx versions can mine RVN but at the cost of greatly heating the cards,so most probably the price after the first half of September will be like 50-60 dollars for a card which would makes sense to buy them then.Keep in mind though as you can use your ETChash to be used at unmineable website where you can choose any coin to mine,you only will get slightly decreased mining rewards daily,so if the price will fall in the second half of September get these cards if you have cheap electricity because right now one such card can make you 0.035 LTC through unmineable mining pool and six of them can make you 0.20 LTC daily which in USD is not much but in crypto 0.20 LTC is a good amount to be mined daily.",

It's hard to say something about possible resale value because every country have their own market.Here for example, there's still market for old cards like RX 580, but I know it's almost at the edge, the next launch of Nvidia and AMD will probably push the generation and Polaris and GTX 1XXX will lose more value and games will be harder to play at these.But talking about mining, in the next weeks we'll have a clue about the cards and algos, RX cards could lose value fast if ETHW and ETC doesn't make any profits.Nvidia are afraid, and will reduce even more the prices of GPUs...Hey OP @BitKongy, have you talked to your friend about the asnwers here?",
