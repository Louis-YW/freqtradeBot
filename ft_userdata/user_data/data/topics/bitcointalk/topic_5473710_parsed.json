You had recently created two altcoins giveaway thread, both of them have been deleted by the moderators. Moreover, you are trying to attract users by posting in some other gambling discussions related thread.Anyway, the old ANN thread of Jacksclub is better than this new ANN thread. I'm wondering why you have created this new thread for Jacksclub and locked the better one.",

Your old thread might give you some reputation boost you are in a business for too long compared to this new thread and start from scratch.I don‚Äôt see any bad review or something that will make you abandon the old thread. Everyone knew you are old casino here except for newbie. I believe you are new representative for this casino since you didn‚Äôt know how to create a decent ANN thread and probably you want to start fresh.",

Not saying they had a bad reputation before but seems a good idea now that there are new users in the forum unaware of them.So it's allowed after all to pass on a bitcointalk account to someone else right as long as it's handled by their staff. I think it's fair. 400% bonus for first deposit and up to $20K, that's a lot and the catch would also be staggering. Anyway, Welcome back to bitcointalk.",

It looks like we are not dealing with the same person, that in itself is scary because it could also be that the casino no longer belongs to the same person, I looked at the post history of this account and I see last year in August it was made the last post of the year 2022 and the person behind this account only posted again in May of this year, that is, he did not enter this forum for 9 months and when he entered this forum in May of this year he made only 1 post and then disappearedHe only posted again this month, on November 6th, that is, he spent June, July, August, September, October of this year without making any posts on this forum. and suddenly he posts again on November 6th and posts constantly and creates a new thread with no quality, he doesn't explain why he left the old thread, he doesn't explain why he disappeared for many months. Honestly, this is all very strange. A casino is a very responsible business, people are putting their money into the casino, so the minimum a casino owner needs to have is to respect their customers, pay attention to their customers.",

So better to make those thread to be locked up and continuethe discussion into this newly created thread.As i have read up earlier into that old thread that been mentioned that you arent part of the team but now you had become that community manager which i guess that should be fine.When it comes to new things and ideas then it would really be that always recommended that you should really be keeping on trying to read up community suggestions because it would really be that a good guide for you to make yourself hover into this market on which you should really be that prepared knowing that gambling industrydoes have that tough competition.
