How is someone going to have confidence that you will not try to get a refund of the money you will send and scam them? Very tricky.",

Very tricky.With your experience over some years here you would still want to use a newbies who are likely to scam you, I don't know how these newbie behaves most at times because they think others aren't wiser than them or what, is it that easier for newbie to make account and immediately wants to offer some services to people how? Besides we have series of exchange were one would easily exchange their currency without going into this cheap hustlers.",

About using exchange, I don't use exchanges which are new and starting their business. For me even with a higher fee, a reputable one is much peaceful. However, mostly I do p2p trade. So, I already have network of a trusted circle to exchange coins between each other. I think some of us who are in the forum from long time, they already have their own trusted circle to exchange coin to each other either for cash or crypto.",

Im looking to start run long term partnership here to be number one fast and private exchanger.Ever watch the movie \"Buster\"?  It came out in the 80's and told the story of one of the \"Great Train\" robbers Buster Edwards who slowly went broke trying to launder his share of the stolen money.  He'd take £1,000 to the fence and get back something like £750.  Your \"fees\" to exchange Euros to crypto remind me of that fence's fees.How come you don't use the Euro € symbol?  Don't your keyboard have one?",

This is a very challenging  and risky deal as there would be no trust from op and again being a beginner instead most people like using their circle of friends either from one locality or across the forum here with a reputations.",
