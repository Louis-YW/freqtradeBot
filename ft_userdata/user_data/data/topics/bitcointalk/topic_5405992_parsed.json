  "content": "So I was thinking with the other posts about electric price in different locations and politics in some areas and so on.As a purely hypothetical question would mining at would it be better or worse for equipment?At higher elevations the air is less dense so the fans would run harder BUT overall it tends to be cooler and less humid. There also tends to be less change in temperate and it is also more gradual so things would be more constant in terms needed cooling.Not planning to start a mine in El Alto, Bolivia just thinking about stuff. -Dave",

(But that's in case of a remote area, El Alto is a big city so it's not the case).",

      "body": "Quote from: spectre71 on July 12, 2022, 06:04:34 PMI think the cooler temps would offset any density altitude issues. It pretty much depends on how \"cooler\" the temps are, because altitude and temperature are keys when evaluating fan performance, at sea level and at 100F you are looking at a factor of 1.06 which is a slight loss in performance, it's equal to the performance of the same fan running at 70F and 1,500 feet above sea level if so happens that temps are higher than 70F then it's worse than running at sea level with temps being 100F.But that example was more like cherry-picking, it doesn't mean it won't exist, but more often than not, the gains from cooler temps will offset the altitude, but if you happen to find a place where the temp is 70F and the altitude is 10,000 then what would be as bad as running the fan at sea level with temps being as high as 300F.  Keep in mind, however, that the cooler climate isn't always a good thing, for two reasons, one, most miners won't run at temps near zero, and they will have a very hard time starting up, you are going to need to generate some sort of heat before you get them going, some people will trap the miner inside a box for it to heat well and then put the exhaust of the hot miner into another miner's intake to get it running, I don't know at what temp exactly all of this will start to be a problem, but too cold is too bad.Another reason would be the miner increasing voltage to stay at desired temps, thierry4wd explained that in detail on one of his posts, but long story short, if the miner is running cool, it will drop the fan speed to a minimum (which I think is 10% or so) if that does not help bring temps up to the desired number, it will increase the voltage to generate more heat, that simply put is a waste of energy.",

Moisture conducts about 10 times the rate air does (general terms).I would be happy with the cool, dry and CLEAN air generally found at altitude. Sure I compensate when I fly into my South Lake Tahoe place or Scuba dive there, it's a factor for sure. I wouldn't get too wrapped around the axel on it as far as a miner goes.",

      "body": "If you were to determine the amount of \"high altitude\", then the assumptions would be better. If we assume altitudes that reach less than 1500 meters, then the effects will not be significant, and therefore cheap electricity will give you an advantage in addition to the low temperature, but it is desirable to reduce the efficiency of the device's work (Low rate.)If you reach altitudes higher than 2000 m, then the air density and atmospheric pressure may function poorly.For example, at high altitudes, less effort will be required to cross a distance, which increases the possibility of electrical arcs, and it also affects the electrical insulation properties of the air, which means a significant increase in the internal temperature of these devices, which may mean indirectly reducing their efficiency/work.",

If you check specs, many time various things like TV's, PSU's and other line powered devices WILL have altitude restrictions. Grant you the 5k limit is very conservative but nonetheless it is fact that as air pressure goes down so does the breakdown voltage which means that greater spacing between PCB traces is required to pass hipot testing. It is not until pressure goes below 0.05mbar (approaching a hard vacuum) that the breakdown voltage of the remaining air starts to rapidly climb again.",

With in context of a 12 volt device and human livable altitudes is not even applicable. I haven't seen an altitude rating on my extension cord at 7200 feet, my dryer didn't arc flash. The insulators on the 13.2 kv powerlines (@9000 ft) are the same ones from sea-level. Nothing skydiving or in my plane over 15k feet seems to flame out, I guess if you put my 172 into sub orbit it may have a problem or two.We might as well debate if things work different in the southern hemisphere. It doesn't matter.I guess he knows something he read, but massively miss applied.",

The insulators on the 13.2 kv powerlines (@9000 ft) are the same ones from sea-level. What Husires and NFW mentioned about air insulation is scientifically correct even if you want to disagree with it, in fact, it's a standard followed by most PSU manufacturers, for example, the \"China Compulsory Certification\" requires a certain clearance between any two conductive materials inside a PSU, at an altitude of 2000m or below, it has to be 8mm, at 5000m, on the other hand, it needs to be 11.84mm.In fact, it is mandatory to write the max altitude a PSU can safely operate at. And if you happen to own any mining equipment the altitude will be on the PSU's specs, an example is Bitmain's PSU, it's rated at an altitude of <2000m because they use a factor clearance of 1 or in other words 8mm.of course, that doesn't mean that if you run a Bitmain PSU in Mexico city at 2200m above sea level you are going to toast it right away, it just means that the chances of that happening are higher than happening in Florida, it also means if you run them in La Paz at close to an altitude of 4000m where the spacing needs to be 30% more you simply are asking for troubles.",

So I tend to believe the light air bigger spark rule.",
