I've encountered some issues when trying to use the advanced fee settings on Electrum, and the recommendations I've seen online didn't cover what I needed. So a comprehensive guide that covers topics like where to find out about fees (Mempool), how to set the fees manually, how to use additional features like increasing fees of unconfirmed transactions could be useful.",

It is solely for beginners, and beginners should learn how to be patient and that bitcoin is not something that you can earn right away just because you invested in it. The new investors should learn more about bitcoin and how to control themselves in the space of this field, as many new investors are being carried away and ignore the important parts of investing in bitcoin. I know you have a good intention; that's why I hope you read this post or comment so you can give guide a full but short guide that will be brought by those newbies in their journey in this bitcoin world or crypto currency world. I will also be curious about what guide you will make to help those in need and if it will really be helpful.",

I mean, in the aspect of reusing addresses, you can explain in detail to a layman, as many newbies also see the reuse address warning as if they can lose their coins. be reusing an address when the case is just for privacy reasons only.",

This is because you trigger capital gains or losses if its market value has changed.It's measured in USD equivalent, you can use blockchair.com to know how much the coins worth based on transaction dates. This is the capital gains bracket.It means if you not use your coins after a year and you only spend up to $11K, you won't be taxed.This is my understanding, I'm not from US.",

Yes, there are lots of people out there who have been in the industry and are still yet to get some more information because they lack ideas on how to go about it, but this move by you could help them solve some percentage of their problem, at least if not all. I have read through many replies here, and most of them are still pointing to the same thing, but I am coming from a different angle, which no one could think of when it comes to bitcoin-related issues, and that has to do with guidelines for noting bitcoin scams and phishing links. Yes, even wallets suffer from this phishing through malware sent through installed apps or messages one receives and unknowingly clicks on them. This has cost many of their bitcoin assets, and some costly mistakes were made by them without knowing that what was sent to them were scam sites and links. So it would be nice if you could really look into this aspect of activity and work on possible guidelines for both newbies and old members on how to note bitcoin scams and phishing links, as they are basic to being safe with your funds and assets in this space.",

There is also no difference between crypto phishing links or not, they have more or less the same signs. I don't see a lack of education on this forum to be honest, not sure if other media don't even bother with it. That would be a shame though, since it is such an easy way to get visits from beginners. At the very least, I believe most people are aware that Google ads are likely a scam/phishing link most of the time.",
