From my childhood, my parents raised me with a lot of pain and care and even taught me education.Their dream was that I would grow up to do good and achieve their fame.I have been working in a private company for about seven years after completing my education and have been saving my salary from the company and investing in Bitcoin.I made a post a few days ago saying that I paid for my entire wedding with my Bitcoin money.Today is one of the best days of my life and I have completed the first step of my parents dream with my bitcoin money. Which I want to share with you today. As the saying goes \"When God gives, His hands are full\". Today I am very happy to do this post todayHelping family businesses with Bitcoin:My father has a business which is weaving industry. This business is our ancestral business.The main function of our business is to manufacture sarees which are human body wear.Our main work in this business requires electric powered looms to make sarees. The price of an electric powered loom machine (about one lakh fifty thousand rupees, this is our own country's rupees). But if we take the price as bitcoin or take the price as dollars then it will cost around $1300 dollars.I bought an electric powered loom machine for my father's business facility with my own invested Bitcoin money.It cost me about $1300 dollars    Fulfill my dreams with Bitcoin:My childhood dream was to buy a motorcycle when I grow up. It is the dream of most boys these days to have their own bike.I bought my dream motorcycle with my bitcoin money.My bike model is Suzuki GSX-R Dual ABS. The price of which is about five thousand dollars in our country. As I don't have that much dollars, I bought a second hand motorcycle which costs around $2050    [I lost all the bitcoins I had invested, it's sad. But I am very happy and glad to be able to fulfill my father's business and my own dreams]Finally, I would like to invest more in Bitcoin in the future, saying that the single best coin to invest in is Bitcoin. Many people's lives have already changed by investing in bitcoins, as mine has. I have already invested in almost all coins but the safest and most successful investment is my Bitcoin investment",

Not everyone achieves their dreams as they have other things to consider or hard for them to decide whether they will prioritize their dreams or their family.You have bought a machine to help your parent's business from your invested money, which can also be considered an investment or an asset that can give your family a source of income. You were able to buy your dream bike which cannot easily afford by anyone even after purchasing a machine that is expensive. You have nothing to be so sad about, your money served its purpose. You can always start again from your investment, at least you are able to use your previous investment in the correct way.",

This reminds me of the story where people say buying a new Iphone is a waste while we don't even know what source of money they are using to buy an Iphone or a car. But I think he won't need to sell his motorbike to buy bitcoin during the next bear season. Did you forget that he still has a job and a stable income? For someone with a plan and stable income like OP, there is no reason to sell assets to buy bitcoin.",

You must have been very happy that you finally achieved some of your dreams and your family's dream. So be grateful for those what you have, even if it means selling your bitcoin and losing your bitcoin investment. At least, you can buy back again when you have earned sufficient funds to invest in bitcoin.For now, observe the market first and check if bitcoin's price has drop a little, because that would be a good opportunity to purchase again a portion of bitcoin and hold it for long term especially that the next bitcoin halving is imminent. Your future bitcoin profits will definitely grow in time, and if you hold like 5 years or more, you will reap massive profits by then most especially that bitcoin is set to reach a new all time high every year.",

Your stories are great and inspiring and despite that you have sold all of your Bitcoins, you can still comeback and buy again as you start to accumulate again. This is the essence of having an investment, whenever you need to dispose it for some important matters, you can liquidate it and see the fruits of your labor. Someone's achievement and being shared here is encouraging us to do better in life and of course give back to our parents if ever we can. I think many of us here have experienced hardship before knowing Bitcoin so, everyone can relate to your success story. Congratulations!",

The worst thing is that when you fall, you can't get up and start again or don't have a chance to start again . Life is a journey and it is normal for us to stumble along the way and whether we get up and keep going is up to us to decide. People who can get up after falling are brave and brave . Bitcoin is just money, as long as you work hard and are flexible in life , accumulating it is never difficult. Just like we spend money, we can also earn it back, and that's life. What you say, like you are afraid of failure and you will fall if you fail.",
