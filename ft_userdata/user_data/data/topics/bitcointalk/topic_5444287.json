The era of x1000 or more on Bitcoin is already over and there’s no way you can grow 100$ or 1000$ to millions here unless you become very lucky on futures trading.The only way to possibly attain it on Bitcoin investment is through DCA until you save enough of Bitcoin and wait for the bullrun to get x2 or above on your investment. Most likely you will need a capital of 300k or above to hit this kind of target profit. Good luck in this.",

      "body": "I don't think it's really a good idea for you to have the profit part hanging over your head. Why come into this investment without also having a rethink about the fact that Bitcoin investment is ordinarily not a way to make fast money, where you invest 1000 dollars today and take back 1 million dollars tomorrow? If it were that simple, then the whole world would have all turned millionaires, and no one would have ever been poor. Why you are thinking of making the millions, please also add to your thinking that you could also lose everything and become bankrupt by chasing that big bag. Just be cautious and mind the steps you take when investing. A bitcoin investment is not blood money.",

Your mentality of growing millions from this investment is not right at all. Looking at that profit target can only force you to invest more than you can lose. Although bitcoin is seen as the freedom of money due to its decentralization but it also comes with its own risk which is the volatility. I would advice you to look into acquiring its knowledge first as it will give you an insight on it before investing on it",

For small investors who buy 100$ in btc or something like that, it's unlikely they are going to make millions, also because right now bitcoin is in a more advanced stage compared to its early years of existence, so percentage increasements in price tend to be lower. Bitcoin is a good investment and it does return nicely on long term, but it's not a magical \"Midas touch\" which is going to turn everything around into gold without any challenges.",

A good opportunity that can be exploited in investing is to use DCA and this pattern is perfect for those who don't have large capital to take a purchase approach.

But since you are a new investor, you will start investing with little first. However, if you invest all the money you have now, you may profit in the future. But if you invest for a short period of time you won't earn much profit so you have to invest in Bitcoin for a long time and hold it. And if you buy and hold Bitcoin for the long term, you can definitely make a lot of money. But you can never get millions of dollars by investing in this time.",

You are totally correct, people see Bitcoin as a get rich schemes and this has affected them alot. You are welcome of course to the Bitcoin world but for now, all you should be doing is learn and understanding everything there is about Bitcoin. Rushing into investment isn't going to be good as you may lose your funds. Try learning for now and you will be good to go in no time.

With this high expectations of making millions, you will quickly be disappointed if getting rich from bitcoins is what you have planned. It is not impossible, but at the same time not as easy as the person who told you about bitcoins and how it is the stuff to make millions from, made it sound. Investment in bitcoins can name you rich and can also make you poor. Investment in bitcoins does not guarantee profit or riches. I will like to advice you @OP that you find out what bitcoin really is for and abandon that bad notion that you have about it as a way to get rich quickly.",

Carefully study first and then wait patiently.Indeed it's funny when someone sees Bitcoin as get rich quick scheme. Someone already told it or they saw it online without verifying if those things are true or not but they just jump here immediately. I doubt many people can make millions in Bitcoin because it just takes a long time for the Bitcoin price to rise and people will mostly sell before they see it.As much as they want a profit, these people must understand the underlying risk in Bitcoin because it is highly unstable and it can dumped a lot of times. I wouldn't say it's reliable because of it this but it is much better compared to the shitcoin and some altcoins for some reasons.",
