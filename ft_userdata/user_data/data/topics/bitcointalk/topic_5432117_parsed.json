  "content": "I didn't see any thread about the handball world championship that will take place from 11 to 29 January 2023. It will be hosted by Poland and Sweden. Since it starts in just 14 days, I thought it would be a good time to start a discussion thread.The biggest favorite to win the championship is Denmark who is two times defending champion. The championship will start with the opening game Poland vs. France. Who do you think will win this year? Will it be Denmark again to win it three times in a row or some other country like France?",

There's not much interest for the game outside Europe, although there are some nations outside Europe that are solid like Tunis. The game is played faster than football and it's mostly played in front of each goal. I don't follow handball that much except when there is world cup or euro cup.Quote from: Sithara007 on December 28, 2022, 11:38:17 AMThe last time I watched handball was during Tokyo 2021 Olympics.

But to say that they are one of the strongest teams in handball is a bit of exaggeration. There are better teams like Denmark, France, Spain, Germany...",

For them, including Russia on events that are international might seem like they are turning a blind eye on what the current events are. It's a shame that these guys cannot play in this international tournament, and there is always an option to bear the flag of other countries in order to compete but hey, at least they are patriotic enough to not turn a blind eye on their motherland. Currently watching the friendlies between Brazil and Korea and I must say I'm weirded out seeing people throwing the ball passionately and seeing that the goal post is very similar to football  I think I've watched a few games of handball before but not at this level. Their coordination and their speed (especially the defenders) are on another level, considering that the ball that they're tossing around is really small to block or catch. Rooting for Brazil to win since their coordination is top tier and man, those blocks from the goalie is something else.",

A lot of people even want to ban individual Russian athletes and the best example is that of tennis players such as Daniil Medvedev. And more interestingly, some of the players want him banned because of his citizenship. A ban would benefit these players, as it will impact the ranking.

And I know that Croatia isn't the biggest favorite to win the World Cup, but they are always close.",

Apart from cricket, some of the other sports such as football, tennis, badminton, field hockey and wrestling are also somewhat popular.

The biggest problem with handball is that there is not much money in the sport. Not like in football, basketball and other sports that are popular globally. The best handball player will never earn as much as any football player who plays in an European football club. When I see how much Ronaldo will be earning in his new club El Nesyri...

If the IHF can come up with a proper expansion plan, then I am sure that the popularity and number of fans will increase outside Europe. And once the popularity goes up, revenue inflows will witness an uptick automatically. I agree. I watched beach handball long time ago (I think it has been 15 years when my ex girlfriend played it). I think that beach handball has somewhat different rules than \"normal\" handball. They give extra points for attractive goals and that's why it's gaining more attention. At least that were the rules when my ex girlfriend played it. For me handball is not that attractive sport. I'm not saying that it's easy to play, but 90% of the game is infront of each team's goal and I don't like it. But that's my personal opinion.",

I guess that during the last World Cup when beIN was broadcasting the World Cup in India not much viewers followed it so this year they decided that it's not worth the money.Well.. I am residing in India, and sorry to say that handball is not very popular here. Cricket is the main sport in India. Apart from cricket, some of the other sports such as football, tennis, badminton, field hockey and wrestling are also somewhat popular. But handball is mostly confined to school and university tournaments and there is hardly any club structure outside it. Most of the Indians watch handball when the Indian team participates in Olympics, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. Now the 2023 World Men's Handball Championship may not attract much viewership in India primarily for two reasons - first of all the Indian team is not participating. And secondly, there is not much advertising. But during the last few years, there is a rising interest within India regarding some of the \"new\" sports, such as rugby, baseball and netball. If the IHF provides some support for the Handball Federation of the India (HFI), then I am sure that the sport will become popular in India as well. The biggest problem with handball is that there is not much money in the sport. Not like in football, basketball and other sports that are popular globally. The best handball player will never earn as much as any football player who plays in an European football club. When I see how much Ronaldo will be earning in his new club El Nesyri... I think that one handball club doesn't pay that much money for the whole team.Yes, of course, when compared, it is clear that the difference is very far away.In terms of handball fans, there are not that many fans of football and soccer is the most popular sport and even has a world championship event which is always looked forward to by fans and clubs of countries that have great potential in football.There are only certain countries that still hold handball matches and even then there are very few fans.So don't compare handball to soccer because they are clearly not compatible at all.",
