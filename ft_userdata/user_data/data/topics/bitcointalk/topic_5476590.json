Once seeing the earliest price of Bitcoin at $20k, who would have imagined that so soon within a short  interval that the price will double. Those who had bought a handful of Bitcoin back then as for the much lower prices will be extremely happy to see their investment grow by 200%, 300% and more as even Bitcoin is yet to hit ATH.It is not too late to buy now as there is still a vacuum left for your investment to grow. Those who would fail to buy now might live to regret as this price range might not be seen again and it might still be a good option for those who already bought and still have what it takes to buy more might want to keep buying because at every buying price it is certain to make profits from it.",

It's been long since Bitcoin price was being speculated and alot of persons where just seeing it as mere speculations, now they are seeing the results and regretting why they never accumulated Bitcoin long ago and now they're even seeing the price like unaffordable when it hasn't even gotten to ATH. In this life, it is risky not to take risk and if you take the risk and fall you rise up and move on then if it also works out for you, you become a wiseman just like people that accumulated Bitcoin long ago they're all wise ones now because they're reaping the dividends of the decision they took long ago.",

I will advise we tread with caution and also be mindful of how we handle our activities this period. One mistake many people do is by going around and telling people to bring money let them invest in Bitcoin when the price is going higher. This will put unnecessary pressure on you. Let's buy the little we can buy and be satisfied with it. It is better that way than having many people on your neck as they were assured of profit and you know these things takes time and any little bad news around the world will cause a panic and there will be a dip in the market.",

If there is anything you should invest in the crypto space, I think it is Bitcoin because Bitcoin is a solid project that has saved people money for 14 years now, and it has the character to recover from price loss and set a new ATH whenever Bitcoin halve take place. You can also use Bitcoin to send money to your sisters/brothers abroad. So, if you have any interest in investing in Bitcoin make sure you have a source of income that will take care of your financial challenges after investing in Bitcoin so that you will not need to sell your Bitcoin to sort out your problems. Quotei wish i bought then, but right now am still confused if i should buy or wait for the price to drop below 40k. But it looks like something that will not happen anytime soon.I think it might not be wise to wait for the price to fall to $40k before you can start your Bitcoin accumulation. You can divide your money into three equal parts, and use one part to buy Bitcoin with a lump sum, the second part to buy Bitcoin when there is a dip in the Bitcoin price, and the third part to buy Buy Bitcoin using the DCA strategy.",

Quote from: Dailyscript on December 05, 2023, 08:39:00 AMOP, i like the fact that you brought this topic up for discussion. I am one of those people who did not buy any amount of bitcoin. Loot at the price now, i wish i bought then, but right now am still confused if i should buy or wait for the price to drop below 40k. But it looks like something that will not happen anytime soon. I gladly recommend you buy now than waiting for the price to fall as it might not, same way most persons procrastinates and did end up not buying as they keep waiting for the price to drop. The last All Time High of Bitcoin was on the range of $67k to $69k and calculating from here there is still enough time to buy and make good profits. Quote from: HajiBagi on December 05, 2023, 06:26:04 PMI believe that the price of bitcoin will move forward again, but I will also anyone who want to buy it at this particular time should invest the amount that he or she is capable of losing because if anyone take a risk by investing a lot of money because he is expecting a profit and later the bitcoin price didn't go well the way he wants he will lost his money and no one to be blame.I strongly believe, more than assumption that investing any amount will definitely give you profit, it might take a longer time than expected but definitely you must see profits, as we should already know Bitcoin investment is for a long term not a quick money project like Altcoins.

ATH dey always happen a year after the halving. Na so e happen for the last 2/3 halving and na so e suppose happen for this one, to continue the cycle as after the new ATH dun happen we go come get correction way go lead us into the bear market. Next year self we fit see major dump wey go fit take us sometime to recover self. It takes just one ban from china or the US on mining or other Bitcoin related service like mixers wey me dey think go bring alot of problem as government just dey shutdown dem like never before. If nothing happen wey dey negative den the market go continue but e go just dey beat around the bush until 2025 and na when the market go dey in full force to carry us go a new ATH.",
