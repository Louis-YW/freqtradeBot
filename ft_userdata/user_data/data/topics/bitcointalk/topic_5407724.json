Company I work for offersJudging by the other things you've already listed on your website [e.g. Wedding dresses], I'm going to assume that you're just a drop-shipper [in other words, I don't think you actually work for \"any\" company] and if for some unknown reason, the other involved party decides to not ship or rather scam your customers, how are you going to handle the situation?Quote from: bestradingbro on July 26, 2022, 09:20:38 PMI offer Discount $300 off per item if buying 10+!!!Quote from: bestradingbro on July 30, 2022, 01:13:01 AM($50 off per item if buying 10 or more)Which one is it? $300 or $50?",

      "body": "Dear SFR10,Thank you for your comments and questions.The wedding dresses, I do affiliate marketing for Aliexpress, the miners I sell as a Sales Associate of an LLC US-based company....So, the company won't scam as they are an established Limited Liability Company (LLC) with an established client base and have been rated already with positive ratings.The discount of $50 off is per unit of Overclocking Boards, and $300 per unit if buying in bulk from the miners in the inventory. Please contact me for more details and I could tell you more of the company if you would like to purchase, thank you so much, and looking forward doing business with you eventually!!!",
