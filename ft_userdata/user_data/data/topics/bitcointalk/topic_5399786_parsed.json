I think at the end it makes the whole process much cheaper comparing to using big exchange (even if commission fee is slightly bigger). And the full process is automated, you only need to tell your bank to make regular transfers - buying and withdrawal does not need your actions.",

Stacking sat is always the word that people love to use especially nowadays when btc price is dipping. That site can offer lower fees but still people must be careful on trusting sites that are still new to them. I say new because this is the first time I hear this or see this being talked about on the forum but how this can be a good solution to DCA when I think both acts are still the same? If there are differences then maybe that was only their names or their term's.

We know most people on this site hates kyc. When it comes to language problems, that is not a big deal but we can just some translators to fix this issue.",

Not your keys not your coins.I mean, it's going to depend on how frequent the DCA is, as some people go as far as buying daily; and buying daily in a non-custodial manner via P2P exchanges can definitely be a huge hassle (depending on how busy you are).Tbh DCA-ing via custodial platforms is fine imo (if you already had an account in the first place). Just withdraw the BTC to a hardware wallet like every week or so.",
