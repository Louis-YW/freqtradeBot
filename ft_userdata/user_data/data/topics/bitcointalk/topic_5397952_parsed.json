Many of the documents he has provided have been proven to be forged or manipulated. Many of his statements have been proven to be lies. Nothing that he has said can be accepted as accurate or truthful.The judge in the case you are referring to wrote this:Quote from: https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20190816b05Unfortunately, the record is replete with instances in which the Defendant has proffered conflicting sworn testimony before this Court. In weighing the evidence, the Court simply does not find the Defendant's testimony to be credible.",
