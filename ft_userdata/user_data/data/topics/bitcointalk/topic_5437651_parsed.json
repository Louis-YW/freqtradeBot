MEXC was only supporting NVT tokens that used nuls network. You can even use this scan to know more about that. https://nulscan.io/That being said that if MEXC didn't support NVT withdraw for another network like . it's only supporting NVT based on nuls network. It's NRC20 token. Nerve has its own chain but it seems like that nerve developers didn't request MEXC to add its own chain and prefer to use NRC20 token build on nuls network to issue NVT asset based on the different blockchain called nuls blockchain.",
