Why will I pay you back?Think about it man. You are a new account, you come into the forum, and your 1st post is for a loan. On top of that, you offer nothing to cover the loan if something happens(collateral). Do you really think people just hand out money and pray they get repaid? It's not rocket science.",

It's not rocket science.I understand and appreciate your concern. Actually I visited this website and found LOAN option. So, I asked for a loan due to requirements. Also, I don't have any other fund to keep collateral. But if you want to get any collateral you can give me perfect Money loan (credit exchange).  Credit score of my perfect money is much higher ( around $70K transaction completed)",

It is quite strange that you just created your account yesterday and are asking for a loan same day. The question is, how did you even find the lending board, or if you were asked by your friends to come on the forum and request a loan, were you not told by your friends that brand new and newbies don't stand a chance of getting a loan from the forum? You should use your original account to request the loan if you are actually serious.",
