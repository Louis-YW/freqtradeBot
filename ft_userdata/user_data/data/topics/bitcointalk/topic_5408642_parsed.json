But from another angle, this is a strategy for them to raise more funds in the future and this will happen by investing millions in cryptocurrency a few years from now. Also, it seems that Michael Saylor can do a better and perfect strategy when he is in the position of being the Executive Chairman of their company, as well as the new CEO according to my analysis on this matter, and apart from this I have no other visible reason.But on the other hand it has a good impact on those of us who believe in cryptocurrency, it increases the reputation of this industry, which is one of the biggest companies in the world investing millions of dollars because of the great belief in this matter in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.I can still say that this is a good decision that Michael Saylor made in the move of putting a large amount of money into this Bitcoin industry.",

Whatever the case, I share @OgNasty's view on this. They have become more identified as a company that buys and holds bitcoins than a leading software company. I guess we should expect MS to slow down on btc acquisition after this.",

You're no longer investing in a company with a ceo that's made a 1bn loss, you're investing in one that can change leadership and may be run better as a result.This news initially sounded bearish to me and I still can't decide if it is or not. I'd guess they could be taking a step back to maybe take a more intensive look at btc and see how the company could've better adapted to relieving its debts.",

Before making bitcoin treasury strategy the stocks of MicroStrategy were around $100 - $150 for years. This touched a high of $1034 during the February month 2021. The growth is being experienced through bitcoin and surely whatever decision taken relative to bitcoin is gonna bring them growth.What we see with the stepping down as CEO too is the same. There's loss out of bitcoin, but in the long term it'll surely give the best results. Stepping down is a plan and not out of pressure in my view.",

I have no issue with Saylor and believe his moves with MSTR will pay off in the next few years quite nicely, but before you say nonsense, I also look at the business aspects of things.  Sure he could do whatever he wanted, but he is no fool and wouldn't want to spook investors or tank the company.  Many investors, including 'activist' investors, don't have a solid foundational understanding of BTC and have a myopic viewpoint- q2q and as much as it sucks, there is going to be some appeasement for them, esp when you lose over 1B in a q.  He could always take his company private and do what he wants but with current market conditions and climate, going from public to private may not be the move to make right now.",

I wonder what this company will do once we are back into bull cycle and the price will break the previous ATH. Will they re-instate Saylor as a CEO? As an executive Chairman, Saylor will not have much power to take direct decisions. That's why Microstrategy is offering this post to him. CEO is the one, who will take decisions and Executive Chairman will just have to sign it. That's all the power he will have. So I doubt Microstrategy will ever invest in bitcoin again.In a way, it's good for bitcoin because a single entity will not accumulate more and take it toward centralization. But it's hilarious to see a company taking such decisions based on a short term outcome. Not good and it lacks vision, clearly!",
