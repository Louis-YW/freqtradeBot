How real is that and does that really count as mining? Second question is, if it can be called mining, is it the creators of the \"pi\" that made it mineable with even a cellphone? Are creators of a cryptocurrency (the ones that are mineable) the ones that set how you can mine them?",

      "body": "Cell phones have a CPU so technically they can mine if someone writes the software. It has been donebut it's generally a bad idea because phones aren't designed for that kind of abuse. The only legitimatephone miners also work on other ARM based platforms. Anything \"phone only\" is a scam.Edit: regarding the last question crypto creators only define the algorithm. It can be implemented in any technologyimagineable, even with pencil & paper. There is no way to prevent any technology from implementing the algoriithm,only technical limitations that make it unfeasible.",

Not that mobile phones cannot mine but they aren't built to mine in the first place. I still find it surprising that there are still remaining Pi believers around.",

Just pretended to mine and you got paid for it. Most cell phone mining apps are scams to steal your private keys. If you find one in the google play store and it doesn’t have many reviews it’s most likely some malware.",

Is this not the same dubiety that people expressed when bitcoin was launched, thinking that it will have no value and then today suddenly you know the story.Quote from: inthelongrun on August 19, 2022, 01:29:14 PM I still find it surprising that there are still remaining Pi believers around.These believers are those who missed out on bitcoin then maybe due to dubiety, right now, they may tell you that they rather have Pi and later meet the reality that it has no value, than not have Pi at all and later meet the reality that it has value.",

It's when I started to get into cryptocurrency, and I just searched how you can mine, etc., and that appeared. They have an application for desktop and mobile IIRC. I wouldn't recommend that to anyone, but that's just one of the things I remember when mining. With Pi, I think it's just a joke to get all the data from unsuspecting users that would sell their identity to the highest bidder. Upsell something or something with that knowledge. It's just impossible to conclude this type of thing.",
