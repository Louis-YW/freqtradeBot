This makes the coinjoin transactions larger and therefore even harder to break, as well as increasing the throughput of remixes meaning everyone gets more free remixes faster, all for no additional cost to the users.Here are a few such coinjoins from the last couple of hours, each with 8 inputs and 8 outputs instead of the usual 5:0.001 pool - https://mempool.space/tx/d66520a1e4a38bbca788e70bce95803d62850441eab6ddee7645f6addbc25c480.01 pool - https://mempool.space/tx/7e0814e83270dc7c733b2a71308985419625a612d756852027d81a4c5490314d0.05 pool - https://mempool.space/tx/f4fd5cad5d4db3716fe2081d1bc20f0beb33a417adf22c8fcca131cb6249adb6",

The transaction fee is not quite where we want it but the mempool congestions have stabilized. I have no idea what the developers have been planning in the last few days since I am not up to speed but what is the possibility that the Bitcoin NFT hype has cooled down for good?Last I read, the devs were planning on introducing a runtime option to delete or invalidate all non-standard taproot transactions? Sounded like a plan to me. If I were to guess I would say thats exactly the reason why the hype has been dying out in the last few days. Now nobody wants to board the near-future trainwreck which are ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, now that they are on the cancel list...",

      "body": "Quote from: dkbit98 on May 23, 2023, 08:37:39 PMWouldn't this in theory also increase fees a lot for coinjoins?It won't change the fees at all.The way Whirlpool coinjoins work(ed) is that they would always pick 2 fresh inputs from Tx0s, and 3 already mixed inputs from previous coinjoins. The 2 inputs from Tx0 were the ones which paid the fees. Every input which was already mixed gets unlimited free remixes. If you look at the 0.05 pool transaction I linked to above (https://mempool.space/tx/f4fd5cad5d4db3716fe2081d1bc20f0beb33a417adf22c8fcca131cb6249adb6), you'll see one input of 0.05014520 BTC and one of 0.05006037 BTC, and the others all of 0.05 BTC exactly. These two new inputs are created from an initial transaction called Tx0 which splits the amount of be coinjoined in to the needed denominations to join the chosen pool, along with a few extra sats in to each input to pay the fee for that first coinjoin transaction. This is obviously an estimate at the time given the current mempool conditions. None of this has changed.When it comes around to actually joining a coinjoin, before it would always be 5 inputs and 5 outputs, and any extra sats on these two fresh inputs were simply paid as a higher transaction fee to miners. Now if this is the case, the protocol will add in one or more additional inputs/outputs in order to bring the transaction fee down to a more appropriate level.Nothing changes for the users, except some of their coinjoins now benefit from larger anonymity sets.",

People who don't mix on a regular basis won't save anything if they don't maintain their LN channels. You're right, off-chain mixing doesn't make much sense in a world where it is still possible for a single individual to make economically viable transactions on a base layer, without having to rely on a pool of co-signers and fee share payers. Mixing through Lightning Network and similar solutions is no different conceptually from CoinSwap but leaves even more traces in the blockchain. You exchange two unrelated UTXOs or transaction histories, but some of your off-chain activity may reveal the real purpose of the transaction and give an observer additional information about transaction participants. The more tools a user employs to facilitate a private transaction, the greater the chance of messing up things and lowering the anonymity set. This is why I support this new Whirlpool feature: your behavior doesn't change, whereas your anonymity increases, and you get additional privacy for free.",

If, when those coins actually come to be coinjoined, it turns out that fee is higher than necessary, it will enroll additional inputs in order to lower the overall fee rate back to a more appropriate level.Quote from: Kryptowerk on June 03, 2023, 12:07:04 AMbtw, is there a statistic showing how many coin-join tx whirlpool is running per day?

I am obviously on Linux which it is designed for - I imagine trying to install on Windows would be more challenging.Once you have it set up, you can be either a maker (also called a yield generator) or a taker. Most people run as takers only, because it is much simpler. As a taker, you decide which outputs you want to coinjoin, how many other outputs you want to include in your coinjoin, how many coinjoins you want to perform, and so on. You pay the transaction fee and a small fee to each of the other inputs joining your coinjoin, usually in the order of 5-300 sats depending on the size of your inputs. You can do PayJoins to an external address, and you can also do a series of internal coinjoins in a so called \"Tumbler\" to mix your coins back to your own wallet. It's very versatile. You can also run it via testnet (instructions are on their guides) to get familiar with it first.If you want to be a maker, then there is further software to set up, but you essentially post your outputs on an orderbook and other users will pay you to use your outputs in one of their coinjoins. You get to mix your outputs and you get paid a little for the trouble.

      "body": "In terms of trust, there is no denying that you need to trust Whirlwind more since you need to deposit coins to their service, as opposed to Whirlpool where you stay in custody of your coins. There is also the issue of trusting the service not to log what you are doing, which can be prevented with Whirlpool by using your own node and Tor. This could change in the future though, as Whirlwind have talked about decentralizing their service and implementing blinded certificates, which would eliminate any trust requirements.In terms of privacy to an outside observer, then at the moment it depends on how you use them, but in the future I would say Whirlwind will provide better privacy than Whirlpool. If you coinjoin on Whirlpool, then your privacy is dependent on how many times you let the coins be mixed before you spend them. Assuming 5-input and 5-output coinjoins, then after one mix your backwards looking anonymity set is a maximum of 5. After two mixes, a maximum of 25. After three mixes, a maximum of 125. And so on. I say maximum, because if other people in the coinjoin do something stupid and deanonymize their coins, than that lowers your anonymity set. If you leave your coins in Whirlpool for months and months and end up with 10+ remixes then that's a very good anonymity set, but if you just let them be coinjoined once or twice before you spend them then that's not a very good anonymity set. This same principle applies to any coinjoin implementation. Whirlwind, on the other hand, currently has an anonymity set of 414 as long as you don't deposit huge amounts, and this is only going to grow. In the future, you will be able to get an anonymity set with Whirlwind of 10,000 or more.",

I simply can't compete makers with hundreds of times more money than I have, and with a fortune locked in fidelity bonds. If you want to be a maker, you need serious amount of money, which comes with even more serious awareness of the protocol and the security measures you need to take.

Is it cheaper than Joinmarket?It's the only other option at the moment, since you shouldn't go anywhere near Wasabi for obvious reasons.In terms of being cheaper - it's variable, and difficult to compare exactly. The fees for Whirlpool are all flat, as opposed to based on amounts or number of coinjoins. You have to pay a fee to join the pool, which depends on which pool you are joining. So if I join the 0.01 BTC pool, then my Tx0 pays a 50,000 sat fee. But I pay that fee regardless of whether I enroll one UTXO or one hundred UTXOs. Then each input needs to pay the transaction fee for its first coinjoin. So if we take the 0.01 BTC pool transaction I linked to in the first post, you'll see two inputs paying more than 0.01 BTC - one paying 5,000 sats more, and one paying 15,000 sats more. But then once you are in the pool and coinjoined once, you get unlimited free coinjoins for as long as you are happy to leave your coins in the pool.So in summary, if you coinjoin a small number of UTXOs a small number of times, your relative fees are high. But if you coinjoin lots of UTXOs lots of times, the relative fees are much smaller.",

The thing I really like with Joinmarket is that coins never leave my house. We saw how terribly this involved with ChipMixer, when you woke up and the German authorities have had your coins seized without you knowing anything. I've had, fortunately, only a small amount seized, but I put myself in the position of people who lost thousands, and it must have been awful. Whirlwind tries to minimize the consequences of this by dividing custody into multiple trustworthy forum members, but it doesn't eliminate it completely, and it's yet to implement this shared custody.We're far from ideal mixing, but we've got worse comparably to the last years with the shut down of CM, the censoring Wasabi and the overcrowded mempool. Mixing is now inferior and more expensive.",

As long as your wallet is online and connected to the coordinator, then any of your previous coinjoin outputs which you have spent are eligible to be included in a future coinjoin for free, with the new entrants paying the transaction fee as I described above. The coordinator sets this up, but your wallet signs the transaction for your input. Your wallet also doesn't need to remain online 24/7. You can shut down your phone or computer for days or even weeks at a time, and when you start it back up your unspent coinjoin outputs will still be eligible to be selected for new coinjoins. The biggest downside to this is time. Your first mix is almost instant, since you are paying the fee. After that, free remixes can take a long time, since you depend on new volume entering the pool to create new coinjoins, and random chance that your outputs are selected. There is no time limit to how long you can wait or how many free remixes you can have, but sometimes you can be waiting over a week for a single remix.",

I don't really understand why this is possible without additional fees, but glad to hear it is working anyway.Basically, when you first enroll coins in to Whirlpool, it does so with what it thinks will be a safe fee for relatively quick confirmation of a 5-input-5-output coinjoin. If, when those coins actually come to be coinjoined, it turns out that fee is higher than necessary, it will enroll additional inputs in order to lower the overall fee rate back to a more appropriate level.So that is what the Sparrow's Premix Fee Rate is supposed to do, right? Things that make the postmix-ed UTXOs able to be remixed repeatedly and the coinjoin that has more than 5-input-5-output is come from that premix fee, if the current pool participant/condition has a low fee that would reduce the number of inputs and postmix remix rounds availability. Am I understand it correctly?",
