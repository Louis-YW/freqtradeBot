But the main point centers on the fact that copy trading prevents or limits you from actually learning the trading it self and you place your trading decisions on a third party. No matter how good they may be it is always advice to actually do your own research on this crypto space so you get lure into your investing in pump and dump coins. As a newbie the easiest way will first be to hodl your bitcoin not Alticoin and then learn about the trading fundamentals gradually, because it is even easier for a learned person to copy trade because they could Atleast dictate fake signals or scam projects. But blindly following other traders way is deemed very risky.",

Many consider it an appealing choice for beginners, but is it truly effective for those who are new to trading?Some may thinks too but I don't think it's a viable  or an advisable option for newcomers. It may have some serious limitations which you can't ignore:1. You may have struggle to find out the perfect trader to follow for copy trading. Also it will not be a cost effective way to trade because you may have to pay additional or higher fees than traditional trading. 2. You will have less opportunity to grow your skills or trading strategy. When you depend on others for your trading you will have less interest to learn about technical analysis, trading strategies so you will have limited learning possibilities.Anyway Copy trading is legit and a popular way to start trading for newbies. But I will suggest you to learn by yourself and control your funds. That will give you best output from trading if you can be an expert on it.",

Many consider it an appealing choice for beginners, but is it truly effective for those who are new to trading? The first concept that we should consider in trading is that if a single strategy works for others, that does not mean that it will also work for you. The market is changeable so we can’t predict that the same strategies will be working the whole time. That’s why copy trading will never be reliable at times. However, I don’t mean that it’s not useful in general. Some traders are still making some decent profits through copy trading, but I would not advise anyone to rely on it. It’s still best to trade on your own and learned from your own mistakes and losses, that way you can correct them after so you won’t have to suffer from committing the same mistake again.",

But it doesn't mean that we just be confident enough about what we learn from them, we also have to dig deeper through reading books or online tutorials. But what is important is that we are not afraid to lose because losing would help us to educate and give us more learnings. The more we commit mistakes, the more we find ways how to avoid them. I suggest newbies do this but I have also to warn about joining signal groups that promotes copy trading.",

Many consider it an appealing choice for beginners, but is it truly effective for those who are new to trading?For beginners who are new to crypto trading, I don't think there's anything wrong with trying the copy trading service. Because by trying these services, at least there will be a few examples and descriptions from the experts that are followed, while trading in the crypto market. But even so, I suggest, don't use the copy trading service for too long. Because if you only continue to use these services to trade in crypto, the impact will not be good for progress in the deeper field of crypto trading. Because if you continue to rely on these services, you are afraid that you will get too carried away and forget the knowledge that must be learned in the world of crypto trading and only depend on these services.Because basically, to enter or start into the realm of crypto trading. The first step that must be carried out is that you have to study the knowledge first, such as fundamental, sentimental and technical analysis and don't forget to know about risk factors too. Because in essence, if you want to get better at trading in crypto, you have to learn more first. In order to better understand and be able to become an independent trader. So in conclusion, try copy trading services, it's fine, but don't take too long and don't forget to keep learning about the science that must be learned to trade in crypto.",

It is something that is no more new in crypto again. About your question, I will advice beginners to learn trading. Because a leader trading (the person you are copying) is winning today, that does not means he will not have losses tomorrow. Another thing is that the leverage you use and the leverage the lead trader use may be different. Your trade may have higher leverage and riskier. But you can easy know the leverage the lead trader is using. Learn how to trade yourself is the best approach for trading.Know that copy trading or not, trading your self or not, trading is very risky.",

In the end you will be paying someone to copy a strategy, which will probably not only be focused on Bitcoin but also on crypto, and which in many cases will lead you to ruin. With stock trading in some chaos copy trading can have a certain reliability, with people with public long term results, and yet you never know when the streak is going to break. The best thing for a newbie to do is to learn about Bitcoin and start doing DCA. But of course, this is much more boring than trading (although a safer way to get rich).Quote from: Oshosondy on July 29, 2023, 07:58:03 AMAnother thing is that the leverage you use and the leverage the lead trader use may be different.
