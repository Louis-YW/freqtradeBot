We are talking about 40 MB blocks every 10 minutes which nodes have to download and fully verify and a blockchain that grows 5.76 GB per day.The effects of it will first show up as the number of full nodes drastically drop in short term and eventually we move to more centralization and more full nodes that are run on cloud services (another form of centralization).The effects could also include more stale blocks and even some mining pools going back to the terrible spy/spv mining methods where they mine empty blocks because they're waiting for the last block be verified and can not include new txs in their next block yet.This could all translate into bitcoin price dropping and the miners' revenue significantly decreasing in terms of fiat as the exchange rate would be much lower.",

So if they increased it by 10x the mempool wouldn’t be clogged and people would pay the min 1 sat byte fee and miners would end up actually making less money.And we would also lose nodes due to the bandwidth and space requirements for such large blocks.",

I would think that the block reward would still be the same, in line with how it works currently. The difference in what miners earn is an interesting topic. The amount of fees that a miner could accumulate, yes, would amount to more potentially...I say potentially as the fee may be lower due to the block size able to fit more transactions, though the increased amount of transactions may mean that they make more...it really depends on the activity of the network and if these blocks are being filled, and if premiums are still being paid in order to be able to be included in the next block. My vote is no, because I don't think it would result in 10x earnings.",

Transaction fees do contribute to a miner’s earnings, the larger the block, and the more transactions in it, the larger the fee for the miner. However, this doesn’t mean that a 10x larger block would contain 10x more transactions or yield 10x more in fees. It would depend on the number and types of transactions that are included in the block. So, while larger blocks could potentially contain more transactions and thus higher transaction fees, they wouldn’t directly lead to miners earning 10x more per block.",

I am from F2Pool. We are currently mining the biggest blocks on the network. So far top 100 biggest bitcoin blocks are all from us. We do support bigger blocks and sooner rather than later. But we cannot handle 20 MB blocks right now. I know most blocks would not be 20 MB over night. But only if a small fraction of blocks more than 10 MB, it could dramatically increase of our orphan rate, result of higher fee to miners. Bad miners could attack us and the network with artificial big blocks. As yhou know, other Chinese pools, AntPool, BW, they produces ASIC chips and mining mostly with their own machines. They do not care about a few percent of orphan increase as much as we do. They would continue their zero fee policy. We would be the biggest loser. As the exchanges had taught us, zero fee is not health to the network. Also we have to redevelop our block broadcast logic. Server bandwidth is a lot more expensive in China. And the Internet is slow. Currently China has more than 50% of mining power, if block size increases, I bet European and American pools could suffer more than us. We think the max block size should be increased, but must be increased smoothly, 2 MB first, and then after one or two years 4 MB, then 8 MB, and so on. Thanks.Based on the above information, only big miners that have cheap mining rigs, cheap electricity cost and fast internet connection are make money, while the others aren't especially the small miners. Bigger blocks would decrease transaction fees, but big blocks might trigger Bitcoin's security, it's better to choose good security with expensive fees instead of low security with cheaper fees.",

The block reward will same but the fees they earn from each transaction could increase according to the number of transactions. But there are other possibilities too. If there are always fewer transactions, the mempool will remain empty and the transaction fee will be cheap as heck. So, Imagine a single block containing more than 35K transactions but all of them used less than 5 sat/vB fee. So, If I am not wrong, the miners won't make much money. We don't have to increase the block size to 10x at this moment. All it could be 2x max. It will help balance the network.",

Bigger blocks would decrease transaction fees, but big blocks might trigger Bitcoin's security, it's better to choose good security with expensive fees instead of low security with cheaper fees.But it's been many years since those points mentioned. Most miner/pool would have better hardware and internet at this point and various technology (such as company) allows faster block verification and propagation. And as miners will depend more on TX fee as their income, they're less likely to mine empty block.",

That will lead to lower hashrate, which means the price will start collapsing too.So you're saying 36 million dollars per day isn't enough for miners?Where did you get that figure from if I may ask?If this is from the current exchange rate, then what you need to know is that while I don't know what the average transaction size is (which would greatly help doing this calculation), I do know there are only between 5k-20k transactions in a block most of the time.If I be optimistic and guess the average is 500 sats/vbyte (including Ordinals), and that there are about 20k transactions, that's 10 million sats per block or 1BTC in fees.Whether this will be enough to support an operation depends on the particular miner. For now, most miners would not be affected by such a change because of the coinbase fee, but what if the BTC price becomes flat in the future and the coinbase is no longer enough to support miners?Many miners have huge loans open lines of credit, so in this case since fees are also stable and not increasing, then many of them would be forced to close shop.Edit: to reach $36m a day at these prices, you'd have to find nearly 100 blocks a day. That will take about 1000 minutes or 16 hours and 40 mins, but that is impossible for a single miner since that means they'd have to have way over 50% of the global hashrate. Something like $10m per day is more likely, but only for the largest miners.",

Miners are earning 36 million does that make the network how much secure compared to previous years?It's all a question of how much you're protecting an with how much you're defending, are $36 million a day enough for miners to build a wall against somebody wanting to attacks bitcoin now? Maybe! Assuming Bitcoin goes to 400k and the chain holds 8 trillions in value, does that value still project the same security, of course not.The exact math you did tells you the situation pretty well, you're getting paid 6.25 BTC per block to guard 19 millions BTCThen you will get  3.12 BTC a block to guard 19 million BTC.
