  "content": "I often read messages and posts that are written right under the topics that are often made by each OP.When I open a topic created by the topic owner, the message below appearsQuoteThere are several types of Bitcoin clients. The most secure are full nodes like Bitcoin Core, which will follow the rules of the network no matter what miners do. Even if each miner decides to make 1000 bitcoins per block, full nodes will stick to the rules and reject that block.I was curious because when I reloaded the computer, the text containing the important sentence changed to another text.For those of you who are curious like me, please try reloading and reading the sentences below my topic. The initial sentence under my topic will change to another important sentence.So I ask here. Anyone know? If I'm wrong about this topic, please let me know.This forum is really great.Thank you.Edit:Another example I found. Extraordinary",

It isn't necessary, but keeping your S-merits won't help you at all because those are not useful for you, however they can be helpful for other users who need those, and those who provide valuable information deserve to get some merits.@ShowOff said that because on you haven't sent a single merit to a user of the forum, however you have received many merits from the generous members of the forum who support users that do a value thing in this forum. I hope that soon you will realize that keeping those s-merits won't be helpful for you in any way at all, and giving those s-merits will make you happy as well because you will feel a pleasure to help those who somehow helped you with their knowledge.And, I must say that you have learnt about factoids from @FatFork, and that's why it should be very generous to send such users merits to show that you truly appreciate their help. It isn't mandatory, but it shows that how generous a user if with those who try to help him/her with their knowledge.",

Of course you have some sMerits saved after you've received 51 merit from other users, so it's only normal that someone warns you to use them when someone has already helped you find the right answer.There's nothing wrong with that advice, especially since you haven't gotten anyone's post after months of discussions with users who have good quality posts. Take the positive side though I think it's not the right time to warn you here. Anyway, I don't answer your question anymore on the topic, I think the two answers above have answered everything.",

The same way you sees it same to me but to my little knowledge about those things that displays I usually calls it ads that is being promoted by the forum.. most times same thing appears whenever send out btc and click on tx, you would see something like \" spin and win 1 btc\" or \"get 7 btc \" most of them displays \" win 8.88 btc\". But with the way I was security conscious I don't click at any I came across so easily. So I the first poster got it right.",

So with this little drama I just saw here, it clearly shows that at some point we just need to speak our mind so as to point things in the right direction. Thank you",

Thank youWhat you must understand is that the forum is open for everyone to speak up, and to whatever they found not in places they should be able to speak and make things right. Most importantly this forum doesn't restricts criticism, and as a member you should be able to overcome any forms of criticism and moved on without undermining what would be the outcome in as much as you are guilty free from what they are saying. However op holding about 22 smerits on his custody without willingly issuing it out isn't a good Â practice as I believe that it add no value to his account or his life.",

For me, I've always seen those, and have always been an active reader of those information, but the truth still is that I never knew what it was called until now, I've always simply seen it as an ad sharing bitcoin information when there are no actual ads to post there.Anyways, its interesting to find out that they are called Factoids, and I must confess that though they are always pretty short, but it passed great knowledge of bitcoin, some that if newbies are consistent in always reading it , they will learn a lot from it in not a so much distant time, kudo to the forum admin admins for such an interesting and educative feature.",
