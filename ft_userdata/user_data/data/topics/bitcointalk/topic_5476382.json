I think the op of that thread uses exchange wallets to store their funds, because he moved the funds from Bittrex which just recently shut down, into LocalBitcoins, which they didn't know already shut down months ago.Do not store your funds in an exchange wallet, and also don't move a large sum of money into an exchange address at once, you can break it down into smaller chunks. Even if the exchange is still in operation and they haven't changed their deposit address, they could confiscate your funds for any other reason at all, so sending funds in smaller chunks might save you from losing everything.",

End Of Line.The way you wrote it can be confusing. I later know after I read what you wrote that you are talking about not to save exchange or wallet address somewhere because the address can be changed by the exchange or wallet. If it is custodial wallet, you are right. But if it is noncustodial wallet, it is your key and there use nothing that will change it. But not all wallets are noncustodial, some wallets are custodial. But it is not good for anyone to use a custodial wallet, noncustodial wallet should be used.",

Even though some of the big exchanges may claim that customers' funds are safe, it is better to be safe than sorry. If any hack happens to an exchange, they won't compensate you quickly because of the various process that is involved, in the meantime, you are losing out on opportunities, and there is a possibility not the full amount will be compensated.People should already learn and understand the huge risk involved in keeping their funds in any exchange regardless of how secure they claim to be. Not your key, not your funds PERIOD.",

But not all wallets are noncustodial, some wallets are custodial. I think OP was actually addressing both custodial and non custodial wallets. Concerning the custodial wallet he describes the use risk of address reuse by which exchange can change the address anytime. But concerning the use of non custodial wallet OP’s warning is about saving addresses somewhere and later sending to an old address that you don’t currently have access to. This lack of access can be as a result of it already been comprised or you lost the keys.I think that’s what this paragraph by OP meant Quote from: DaveF on December 03, 2023, 02:48:36 PMAnd if you sent to your own wallet, don't save the address.

So it's applicable to wallet out there they might stop operation and close their wallet what happened when we send in our funds to that address we ends up losing our entire funds without knowing its our fault.",

Simply keep it, maybe with less storage safety compared to your current wallets that are in use. If you keep your old wallet's mandatory recovery data, you should be able to handle receipts to old addresses more gracefully. Good documentation helps, too.And again, switch on your brain and check carefully the validity and usability of your transaction's outputs when you move coins to your own wallet(s)! The Localbitcoins example of the guy who sent coins from an exchange to his months long defunct Localbitcoins address is a stupid mistake and a reckless move without prior validation (the incident's thread is linked by OP of this thread). Sorry to be frank, but it's the other OP's fault. It has been long known that Localbitcoins will shut down the service. I'm surprised a user can still login to his account.",
