  "content": "Overview of Bitcointalk Traffic AnalysisIntroduction:Analyzing website traffic for Bitcointalk can provide valuable insights that can help forum members to understand how big we are and obviously we can inform Crypto businesses to make informed decisions about advertising their projects on the forum.As an SEO professional, I have all sorts of tools which allow me to see different metrics of a website to analyze and improve.  I always wondered why admins never thought of to have an SEO audit for the entire forum, I understand it's an old forum but having an SEO audit and some simple tweaks can increase our online experience by 100x. That being said let's start with the last last month's stats.Traffic stats for February 20231.3 Million visits with 552.1k visitors. Although visits gained up to 8.63% compared to January 2023 but 2.97% drop of unique visitors basically makes it even. We had very similar traffic activities comparing to previous month. 56.53% bounce rate on a forum is a lot to be honest. The average visit duration is not bad. It means there are people who spend almost a whole day on the forum.Last six month's traffic flow and takesDoes anyone have any explanation why on the earth there is a dramatic drop from September last year to October last year? From 3.9M monthly visit to under 1M which is almost 75% drop, not a very normal behavior. Is this because of the Bitcoin price? I can not remember when it started to drop from $50k then below.Form October to until now, it's moving steady which is a good thing. 81% of the forum visitors are from Desktop which again proves if we had a mobile friendly version then we would have at least 10x visitors on the forum.It's very simple, most of the visitors who stay longer time are people who know the url and visit the forum by typing the URL directly on their browser. They may have bookmarked the pages too.Even without proper optimization, Google is providing 32.89% traffic. Duckduckgo is also popular around the community. I think these small percent of people are really concerned about their privacy.No office but it seems Colombian nations who are the most numbers as visitors do not like mobile device at all LOL. See 100% are on desktop when they are visiting the forum  Would you like me to continue it for every coming months?Opinions please.",

      "body": "Your statistics does provide valuable insights for the forum An average monthly registration of 8.5k, 1.3 million visits for February is a remarkable number.I am doubtful the admins are interested in boosting traffic or attracting more ads. And they do not plan to make any changes from the current system to make the forum more friendly to other users.

It also shows mobile users to be way higher than desktop users which does not show up in any other month.- Jay -",

I am using one of the best tool that is existed in the industry.The desktop users are steady, the ups and downs are not much noticable but that huge drop from September to October may caused by the price of Bitcoin. These days new generation always use mobile. When they see much growth, much talk about Bitcoin then they obviously find us from their smart phones.With a mobile friendly version we could hook them better.",

However the forum is missing on some great opportunities, where the source of all things bitcoin related should be this forum, where it should be in the top 5 results on the first pages of search engines. Some of the most prominent crypto related developers lurk these woods regularly and provide the most useful content, yet the search result for some fundamental discussions about bitcoin refer the user to other sources. Bitcointalk should be the go to for the majority of crypto enthusiasts not the go to for the majority of altcoin scammers.",

      "body": "Google does not consider a blog and a discussion board (forum,...) in the same way. This is a well-known fact, but to give an example, Google's bots visit a forum more frequently than a blog (every xx minutes for a forum, once a day for a blog. Considering you haven't written a rule in the robots.txt file of course)(And there is a good reason to do so, but that's another topic)The default SMF is enough to optimize SEO, of course they can install a mod but to be honest it's pretty useless. The forum is optimized sufficiently as it is and changing something won't do much.Not to mention the fact that Bitcointalk has been considered by Google as an \"authority site\" for years. And when it comes down to it, SEO is pretty useless.There are so many keywords with which Bitcointalk comes up on the 1st page of the SERPThat's for ON-site SEO, now for the OFF: does Bitcointalk need anything given the mentions it already has? Wikipedia, Forbes, WJS,...These traffic analysis tools are to be taken with caution. Since you don't have access to the server, such statistics can be considered as not accurate (or not very accurate).And to stay about forum and SEO. https://youtu.be/WSkETCRe7Ichttps://searchon.withgoogle.com Since it changed, we can say the SERP do the job now.",

Yeah, I know that Bitcointalk isn't mobile friendly, but I didn't expected such big difference between desktop and mobile. Esepcially considering that large part of forum traffic comes from developping countries where people mostly use mobile to access internet.Also, some number doesn't looks realistic or accurate. For example, it's simply impossible that 100% of  traffic from Colombia access Bitcointalk using desktop. Or such big difference between tow European countries Germany and Italy. 83% of traffic from Germany access Bitcointalk through desktop and just 28% in Italy. I don't think that such huge difference is possible.",

Semrush indicates that it estimates monthly traffic, but it doesn’t detail how. Ok, it mentions \"hundreds of partnerships with clickstream data providers\" and \"Neural Network algorithm to come up with a realistic estimation\", but I’d like to see a contrast of those estimates to the reality before taken the estimates to be any good. A few of the indicators quickly stand-out as very weird and seemingly not feasible:- The said drop in visits from September 2022 to October 2022 is not rational from the site’s noticed traffic point of view. The driver behind is the mobile traffic indicator, and there being no logical explanation from the forum’s traffic point of view, unless some very heavy mobile using countries have been blocked from accessing the forum (which I'm not aware of), it might be a change in the estimation algorithm or subjacent data.- The Spanish Local board has very small activity, and I can’t even think of any active member from Colombia currently posting on that board. It seems unfeasible to have more traffic from Colombia than from the US, all on Desktops, ... and yet having no interaction whatsoever on the Spanish Local board.",

Many times clients ask us they require a specific analytical tool and plugins for their projects. For example someone prefer SEMrush then other one prefers ahrefs. We also have clients who wants Moz or Ubersuggest. To fulfill the clients demand we have a few such tools that we use in regular basis. It's costs us a lot but it's reasonable for an agency considering the scope of work and ROI of the business.For a single project one tool is more than enough, even it's hard to use it's full potential sometimes like I see it in your case.Quote from: DdmrDdmr on March 09, 2023, 10:40:40 AM]I’m always pretty sceptical of statistics where we don’t really know exactly how the information was derived, and would rather prefer to have some official forums statistics to go by along those lines. The entire traffic analysis, SEO industry is based on approximate statistical data. It will never be accurate like 2+2 = 4.When you search a keyword, certain website will appear at position 1 but after a new search you will see the position dropped to 5th but then again you will discover it's in 2nd position. Google has over 200 ranking factors and it's not humanly possible to work with even 10% of all the factors.The results are always approximate.",

Regarding showing a result, It should show the same result on Paid and Free versions. If they want to restrict something for the free version, They can restrict viewing six months of data for the free version (which they did for other features). Or they can limit it to one week or 15 days as their wish. It's not like we are getting visitors from them. So, they will give me fewer visitors if I use the free version.

You may know that the USA is the most popular server for VPNs. Even Free VPNs offers USA server. So, it would be tricky finding from where most visitors come from.",
