Back then you could use proton or Tutanota to store some documents, but Tor is banned, they are randomly closing accounts, even with VPN, so I don't trust that.So basically, I gave up and didn't find a way to backup documents in a reasonable way, that doesn't force you to get doxed first which defeats the point.",

Well for cloud storage services that accepts Bitcoins I would say sync. Or you can try hosting services.",

I tried to search though and people seemed to have talked about this already last year. Here if you want to see https://stacker.news/items/429534but it seems like even the platforms mentioned do not have both non kyc and bitcoin as option. So, choose wisely I guess.Quote It's quite disappointing the lack of services in exchange of BTC. Most people just want to hoard their BTC, which leads to lack of servicesI actually do not think it is because of the lack of interest in spending bitcoin that leads to lack of services like this. I think big platforms just do not trust bitcoin enough to add to their options. Because I have seen platforms almost use bitcoin as a marketing strategy and to show that they are so progressive and that you can use all your bitcoins in this platform. And almost a lot of bitcoin users go try out that platform just for the sake of using their bitcoin in the platform.",

The blocks by Protonmail and Tutanota are due to \"spam\" and so they randomly lock your account if you log in from an unlucky node, that is if you are able to register a new email with Tor to begin with.I will look at the links given on this thread, but probably none of them allow Tor, require doxing or other things.

This is the problem with lifetime payments, today they are here, tomorrow they disappear and you already did your lifetime payment and no money back. Or another classic, they randomly drop Tor support due \"spam\" or something like that (see Protonmail dropping support for Tor registrations basically, and even if you manage to register an account, they make you enter an alternative recovery account, and only from email providers that only work if you are doxed during registration, so basically useless now for privacy).As far as this internxt provider, when I go into the checkout window, there is no way to pay with bitcoin, it asks for either credit card or paypal, so at least on the website is not showing up.",

I saw some testimonials of errors and uploads being cut when uploading on internxt, but others said the service is now working fine. Something I noticed is that it doesn't show the checksums of the files you upload. This is an important thing to have on mind. When you upload files on the internet, you want 100% certainty that the files were not tampered with, which means you want a record of the checksum sha-256 next to it, otherwise you wouldn't know at least until you download it again and check with a local copy.Other services i've seen is icedrive which accepts BTC, but the problem is it's closed source, so this is a pass.Filen.io is another one but I don't see if they accept BTC. This one looks great but they also don't have lifetime plans.If anyone finds some other ones please comment them there.",

I don't really want to be paying with bitcoin every month or even every year. I want a good company that will not disappear at any moment so the lifetime payment makes sense. I don't want to depend on paying every X time for a service because if you forget, or if you are not able to for whatever reason, by the time you want to access your data they will have removed it, so it's better to simply pay once and forget about it. So if anyone knows any lifetime payment services im interested. Siacoin is definitely a no. It just adds additional friction having to convert the BTC to some altcoin and then learn how that even works.

Some companies offer a \"lifetime\" option but it means as long as their company is still profitable, so there's still a chance that you'll lose your files if you never back them up. I don't think using a lifetime option as a criterion to judge how long a company will last is reliable either. If your issue is forgetting or can't extend your plan, maybe you can compromise by looking at those who offer a grace period or something similar? Not to mention most of them usually send you notice before your plan expire.",
