USDT Tether is the first ever large scale stablecoin (centralized) and they are still the biggest one in terms of volume. I don't think they have ever got audited. So the entire stablecoin ecosystem is thriving based on trust! For Terra, the trust is somehow gone and we are seeing the price dipping every single hour. Otherwise I don't see a logical reason for not maintaining the peg with reserve asset.",

Thank you very much. i am agree stable coins now failed to pegged to $1 no matter their algoritm or mechanisme to set it stable $1. i am believe there is no real  collateral from stable coins project, they just use an algorithm which is could not work while we see unexpected market movement . we see from several project build stable coin, most of them totaly failed.even usdt many time under $1. this is early warning to becarefull with this project to avoid same accident with luna or ust.",

If ETH turned to POS its likely that it will also be attacked when Blockrock the largest in the world could buy all the ETH in the market to become a validator.

Those centralized stablecoins are the ones I would even fear the most since they are centralized and anyone who owns the coins can be in control of it and decide what happens tomorrow. But, that wouldn’t be the same with the stablecoins that are decentralized, they would be a far more stable choice to go with it and you wouldn’t have the fear of anything such as coins being frozen and so on. Almost every big coin we know in the market today has been at this stage once where they faced one issue or the other, but they still overcame it and kept moving hard and better.",

Ust is always maintained at a stable price of 1 $ to do this, the Luna must always be burned and vice versa when Ust decreases in price, this mechanism will automatically print more Luna to make up for Ust price. UST is what causes Luna to drop thousands of times from its peak, Luna will continue to burn when the UST price stabilizes again.The Luna tokens we are trading are those that were transferred to the exchange last year and are held by holders, all tokens minted later are in the token mine.",

While this would make saving money on stablecoins no different than saving money at a bank, it would bring a level of confidence among investors and traders alike. Let's face it, there's no stablecoin that's guaranteed to hold the peg except centralized ones backed by real world reserves. But even a centralized stablecoin like Tether can be shady at times. People need to learn that crypto does come with its risks, instead of being all \"reds and roses\".May the current situation be a good lesson to all of those who invested their life savings on LUNA/UST. Who knows if this motivates other developers to improve algorithmic stablecoins for the better? Just my thoughts",

IMO, I believe in the saying that there's always a room for improvement, in that case, those so-called decentralized Stablecoins that you mentioned has been serve their purpose to send a strong message to other decentralized platforms to make sure that if they want to issue such a decentralized Stablecoin it should be pegged or back with stable asset just to make sure it was stable and can withstand any possible scenario or attacked! just like what happened to Terra Luna's UST Stablecoin. Anyway, some decentralized Stablecoin has remained strong and consistent for years already and DAI is one good example.",
