Could someone please explain this to me?Specifically what parts you are not sure about?Asking one to explain it while yourself does not address it in any way or any sense what is not understandable to you is like shooting in the dark. The merge explanation is thoroughly addressed by the Ethereum team itself, and there are many conversations about it that readdress it in a simple manner. Asking to explain it again would only give a burden to the explainer since one can not tell it in a specific manner of what you are trying to understand and which part you are trying to comprehend.",

It's not that deep, as there are a lot of recent threads about the Merge.Misconception 1 is that most people make the most mistakes, because most of them don't learn or read anything about the merge. They always think that the eth upgrade is short-lived and one-time only without knowing that the merge is just the first stepping stone for other upgrades to be updated in the future. The reduction in gas fees and the increase in scalability is only seen when the sharding upgrade is updated and the misconception of many people that upgrading will help increase the price of eth but things did not go as many people expected.",

But some of the changes will be visible for a long time, not instantly. It does look like nothing has changed since it's just called merge.Why no change?, moving from POW to POS is a big change for ethereum. This event has been preparing for the past 4 years and this is the biggest move in the development of ethereum. The 2 things that you can most easily notice are the ethereum supply being reduced due to the burning of transaction fees and up to 99.95% reduction in energy consumption.",

But too unfortunate that instead, this will helps to increase demand and price, it happens that this becomes the reason why people got panic and dump their ETH. It doesn't look good actually and that was because many people don't really understand this, it is somehow they just listen to rumors and fake news.",

But be careful with myths surrounding the Merge like gas fee reduction, etc. This is true, The merge will not affect directly the gas fee because Ethereum just change consensus but it will make Ethereum more faster to implement an upgrade since stakers will dictate the approval for the next upgrade on Ethereum unlike PoW which requires certain blocks to implement upgrade which makes Ethereum slower to do the implementation.The merge also introduced exciting new actors to the consensus mechanism like block builders and MEV relayers which will make Ethereum more decentralized. Maybe in the future it might help reduced the gas fee through the upgrades.Source: https://www.blocknative.com/blog/will-the-merge-lower-gas-fees",

Lowering gas costs will require efforts to further expand network capacity and throughput. The developer is also working on a rollup-centric roadmap to make transactions cheaper. and it is certain that the Merger will not reduce gas costs.",
