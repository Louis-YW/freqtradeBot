  "content": "Earlier today, both the camps of former champion Nonito Donaire and Jason Moloney were informed by the WBC to start negotiations for the vacant WBC bantamweight belt. They will have until February 17 to reach a deal, otherwise, it will go to a purse bid. Moloney's camp already showed willingness and wanted to bring this fight to Australia. Meanwhile, Donaire's earlier target is to drop in weight and face El Gallo Estrada for his ambition to become a 5 division world champion. We will see if old Donaire entertains this fight as he was already a 2-time champion in this division and he's got a few more fights left in his career. All the belts became vacant after undisputed champion Naoya Inoue decided to move up in weight to continue his conquest of glory. Meanwhile, the WBA, IBF, and WBO are yet to make their own official announcements. Jason Moloney still has a lot of options and he can wait for more announcements from the other sanctioning bodies. I believe he may be able to outpunch past-prime Donaire but I don't think he can take the Flash's powerful hooks. It took another great to be able to survive Donaire's powerful hooks in this division although Inoue was also hurt for the first time in his career. Moloney can opt for his other options. He is also ranked #1 by the WBO which will be easier to outbid the #2 Vincent Astrolabio from the Philippines if he really wants to fight a title in his home of Australia. Moloney is also ranked #3 by the IBF which is also doable if ever #1 Vincent Astrolabio prefers to fight for the vacate WBO belt. Moloney can face #2 Emmanuel Rodriguez of Puerto Rico whom he lost already in a very very close fight which could've gone either way.",

That being said AFAIK just like what OP said he is vying to fight El Gallo to claim 5 divisions for himself. Although he may entertain this fight because worse comes to worse, he's going to be better prepared against fighters that are younger than him considering moloney's age, best case scenario he has a title to bag for himself. February is not too far now and I think they'd rush the two because money needs to be made. So we may see the two of them fight probably February or any other month that will give them both the time and prep.",

He just had a fight last December against Akaho, that's why he is not interested at 118 already.Hopefully this fight can be 'force' by this body and let the fight happen.They are the #1 and #2 in the rankings, so there should be no barrier making this fight, unless Arum doesn't want to work it out with Inoue's camp because he has his own reasons.",

We have seen Manny proved that against Keith Thurman.Donaire's lost with some of the best boxer, and like when he tries to move up in the division facing bigger opponents. And the last time is against the Monster Inoue twice, so he has been facing the best opponents even as he age.So I will give Donaire a chance in this fight and this could end in a knockout, if he can time Moloney and hit him with his vaunted left hook.",

But you could really see the speed and that technicality isnt really the same on his prime days and its impossible for us not to see up that one plus having that footwork isnt really that good when he's still young.Now that he would be fighting against Moloney which is younger plus having that good KO percentage then we could say that power is more than with Donaire but lets see about the speed if there's much difference in between two.If i were to choose up then i would be having some doubts on going all in with Donaire and its not bad to make up some consideration on throwingup some bucks on Moloney.",

Donaire should accept this deal and make this fight more possible, this is a good opportunity for him to reclaim the belt and be a champion again.",

Since Donaire is still at the top of the WBC Bantamweight ranking, he got his chance again for a mandatory title fight and now it was materialized, and he will face the Rank 1 Jason Moloney for the vacant title.As I said in the other thread, we don't see if Donaire is at his limit yet since the last time he loses is against a real monster. Again, I want to see him facing a boxer aside from Inoue in the 118 lbs to see if he can still match with the boxers at that weight.",

That's Oubaali's first knockout loss and he got it on a past-prime boxer like Donaire.His fight against Inoue is expected already knowing how strong and how good he is. Both of these fighters suffered a lost against \"The Monster\" and now that the Inoue choose to step up and vacate the title, Donaire again has a chance to get a title and fight a few more fights before he retires.I guess Donaire still can defeat Moloney only by knockout, but if this will go to scorecards, I guess Moloney has a shot to win against Donaire.

Watching Moloney fight with Inoue, he's lack of technical and much slower, Donaire still have a speed and it would possible to knock out Moloney. 3-6 rounds are average rounds where Donaire will finish his opponent, let's see if Moloney could survive for the first six rounds or not.",

Both boxers lost against Naoya Inoue, both were KO'ed by the young superstar too. (Donaire vs Inoue 2) Although I also want to point out how difficult it was for Inoue at their first fight. Lasted 12 rounds, Inoue was also hurt in the process. I believe The Flash still has it, the punching power is there although his movements might become limited to preserve his stamina. Moloney on the other hand could use that to his advantage. This might become a fight with an unpredictable winner unlike other events that happened recently, I hope the odds will be balanced for good profits.",

They are both good boxer, and it will be hard for Donaire to win via KO here so he must be more active through out the round if ever.The decision will be based on their performance, they are both aiming for the belt and this is their golden opportunity to have it again so I believe this will happen. Most probably they just need to talk more about the contract, and if both parties agree we can see an epic match between this boxer. I'll still with my bet with Donaire, he's more eager to win here.",
