I read a comment in the forum a member talking about his friend that only gamble when he does not have money after getting the money he never gambles again until he's lacking money. Such persons will make good use of this amount.OP what makes you believe you won't lose the remaining amount after you have already lost half an amount back to where the money came from.  If you were lucky to have won $1,000,000. it doesn't mean you will be luck to make more of it on the next bet. The way you're about to go is not how a good and experienced gambler will place bets, you will  lose the money even before placing the bet.",

If you aren't satisfied yet, you can continue trying. Who knows, you might be able to turn that $1 million into $10 million? Anyway, good luck and congratulations.",

Gambling is a completely luck based platform where you can go broke at any moment. So never prove anything to yourself in this fortune based platform. Thanks OP you have met your target, you can stop your bets from here as you have met your target and reached the target. If you greed more then you can lose your entire money at any time. $1000000 is very surprising to hear. You put your dollars into any business activity. This will reduce your financial risk and you will be able to spend your next life very well.",

If the answer is yes, I think you should stop gambling and consider taking that $1 million elsewhere, perhaps investing it to grow it in a less risky way, or enjoying some of your winnings as a reward for yourself.Sometimes, my friend, luck can make you greedy too. So, I suggest you calm down a bit and reevaluate your goals to make the right decision. Don't let your emotions drive you towards something you might regret in the future.",

At this stage you should be able to control your greed and also learn how to manage your finance, if you just throw money into your account because it’s present and you feel you can do whatever you like with it will surely have an effect on you in the long run.",
