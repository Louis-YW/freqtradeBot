  "content": "I think my biggest fear is of spiders. I am very terrified of spiders because of their eight legs and eyes. Spiders also have fangs that allow them to spit out silk to create webs to trap different types of flying insects to kill them and eat them. Now spiders are also able to lay their eggs on the webs they create around cold, dark, and dusty spaces. For example, behind furniture, underneath your bed or set of stairs, closets, and sometimes inside cabinets. That is why it is very important that your constantly clean your house to ensure spiders donâ€™t invade or home. I do not kill spiders when they are inside my house despite how scared I am of them. What I recommend is to set some traps around your house, this way you can catch them safely and take them to a pet store or try to release them to the wild.So what about your biggest fears?",

I was attacked by Pitbull when I was only 6 years old. I was walking back home from school, and I saw that one of our neighborâ€™s dogs manage to get out of their front yard. I was so nervous and scared that I started running towards my house which still was like four houses down the street. By the time I was able to get to the third house, I was knocked down by the Pitbull who bit me on my ankle. I started kicking the Pitbull with my other foot to try to let me go. I screamed for help and felt like it was an eternity before my other neighbor came out from the house with a metal pipe and hit the Pitbull in the head to let me go. When my neighbor saw that the dog was not letting me go, he kicked the Pitbull with his steel-toe boot right underneath his mouth and it took off running. I have a scar on my ankle where the Pitbull bit me, ever since I have been traumatized and nervous to go near any big dogs.",

Now I always check my bed sheets and pillow casing. I think this is gross to find bed bugs but it does not scare me like a spider or a dog.Those will attack you and cause you harm. Bed bugs is just really gross still can bite but just no that scary being so small.",

I wouldn't mind avoiding any public role for fear of so much eyeballs starring. I also feared cows at a time, but I out grew all these when public hairs and bills multiplied. My current fear is being broke.it Scares the hell outta me when I start getting debits or calls from utility services I patronize or from the credit card companies I use. Don't wanna have those fears now, because it ain't even worth the time.",
