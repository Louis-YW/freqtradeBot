What is the best way to consolidate these 12 UTXOs into a single UTXO, to take advantage of reduced transaction fees and what else should I know before proceeding?Saving fees starts when you withdraw from exchanges: what percentage have you paid in withdrawal fees in the past year? If you DCA for instance $1000 per month, I get that you want to withdraw it. But if you buy, say, $50 per month, and pay, say, $5 to withdraw, there's room for improvement.Since you're using DCA, I assume you plan to hodl long-term. In the past year, low fees were quite common until March (ignore the few drops where Jochen's mempool was wiped). In the past month, anything with around 3.1 sat/vbyte would have been confirmed. So if you're not in a rush, go low. Or, and that's what I'm doing: wait. I have a few dozen inputs to consolidate, but I'm in no rush to do so. I'll do it when mempool clears far enough, so I can use 1.1 sat/byte again.",

If you want advice regarding privacy as well, it would help to know whether these UTXOs have been received on the same address or if you used a fresh address every time.In case that you did, you gained some privacy by doing so, but would lose it when consolidating. One idea, if you are planning to consolidate a bunch of smaller inputs, is to submarine swap them into a Lightning channel of yours, e.g. using Boltz.",

Also if paying to many addresses, the native segwit transaction fee becomes more lower than if compared to pay-to-taproot. Only when pay-to-taproot has lower fee is when the transaction has higher input counts just like when you want to consolidate. I mean while comparing single sig wallet.",

It is true that there are usually thousands of pending tx's in the mempool, sometimes over 400k like it is right now, but these days with a fee rate of 6-7 sats/vbyte, a tx can get higher priority and be confirmed asap, unlike when the BRC20 mess began; so probably in a few months time, 1-2-3 sats/vbyte could be possible.",

Go and take a look at literally any of the heavily shilled ICOs which were launched during that ICO craze, and the few which still exist are down >99% from their peak during that time.The ordinal craze is already going the same way. The hype is over. The prices are falling. 3 months ago a fast fee was around 30 sats/vybte. 6 weeks ago it was around 17 sats/vbyte. Today it's around 7 sats/vbytes.We just have to hope that the next ICO/DeFi/NFT/Ordinal pump and dump scam isn't built directly on top of bitcoin.",
