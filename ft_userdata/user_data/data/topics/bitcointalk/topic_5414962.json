You can check your bounty balance here.♦️ Since SRT is a taxable currency, 3% of the total transaction gets taxed by the holders whenever a user makes a transaction. Therefore, the receivers get fewer tokens instead of the total amount transacted.♦️ Follow up-to-date information about the Saratoga project by joining their Telegram Group.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖✔️ ALL DISTRIBUTED BOUNTIES📃 Page 1📃 Page 2📃 Page 3📃 Page 4📃 Page 5♦️ You can participate in the ongoing bounties on our Telegram channel.Kind Regards,  Bounty Detective Team ★ WEBSITE ★ TELEGRAM GROUP ★  BOUNTY GROUP ★ TWITTER ★ REDDIT ★  MEDIUM ★1.

The reward distribution of Saratoga Bounty is guaranteed by Bounty Detective.The distribution will begin on December 10th, 2022.Note: 🔖 The total reward pool's USD value is estimated, and it is calculated based on the project's token sale prices.______________________Disclaimer: By agreeing to participate in this bounty, you acknowledge that the wallet address and the email address you submitted are final and can't be changed.Bounty Detective may perform additional reviews, including but not limited to requesting other documentation for analysis of your joined campaigns if needed.Bounty Detective is under no obligation to send your bounty reward and may, at its discretion, cancel your participation from each ongoing bounty if the participant does not follow the rules mentioned on this bounty thread.Bounty Detective has no contribution to the token distribution; unless it announces the exact opposite on group and channel. We are only responsible for the reward distribution of any campaign when we publish it, unless explicitly stated \"Bounty Detective has escrowed and guarantees the reward distribution of this bounty.\" The USD value of the bounty reward pool is estimated, and it might change regarding different factors. We usually announce the rewards by calculating their final token sale price if it is not listed on any exchange yet.Our team has carefully researched the project following several criteria as we did for all of the campaigns we have managed or published. However, we can't assure the project's success as our duty is to provide a bounty management service for them as freelancers. We are responsible only for managing the campaign. We are not responsible for the project's success and continuity.A crypto project has too many factors in reaching their targets. We are not in the team of any project and not their employees, and we can't guarantee the future progress of any project only because we manage their bounty as freelancers. We encourage everyone to do their research and due diligence before investing their time or money. Participating in this bounty campaign or investing in it will be at your own risk.Kind regards.______________________1.
