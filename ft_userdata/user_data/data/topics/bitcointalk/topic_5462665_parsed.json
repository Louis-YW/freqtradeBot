  "content": "Told ya so moment  China opening was a flop, if we're heading to deflation, what about Bitcoin?Everyone who follows the news knows what happened today,  China has entered deflation!Further reading, if anyone cares https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/09/business/china-economy-inflation.htmlhttps://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-consumer-prices-swing-into-decline-deflation-risks-build-2023-08-09/Now, you can't even cram in a whole topic the implication of deflation, why it's not good either, the speculation on how this will affect everything, and most crucially since we're on Bitcointalk, what's in for Bitcoin so less in just a post.So making this as short as possible- China is the first G20 to slip into deflation since Japan- Despite pumping trillions into the economy since February the consumption is not picking pace but going downhttps://www.scmp.com/business/article/3210562/china-pumps-us121-billion-economy-biggest-one-day-cash-injection-spur-post-covid-growtheach monthhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/china-cuts-rates-to-prop-up-flagging-recovery-6fe3ec72- Exports and imports are going down as manufacturing is also contracting- there is no demand for goods, the law of economics take over, price go down, people see prices going down they stop buying since they think it will be cheaper accelerating the spiralThe important thing, since inflation makes your wallet bleed some think that deflation is good, It might be temporary for your own household but long term it causes damages beyond those caused by inflation. Assume you're a business owner and you sell stuff, if people stop buying, is it good for you? Assume you're a factory manager, with no orders coming, is that good for you and the people employed? With no demand for your services, is it really good when the price of bread falls but you're not making any money cause you have no customers?Normally I won't have to link to Wikipedia articles but for those who didn't read it, here are two key examples of what deflation can do:- the Great Depression in the US in the 30's- Japan lost decades in the 90'sNow fast forward, if the contagion grows and it spreads to countries that are currently at 3-5% inflation and going down, like in the US and Europe, what will be in this for Bitcoin?Bitcoin was supposed to be a p2p electronic cash system that would allow you to transfer and keep your money without the need for a third party with the finite supply ensuring it wouldn't be affected by issues plaguing the fiat money printing system.With the price gradually taking over and more and more being interested in the returns you can get for just holding coins, and a shield against rampaging inflation, would this change in a prolonged period of deflation? With prices everywhere falling down would the majority still be interested in buying and holding an asset that temporarily would be stripped of one of its current selling points?I know this is a bit more of speculation but since it heavily relies on events in the world economy I think it's a discussion that goes hand in hand with economics not just speculation.",

I know that sometimes the unexpected happens, but with the economic systems of some countries being so down, I really don't see deflation taking place any time soon. But if it spreads so fast that it hits the US and Europe, then, as it is, many people are going to sell their Bitcoin because the price will definitely drop. Investors are going to be selling off, and if the pressure is too much, the price will drop. But again, @stompix, I am still wondering: if this happens, how long will it last? Perhaps not for ever, so Bitcoin will not die out; it will only suffer its recovery until the period is over, no matter how long it's going to last.   Again, the inflation rate in my country as of 2018 was 10%, but according to the CPI (Consumer price Index), the inflation rate now is 22.79%, which is an 12.79% increase from 2018, and I know it's even going to keep increasing over time. So, I will just sit and wait to see what happens. Bitcoin will soar through, even if the deflation spreads across other countries like the US, Europe, and other countries with large economies.",

There are others, like the  ability to use it globally, decentralization, self custody, censorship resistant, privacy-preserving, permissionless, etcThe other selling points will become more relevant when the need arises, for example when people need to send/recieve money globally as global fiat currencies like usd becomes difficult or impossible to use. The overall selling point is that Bitcoin is freedom currency/system and will always be very attractive to freedom loving people. And the selling points which are its ideals are strong fundamentals that will always give it  stronger value and higher demand over fiat currencies especially when people understand their benefits... Just as organic food are more valuable/expensive than junk when people know their values. So, the whole truth about Bitcoin needs to spread globally and you wouldn't need to worry about price deflation in certain countries.",

      "body": "Thanks for this piece. As I tell people, deflation is worse than inflation, only that people don't often witness this and believe they will spend less and still have a good standard of living only. As these are true, it's also bad for the economy as it would not grow as you've rightly explained. It means the inflation gauge is negative and continuously decreasing or stable below 0 with an inverse order in demand and supply where more supply lingers. It could lead to unemployment since less labour is required, and it encourages too much savings since you pay less for goods and services and might keep more in anticipation of more devalued products and services. This will naturally cause an increase in interest rates which the government will begin to fight through rate cuts and other measures to reverse the trend.Strangely, this often happens as a result of too good policies and economic prosperity without a proper check by the government, good things at times backfire.Quote from: stompix on August 09, 2023, 03:51:26 PM- Despite pumping trillions into the economy since February the consumption is not picking pace but going downPumping money has to be clarified under an economy as to what area the money goes to and in what form. I don't see how the pumping of money into the economy in general context would help when a country is witnessing an iota of deflation, it would rather worsen/aggravate it except you actually meant pumping in terms of \"printing of money.\"QuoteAssume you're a business owner and you sell stuff, if people stop buying, is it good for you? Assume you're a factory manager, with no orders coming, is that good for you and the people employed? With no demand for your services, is it really good when the price of bread falls but you're not making any money cause you have no customers?First, to buttress your point on the shop owners' narration, what if they've stocked for what would last for months at a higher price and deflation forced them to sell out at a lower price? Also, I understand your plight here, but you seem to overestimate deflation, it doesn't translate to no patronage as you make it look, but less patronage than normal.QuoteNow fast forward, if the contagion grows and it spreads to countries that are currently at 3-5% inflation and going down, like in the US and Europe, what will be in this for Bitcoin?Bitcoin was supposed to be a p2p electronic cash system that would allow you to transfer and keep your money without the need for a third party with the finite supply ensuring it wouldn't be affected by issues plaguing the fiat money printing system.With the price gradually taking over and more and more being interested in the returns you can get for just holding coins, and a shield against rampaging inflation, would this change in a prolonged period of deflation? With prices everywhere falling down would the majority still be interested in buying and holding an asset that temporarily would be stripped of one of its current selling points?This can't be a contagion in my view as China doesn't have economic similarities with the countries they share borders with. And those which have administrative authorities like Hong Kong and Macao don't have the same economic similarity. Even if they do, the effect can't reach further countries.As for Bitcoin, I've personally said that it depends on how people view it. As someone that is more economically and analytically inclined, I view it differently. Contrary to the general belief that Bitcoin is a good hedge against inflation, I don't believe such, the studies and conclusions on Bitcoin are still premature, it needs more time for the world to be certain of what it really is as it at times behaves like risk-on and risk-off asset alike but more risk-on in nature. Why did it fall when inflation has increased in recent years? Bitcoin is an asset, we should view it as one, and we should invest in it in the view of good returns only like other investments. Who knows if that would help our finances? This is what people mistake for an inflation peg. Can't we invest and earn through another asset? Do they then automatically peg inflation? So, whether it's inflation or deflation season, when the bull run of Bitcoin is active, you make money. And when the bearish season of Bitcoin comes, you will lose money, period!",

I thought if the deflation takes place and spreads across the other countries, then the value of the country's fiat currency will increase and they can buy more goods and services with the money, and since investors know that their fiat currency will increase in value, I thought 🤔 💭 they're (investors) going to have to sell their Bitcoin holdings and perhaps stack some fiat instead. So that If the fiat value shoots up, then they can buy more Bitcoin with it. I don't get it; I just need the clarification.",

The Chinese communist party did a great job when they were opening up and using the (relatively) free market model which brought many millions of people out of poverty and gave them jobs. However it seems like they have switched into reverse gear now under Xi Jinpig, instead of focusing on economic growth the dictator is deciding that he wants to squeeze ultimate control again and is probably lining up to invade Taiwan at some point in the future, but as your graphs show - this is leading into disastrous territory. The way their government is lurching from targeting one sector to the next and the fact that the rules can change overnight, shows that they are a completely unstable business environment which scares off long term investment.",

Could you elaborate on that? Also not clear to me why Bitcoin investors should all of a sudden sell their holdings at a loss?",
