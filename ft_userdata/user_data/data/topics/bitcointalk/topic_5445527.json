You'd also share some information in your Blog section. If you are not ready to launch it, remove it temporarily from the website.Cheers",

Although the site is new and not to much information has been provided, but could you at least make the $10 card available because you won't expect most people to test a a new service with 100 dollars. We can risk losing the 10 dollars but for the 100 dollars its a no go situation.",

The problem is that there are no such gimmicks or bonuses.So I don't think this prepaid will click as they say.
