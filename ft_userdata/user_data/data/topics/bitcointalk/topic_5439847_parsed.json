      "body": "Inflation bit last year, it's my hope that it doesn't repeat this year. Nonetheless, I had warned those that claimed that inflation is gone severally, it was a clear correction then and it has indicated its stance on bullish reversal. Who knows for how long this would last? The US CPI released yesterday as shown below is an indication, and it did not leave any of them out (Core, Normal and Yearly).This has started affecting the FX market, gold included, but the crypto market is still stabilising. This might be another time for Bitcoin to prove itself as a dependable asset during inflation. But I doubt this if I must be sincere.",

Bitcoin and Ethereum surged as the market calmed down after the US inflation data. And it will have a significant impact on Bitcoin in achieving great gains. Investors are generally looking for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as a way to hedge against hyperinflation, which will result in increased demand for Bitcoin, which will increase the possibility of an increase in its price, but we must bear in mind that the crypto market is very volatile and that is why it will be very difficult to predict the exact direction. It is worth noting that it was not expected that the inflation rate in the states would drop to 6.4%, down from 6.5%, which is considered a decrease from last year, and this decrease in the core inflation rate may be due to other economic indicators improved, and then came firm statements about interest rates from US Federal Reserve officials to address inflation, as it is not the best news for the markets, but it will be in the interest of the dollar, so yes, I agree with you, Bitcoin will recover over time, and the market will continue to rise.",

CPI and interest rate are affected a lot in the past year 2022 and now in 2023, it is a considering time for FED to slow down their speed of increasing interest rate. CPI is an indicator that reflects economic and social status and if interest rate becomes better in future, we will see better CPI.I believe that we will get better interest rate and CPI in 2023 that is positive support for financial markets as well as cryptocurrency market including Bitcoin.FED did not increase interest rate instantly and sharply and I believe they will have similar style when reduce interest rate.",

In theory it is a good hedge against inflation, if not the best, but apparently in the period of the highest inflation since its creation it has not been a good hedge against inflation because the price has fallen. I say apparently because if we look deeper we see that everything has gone down, which is normal due to the reduction policy of the central banks that have withdrawn money from circulation, and in general all markets have gone down. What people often do not realise is that inflation as a CPI does not count the price of financial assets, and that in times of monetary expansion, inflation ends up in them. We only have to look at the returns since its inception to realise that expansionary policies have worked very well for it and I think it will continue to do so. Investors are betting that inflation will moderate, as it seems to be doing, and then Central Banks will slow down or even change rate policy, making markets rise again.",

It is theatrically correct that due to its finite supply & decentralized nature, it should work as a good hedge against inflation. However, as you noted, short term fluctuation in Bitcoin price is not always correlated with inflation rate. It is also true that inflation measured by CPI doesn't necessarily reflect its impact on financial assets including Bitcoin. Inflation can lead to increase in price of assets as investors look for alternative stores of value to protect their purchasing power.",

But for those who do long-term investing, then they can just neglect these because the flow of the price can still change later on. Bitcoin is definitely the best hedge against inflation because of it's deflationary characteristics. It's supply is very small and limited and then it halves every four years making the coin more scarce from time to time.It's normal for Bitcoins value to go down because it was still a highly volatile coin but we shouldn't worry because its price can always recover no matter how low it dips. Other factors or mostly the happenings outside can also affect how it's value moves.",

Because in Bitcoin, the definition of the medium term by two to 5 years is considered a long period of time compared to other investments, and the decentralization of Bitcoin will accelerate such tools. It is just a guess because there are many variables that will affect the price in a period of 5 years.What I am trying to convey here is that these indicators cannot be relied upon in the short term and are not sufficient to bring about changes in the long term. Therefore, on their own, they are indicators of no value.",

Most of the economy are rising as well though we cannot deny that bigger countries are experiencing a lot of problems economically and with their inflation. Bitcoin might be affected by this but I also believe that its only a temporary trend and the government will always find its way to recover.

In crypto things work a little bit more differently and that's why it's not going to be the same thing. First of all, whole thing is connected to each other, secondly we are talking about just bitcoin going up and down could make the whole market go up or down.This also means if there is one bad news about bitcoin, the whole market will crash and that's not something you can avoid here. When you compare that to stocks where if one stock has bad news, then rest are fine? I would say it's not going to be the same thing to trade the same way.",

In terms of inflation not much changed over the last 6 months, the central banks kept increasing the interest rates but prices are keep rising. Overall I think that a higher inflation is also going to lead to a higher bitcoin price. In the short term however investors are spooked and will be selling all types of risky assets including crypto currencies. Higher interest rates by the central banks will make all fixed income products more attractive, so that is what most investors are going to switch into. The problem is that even the high yield bonds are not going to yield returns as high as the inflation rate. So for investors to not lose value long term they have to come back to the crypto market.",
