      "body": "Saw my name already on the spreadsheet and also received 5 CRP as mentioned by the OP, I found the ecosystem very cool but would like to keep some points in front of you (and the Utopia team)My reviews:1. The chatbox on the crypton exchange should have different sub-sections for different languages to make it easier for ppl to chat. Im seeing chinese, english, russian language chats all on the same section. You can rebuidl this inspiring from the bitmex trollbox.2. Why not use a good visual for watching orderbook depth too instead of just having those buy and sell order numbers ? Im missing it. Possible on a P2P platform?For example:  And instead of having totally white background for buy/sell orders you may use green/red colors to make it feel much real.Example: Believe me the above type of visuals excites many traders (including me) and are important,  most would agree!3. Utopia's privacy enabled UUSD stablecoin is a great addition to the ecosystem. But may I ask what are the incentives? As You know ppl are already too afraid of new stablecoins after the last luna debacle. Is it well audited by any trusted third party? Since I can't find much details about it on the website, I'd love to know more from you.4. Utopia's messenger app (im using android) needs a dark mode theme asap, even if its in beta mode the priority should be given to this first! Its a must for ppl like me atleast, I don't like to use any app without dark mode on, it became a habit lol..5. I dont know why ETH is not listed? Addition of ETH/USDT pair would be great on the exchange, it leads the market many times and even beats BTC in terms of trading volume sometimes.6. You may atleast add an official public twitter link (if not telegram) on the utopia main site for ppl to stay updated about the progresses made.There maybe a few more points which I may have missed, will leave it to other reviewers. Btw, I'd say the ecosystem itself is a great effort made by the team, I didnt find any major flaws, the order executions are quick, just need everything to be audited well and results publicly available by a trusted party (since it's closed-source) so ppl can use it hassle-free.",

      "body": "Since I have already received 5 CRP in the utopia ecosystem I can give my review here with my honest opinion.1. When I opened the Utopia P2P ecosystem, its interface was nice in my eyes, and what immediately came to my mind was that it was like I was facing my email as normal and at the same time there was a chatbox like Messenger style.2. Second, I also just noticed, the only ones you can talk to in their chatbox in the utopia ecosystem are those who have also downloaded Utopia on their desktop and android according to my understanding if I'm not mistaken.3. some merchants accept CRP as one of their online payments, although I can't check them all because there are too many like 124 pages.4. CRP also has a crypto card, so my only question is what steps will users take to have it?5. I also saw in the Ecosystem of Utopia that it has Mining, the only thing I can't understand is why it is still there in the features of its ecosystem if it does not affect the CPU, it should not be included in the features in my opinion. Or maybe I need to follow its procedure in its mining bots to activate.6. When it comes to Crypton Exchange, I just noticed that the volume it gets every day is quite low compared to other exchange platforms, it seems that it needs a good strategy to get more attention from the crypto community, so that's one of the reasons is because you don't have a fair for Ethereum(ETH) and Binance(BNB), because these two only have a lot of holders, to be honest, try to add it to your ecosystem and your exchange as well.But everything so far is okay with me in this ecosystem of utopia. Anyway, its volume is good in other exchanges except for the Crypton exchange which needs to be boosted to be noticed by other crypto enthusiasts.",

      "body": "Here's my review about Utopia ecosystem and it's desktop software.InstallationI use freshly insalled Debian 11 on VM with 4 core CPU & 4 GB RAM for this review, so i choose .deb file. I have no problem installing Utopia using dpkg and i don't need to install other dependency. While i do not experience any problem, AppImage would be great addition since there are some linux distro which isn't based on Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL or RPM.First impressionAfter creating new wallet, i was greeted with Welcome tour. It's quite helpful to write this review, although it'd be great if mining/stacking feature is also briefly explained on it's own page. Initial/first sync took some time (about 15-25 minutes) since my internet connection isn't very fast. Adding estimated remaining sync time or how much data need to be downloaded would be great addition.The UI reminds me of email client and application from early 2000. Personalty i like the UI, although people who mainly use mobile device or web-based application will find the UI is unattractive. Initially i have problem finding feature such as \"Idyll browser\", where i had to check all option on top menu bar one by one. And when i quit and re-open Utopia software again, it failed to detect location of the db/wallet file and i had to find it manually using command find ~ -name \"*\\.db. However, i unable to reproduce the problem since Utopia software automatically select db/wallet file when i try to quit and re-open it again.Idyll browserAfter opening Idyll browser, i see homepage which show an image and address bar which say \"Please enter address in P2P Utopia Network\". But since Idyll can't access regular website (such as https://bitcointalk.org) and the browser doesn't show any list of Utopia-based website/link (such as Utopia offcial website), i cannot proceed further. I would suggest to give short explanation/tutorial and list of utopia-based website on the homepage so user won't be confused or feel disappointing.MiningAfter reading FAQ about mining[2] and description about mining bots (located under \"Tools -> Mining Bots...\"), i found out mining process require Public IP. But since i'm behind NAT, i couldn't try mining feature. But reading mining description (located under \"uWallet -> Cryptons -> Mining...\") and reading FAQ at one of Utopia block explorer[3], i have confusion whether Utopia actually use PoW, PoS or dPoS. I also found out there's option to delegate your crypton coin to someone. But i couldn't try delegate feature since i couldn't find public key of delegator/node which perform mining on both Utopia website[1] and block explorer[3].uWalletuWallet UI is intuitive, so i have no problem understanding what each uWallet feature does. Although to test uWallet more throughfully, i decide to make payment on merchant listed on Utopia website[4]. After looking at list of merchant, i decide to choose WorldVPN[5] since they offer VPN which cost $1.99 (less than 5 CRP). But when i make payment, i'm surprised instruction by Utopia is outdated[5] where there's no \"crypto currenies\" option (see below screenshot). There's nothing i could do, so i cancel the transaction.Afterwards i decide to try other feature on uWallet. While i'm not sure where or when to use crypto cards, i find uVoucher is handy and could be really useful in various scenario. Here are few voucher i created (each voucher has different amount). Feel free to redeem 1 (one) of these to try uVoucher feature.Code:UTP-U2BA-YREQ-Z4DP-7STG-MNHMUTP-42EY-VWDT-CFRX-HKNS-QUM7UTP-R7DB-5C6F-4P3Z-UILG-NWJRUTP-CU2X-WIQO-TAMH-7B3S-E5GYUTP-MNOB-IZ5L-T3CF-DE6W-Q4UBuChannelI don't have much to say about uChannel. While there are >2800 channel, there are less than <50 channel which have 10 or more guest. It's rather unusual there are many channel which isn't moderated, which is different from Telegram and Discord ecosystem. I also tried \"Advance search\" feature, but while it's useful i 2 critique.1. There's no autosuggestion when i choose filter \"uTag\". It bring some inconvenience since i don't know which tag is available and i could make typo.2. The filter \"Language\" actually show list of country rather than list of languages (see screenshot below)Additional note1. When i check the FAQ, i found out Utopia software is closed source[6]. It's a red flag for most people who care about privacy or decentralization.2. When i use the desktop application, it might freeze for few second on few occasion (such as joining channel or opening Mining tab/window).SummaryWhile Utopia have many features, lack of documentation and tutorial could discourage some people to choose Utopia as their cryptocurrency choice. I didn't review all features available on Utopia desktop software, but i will leave that for other reviewer. And i strongly encourage to make Utopia software open source to build trust among cryptocurrency community.[1] https://u.is/en/[2] https://u.is/en/faq.html#faq38[3] https://explorer.utopiaecosystem.com/faq[4] https://u.is/en/merchants.html[5] https://u.is/en/redirect_merchant.html?website=worldvpn.net&ret=1,All,worldvpn[6] https://u.is/en/faq.html#faq4",
