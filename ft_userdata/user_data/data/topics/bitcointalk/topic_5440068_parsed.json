      "body": "Previously, no one paid much attention to alternative energy sources. Moreover, oil and gas corporations did everything possible to prevent such alternative ways of generating energy from appearing. For this, inventions were bought and subsequently destroyed, or simply inventors were killed more often under the guise of accidents. But now the situation has changed largely due to the fact that the world's oil and gas reserves are being depleted at a very rapid pace and the transition to other types of energy, such as solar, wind, geothermal and others, has simply become overripe in its decision. Moreover, now, for example, the production of solar panels is constantly getting cheaper due to the emergence of better technologies and their efficiency is steadily growing. So in any case, the world will switch to green energy, regardless of the aspirations of individual states. This is also required by the rapid climate change on our planet.",

It has been one of the strategies developed by experts to protect the world, but the challenge right now is that the project has been very expensive to implement. It started with trying to get rid of fossil fuel vehicles and developing electric cars, but not everyone can afford them. Now the issue with solar generating electricity, which not all countries can afford, the vision is good but lacks resources, especially for my region, countries like Russia, China, the USA, and many more to some extent have the resources.",

Perhaps its better to begin the transition now, rather than wait until its too late.Of course, the future belongs to alternative energy sources and the most significant place among them is solar panels, the production of which is getting cheaper thanks to new technologies. So, scientists from the University of Rochester were able to develop a new method to increase the efficiency of the solar cell material. Silicon is usually used as the basis for solar panel development, because it is found in abundance in nature and has an excellent ability to convert sunlight into energy. However, the researchers decided to use in the development of panels a forgotten, but not lost relevance mineral - perovskite - a source of titanium, niobium and a number of other elements. It is quite famous for its crystal structure. If we use perovskite instead of silicon in solar panels, then the energy efficiency immediately triples. Probably, and this is far from the limit.If technologies continue to improve further, then hydrocarbon energy sources can be forgotten. Of course, oil and gas can be used in various industries, up to the food industry, but not on the current huge scale. Therefore, Russia in this regard will lose its former significance and greatness.",

The incentives all those different countries have are so complex especially in situations of war that it sometimes is hard to understand who wants what the most. In this case though I think China is already planning with sufficient resources from Russia. Yes, but with a few caveats.1. Yes, China, \"thanks\" to the fact that Russia \"shot itself in the foot\", showing the whole world its fakeness in everything (from the economy to the quality of weapons and the army), let China into the bipolar world. And China no longer mentions Russia when it talks about a bipolar world. In his vision - in such a world there are 2 superstates - the USA and China, and the rest - should listen to them.2. On the other hand, the total loss of Russia, for China, carries reputational and situational risks. China is very unhappy that Russia, with its terrorist attack on Ukraine, rallied the WEST, actually resurrected NATO, and restarted the military industry of the West.That is why China now needs to weaken the forces of Russia as much as possible. Although Russia is an appendage of China, it can still provide some danger to China. Therefore, China comes forward with its \"peace initiative\", and they will offer to create support for Ukraine, sit down at the negotiating table, negotiate, and, well, obey China. Otherwise - the collapse, the total collapse of Russia - is very close. And then China will lose both the \"guinea pig\", and the \"raw material appendage\", and the puppet through which China can influence the international arena",
