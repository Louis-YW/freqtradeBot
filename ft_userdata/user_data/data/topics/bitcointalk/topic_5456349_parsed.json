But for any investor that has been in the crypto space for like 4 to 3 years from now would now cause to fear. In fact in the face of the approaching halving and the exchanges crises bitcoin faces this days I still feel the current price is still better than the other years. Another thing that actually has caused panic or fear in the Mindset of the new investors is the fact that most of them came into bitcoin with the narrative of it been a rich quick scheme and they invested either amounts that they can’t afford to hold for long or some loaned funds and since the market fluctuations aren’t going as they expected it is causing them some trouble",

Bitcoin marketcap got to over $1 trillion, now at half of the marketcap. You are not wrong about what you are saying but know that whales do wake up for bullish season and many of the whales will leave the market and bear season will start again.By next year, before and after bitcoin mining reward halves, you will see the whales waking up again. If you invested in bitcoin at $50000 to $65000 in 2021, you know how much you have lost and the period of time that you have to wait before bitcoin will hit the price and increase above it again.It is better to make a good speculation and invest at the right time. If I invest in bitcoin right now and the price fall, I will not sell because the price will reach over $25000 again and increase far more.",

They have such strong and unchangeable confidence because they have many things behind. Knowledge about Bitcoin, experience in the market and already got profit from Bitcoin investment.A newbie must do many things to become a Bitcoin maximalist and very first important mark, earning profit from Bitcoin investment. When you have profit, cash it out, you will increase your confidence. As said, you must be tested by the market especially bear market with massive fud to upgrade from newbie to a senior investor and a long time later, a Bitcoin maximalist.Anyway Bitcoin maximalist is kind of extreme, you don't need to be them to hold your bitcoin as a real Bitcoin investor.",

Bitcoin Maximalist are OGs in bitcoin,a newbie should only use the money that he can afford to lose for investing in bitcoin because nobody can predict what amount bitcoin price will be next. Bitcoin volatile nature is what controls the price and if you understand the basic bitcoin investment strategy,then you will know that investing in a long term run will be the best thing one can do to avoid panic when the price goes dip. We must all start from somewhere in our bitcoin journey and it is only  bitcoin knowledge and experience that can make you believe in it.",

I personally appreciate how passionate those guys on bitcoin because they really have long patience and believe that bitcoin could give them more decent profit than any other coins in the market. But its so rare to find bitcoin maximalist guys and I only know few of them exist here because most of the people I encounter invest on multiple coin because they believe on saying that don't put all of your egg in one basket. There's also nothing wrong with those belief and they should go on whatever can give them confidence or where they are comfortable to deal with.",

I remember my first months in the bitcoin sector, it was not easy for me. It was the period that the price was dropping every day and I was tempted almost to sell my coin to avoid further loss. With time I began to understand the sector and the need for patience. I was able to gain confidence and trust in the investment platform that bitcoin offers. I can't state categorically that I am now a bitcoin maximalist because I still fret but I am a bitcoin believer. I believe that investing in bitcoin is profitable for long-term investors. The destination of an unshakable belief in bitcoin is not a day's journey. Newbies need to understand the sector and gain experience in the workings of the industry. It is the depth of their knowledge that will determine their level of conviction that bitcoin is a trustworthy investment. Their experience can infuse boldness and bravery that will make them hodl their coins even in the face of FUD and intimidation from banks and the government.",

I believe that, but you've seen a lot of bad news these days about crypto. That makes us have to wait a long time, I actually hope that BTC will again grab the latest ATH. The current state of affairs is certainly part of the process towards that (hopefully). Many investors have different trading strategies and mentalities. For new people, maybe the problems these few days make them frightened. So there are several decisions they take to secure the assets they have. The stronger our mental restraint, it will certainly have a good impact on price increases.",

Lets just hope for the best to reach or surpass its ATH but it will take a while due to a lot of fuds.
