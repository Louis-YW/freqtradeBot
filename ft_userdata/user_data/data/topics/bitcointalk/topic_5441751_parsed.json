  "content": "Good morning everyone. I moved my funds from one wallet of mine to another wallet of mine, this one created a long time ago and with an older version of electrum. the problem is that when I try to send funds from this old wallet it asks me for a second password which should be generated by google authenticator, which however I have never set, I don't even own the app ( I verified myself that to set google authenticator with electrum you need to have the app and scan a qr code which I have NEVER done). I have the password of this 2fa wallet and I can enter it, view everything I can as the wallet is my property but not send any btc. The seed being a 2fa wallet cannot be viewed. please i need our help.",

      "body": "A wallet doesn't magically decide to become a 2FA wallet because it was bored.Anyways, if you don't want to use it as a 2FA wallet, you don't have to. I assume you have your seed, right? Recover your old wallet from your seed. Electrum will recognize it as a 2FA wallet and ask you if you want to keep using the 2FA or not. Remove the 2FA option and finalize the set up of your wallet. That should remove the 2FA feature. But your wallet remains a multisig wallet, meaning you will spend more on mining fees when you make transactions. You should move your coins from that wallet to a standard (non 2FA) wallet as soon as you recover and deactivate the 2FA option. Just make sure the other wallet you create (or have created) isn't also a 2FA wallet.",

Because it was created with an older version of Electrum, it might have issues now and that's what you encountered. Still you sent your funds into a \"trap hole\".What was the reason to move your funds in such a risky move? I don't get it.",

That is one strange point.Electrum has the option to create 2FA wallet service provided by TrustedCoin, implemented in 2015 if I can remember correctly. It requires 2FA codes from google authenticator, though it's a 2 of 3 multisig wallet. My bad if I didn't get your point. I haven't used 2FA wallet but have seen this when created electrum.QuoteWhat was the reason to move your funds in such a risky move? I don't get it.Bad move but maybe OP thought the wallet was safe. Maybe he has generated the seed in a safe and secured way.",

That is one strange point.It's not strange, when creating an Electrum 2FA wallet, Electrum will guide you to link it to Google Authenticator app through an \"authenticator key\",that will enable the authenticator app to reproduce the same 2fa-code generated in Trustedcoin's server within the allotted time.Try it be selecting: \"Wallet with two-factor authentication\" in Electrum's install wizard.Additionally, users can use whatever Authenticator App that he chooses, be it Google or Aegis, etc.It's not reliant to Google, it can even be set-up and use while the 2fa device is offline, the app computes the 2fa-code in real time.",
