Do not sell your freedom.I missed reading this kind of stuffs from 2017 in which people keeps talking about HODLing and buying but recently its mostly buy and sell or diversified your folio and the most popular is DCA , but for me? will stick to buying and holding because like what you said? it is our freedom that we are disposing by selling our bitcoin , not unless there are super emergency I will never sell my bitcoin specially this season that we are  nearing bull market.",

So waiting for fiat money to disappear is just a waste of time and meaningless. I invest in bitcoin and want to become financially free and have a better life. I don't think it's my responsibility to hold on to bitcoins and give them to my grandchildren while my parents, wife and children have to live a difficult life. There will be no freedom if you still live in poverty and don't have enough money to take care of yourself and your loved ones right now.",

Do not sell your freedom.I don't understand how we can get freedom if we are not selling at all. To use the benefits associated with it, we will either have to sell or use our assets or you will only be keeping them forever, giving them to your kids and grandkids. How will Bitcoin provide us freedom if we keep holding it forever? It's freedom when it is used, and if we are honest with ourselves, we should know that fiat is not going anywhere, at least for very soon.The world might become completely digitalized, currencies might turn into digital currencies and the concept of cash might disappear, but fiat will still be there, the government and traditional financial institutions will always have their control over us because we are compelled to use their currencies even if we don't want to.",

Do not sell your freedom.Well I think that's a good advice, but not everyone that can be patient enough to hodl it until fiat goes away entirely, because most people can decide to sell their bitcoin due to financial problems and other things. that's for those who don't have any other source of income apart from bitcoin investment, so this set of people will find it very difficult to hodl it until fiat goes away. However we should not always forget to use non custodial wallet in storing our bitcoin, because that's the only means to obtain freedom.",

Whales only needs to wait for the time to see Bitcoin price reach the new ATH so they will sell it and takes their profits. We as small investors must be patience and waiting for that but we can buy more to accumulates  more Bitcoin. But they must be careful with the trap that they see on the market which is the price can dump suddenly and then up immediately in the next minutes.

Weak hands will always fall the trap but strong hands will be able to resist the panic. I have seen such manipulation and have seen the panic in the market in 2018. After 2021 it is not happening as it was earlier due to the fact that institutional investors entering the Bitcoin market. After the ETF approval it has gone down drastically as it is not that easy to manipulate the price of Bitcoin. I don't agree with your point that it is important to keep holding Bitcoin. If that is the case then after a certain time there won't be any Bitcoin available to buy or sell. To increase the adoption of Bitcoin it is important to hold, buy and sell Bitcoin but always avoid panic sell.",

By limiting yourself to only one “eternal HODL!”, you are deprived of this freedom and it turns into BTC-slavery - blind service and worship for the sake of God “HODL!”. ?Fiat will leave, but CBDC will take this place.Don't be overly maximalist, because you only live once - take advantage of the opportunities provided by BTCitcoin.",

But if you invest in Bitcoin, you will get profit from it and it will be a good asset for the future, this is the big benefit of holding Bitcoin. Because if you keep money in the bank, the value of money decreases day by day due to inflation, and once the value of money decreases, the possibility of its increase is very low. This is why investing in Bitcoin should not be missed.  People who are knowledgeable and have enough capacity to invest I don't think they will miss the opportunity to hold Bitcoin.",

Pro tip to newbie hodlers, if you've got a goal with your bitcoin investment, it will help with your mindset to be clear and focused on how you will sell or buy your bitcoin, that way, you're not those mindless sheep investors that will move the wrong way or will move depending on where the wannabe market manipulators want them to move.",
