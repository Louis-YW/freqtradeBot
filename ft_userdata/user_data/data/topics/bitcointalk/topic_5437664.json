Make sure you buy a open source hardware wallet like Trezor.",

Actually Electrum wallet is beneficial for those who need daily spending of BTC. As you alread mentioned that you want to hold BTC for long time so I will recommend hard wallet to store BTC. Any cold wallet is not safe for storing long term.Ledger is best option for you to store which is full secure and no risk at all to store for long term. Trezor is also best one as mentioned by Kiakia. I am using Safepal Hardwallet to store my coins and I think it's also secure to store BTC. You can use any of Hardwallet according to your need .",

If they securely generate their keys on it and back up their seedphrase, maybe with an additional passphrase, this would be more secure than just opening electrum on your regular mobile and creating a wallet, and could be as secure (or more) as a hardware wallet.How you back up your seed, How you access your wallet to transact, how you interact online all contribute to the security of your asset.- Jay -",

Makes me realize how effective them asking you to type your password out twice really is.Why does anyone use entropy yielded from machine brains? There's no one out there that's gunna guess a combination of 16+ characters that came to YOUR mind RANDOMLY.Then again, I'm new so I'm probs wrong.In some very rare situations, you may be right.  Machine generated random passwords are not necessarily always safe.  You never know how random random can be.  You can click Generate and it can bring you a sequence of 16 identical characters.  But then you have a brain and can see patterns, so if you see a pattern you skip the newly generated password and re-generate until you get one random enough.I would argue coming up with your own password is a decision as bad as generating a Brain Wallet always was.  Your brain sees patterns and I think most of the things we are doing are actually patterns too.  This makes me believe we are even thinking in patterns too.I tried coming up with random passwords out of my mind too.  While at a first glance they seemed random, I soon realized there were a few things that went wrong.  First of all, I realized that I was only mainly using less than half of the alphabet in my 'random generation' of passwords.  Then I realized many of the sequences came from actual words.  I would have 'S' coming up first in my mind, write it down, then I would think of '@', write it down next to the 'S' and then, involuntarily, I would think of 'd' as the next character.That leaves me with the sequence 'S@d', which I could transform into 'Sad' from the English vocabulary.But then I realized I was doing this not so random generation.  Which led to the great idea of moving forward to using an actually randomly generated password.  You can do this in so many ways if you do not want to rely on machines.  The even bigger problem is that if we popularize this idea of 'you can produce your own password randomly', there will be many who will fail and will end up having passwords like tH1si$aGo0Dp@s$w0RD which is obviously not a good and secure choice.-Regards,PrivacyG",

You can't produce randomness, humans aren't capable of doing that, it's proved. What you're doing is thinking that you're being random, and that's why it seemed to you.Whatever is deterministic isn't purely random, and neither are CSPRNG (I haven't studied the field, but I guess). It's more of a philosophical topic. I'm sure the human brain functions deterministically, though. If you were forced to create a sentence within a minute, the first thing that would come to your head would be product of a very strange algorithm.

Some popular options include Trezor, Ledger, and KeepKey.Cold storage: This involves creating a paper or physical wallet, where you can store your private key in a secure location, such as a safe or a secure deposit box.Multi-sig wallets: A multi-sig wallet requires multiple signatures to access the funds, making it more secure than a traditional wallet. You can set it up with co-signers, so even if one key is compromised, the funds are still safe.Regardless of which method you choose, it's important to follow security best practices, such as keeping backups, using strong passwords, and enabling two-factor authentication.",
