I don't know how best to put this to say but most times if not all the time, I see referral bonuses or commission as something difficult especially in my country were people barely have to give listening ear to anything that has to do with depositing money online and most of the referral commissions will require you to get those you refer to first make a deposit and be able to wager same amount before one is been able to claim those commissions.Can you also point out any casino that wouldn't have to stress with having those I refer wager even after deposit before I can claim my commission for referral please.",

You must pay the prize to get what ever you want. In this case, casinos know that there would be lots of correspondence to their referral bonus offer and most times, the process is overpowered or overwhelmed by bots which most times can not be detected so in that case, if you must claim your bonuses, you would have to scale through the process and procedures involved so as to know you truly referred them and secondly if your referrals are not but generated accounts that was unleashed to invade their website as a result of the referral contest bonuses. Nevertheless, bonuses are some kind of promotional promo too which casinos do to get more traffic so in that case, they would be committing lots of funds for it and if you must access it, you must scale through the process of claiming the funds for which you have worked for. I really do not think it is a waste of time if one wants to claim referral bonus so far as you are up to the task. There is no point involving in what you know you can not be able to meet up with.",

This is a free world and I personally love trying out new stuffs especially when there are possibilities of making some good money from it but in as much as I love trying out new things, I also don't want things that seems to be a waste of time to me because over the time I've watched several YouTube videos on how to make effective use of referral bonuses but they all seem impossible when I tried because for you to get something really worth it from referrals then one has to have a great niche and audience of people who believe and would easily do as you tell them to do ( just my opinion).Quote from: Oshosondy on March 16, 2023, 10:11:54 AMWe need to know the exact reason why you said it is a waste of time. There is this saying that you can force a horse to a river but can't force it to drink from the river and same also applies here in referral bonuses as you can get one to use a particular casino and also your referral code or link but might not get to deposit or even wager and most of the casino requires you to get those you refer to first register, make deposit and then wager before one could claim these bonuses and if you'll agree with me that isn't an easy task especially in a country like mine.",

They are a marketing gimmick. They are not supposed to be a way some sort of guaranteed payment that provides you decent passive income. That would only be possible if yu attracted whales with your referrals and there are like handful of lucky people who are making money from them. And even then there's a possibility like this betfury thing happening.I think you answered to your own question.

You do realize that that has nothing to do with who you know or where you live right? To make money from affiliate marketing you have to be good at marketing. You have to share your code in ways noone else has thought of. Look at btcgosu for example. The guy is marketing and made a website. He offers all who have codes under him special rakeback deal, has special contests for his referrals, and does ok for himself I assume. You can also look at your casino streamers. There are a lot of them who make money from affiliate marketing as well. Getting users to sign up under their code and play.People think that simply sharing their code on a facebook group is going to make them rich, but if you only know poor people what are the odds they have money to waste gambling? You have to be innovative and think.",

You are right but this does not only apply to gambling. Recently a friend referred me to one of the common online banking in my country, if I did not deposit that day, he will not get the referral bonus. This is everywhere.Referral reward collection depends from sites to sites, I mean the type of service an organization is referring. Example is on freebitco, which is a faucet (though a gambling site too), also are many other time wasting faucets like Cointiply that you can refer people to to claim free coins, that kind of referral reward can be simple. But in referring in banks, exchanges, gambling sites and many other sites that require humans to deposit before the company can gain or make money, the referral reward can be when the person referred has deposited and make use of the site already.",
