I was just thinking how many people visit dedicated sites for crypto news in the recent time. I know there was a time people were just publishing crypto related news in their crypto website,  but these days the trend has reduced. I know that it is not easy to draw traffic to your site and when the traffic is not fast coming, the team members would be somehow discouraged.So, if you are to be successful in your project, maybe you have to do something from different from what others are doing. I wish you success in your project.",

On the plus side some of the content is interesting.  But there are already so many similar sites out there.

With proper use, and asking precise questions and tasks, AI can help create attractive content.When you start a website the primary goal is to get traffic. Google after its own AI content generator known Bard is not ranking down contents which have been generated by an AI. Unless the content doesn't make any correlation to the topic and has relevant information that covers every aspect, it will get rank on the first page. The trick is always to generate content that is unique or based trending topics. While human written content still make to the top without the same criteria. The difference is how much the content adds value and whether it makes some unique difference to an AI based content. P.S: OP your website is down.",

Instead of placing all the thumbnails of news that has ever been published, I think you would be better off loading a selection of featured/highlighted news to make the site lighter and friendlier for cheap hosting servers.I agree with you boss. Cheap hosting service or not, I believe websites like this should have load on scroll functions or provide users the ability to load more content if and when they want. This website has a load on scroll function but only after you get to the end of the first set of posts. I think number of posts in the first sets is too long. Also, loading a few posts will reduce loading time compared to loading many.I really like the design. I haven't looked at it on mobile though so my comments would be about the desktop view. I am also going to ignore the speed aspect of things since other responses have already addressed that.As a product designer with a lot of experience in designing websites, I wish to suggest a few design related improvements.I'll like to first of all commend you for I think the site's design is really on point. I just hope you didn't use a template.  👆 I like what you did with the heading there, showing the website motor. I think it is really nice. I also noticed the logo get's smaller as I scroll down. I think the logo should me more smaller, let's say fairly 70pixels in height. This, I think will allow the logo area to take less space thereby creating more room for the content.Secondly, on the categories directly below the logo and moto. Again, kudos to you on how you added the number of posts on each list item. I can imagine several horrible ways some designers would have done it. What I want to suggest here is that the list should stick to the page top edge as the user scrolls so that they can easily filter the content without having to scroll to the top.Thirdly, the container showing the post thumbnail, heading and some of the body content, should be linked and not just the heading. Research has thought me that users to just click on anywhere on the container to open it.Fourthly, the head image in the post page is too big. I think half of the size would make a better view. I had to scroll about three times to get to the bottom of the image and I couldn't see the whole image at once. So making it smaller will improve the experience.The last thing I'll like point out is the color of the text on the post page. It doesn't have enough contrast. Extra touches you could add to make the site really pop is to include dark mode. It really helps with a more focused reading when necessary. And this is all I can share for now. I am a Product design enthusiast who spends more time responding to posts rather than making my own",
