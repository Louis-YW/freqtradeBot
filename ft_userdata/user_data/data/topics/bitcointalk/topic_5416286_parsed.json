As far as i can see there was no new thing come to the crypto and it seems like the next bullish trend will always be related with the things that are still in the development progress like metaverse, web 3.0 and any other things that currently exist in the market. I don't even think you will be seeing the new thing to come very soon. Im still investing in the current tech that is still being developed",

There’s a high chance that it will be related on Metaverse since it’s the year where Metaverse will be fully developed and innovate to new ideas inside them. I don’t know exactly what idea it is but I assume it will be an dapps inside a metaverse. Maybe a metaverse casino or anything else.",

I think the most attention is on web3 and by 2023/24 there will be lots of web3, AI projects, there will also be some defi and cefi but they will be few. Already, we a handful of project support web3 in preparation for what is yet to come.",

I'm starting to see those projects that are focusing with web3 and they're thinking that it's the best time to start it because we're on the early phase of it. Although some web3 projects have already been there since the last bull run, still, it could be the next big thing where people are going to be hyped for. What else I can think of? Maybe about real companies producing their own tokens, like the ones that are already established.",

There's no reason for machine learning to become giants for the next years. People didn't even need machine learning to learn about crypto. They needs only consistently to read and read about crypto. Crypto can be learned easily without any problem. Ai is a bit make sense but so many ai projects were also failed delivering the product.",

The hot topics that may be the reasons for the next alt seasons are quite interesting to discuss.  Regarding Metaverse, it is not a new topic, it was already hyped in the previous bullish season. Unless there is something new about Metaverse, I don't think it will bring a big impact on the next altcoin season. I assume the hot topic in the next bullish season should be a new issue. We may be not aware of it now but it is probably hype during the upcoming bullish season.",
