Bitcoin is way different and acts more as an asset as compared to other Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum which does not reflect any asset values at all. Bitcoin has a fixed supply. It's literally much better than Gold. We do not have a fixed supply of any otherÂ  Major Cryptocurrency in the world.They all will follow the moves once a big player makes it, that's why these countries remain a follower not an innovator.",

You can see now that there are more than 26000 cryptocurrencies. There are still more coins but only few remain good. Most are shit and dead coins. Also that most coins are securities and not commodities. The only coins that has legal tender status should be bitcoin. And it should be in a way citizens needs to know how volatile it is. Bitcoin also is a store of value and an asset of value.",

It's not enough to just say pro Bitcoin and then change all transactions. Argentina needs a balance where the country's financial identity remains unavoidable. Javier Millei has a responsibility not only to focus on one support, but he is also responsible for the people of Argentina who do not use Bitcoin.For Javier Milei, currently it is not a question of whether he is neutral or not regarding the inauguration of Bitcoin, it is just that he is aware that while serving as head of state he cannot focus on one source of income. It is not easy for a leader of a country whose job is to improve the economy with a population of more than 45.81 million people.",

Or were you referring to something else, like the country of Argentina in general?The article mentions that Milei said different things about cryptos and Bitcoin in different interviews, and, considering that the article is very new, there's probably not enough information yet to know which policies he will actually try to implement. Bitcoin is one solution, but maybe he'll opt for a different one, such as dollarization.",

But if you solely talking about BTC then yeah it is not pegged with any real-world assets. As it is decentralized and its prices depend on demand and supply.Anyway, your title of the topic says, that BTC adoption has increased in Argentina while in the post you are saying Miley's opinion on Bitcoin is neutral. I don't see it as an increment in the adoption of BTC instead these are just Miley's concerns about BTC, or it shows that they have BTC in their minds and they might do something in it.",

The Bitcoin network is simply not capable of handling such volumes. Also the current situation of Argentina is not something where Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies can help. It is simply not possible. If Argentina really wants to get back on track, we will have to adopt some other currency systems just the way Zimbabwe did. Cryptocurrencies are not the answers to every problem. Removing Central Bank entirely can be a suicide for Argentina. Alternatively cryptocurrency can work as a parallel currency system in the country where both fiat and cryptos can be used to buy goods and services. Removing feat entirely can have severe consequences which may not be reversible at all.",

Well, this is just a typical politician move, they will promise anything that the voter want to hear, but most of the time they never keep their promise. I understand that disbanding central bank and adopting Bitcoin is very radical and significant move, it will be very hard to be applied, but if he doesn't want to do it, he shouldn't promise this thing in the first place.",

Bitcoin is not an economic savior. Some things are needed for a better economy. Proposing to eliminate a central bank is not the way to go for me. The central bank is the best rock of every economy. How does he want to improve a centralized system without the central bank?
