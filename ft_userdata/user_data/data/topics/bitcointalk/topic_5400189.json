  "content": "Hello Everyone,I registered on Bitcointalk forum on June 16, 2021. As a newbie and even up to till my present rank, I always enjoy reading comments in the Beginners & Help section of the forum. Aside from the knowledge value it offers, I find reading the comments very therapeutic. I have therefore compiled a list(though not exhaustive) of every comment that has given me guidance, direction, instruction, mixed with hope, inspiration, and encouragement. I also thank everyone who shares their knowledge for free. Thank you. Merci. Grazie. Gracias. Gamsahabnida. Xièxiè n. Daalu. E se gan ni. Na gode.Topic Forum UserComment_______________________________________________________________________________what you must know before investing into crypto currencyDaniel91QuoteBefore making any investment, it is necessary to have some knowledge about the market and how to analyze the market. It is always important not to invest emotionally but rationally, with a clear investment strategy and it is always important to have an exit strategy. Investing should be understood as a very serious business and not as a leisure hobby. The most important thing is to be patient and not expect quick results. If you don't know anything about the crypto market, don't invest because you risk losing everything due to your haste and ignorance.A word of advices about cryptocurrenciesmk4QuoteDo some actual reading, and a lot of it. A lot of people thought watching YouTube of some pump and dumper would suffice. And no, I don't mean read Reddit shill threads and such; go read actual articles.why does the price of Bitcoin influence other coinsBitcoin_ArenaQuoteThe easiest answer and explanation is probably because Bitcoin acts as a base currency for different altcoin pairs in different exchanges. I believe you have already seen so many altcoin pairs in BTC markets such as ETH/BTC, SOL/BTC, LTC/BTC. So let's say at a bitcoin price of 1 BTC being $10,000,  if 1 LTC = 0.001 BTC in the LTC/BTC market pair, it means in USD value 1 LTC is worth $10. If the price of Bitcoin double to $20,000. Even if the price of LTC remained the same vs BTC (0.001 BTC). It implies the USD value of 1 LTC will have doubled to $20.That how Bitcoin affects other altcoin markets.DON'T QUITKingsDenQuoteSometimes it is better to quit. I think the idea of quiters never win and winners never quit has led some persons to early grave. There is no harm in quiting, it is better you quit than trying the wrong way. When you don't know how things work, quit. Quiting does not mean you cannot rejoin, just quit temporarily and acquire some required skills and you can key in again. He who fights and runs, lives to fight another day and the same is the hero. So, it is good you learn how to do it than doing it wrongly all your life.Always look out for a good entry pointLuciusQuote\"@YellowSwap, it definitely makes sense to buy something cheap, and when it comes to cryptocurrency bear market or big corrections are a great investment opportunity. However, many see such a strategy as a problem due to the fact that they will have to wait a long time for some profit - and that is why most choose the opposite strategy of short-term investment at a time when prices are rising.And as for some good crypto projects, good luck with that - because finding one such project is the same as looking for a needle in a haystack, and I personally prefer to play the lottery once a week and hope that some pretty girl will draw my lucky numbersPrecaution is better than cure.LTU_btcQuoteThere is not new thing - you should never buy hardware wallets from unofficial sellers. You can save few dollars by doing it, but there is risk to lose all your crypto savings later. So, I don't think that's worth to risk. But it's not completely safe to buy from official website too. Few years ago Ledger customers database with personal data, mainly emails were leaked. So, it would be best not to use your main email when you order hardware wallet from it. And yeah, as said above, Ledger have official store on Amazin, but it's worth to check everything twice before making order.Bad way of storing keys?BitMaxzQuoteTake note according to Google M.2 memory has 8 to 10 years of life so if you are planning to hold them for more than that you must make a physical backup. A paper backup or stainless or metal to backup your seed phrase physically you can buy Cobo vault or keystone tablet as a common steel backup tool to hold your keys or backup seed phrase for more than 10years. I have actually HDD with old coins and tokens but can't able to revive it all of my HDDs are 2nd hand so I do not know what will be the exact lifespan of HDDs but according to Google, it's around 5 years. Not good to have an HDD with coins holding it for a long time because there is a big possibility that they will die in the future without recovering your coins from your HDD. Unlike having a physical metal/stainless steel backup.The power of a questionnaireOcTradismQuoteTo have good questions, you must have knowledge and experience which are not what newbies have. Scam projects aim at newbies at most because they are more vulnerable to scam. They don't have experience to see risk and when they invest in their very first crypto projects, they simply think of bright future with good profit. If you ask questions and receive polishing answers, it does not mean you can believe that project is good. Sometimes scammers are very well to answer your questions, make you hope high and make their project goes viral. However, quality of their project does not only come from their answers. You see and check their real products..1$ per day crypto investment plan any good ?NeuroticFishQuoteIt's clearly better than nothing. \"Enough\" really depends from person to person and from country to country. Also be aware that you probably won't deposit each $ separately, won't buy BTC for each $ separately and the withdrawals to your own wallet are not cheap, hence you'll have to check all the fees involved and plan accordingly. For such small amounts the fees can be a big problem, especially if you are not super-careful.Do you tell your friends about your crypto achievements?Charles-TimQuoteYour friend can believe more in the way you earn if you are actually earning from trading, he would want to know about it from you if your way of living is good and making money from trading. What I know is that you can't tell friends a lot of things about you, a friend can become the person that may be able to look for way to compromise your wallet or trading account. About your strategy, there is no harm if telling your friend about it, but not about how much you earn.How Quality Can A Newbie's Post Be?mk4QuotePeople think that creating \"quality posts\" always means that you need to be teaching or educating people through posts that consists of 3 paragraphs or more; which is definitely NOT the case.Newbies need to be mentored well.mocacinnoQuote\"No need for mentoring on how to avoid plagiarism, i can help you in three simple sentences:Do not copy somebody's work and present it as if it were your own. This is illegal in most countries, and on most discussion forums. It is also illegal on bitcointalk. IRL, plagiarism will get you expelled, fired or you can even land in jail... On bitcointalk, the admin is more lenient and just gives you a lifelong ban instead of banning you AND reporting you to the authorities for an in real life punishment.\"Buy bitcoin seasonTheNineClubQuoteThose are some big and hard-to-answer questions that have been researched to depth on this forum and other sites. No one can tell you what the best time for buying BTC is because no one knows what your goals are. So the best thing would be to educate yourself as much as possible and then make an educated guess on when to invest.Is Bitcoin a business or an investment?pakhithebossQuote\"It completely depends how you want it to be?For most of us it act as an asset. For some it comes as a salary. For few it is used for buying goods. For a lot of us it works as a payment system.  It goes on and on as I told you it depends on how you want to use it? That's the power of Bitcoin.\"BUY & HODL - is the surest strategy for crypto beginnersRatimovQuote\"As the saying goes, if there is demand, then there will be supply. If there are many who want to get rich quickly (and they will always be, such is human nature), then there will be many who want to make money on it. As long as people think that they are smarter and more cunning than others, they will lose money. You are right, holding is the best strategy and no trading can compare with it in terms of profit, in the long term.\"What are the reasons for entering the crypto market?tyzQuoteI dove into the crypto scene in 2011. Out of idealism, not to get rich. That's a major difference from many who dive into the scene today. They want to get rich quick without having any knowledge at all about the goals and workings of the technology. By the way, this is also the reason why so many end up making a loss. They buy when they hear about it in the news. But then it is usually already too late and the peak is already reached or is about to be reached.Be careful of scammers on p2p exchangestaufik123Quote\"The safest and safest way to avoid scammers on P2P Binance is to choose a seller that has a Merchant sign, because a seller who has a merchant mark is a seller that has been chosen by Binance, so it will be safe from scammers or you can filter seller accounts that have only merchant marks that appear. Don't be tempted by cheap selling prices and expensive buying prices. because some of them are just price gimmicks. I have made a transaction but it was never processed.\"Guide on bitcointalkcryptoaddictchieQuote\"Aside from plagiarism. Dont do spam and avoid posting nonsense topic. It will be subjected to such punishment like temp ban, deletion of post, or worst permanent ban. A forum is made for discussion so avoid making your account a business one for earning money. What Im trying to say is since you are a newbie then focus on doing what other newbies doing like learning the process here. If you do that then thats great.\"How to stay safe from scam cryptocurrency app.cheezcarlsQuoteIt doesn’t matter how many who have downloaded the app or publishing genuine reviews, the most important thing of all is to double or triple check the publisher of the app if it’s legit or not. We could easily know that once it’s coming from their official website or social media channels regarding the app.Why buy bitcoins and not altcoins？bitmoverQuote\"I can show you some data.1) MarketCapBitcoin accounts today for 48.4% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.This means that investors all around the globe consider that all altcoins combined are worth nearly the same as bitcoin.2) Oldest and most tested cryptocurrencyBitcoin is the oldest and most tested cryptocurrency out there. BTC is around since 2009, and etheruem only since 2016 (half bitcoin age)3) Price correlationAll altcoins have a strong correlation with bitcoin price. If bitcoin price goes down, it is almost certain that all other altcoins will go down as well (usually more than bitcoin). When bitcoin goes up, some altcoisn goes up as well (some don't), with extra volatility.So you are not really diversifying when buying altcoins, you are just adding more volatility.\"Newbies Learn From Your Senior Colleagues.logfilesQuoteBy the way, just because one’s profile is a newbie rank may not automatically mean that the person behind the account has no clue about cryptocurrencies and vice versa. While learning to read more than one can reply is very important.A blind investor's confessionAbuBhakarQuoteYou should focus on investing on major coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum then stake it to get passive income. Then venture out on other project within top 100 and search for project that price is not moving significantly for a long period of time. Always DYOR on the project team and who’s investing on it. Make sure search for trusted VC on there backer to make that the project is legit because VC will never invest on shit project. Stay away on meme coin and invest more on blockchain project as its the most profitable investment in crypto since the beginning of crypto.Newbies Hodle and profit in a Pumps and Dumps market.tranthidungQuote\"My advice goes to-Take profit when price goes up high enough to do it. Be happy when you take profit no matter how the price will move later (even if it rises 2-fold, 4-fold more later)-How many proportion of your initial investment should be taken profit?a) You should have plan to take profit partially, not all at onceb)You should take profit to retrieve your initial capital back. Assume it requires 50% of your total token. Then for rest 50%, you can take profit next times with 20%, 20% and 10%. Make sure you reserve 10% or 20% of your initial token as your bet.c) It is a safe strategy because: (1) You already get initial capital back, so no loss in the end; (2) Already take profit, so it's already a good investment, no loss and somewhat profit; (3) the reserved part will help you rich in case that token has 50x, 100xAfter you take profit, forget about that token. The longer time you stay with it, the more risk you will be trapped by the market\"NO RISK, NO REWARDjackgQuoteIt's only half true the no risk = no reward because you have to learn how to take managed risks in investing so you don't just lose money (especially to scams). If you don't learn the risks or how to manage and limit then then you'll end up with less of a reward than if you did full research.About my safety on exchangeo_e_l_e_oQuoteThere is no centralized exchange in existence which is entirely safe, and even ones which offer non-KYC accounts such as KuCoin can and frequently do lock accounts and confiscate coins while they demand KYC. If you aren't comfortable submitting KYC, then you need to avoid all centralized exchanges.In a world where trust failsnoorman0QuoteWith decentralization which means giving up legal guarantees to get involved in problems, it actually opens up more opportunities for people to cheat and be deceived. Therefore, in a decentralized financial system it is more popular to use the word \"don't trust, verify\". A trustworthy person will first suggest research and explain the risks rather than shouting \"trust me\" and \"it's profitable\". Some annoying things that beginners do (but also some old members)hatshepsut93QuoteNot using punctuation. One of the most annoying offenses to me personally, is when someone posts a huge chunk of text without breaking it into paragraphs. I usually just skip such posts, because they tire my eyes, and pretty much all decent posters know how to break up their posts to have basic readability. Do your own researchUpgrade00QuoteThe idea of doing your own research is to do your inquiry and not just take an advice cause a user said so.For example, if a YouTuber makes a video about a new trading strategy, and says you should not take their word as financial advice; It means you should research more on that strategy, and possibly try it out in demo mode to confirm that it works, that way you will see the result of the said strategy and if you choose to adopt it, it would be because you've seen it work and not cause someone said so. [Beginner Dilemma] What's the truth? Confidence/ArroganceskaraisQuoteDon't be afraid to express yourself and knowledge here in the right way because this is basically what can tell which users are really interested in knowledge and which users are interested in money. Maybe it's not wrong to get to know each other between forum users. But I don't think I should do it just for privacy and I think other popular users will say the same. Things to know before trading.JosefjixQuoteNumber 1 rule have to be you can make much gains by buying low and selling high than buying high and thinking you could make so much gains in a short while. You will have to reduce the greed index level in your mind, because no matter how much you hope to make it can never be bigger than the gains you have been making. Always HODL, be disciplined. Don't chase your losses. These are basic facts. Kyc is deceitful if ignorant of the bad sideShowOffQuoteScam can happen anywhere and anytime as long as we don't take precaution and are aware of all the possibilities. Buying verified account \"trading account\" from other users in my opinion is not a good idea in preparation for trading activities because there is still a possibility that this will lead to scam. If they don't like to use personal identities on exchange then I think they can still trade on decentralized exchange \"P2P exchange\" instead of having to buy someone else's verified account for a centralized exchange. Reading is more important than replyingFindingnemoQuoteReading let you to gather new information but only replying will share the knowledge to others if they don't know it and there is a famous quote \"keeping the knowledge for yourself is a greatest sin\". But reply only it its needed and \"keep it simple\" so others can understand it better! Social media's impact to the growth of crypto currencyDarker45QuoteI guess Bitcoin would have grown much slower if social media weren't part of it. So thanks to social media for serving as a vehicle or a platform for quickly spreading Bitcoin. However, it is also true that social media has also damaged the image of Bitcoin to a certain extent. For the past years, Bitcoin has been attached to investment scams thanks to social media as well. The convenience of social media has become a double-edged sword. It could educate people on Bitcoin as well as mislead them. So individuals should also be critical of social media. Verification is always necessary. Crypto becoming less and less anonymous dimonstrationQuoteIt’s for the better as many scammers now uses it for their own goods and finding ways to scam people. The more adoption happens, the more the security should be tighten. As long as we know what website and project we are doing KYC with then it’s fine. At this time we must know how to choose the project and know whether we’re doing the right process. This is the cons of the price increases and we need to embrace the consequences if we want not to be a victim of scammers. We just need to be careful. Do we see a future where Crypto would be globally accepted as a common means of ncsupanda QuoteBit of a biased question to ask in a Bitcoin forum; if anyone here doesn't believe in the potential future of Crypto as a whole I'd be confused on their presence here What we think is a quality post DdmrDdmrQuoteI tend to favour the concept of interest over the term quality in the context of Merit (which I figure is the context here). Both terms are subjective, but a post that arouses interest of some sort, be it through a question, a comment, a versed explanation, a summarized explanation, a novel theme or approach, or what not, is more the concept sought for in my opinion. The post can then additionally be well constructed and structured, with decent grammar and a clear exposition, features that may build towards it falling under the additional quality categorization. Who else has your passphrase BlackHatCoiner QuoteYou don't have to give them your passphrase/seed/private keys. You only need to make them learn some stuff, like how Bitcoin wallets work etc; you should just sign a transaction which spends all of your money (you want to inherit) to a freshly generated address which will be owned by your family/loved one. Just make it spendable after a certain block and ta-da! Trustless inheritance. Your thoughts about Bitcoin in years to comeCookdata QuoteBitcoin will be recognized all across the globe, but it will not be accepted as legal money by the majority, as I have observed, but I am not a prophet. Fiat isn't going away, it's staying because that's what dominates the country, and you don't expect what controls the country to go illiquid one day. Bitcoin will continue to be the most sought-after digital money in the world. How do you differentiate good Airdrops from bad ones?Jawhead999QuoteThere's no way to verify that, you could consider airdrop is kind of giveaway which is there's no guarantee you'll got the reward. Just participate as much as you can since it's not hard and low effort to register an airdrop, it's a matter of time consuming. To participate airdrop all you need is provide your address, if they ask money then it's 100% scam. It's worth to mention some airdrop will ask your KYC, you can consider does your identity are worth for couple bucks? If I were you I won't do that. Getting started with escrow service. bL4nkcodeQuoteTrust of the community, experienced/knowledge of trading/deals/transaction to other users (p2p deals) are one of the keys to be eligible on escrow services. There's no required rank for it but many recommend for higher ranks as they spend lot of time in this forum. Holding fund is not the only work of escrow, handling disputes is also one of the criticals you need to work on. So to start on this service, you need to build your own reputation. Have you ever tried to live only on Bitcoin? BIT-BENDER QuoteI think everyone would love to live their daily lives on Bitcoin,it would not only mean investment opportunities but it would also make transaction and payment very easy.although to be honest this may be hard to achieve, there are hardly any place that solely accepts Bitcoin as a means of payment offline, also employers are not willing to add Bitcoin as a means of payment to their employees and this are all little hindrance in terms of that which the government poses. I think we have a long way to go if we want to live on Bitcoin all through Who is your bitcoin hero (excluding Satoshi)? SatoPrincess QuoteMy hero would be the Bitcoin community, reasons are• Members of the bitcoin community are curious and take the deep dive to learn the technical aspect of bitcoin and blockchain• No one in the crypto space has a stronger hodling mentality like the bitcoin community. This has helped me to build a strong mind as well.• The community is not fooled when imposters claim to be Satoshi NakamotoWhat to do to avoid phishing sitesUpgrade00 QuoteNice post. It would be helpful to bookmark all the sites you visit regularly, and always review any new site before adding it to your list. Never click on links from unsolicited emails, telegram messages or even PMs here on the forum. Before clicking on edited links here on BT, hover over the link to view the original HTML or copy and paste the link if you're using a mobile browser.What is the difference between seed phrase and private key? hosseinimr93QuoteFor every transaction you make, you need the private key of your address to sign the transaction.When you make a transaction, your seed phrase isn't directly used for signing the transaction. Your seed phrase (which is a series of words) is used to create a seed. Then the seed is used for generating the extended private key and the extended private key is used for generating your private key(s). So, Any seed phrase gives you access to numerous addresses. But a private key gives you access to one address only (of course, more addresses if different script types are considered). It should be noted that your private key(s) can be derived from your seed phrase. But your seed phrase can't be derived from your private key(s).Don't use your bitcointalk account password on other websites Anwar151QuoteAnd activate the 2FA feature on the email for additional security.Growing Bitcoin demand among people.... dkbit98 QuoteGeneral population will be the last to accept Bitcoin and they are just following the heard mentality, but smart people can see that fiat inflation is growing and leading towards hyperinflation. Smart people and sportsman you listed above are thinking with their head, and they are just trying to avoid losing their wealth by investing in Bitcoin. Alternative option for this is to trust your government and professional liars called politicians, and than let's see how far both ways go in few years.Parting words to young warriors RatimovQuoteIn cryptocurrency, all quick options to get rich lead to quick options to lose everything. Remember this. If you start trading, then only in the spot, only on your own.Some Tips To Stop Feeling Overwhelmed In Cryptojrrsparkles QuoteI want to add one more point which is avoid any project without giving any shit about it when you see it is promoted as next Bitcoin or ethereum because copycats won't survive if they don't bring anything new then they are not going to stay here, probably with the hype they may last for few weeks or months and not more than that.Don't buy your greed NeuroticFish QuoteBe very careful on how you present the information to your friend. Make it 100% clear that it's his choice whether he invests or not. Make it 100% clear that Bitcoin price can rise and fall. Also, if he indeed wants to invest, present him information about how to keep his coins safe (the wallet, which can be even hardware wallet, and the backup too).What is the most profitable way for me to earn income on my idle Bitcoin?khaled0111QuoteIf you are looking for a passive income then lending is your best option. You can offer your service in the Lending section but don't expect to make a huge profit as you would make on other platforms. If you decide to go with this option, make sure to deal only with reputable members or always ask for a collateral. Holding is also a good option but since bitcoin is at its ATH, it may take some time (months or even years) before you can see some good profit.Getting up and trying againCryptopreneurBrainboss QuoteFirstly go get a real job, it's more comfortable investing in bitcoin when funds been used aren't urgent funds for day to day needs but spares that you won't go crazy losing. After securing a job steadily by into Bitcoin first (later you can experiment with alts), and keep learning.How to trade properly for newbies passwordnowQuoteMight also be good to add that don't trade if they're still new and check those trading exercises or simulators where they can trade without risking their own money. I think that's a good start for the newbies to have an idea of how it goes with trading so that they'll make themselves be prepared if it's about putting their money on the line as they trade. And as an addition to that tip, just don't leverage/margin trading, it's not really for the beginners.How to lose your Bitcoins with CTRL-C CTRL-V o_e_l_e_o QuoteAny time I am sending coins from any wallet I physically place the address I know is correct directly from the source, right next to the address I have entered to send to. That usually means either holding my hardware wallet or phone up next to my computer screen, or resizing two windows on my phone or computer to put the two address physically right next to each other. Once you have two addresses which are less than inch apart, its very easy to check the entire address and not just a few characters at the start or end.Don't use institutional BTC purchases as a signal of imminent growthBitcoin_Arena QuoteWhat people forget is that when institutions by bitcoin. They are also looking to make profits short term and not just holding long time. So obviously if they buy a huge amount of Bitcoin that can push the price up, then it's very likely they will sell the same amount of Bitcoin at some point to take profit leading a price drop.Which trading platform is good for beginners? Jawhead999QuoteThere's no such good trading bot for beginner, expert etc because trading bot will give you indicator, technical analysis, notifications etc to help you in trading. If you don't understand with trading indicators, they it's just wasting your money since it don't help you anything. Consider to use free bot (e.g. gekko and zenbot) before the paid one.Need Some Advice _BlackStar QuoteIf you have the skills, then you're one step ahead of many of the spammers here to come up with something decent. You can go directly to service board and create threads about services that match your expertise, promotional banners for example. But I kind of doubt you'll find your job that easy at this point. Average Joe may be tough from the start, but it never hurts to try.Create and earnIssa56 QuoteI don't think your purpose in the forum is just to rank up, the forum is a place where you can learn and you can also share your own knowledge. If you are just after rank you you might endup going against some forum rules. If you are joining the forum I believe you should have it in your mind that you want to learn and you also want to share your knowledge and gradually you are going to rank up. Be patient, don't get discouraged. Rruchi man QuoteThis is a wake up call to newbies especially, and all those who are considering quitting forum.-Your opinions are valid and we want you to stay. Big things always start small, don't get discouraged because there seems to be no attention on your post and no merits given regardless of your activity.-Even if your contribution get deleted and you get criticism for your point of view, don't get discouraged, work on yourself to be better, but still remain yourself.-If it is taking you very long to increase in ranks and you almost feel like it will not be possible anytime soon, don't get discouraged, you will get there.It is okay to take some time off, but please do not cut us off from your perhaps golden contribution.The relationship between educational qualification and quality of post. jackg QuoteI think the experience part has the biggest weighting here. If you're good at accurately learning/doing research then your posting quality will probably be at its best regardless of what education status you have (even if you can learn things better in another language).Which is the best to use now?LoyceVQuoteThe basics apply to any OS: don't keep a lot of funds in hot wallets, don't install weird software, install as few apps as possible, or even better: use a dedicated system for your wallet.BHUNT Stealer Malware Targeting Crypto Wallets!notblox1QuoteRecommendation is to never install applications from untrusted sources, and don't use cracked software and operating systems.Ranking up is possible! 2900 Merits earned in less than 12 months!My 11 Hints!fillipponeQuoteI think I can share with you some suggestion on how improve your chances of writing good posts, and then getting merits. Write correctly, avoid typos and edit your post at the best of your possibilities (don’t forget punctuation marks). Typos, grammar errors, strange sentence syntax might dampen the effectiveness of your message. I learnt the hard way when I got almost no merits on the first revisions of my guide. A good hint is to proofread your text with a Word Processor before posting. Preview your message before posting to spot errors in links, or opportunities to improve the general layout of the message.Phones on mobile wallet becoming riskierWelshQuoteClassic sensationalist headline, DdmrDdmr is spot on in my opinion. The thing is phones, especially online phones have never been a good idea, at least for storing a significant amount of Bitcoin. However, I can see their uses for small amounts. Android has a good permission system, the locking system on it is decent, depending on the options you choose i.e don't use a pin or fingerprint, use a password. The problem with phones is people are more inclined to download apps which they haven't verified or know they can trust, and also connect to networks which they don't trust. Otherwise, they are pretty decent apart from a few issues.The fact is, even if you do have a Bitcoin wallet on your phone, it should still be encrypted, and should lock after exiting the app even if it has been kept in memory or the open apps drawer, and you should be able to hide the icon. Android, at least custom ROMS usually have this option.There must be some don't do with hardware wallets or there is none?ETFbitcoinQuoteAside from what other member said, some hardware wallet comes with documentation or article. Usually it's meant for general user, so i strongly recommend you to read all of it. For example, Ledger provide these handy article,1. Is my Ledger device genuine?2. Check hardware integrity",

As a newbie and even up to till my present rank, I always enjoy reading comments in the Beginners & Help section of the forum. Aside from the knowledge value it offers, I find reading the comments very therapeutic. I have therefore compiled a list(though not exhaustive) of every comment that has given me guidance, direction, instruction, mixed with hope, inspiration, and encouragement.Cool, I also want to support you with a +2 merit.Thanks for quoting me too in your thread. I don't think it's the best quote I've ever made, but it might be useful to some of those who need the answer. OP, you should know that account age is not a guide that someone has good experience and knowledge [that's not all true], but we can judge the quality by the way they post. So just do what you want to do, if you think it's good and useful then don't be afraid to do it.Quote from: Davidvictorson on May 25, 2022, 06:56:32 PMNeed Some Advice _BlackStar QuoteIf you have the skills, then you're one step ahead of many of the spammers here to come up with something decent. You can go directly to service board and create threads about services that match your expertise, promotional banners for example. But I kind of doubt you'll find your job that easy at this point. Average Joe may be tough from the start, but it never hurts to try.",

I think the idea of quiters never win and winners never quit has led some persons to early grave. There is no harm in quiting, it is better you quit than trying the wrong way. When you don't know how things work, quit. Quiting does not mean you cannot rejoin, just quit temporarily and acquire some required skills and you can key in again. He who fights and runs, lives to fight another day and the same is the hero. So, it is good you learn how to do it than doing it wrongly all your life.It feels good to understand that the piece that some users drop here helps others in one way or the other. I commend Op for a beautiful compilation he did. I didn't only see my quote in Op, I also saw some topics created by me appeared above. You are not alone on this, because I still remember some statements that helped shaped me in this space when I was a newbie, some of these statements I might have time to appreciate in the future. This kind of thread is a motivation to continue creating insightful and helpful threads on B/H board for newbies.",
