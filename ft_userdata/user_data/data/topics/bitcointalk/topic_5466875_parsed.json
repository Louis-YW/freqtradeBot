Office Job is not hyped as it was before and many graduates have been looking for other means to earn money. Online work has been very helpful for many Nigerians since some years ago and it is still helpful as of today.Quote from: Hewlet on September 15, 2023, 09:17:03 AMIs it true that for you to make it big in the online space, you must be involved in an act of illegality?There are many people that went through illegal means to earn money but they are still poor as of today. There are many of them that were later known and jailed. There are people that did not go through the illegal means and they are not rich. There are people that did not go through the illegal means and they become very rich. You can see a lot of Nigerians that are YouTubers, TikTokers that are earning money. Some are earning from ads on Twitter and other online sites. This forum alone is also helpful. If you seen the means some people are earning money, you will be surprised that it is legit.",

The older generation are always guilty of this as their reasons and mentality is just all around the time of their early beginnings back in the days. They forget that things changes likewise evolution in virtually every aspect of life and activities.When it comes to job, there have been lots of evolution in job occupation now that one does not really need to move about to work or make an earns meet but just comfortable at your convenience working from your home and getting paid. For instance and to the best of my knowledge people work here and are paid weekly in Bitcoin which is still part of job done to earn a living.Office job I think is over hyped mate because I see no difference between them. In some cases, people earn more from their comfort zone than those claiming to be going to the office on daily basis spending money more on transportation and lots more compared to what they earn in a month.It is only here in Nigeria where it is assumed that anything online is illegal. So in that case anybody sitting too long in front of computer or laptop is termed and tagged a street boy which is not true and that is where the misconceptions began.",

Especially in third world countries and other countries with growing economy where many perceive it as working in the office or having an office job is the only way to success. That is a long time misconception that have glued to our thinking faculties.But another thing I will mention is that, with the advent of the Corona virus and the adjustments we had to make across the world, that has at least soften the misconceptions that one must have a white-collar job to make money. I think the technocrats also did excellently well to enlighten the world about the emerging technologies and how we can use it in our career jobs and working environments.This has at least tamed the largely spread misconception. In a nutshell, working at home is more advantageous to working in an office where you will have to walk or drive some miles to get to every day of the week. It has both economical and physical benefits. You get to save more money to settle other bills when you work from home instead of spending some bucks to fuel your vehicle. Physically, because working at home doesn't require you to undergo any physical stress of commuting. Other advantages of working remotely includes, additional time for family, time saving, flexibility and increased productivity level.And also for making money in the online space. I think that fallacy has really eaten our society up but if I may ask you, what do you think is your personal opinion on this?",

And for the younger ones who stay with their parents but are into online business/jobs, some parents tend to term them lazy due to the amount of time spent on their gadgets.Working in an office has made so many people go through a lot of stress like waking up by 4 am mostly for those working in the banking sector and also paying for transport with a lower salary while working from home will make you overcome the stress of waking up early to go to work and coming back late. When you work from home you decide when to wake up from sleep, and when to start your work for the day, and the pay is also good. For instance, if you want to place a sports bet and you don't have an online gambling account you will be stressing yourself out going to a betting shop to place your bet and also waiting for your turn before you can place your bet while someone who has an online gambling account will just be in his house with ease and place a bet without he/her going anywhere QuoteDo you think the office job is overhyped? Yes, an office job is overhyped in our countryside because we were made to understand that if we don't go to school we will never make it in life. Yet there are so many graduates in our country who are not employed and are doing mini-work such as driving a taxi, or bus, and riding a motorcycle to earn a living. In our country today you will see that those who didn't go to school are the ones making the money.QuoteIs it true that for you to make it big in the onlinonesace, you must be involved in an act of illegality?It is just vice versa there are some people who have made enough money through illegal hustle and there are still many of them who can not afford one square meal a day while legally, there are people who have also made huge money by investing their time and money in Bitcoin and other legit online hustle like monetize of Twitter, and skit making, and we also have some too who are finding it difficult to feed themselves.",

Na scam e dey do, is what many would assume. The reality is this, with the current situation of the country many offices are willing to allow their older workforce work from home, if they are willing to do so. It is dependent on the job description however. Automatically, all private jobs don become government jobs, hehehe... because na only government workers in days past, I don't know if it is so till date, but they can stay at home during work days or come to work when they like, many of the times.",

But all this view has changed about white collar job because in the past once you finish school there is every possibility that you will definitely get a job with or without any form of connection but nowadays getting a white collar job is even more difficult than finishing from school and since there are lots of graduates without work now people don’t hype these jobs as they do before and they seek for employments online and some establish their own businesses. There used to be so much respect for white collar workers but not anymore, rather people have more respect for business owners nowadays.

The amount you earn online depends on the work you’re into just as it is in the working sector, some work can earn you millions e.g content creating and the likes and also some can earn you less just like the signature campaigns and bounties in the forum and there are so many other kind of online jobs that are clean and legal so you must not work illegally to make it big.",

Can you picture how some people would suffer to pay their school fees for them to finish their degree, HND, etc and at the end of the day, they won't see an office job? This is due to the way the government is currently running our country. Some instructors will even invite students to their homes to sit down with them and advise them to go earn some cash before they can get job.Quote Is it true that for you to make it big in the online space, you must be involved in an act of illegality?And about the issue of on-line subs, that some individuals are referring everyone to a scammer, but Shal, I don't blame them because they didn't know that they meant methods of making money online because not all online purchases are prohibited.",

First of all, you're working for someone else pocket, not for yourself. Secondly, you're not earning enough to feed yourself and your family properly ( not all jobs though, but most ), so why all the stress? Thirdly, you probably don't even like your job, and cause of the want to make your parents proud, and earn, you're stuck in the matrix system draining yourself away. This isn't the industrial age, the world has moved on, and so should we.And about illegal internet activities... NOWhen it comes to the online space, it's all about growing your network and therefore enhancing your net worth. So, you don't need to participate in illegal activities first, just learn a skill, a good digital skill, and grow your network.",
