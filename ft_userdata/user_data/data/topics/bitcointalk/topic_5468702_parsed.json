After reviewing their video I found that it is a way to drain the wallet of crypto users with a tempting offer. I checked the ETH address 0x05d0b9414dAFF032E33A5D2C679a8094484B3A41  where he showed the deposit process in the video and found that there was no transaction of 8 ETH, so the deposit video he showed is actually fake. I have collected this address by taking a screenshot from the video and converting it to text. Crypto users should protect themselves from such fake videos, and always use common sense, so that these scammers don't play mind games with tempting offers.QuoteDomain Name: eth-mev-bot.appRegistry Domain ID: DF9301E0A-APPRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.namecheap.comRegistrar URL: https://www.namecheap.com/Updated Date: 2023-06-25T15:52:27ZCreation Date: 2023-06-20T15:52:27ZRegistry Expiry Date: 2024-06-20T15:52:27ZRegistrar: Namecheap Inc.Registrar IANA ID: 1068Registrar Abuse Contact Email: email@namecheap.comRegistrar Abuse Contact Phone: +1.6613102107",

They create videos in such a way that inexperienced crypto users think they are genuine and fall into these scams. Crypto users should be cautious and knowledgeable about how to report such scams. A normal crypto user would have easily believed this video and lost their funds, because it was very difficult to understand the tricks of the scammers by watching this video.",

I don't know how some people get fooled by this!I also created a wallet and pretended I will make a deposit and I found that the deposit eth wallet they gave me was not new, it received few transactions! Anyone is supposed to realize that this is a scam. How are they going to know who made the deposit if they don't give each user a new and unique deposit address?",

Similarly to what I said previously, the victims wouldn't even think of questioning or checking how this works. Despite a public blockchain, they aren't going to waste one second doing any research or thinking logically where the money comes from. Sadly, the gains is all they see.",

Crypto users should be careful to avoid such scams. Its easy to get those bot comments on youtube before they remove the video after getting a significant number of reports from legit users. So we should all report it specially from your google accounts.Coming back to the topic, I guess these type of scams propagate when a newbie wants to make money but does not to go through the grind but the easy way out. There are legit bots to help you automate the process of trading but scams are always there and if it seems to good to be true, then it is a scam when it comes to space like cryptocurrency.",

They publish a guide video and review of the Fake Ethereum MEV trading bot on YouTube and provide false proof that they have made thousands and millions of dollars from a currency through the bot they created and promoted. Then, they publish positive comments and reviews below the video to mislead viewers. What also helps the success of the scam is that YouTube does not show people’s dislikes numbers. After the victims see all this, they download the malicious tool of this fake bot .exe, into their devices; then they deposit their crypto to the deposit address of the scammer who programmed the bot. Even if the victim downloads the bot tool, opens it, and does not make a deposit, the scammer has already succeeded in hacking his computer and stealing his private keys and sensitive information if the victim ran the bot on his main computer.Therefore, many YouTube channels promote fake and scam bots. Everyone should do their research and not be fooled by what they see or download anything from unknown sources.Thank you, OP. My report has been sent to the YouTube team.",

When YouTube does not remove such videos, it can be very dangerous for YouTube users, as they may be led to believe these tempting offers, which can easily lead them to fall into the trap of these scammers. Since the video still exists on YouTube, it is possible that crypto users may fall victim to this scam in the coming days, so the crypto community should report more on this video to force YouTube to remove such videos.",
