Paying whatever major crypto. It’s seems to be the impressive one,if you had mentioned your telegram Id or mail.Someone may contact you directly,because after they had mentioned their telegram id.You need to find in this thread and you need to text on the telegram.Then he need to check your messages on the telegram id,So it will be very complicated one.My suggestion is your can include your mail id or telegram id,So the process time will take be very low.The possibility of getting the right person will be more and time efficient.You should ask their previous work of logo or HTML web page.This forum contain huge number of working people with more skills and experience.So you had made the post at the right place.Cheers!!",

Paying whatever major crypto. There are lots of prominent designers here as their names are already being mentioned by Catenaccio for your perusal. You are free to contact them for your job offer and see how you can reach to an agreement for your job to be done. You can as well try his suggestion if you want it a competitive way to get the best out of them or all other web and logo designers present on this platform.",

Am yet to post my service thread since am still working on some project.  I am interested in your job offer but i would love if all conversations and negotiations to be held in the forum as i do not prefer telegram. I like transparency in everything i do. If you don't like it that way i  think going for what Catenaccio suggested is better. As i can participate there and show my skill and talent. Goodluck in finding the right person. You can hit me up if you want to work with me.",
