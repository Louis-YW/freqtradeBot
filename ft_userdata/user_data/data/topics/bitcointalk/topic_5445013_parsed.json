Would you still invest on projects like shiba inu and floki inu. Depends, I mean in the previous bull run, the one and only meme coin, Doge was influence by Elon Musk. That's why we have a lot of meme coins that born out of it. And only Shiba has so far have that distinction of surviving at least in this bull run and keep afloat in the market.But in doesn't mean that it will have a continue success in the next bull run.So for me it's a risk to invest in this meme coins, just saying, unless you got lucky and invest early on them and so when they pump up, you will enjoy the fruits but it's a long shot, in my opinion.",

All meme coin is just created for a sole purpose of pump and dump scheme. You literally just trying your luck that these coin will pump out of nowhere due to luck if you invest on this coins. Why do you need to waste your money by risking on this garbage coins while there’s a lot of token out there that has a real utility like Bitcoin.If your concern is just the volatility, you can always use the leverage feature to scale your profitability with same capital amount.",

You can also probably tell if meme coins would pump if you see anything purposeful of the sort, like how Elon basically advertised how he liked Doge so much. Other than cases like that, I highly doubt they'd rise on their own.",

Would you still invest on projects like shiba inu and floki inu. Short answer: Definitely yes. Most of the smaller ones die and rug though.And i wouldn't recommend anyone buying shiba or doge, you can just watch the chart history and make your own conclusions. They pump with the other market. In fact some of them could pre-pump before altseason, and by doing so sort of signaling the altseaseon is near. People saying that those would die don't understand the power of memes. Young people invest in something exciting and in something suits won't. Not in boomer stocks just because they have \"real value\". Some see even btc as a boring boomercoin. And there's ton of trend makers in youngsters and lots and lots of stupid money from rich kids.",

Hmmm, I'm a little doubtful.That's what I wonder as well, like yeah sure maybe doge will go up, I am not saying it can never go up, it totally could. But is that where people want to bet their money at? I would rather have something a lot more solid, bitcoin, ethereum, bnb, those are the things that look solid and will do fine whereas making a profit based on doge? That doesn't look like a good idea at all to me and I rather not make any profit at all instead of investing into doge.I rather have it on something like USDT and just put it on staking so I would make a very little return compared to inflation, but that would still make me feel a lot more ease compared to having my money in something like doge or shiba.",

Shiba inu which was just a meme coin have now got importance as an investment. Though it is preferred for short term the investors count is high as well as it had got acceptance in different businesses. Next to that is the Floki, and I never expected such good promotion from it. Surprised to see it on one of the cricket team jersey.",

Therefore, waiting for a clear trend line in the market and to these coins' chart is required if you are aiming for them.

Recent news was that SHIB is also about to launch thier Shibarium which is for their Metaverse. A game changer if this is going to skyrocket while all of us think SHIB is still shit just as we thought ETH was back in 2016.",
