(sounds familiar lol).  I do not think free trading fees will result in trading addiction or losses.   The losses is caused by the decision of the trader to take in riskier trades in hopes of a higher profit.  And not because a person is trading in a CEX with a free trading fee.Btw, you can check this list[1] of exhanges that offers free trading fee.[1] https://www.cryptovantage.com/best-crypto-exchanges/best-no-fee-crypto-exchanges/",

Those had crazy volumes and they made a small amount off the spot trading. So an exchange like Binance can do this.Other exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini obviously can’t because they need the revenue from fees to survive. Also remember the fees might be free but there is still a spread and depending on the liquidity it might have a large spread between the bid and ask.",

In fact most times Binance gives vouchers to its users that they can apply so they can trade some pairs without any trading fees. Sometimes those promotions allows each and every user of the exchange to trade without fees. In those times there isn't a need to apply any promo code at all.I personally find such promotions as a way to attract more traders to their platform, but still that's a really good initiative taken by Binance as that helps current users a lot. I would definitely recommend you to go with Binance if you want such promotions as well a better trading experience. Their exchange is currently the top one in cryptocurrency market, and so far my experience has been amazing with them.",

We know why there is something like that, because it is to encourage traders to use their platform. So there are new exchanges that are doing a similar promotion, and you might take a risk to use their platform just to avail that zero trading fee. Just be careful not to invest large amount of money in a new platform so that if ever something bad happens, you can save your other funds.Besides, if you don't want to take risks to use unpopular platform, there are trusted platforms that make tasks for users, if they complete they will receive trading vouchers like Binance.",

My perplexity gave way to anxiety and worry as I soon began to imagine if Binance wouldn't disappear with investors (my) cash. Howbeit, it was a strategy to get traffic to its site as we can see years later. However, if I were OP I wouldn't worry so much about trading fees as I would worry about the safety of my funds. Safety comes first for me. I don't like the idea of \"penny wise, pound foolish.\"",
