  "content": "NFT is more profitable than webcamFirstly, i should tell you about the amount of earnings working as a WebCam model. Depending of cite or the type of chat, the payment varies from 1$ to 10$ (these payments relate mainly in Russia). In order to get the most ‚Äútruth‚Äù amounts, we should take mid or a bit less than mid of out numbers range, for example 3,5$ for a minute of private chat. Lets calculate: how much can a WebCam model can earn in a week?Imagine: a girl is ready to work for 5 hours a day, she got average English knowledge (for example: she knows the translation of word ‚Äúyes‚Äù or at least ‚Äúgolden shower‚Äù), and she is ready to work 5 days a week. Thus, she can earn about 300$ in a week. (Yeah, yeah, i know. Now u are sitting in front ur PC and commenting that her money is tight‚Ä¶ but in Russia she can let buy herself about 165 Big Macs). https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8f5ebc3d-c6ef-4ba4-a74f-f4ee2a25ca10/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220512%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220512T122901Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=10ad4143bd9d006cc82b15c7bea9c309787860da757764265fb527123c00dc88&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22&x-id=GetObjectFor now, we should compare her weekly earning with earnings on NFT. It‚Äôs truly hard to compare earnings in this sphere, but nevertheless after mint of ur NFT (without Virgil Abloh attraction) you can earn about 50$ for one NFT. That income is very close to WebCam models income, but if we compare busy time of each other and the amount of investments we will mint everything on our table. I doubt if anyone of my readers is wiping off dust from laptop webcam for now.https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a049bcb5-c6d1-49c7-8089-ed283fede357/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220512%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220512T122951Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=01d565e0e8dae5367567409ae69594ac87b798904d32862c005fb8131c246cc5&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22&x-id=GetObjectNot every NFT is the same‚Ä¶ just like tits.Lets take a look at NFT sales on different cites‚Ä¶We got the most popular marketplace of NFT [https://opensea.io](https://opensea.io/) Marketplace is rich in various NFTs: from cats to clothes. CryptoPunks, bears, anime- do you know connects them all? -Super sales.Marketplace [https://opensea.io](https://opensea.io/) based on Ethereum and marketplace [disintar.io](http://disintar.io) based on TON - two very different marketplaces. The first one got lots of expensive NFTs. If you enter the website, you will get increased heart rate and start to think that there is some businesses that can compete in incomes with Hot Dog food card at Wall Street. TON marketplace is mush easier for average users. TON got the same NFT, but much cheaper than on marketplace based on Ethereum. Everything is obvious between your choice: which marketplace I should choose? We don‚Äôt wanna miss the boat, so lets take our business projects from the old granddad‚Äôs country house wardrobe and convert them to ‚Äúpixel gold ore‚Äù based on TON.https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/615585e4-1035-449d-b64a-7f201aff0ccd/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220512%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220512T123041Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=fb863be5164c558df17e1f0442c3218338eafd35b9ce67779a314b6b0583864f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22&x-id=GetObjectAs we can see, everything that can interest average internet user can be sold, but it‚Äôs worth considering that it‚Äôs too hard to intrigue user with frankly boring project. I got an idea! We will sell tits. Everything will be better with tits. NFT means non fungible token. Tits got the same characteristics. Each boobs got their features. Which type of boobs do you prefer? https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/856beb52-c0e2-4499-bd9d-7d54dd0876bd/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220512%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220512T123128Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=ebff4b3f5d97128cc088da595f2e84ca727ad4dfa9dbad458e150eca540d4b1c&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22&x-id=GetObjectWe got NFT tits‚Ä¶ why do we need girls?Let‚Äôs do a little research.
