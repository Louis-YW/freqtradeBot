  "content": "This is a Must sharing happiness.Greetings all, Today seems to be the happiest day since i start to Introducing Bitcoin to friends and co-workers.Is all started when i gain Job in my province just about 30 Minutes drive to my home, I have worked for over +2 years with the local company but we always experience delay of payment either from the cashier or from bank not able to processed our payment, we always received salary from 26th to 29 or even 30th every months maximum but after my 1 year working with the company we started experiencing delays on payment processing it went forth as a thing of thought and it kept bothering the Manager despite what was going on our CEO isn't aware of the delay. As the case may be, they called a board meeting  to know why worker always receiving their payment lately and how we could overcome the delay at a point everyone was given a chance to speak and contributes how we could overcome the delay but getting to my turn i was asked what do i have to say?All i could say is that \" Sir i think is the right time we should adopt digital currency as means of payment\"They asked how do you mean? I went forth by explaining to them; We all can receive our salaries/wages through digital currenciessuch as;1. Bitcoin2. Ethereum3. Usdt4. BNBBut mostly Bitcoin would be more preferable, and the next question i was asked is that how trusted are you withthose currencies and i said %100 trusted being that you could buy and get it paid to all workers is the best and is also left for them after receiving the equivalent to their salaries to convert immediately to our local currency to maintainthe value we being paid otherwise if there's any change in market it results to either increase or decrease in value.Another interesting question that was asked then is that \" Where and how do we get those currencies\"?I replied \" we could have to buy from exchange like Binance, Huobi, Kucoin, FTX and many more\" so i was very much happy goingmore further to explain all in details, the CEO ask our cashier to download any of those mentioned exchangeand proceed the verifications with her detail. Thereafter, all workers began to ask if we have done it how do we received our payment, i simply reply for a starter you can as well download any of those exchange or you could download Trust Wallet.To cut the long story short, I introduced them to receive Bitcoin as means of payment in our work place, though pictureswould have been taken but they said for security purpose i should do away with it ( Not share any picture).So the introduction took us about +14 good days for everyone to download Trustwallet/binance app, for those who don'twant to pass through kyc only downloaded Trustwallet and i thought them how to secure their phrase/password etc..Well is really a good news to see i was able to spread the awareness of bitcoin at my work place.Note: Maximum numbers of workers is 30 including 4 security personnel 34. Thereafter, all our BITCOIN deposit address was asked and our payments were processed accordingly.For me i was Gifted additional 25% of my salary which turns to be %125 for introducing a new way to receive salaries withoutthe cashier going to bank to process our payment and as well to overcome delay payment.During our meeting i explained to them as a beginner all this including, i also open floor for them to browse more about the information given to them1. Introduction of Digital currencies                                      Max 48 hrs2. What is Bitcoin                                                                Max 24 hrs3. When was Bitcoin introduced                                            Max 48 hrs4. Why was bitcoin introduced                                              Max 24 hrs5. Founder of Bitcoin                                                           Max 4   hr6. Bitcoin wallets/Security                                                    Max 72 hrs7. Exchange (Deposit/Withdrawal, Buy/sell, P2P)                   Max 96 hrs.   As workers i think that was the only thing they need to know since                                                                                                              they are only interested in how to receive and sell off salaries.                                                                                                              anyone who needed to know can easily do his research.Is been 4 Months now but i refused to share here, reason because I wanted them to be safe and trusted the network they are usingafter that, another board meeting was called asking if everyone gets their payment correctly without any delay and they said YESi received my payment completely.. Though before then I thought them how to sell from binance p2p since we are still on restrictionto buy/sell directly from our local bank. please i beg you all to comprehend my write up as i m not a good writer but try to derive my points, actually it wasn't easy with me at some stage i feel like not carry out the class with them but as a lover ofbitcoin and adopter of it i have to put my efforts to make sure i have contributed in a way a local company in my place have started using it as means of payment, btw there were options left for some staff to choose whether BITCOIN or FIAT. 80% chooses Bitcoin as salary while %20 choose our Local FIAT. There are more to say but decided to make it simpler for me.Thank youThat was how it goesyour contributions are welcomed and more i will keep sharing some difficulties will in our meetings.",

      "body": "It is a nice initiative, but adopting bitcoin or any other crypto currencies to remove delay of payment of  salary might not be achievable because payment of salary is from the mindset of the manager or the CEO. So if bitcoin is adopted and the manager or the CEO is still having the mindset to delay the payment, your initiative is just like a waste. The best approach for such issue I believe is to either charge the management or the workers in the meeting take a bold step to tell the management to stop the delay if the workers are meeting up the demand in the company. It is when the payment is very smooth and without delay in every month then you can introduce another method and currency of payment if only the management accept it. Because it not easy for a company to accept crypto currencies if the country is not accepting it. But you can only teach them. But not telling them to accept. Most of them will not even accept it if it has not legal in the country.",

This goes to show that cryptocurrency usage is being encouraged in many real life situations rather then remaining an abstract digital tech thingy, which is used for high risk investments.Great to see that as much as 80% of the workers opted for Bitcoin as a means of payment, would have been interesting to know how many of the workers did not immediately convert them to fiat but actually chose to hold a certain amount of their earnings in Bitcoin instead.",

For your bosses, they will give you more preference now because of your valuable and working solution that you preferred to a problem.  Nice one OP, you have distinguished yourself from every other personnel employed in that office. Everyone needs to know about bitcoins, it is great that you are playing your part.",

Although every investment has its own risks and you also need to be aware that if what they receive is only a sweet profit. On the other hand, the investment will experience 2 cycles of ups and downs, so I hope you will have a sense of responsibility to provide education about the anticipation. So it's not just a plus point, but there are also things where they have to be holders when a bear market approaches.",

At least I am sure about bitcoin. I join the other users in the comments to congratulate you. I can tell that your organization is a progressive one. One thing I'd like to suggest you do during your next meeting with your colleagues is to talk about their security and privacy with regards to bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. It's very important.",

Your suggestion to use Bitcoin as a means of remuneration is innovative and I must commend you for preaching the gospel of Bitcoin. But the company must be aware of the consequences of volatility in using Bitcoin. Using Bitcoin might be counter productive when there is a drop in the price of Bitcoin especially if the company has already made projections and converted  the yearly workers salary to Bitcoin. The drop in price might cause the company to loose some of the money that was budgeted and saved for salaries. It could also turn out to be a blessing to the company if the Bitcoin market experiences a bullish trend. Just ensure the management understands the beauty and sometimes pain of using Bitcoin for transactions.",

I don't know how many are really interested, but what you've done will surely influence few people to invest into cryptocurrency. I also have the same concern, just for the delay of salary going for the cryptocurrency usage doesn't looks fair. Maybe some form of payment addition relative to service addition by the company seems to be better than initially going for salary. Because, the volatility will affect the company's financial health positive/negative. The same should not affect the company's participation in using cryptocurrencies.",

To stay out of trouble  Nearly every country in the world taxes crypto gains. Most places allow private enterprises to compensate via crypto as well. Legal tender status isn't the biggest hurdle as long as p2p transactions between consumer and sellers aren't tightly regulated. In the future the government could ban businesses from taking Bitcoin if they wanted (I imagine because they would fear tax evasion) which would eliminate crypto entirely within the jurisdiction, but that isn't likely.Most governments just hope that businesses stick with fiats.",
