By the way, you should move this to Services section instead sharing it in Services Discussion. I agree with you, the @OP should have improved his/her writing style before offering a service like this. I'm not in any way against the @OP, but I really think that he/she needs to improve his/her English writing skills before offering a service like this because clients often search for the services that offer high quality work , and if someone can't give quality to his/her own thread then we can expect that what level of quality they will be able provide to their clients.I recommend you to fix the typos of your thread and also provide some free vouch copies to the reputed members of the forum who want to test such services. If you get vouches from some reputed members then you chances of getting clients will be increased.",

To further convince people that it is indeed you typing, consider typing your username (perhaps in the URL bar) before beginning the typing test. Additionally, improving the typography of this thread would enhance your presentation. Best of luck!",

How come? if you used the word expert in your service or application you should reflect that in your application or task, it should be unquestionable, that's a very bad marketing strategy he did not proofread his post so how can his client be sure that he will deliver a good service, he did not post a sample of his work, we can forgive this typo error if we can have a sample of his work that is good enough for him to claim that he is an expert.",
