But this amount is low for any profitable APR.If you are using a wallet to try to stake and it does not work, use another wallet for it. The wallet that I know that can stake also is Trustwallet, but it is close source.",

Scroll down to the bottom of this thread, and you will see there is a button named Move topic. Click on it and then select Other -- Beginner & Help and then click on Move topic. I am not sure if there is another better section for this thread. Development & Technical Discussion also fits but it's under Bitcoin Section. Maybe you can wait if some other prominent members could suggest you a better section than Beginner & Help section. Edit: A Moderator already moved this topic to the Service discussion section. You don't have to do anything.",

You will generate a wallet on Trustwallet, backup your seed phrase. On Trustwallet, click on 'discover' and you will see a forward arrow at the right side just above some coins to stake, click on the arrow and it will direct you to lists of coins that you can stake on Trustwallet. Trustwallet is close source wallet, I only used it when I have no open source alternatives to use.Quote from: John Abraham on June 29, 2023, 06:39:36 PMMoreover, Trust Wallet was an open-source wallet back in the old days.But they are closed-source wallets now. I discourage everyone from using this.Before Binance bought Trustwallet, it was open source. Binance bought it and made it close source. Close source wallets should be discourage when there are open source ones that are available.",
