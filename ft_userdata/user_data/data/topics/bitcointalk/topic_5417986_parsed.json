What is your request, what are you looking for?Did you plan to run an auction or are you waiting just best offer?Can you retrieve please the original post/ selling topic about this piece?I think the original post got deleted, it was quite old. Im sure wheelz and or bg4 can confirm whats what if they see this post. I think i got it from an auction from minerjones if i remeber correctly, living in the vault since then since im not very active here.",

I will have to check its been so many years since I did one of them!Either way yes me and bg4 got together in person and signed these together and sealed them on site.  I had a couple and he kept a couple I believe.  Unsure how many we did but it wasn't many at all.  Less than 10 if I had to guess.",
