  "content": "QuoteRussia on Friday indefinitely halted natural gas imports to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, adding to fears of a looming European energy crisis.Energy company Gazprom, which The Wall Street Journal notes is controlled by the Kremlin, said it would not restart the pipeline on Saturday (as planned) due to an oil leak; the company also did not give an estimate as to when service might resume. The pipeline had been closed since Wednesday for maintenance.\"Until the issues on the operation of the equipment are resolved, gas supplies to the Nord Stream gas pipeline have been completely stopped,\" Gazprom wrote in a statement, per CNN.Notably, the announcement from Gazprom arrived not long after G-7 countries said they'd be imposing a cap on the price of Russian oil so as to ding Moscow (and its war in Ukraine) financially. The level of that cap will be discussed at a future meeting, the Journal notes.Europe is decently dependent on Russian gas and a blow to its supply just before winter is the last thing the continent needs, CNN adds. Plus, Moscow has already retaliated against certain European countries who refused to pay for supplies in rubles, while Gazprom has kept flows through Nord Stream 1 \"to just 20 percent of its capacity\" since June, \"citing maintenance issues and a dispute over a missing turbine caught up in Western export sanctions.\"https://news.yahoo.com/russia-shuts-off-nord-stream-213253802.html....It seems russia shut down the nordstream pipeline.More recent sources claim russia announced it will not reopen the pipeline until sanctions are lifted.QuoteRussia demands sanctions are lifted before it resumes gas suppliesRussia won’t resume gas supplies to Europe until western sanctions are lifted, the Kremlin has warned.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/09/05/ftse-100-markets-live-news-oil-russia-gas-euro/It seems that this is also part of russia's plan for ending the ukraine conflict on a faster timetable.An end to sanctions that supplies russia with components and parts may increase their wartime capability. Which could allow them to defeat ukraine faster, at lower cost and less loss of life.This seems like a topic some people might care about. So I thought I would post it.",

So I thought I would post it.I have studied this issue and can say the following. Russia is using the simple and effective tactic of the Italian strike, demanding from Siemens exact compliance with the regulations in the framework of technical work on the maintenance of gas turbines. Those turbos always guzzled oil like grandpa's old pickup truck. But before, Gazprom turned a blind eye to this, but now it doesn't. Because you can't freeze Russian money and talk openly about the economic war between the West and Russia, and at the same time demand uninterrupted supplies of something from Russia. Russia is interested in maintaining the image of a reliable supplier, but only for friendly countries, and not for unfriendly ones. And in order to stop being an unfriendly country for Russia, all economic sanctions against it must be lifted. It seems quite logical.",

The more they try to disable Russia's economy through sanctions and unfair trade policies the more Russia will bite back. Russia has been doing good for the past few months with all these sanctions in place, and is still capable of exerting some force in their war effort against Ukraine. But it seems that the West is the one being hurt by their sanctions, as Russia turned off its pipelines and now everyone is in a hurry of finding a reliable oil supplier. The Middle East and US cannot do this task in a jiffy, they need more time to amp up their production but it will take some time. Russia seems to be winning on this side of the board, but the question is how long can the two factions take this standoff?",

Nord Stream shutdowns are simply Russians tightening the screws on people they thought were their friends, but proved to be their enemies.To see Russian strength, simply search on their nuclear missile capabilities. Russia isn't fighting a war. It's simply basking in the summer sun while being pestered by 5 or 6 pesky mosquitoes, including the US.",

And people have children! All you need to do is talk your country into stopping the sanctions against Russia. After all, why was Russia supplying gas in the first place? Wasn't it fair trade... to make money for a product sold?It's rather simple. If there are sanctions against Russia, so that Russia can't trade the payments you might make for the gas you buy, for whatever products she wishes elsewhere, what's the benefit of giving you gas for useless currencies? The whole thing revolves around supply and demand...Or it did before the full force of the sanctions was felt. Since Russia gained the upper hand through the sanctions, she might be displaying her superiority, now, through cutting off Nord Stream.If you love your children, get together with friends, and promote the idea of appeasing Russia so you can get the gas turned back on. Then after you are warm, work on finding other sources of energy that Russia can't block.After all, you pay taxes, and those taxes are supposed to be used by government to guarantee you some basic benefits, including a supply of whatever it takes to heat your homes. Why pay taxes if government is going to fail you? So, get after government people to either get your tax money back, or to get them to do their job.",

As awful as it may sound, I'm in favor of lifting sanctions against Russia. Currently, we're only hurting ourselves. Europe is about to go through a massive economic recession, with inflation averaging at 10%, fuel and electricity soaring. Europe is imminent to an energy crisis due to the excessive dependency on Russian natural gas.On top of that, Russia has made great advances against Ukrainian territories, completely occupying Luhansk and slowly occupying other territories.Click on the photo below (interactive gif) to see their advancements since the start of the invasion.",

Russia has taken over parts of Ukraine, has released Crimea, has released most of Donbas, has released other areas of Southeast Ukraine. And there isn't any chance that Ukraine, even with money and weapons from other countries, is going to be able to push Russia off what formerly were Ukraine lands.Push, push, push. Lie, lie, lie. Use the media to hide the fact of Russia's wins. Even if Russia is more or less just sitting there, they have essentially already won without any more fighting except to hold what they have gained.Ukraine shrunk. Russia increased in size. Russia got more land with water access. Russia got a big fat nuclear power plant. Russia gained financially through the sanctions. Russia is being forced to solidify what could almost be called a new UN through the BRICS nations... with other nations ready to join.Did Russia really, clearly win the war? No. But it's far from a stalemate with what Russia has won so far. And nobody dares even hint at starting a nuke war with Russia. Why not? Because Russia is set up in a way that if one of its nuclear missiles flies, the rest automatically fly. And Russia nukes aren't anything to sneeze at.Essentially Russia has won, even if literal soldier-fighting appearance looks like a stalemate. However, nobody knows the future. Random happenings in the world could change this. If Russia makes a mistake with BRICS, that alliance could be destroyed. Who knows what else? But as it stands right now, Russia has won; the stalemate idea is just blabbed up joke.",

However, at this time, Europe is dependent on natural gas from Russia, and Russia is not providing said gas. This is a problem. Without gas from Russia, Europe is not going to have sufficient energy to meet the increased demand associated with the cold winter months. The timing of the shutoff means that Europe will not have time to make alternate arrangements to get gas from alternative sources.",
