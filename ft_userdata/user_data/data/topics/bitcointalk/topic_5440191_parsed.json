But as I understand, owner of this faucet put this advertisement himself and it rotates together with ''Automated Cryptocurrency Trading Software'' - another scam probably.I don't see big issue there. Not good, but we see scam advertisements at every corner. Testnet faucet isn't business, but you still need money for hosting and domain. But it's probably possible to get it by advertising something legit.",

Usually owner of website don't have much control over what is shown there. More particularly, a text ad. Like what is shown in etherscan ads iirc. Probably the site owner uses an ad service, with that kind of link uBlock or even other ad blocker (hopefully) warns user when clicking such link.",

      "body": "This is the problem of most cheap faucets in that they place advertisements for any platform, even if it is a scam, in exchange for the team of this scam platform paying them advertising fees, and the visitors and users of the faucet site are the potential victims of these malicious ads, so every beginner should stay away from using these faucets or clicking on the ads that they place so as not to lose his money, as the return that they will get from these faucets is very weak compared to the risk that they will be exposed to.Even now, and not only on faucets sites, there are also many malicious scam ads, even in search engines such as Google, in forums, in mobile applications, on social media, and everywhere, so care must be taken before believing and trusting these ads.",

It seems on my side it doesn't show any ads maybe the website owner is also here on the forum and found this thread?After checking the source code of the page it looks like it isn't a google ads but the ads came from infolinks.com this advertising company usually promotes gambling sites and skin care based on my past experienced. I think you can report this to support@infolinks.com about the scam ads.",
