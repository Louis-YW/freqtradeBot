  "content": "As we all know Bitcoin hold about 40% + of total market capitalization which is the coin with the highest trading volume both monthly and daily trading volume. Which I have no doubt that. I just came across account published today by Forbes titled  \" More Than Half Of All Bitcoin Trades Are Fake\"How on earth will they believe that. The trading volume for btc is increasing day by day on individual exchange, of a truth their are exchanges which manipulate trading volume on their exchange to draw the attention of traders, exchanges like Finexbox But that does not mean that the total daily trading volume up to 51% for btc is false. Going through trade history to total volume recorded by different exchanges, both centralized and decentralized exchanges I fine their analysis wrong. According to them  Companies like Binance, MEXC Global, and Bybit are examples of some of the largest issue areas when it comes to phony volume. Really don't know where and how they got their source and come in conclusion to this. Btc market is large and it's trading volume is a big representative of how large the coin is.",

Forbes tracked in recent months how Messari applied a volume discount ranging from 40% to 65% to Binance volume, compared with the averages reported by CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko and Nomics at the time. Messari also discounts the trading volume of FTX by a lesser percentage (less than 20%) and that of Kraken by 99%. With regards to this latter, Forbes doesn’t share the view of applying a heavy discount to a firm that is among the most regulated crypto exchanges in the world. Most exchanges going through the Messari real volume analysis, however, lack any type of volume discount.Web traffic. Forbes employs third-party data from web analytics firm SimilarWeb to heavily discount the volume of firms claiming a high trading volume without having sufficient crypto licenses and web traffic to generate such volume.Forbes interviews.

Some more than others, for example the Chinese exchanges that the Chinese government cracked down on and shut them down were reporting unrealistically HUGE volumes and were actually using it as a covert to launder large amounts of dirty money through their centralized platforms. The other exchanges are doing the same too.The thing is, you can't calculate how much of it is fake by looking at public data. You have to actually gain access to their internal private data and use that to compute the fake volume and then arrest them for money laundering.What people at Forbes are doing is simply nonsense and the article is only using technobabble to justify the numbers they reported in their FUD.",

Even noob coming on an exchanger based on the volume perspective since it holds importance of getting any coin traded quickly. This ensure fast service for them and thus they would go and spend at least couple of hundred in their tenure over an exchanger. Now, on the world wide scale this can sum up to millions of dollars getting traded and exchangers fat wallets getting even fatter!
