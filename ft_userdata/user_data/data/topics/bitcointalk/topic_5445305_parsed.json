I want to be ready for when the time comes to cash out and understand how and when I need to pay the taxes. In my opinion, you should discuss this legal matter to a local legal expert to make sure that you not violating your law in regards with tax. You should pay taxes base on the annually or on the time frame given by your government and not based on when do you feel you will cash out because you might get in trouble in case someone audit you and saw a cash balance sitting on your exchange for a long time untaxed.I’m not an expert with your law. I highly suggest to play safe and consult a legal expert.",

I want to be ready for when the time comes to cash out and understand how and when I need to pay the taxes. In the UK, the tax treatment of cryptocurrency is subject to HMRC's guidance on cryptoassets. HMRC considers cryptocurrencies to be assets, and therefore, profits made from buying and selling cryptocurrency are subject to capital gains tax.When you sell your cryptocurrency, you must calculate the capital gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. The capital gain is the difference between the sale price of the cryptocurrency and its original cost, including any fees and transaction costs.In the UK, you have an annual capital gains tax allowance, which is currently £12,300 for the tax year 2022/23. Any capital gains below this allowance are tax-free. However, if your capital gains exceed the annual allowance, you will be required to pay capital gains tax on the profits above the threshold.You will need to report any capital gains tax liability on your self-assessment tax return, which is due by January 31st following the end of the tax year. If you fail to report your capital gains tax liability or submit your tax return by the deadline, you may face penalties and interest charges.",

      "body": "I created a similar thread a while ago, but for my country, Greece. You haven't mentioned how much money you're talking about; even a mere estimate would be enough. If it's a small amount, there's a high chance no one will bother. However, I'm not sure how strict your policies are and how closely monitored your income and banking services are if you were to withdraw a large amount of money from an exchange to your account. If you are to pay taxes, you'll have to declare your capital gains and pay taxes on that amount; it should be about 10–15%; someone from the UK or a simple search may reveal the exact percentage.A few users also suggested using a P2P exchange or even splitting your profits into smaller transactions and exchanging them in person (which requires extreme caution).",
