Newbies will be permanently banned; established members may be given warnings before being banned, but the relevant posts will be deleted.AWSN26UpworkServices are added to this list when we come to believe that essentially no trades of such accounts are following our rules, which prohibit for example selling hacked accounts, accounts requiring KYC info, accounts created using stolen identities, etc. If you have a really strong argument for how you're selling these accounts without violating our rules, create a topic in Meta explaining in detail, and we may consider either removing the service from this list or giving you a one-time exemption.This list only applies to sales of accounts, not invites, codes, etc., though sales of the latter items must still follow our usual rules.",

For sure he might got more clients for seeing this post since somehow this awareness will help them to know where they can get those fake ID.",

Its like he will say thank you for the exposure.I am pretty sure* his intentions are good, it's not the first time he exposes scams. Just, like everybody, he has to learn now and then to avoid helping by mistake the scammer.Of course, since (in most cases) the internet doesn't forget, from the moment the scammer posted that, he has exposure. But now, with OP editing the quoted text and with the mods removing the scammer's post, his exposure is smaller.So let's not be too harsh on OP, mkay?* as sure as I can be about a person I only know from his actions on this forum.",

Followed with a but, quoting myself here:Quote from: DaveF on October 19, 2022, 06:46:06 PMOpinion / conjecture: Over the years a lot of people opened accounts in a lot of places with information that may not have been accurate then, or over time changed like address / license information / whatever. And unlike your bank that you by default used legit information with and knew to keep updated with the crypto exchanges they never did. Now that KYC is becoming mandatory a lot of people are having trouble verifying that they live at 1234 nowhere street. Or they moved twice since they registered with 100% legit info but now they can't prove they ever lived where they did in 2014. And so on....Going back to the motorcycle world, we had a club member have to take a few 1/2 days at work because in 2002 he bought and titled a project bike, but never registered it. Moved a few times since then and lost the title. Went through hell at the DMV trying to get a new one sent to where he lived now, not where he lived in 2001 to 2004.-DaveSo long as YOU are just trying to get YOUR money out of a service because you either did something stupid but, did not commit 'fraud', and they are making you jump through KYC hoops, I can actually see the need for people to get ID that might not be them. It's sucks and it's just about insane that you may have to commit fraud to get your money back. There are some people that will say 2 wrongs don't make a right, but at what point do you pay someone $100 to make you a fake ID, so you can get your funds out of an exchange / casino / whatever that sprung KYC on you after years of use. -DaveAnd with the 2 wrongs don't make a right; keep in mind 3 rights do however make a left for the next time you get lost in a new city that has a bunch of no left turn intersections.",
