What do you think ? What I think is that whales are not controlling Bitcoin, they can't change the nature of the project and it will remain decentralized no matter what. Whales are here to enjoy the market, that is true but being the owner of the entire crypto market. I admit that manipulations occur in the market but if we talk about the control of Bitcoin price, I certainly doubted it. We have to be aware of the market volatility and the price of Bitcoin will pump or dump normally, not because it was being planned to what will happen next otherwise, Mr. Satoshi had failed.",

The whales still manipulated to their liking, but it wouldn't exactly go according to their plan. There will be some mistakes they might make. The control of bitcoin prices is not completely manipulated by whales. We'll see. When bitcoin volatility rises, nothing can stop bitcoin from experiencing bullishness and reaching ATH. The volatility of the bitcoin price is so difficult to control that even Whales would not be able to fully manipulate it. They only apply pressure at the beginning.",

The Bitcoin halving is when the reward for Bitcoin mining is cut in half. These are some of the most important things where time has an influence on the Bitcoin price.... not the time that you have to wait for the price to recover for you to make a profit.",

Centralized exchanges are bad?Pick one topic and discuss it. Don't just throw random sentences here and there.Right now every individual is able to buy and sell BTC without centralized exchanges. Just look at the decentralized exchanges like bisq and hodlhodl. Nobody is obligated by the law to use centralized crypto exchanges.If you really have some evidence that BTC whales are manipulating the price would you mind posting it here?Bitcoin Time Machine?
