Like you want to ping your trade partner, use the platform chat box. If you want to communicate with the platform moderator for disputes, supports, use their chat box. Each platform will have a special verified badge for their moderators. Such badge is to avoid impersonators who are scammers and will try to scam users.Validate your address through a telegram group, it sounds not right. Did you visit an official site of Localcoinswap?https://localcoinswap.com/QuoteN/B:. This might not be the right board for this post but please bear with me and I will be glad if people who have used the localcoinswap to guide me please.It belongs to Service discussions (Exchanges) board.",

I also received a guy who said he was going to help me bypass the system but before then he want me to verify my account that way they wmt be able to detect any malicious activity and to do the verification I have to send some BNB to an address ( he claimed the address was generated from my coinsbit account, he got it since he wants to bypass the system) and after I send it I'll be able to withdraw after 12hrs -24hrs time.I went back to the group to verify the identity of the user but I was told that they have nothing to do with the person chatting me. (All these occured before I came to the forum)@Obari if you're not comfortable with the process there you could try another popular site. and be sure not to send any money to anyone no matter what they claim it's for.",

Murat even forgot what he experienced with LocalCoinSwap exchange in 2018 when he run the bounty for them. I believe within 5 years, LocalCoinSwap exchange had many upgrades on their platform and Murat did not follow it up over these years.",

In order to move it to another address you would need TRX in the same address which will be used as a transaction fee -- and that is how you activate an address, you just need to send a couple of TRX to it. Try looking up an address with no TRX on tronscan.org and it will be marked as \"inactivated address\"My guess is scammers are twisting some words in order to scam people.
