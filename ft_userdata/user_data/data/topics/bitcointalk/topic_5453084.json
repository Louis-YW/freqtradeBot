  "content": "Hello!I have a problem and I need your help in finding a page with stock exchange shares that functioned on the Polish market in 2010-2013, but I am aiming for 2010-2011.Well, in these years I bought Bitcoin and years later I remembered about it ...I can't remember the website I registered on at the time. I remember that the registration was in English, the site was supposedly a Polish stock market site. I had to provide my details at registration, exact details, plus a phone number, which was later required for withdrawals and used to confirm the transaction/identity. On the given page, I also had to enter a special key/password during registration, which was to be used to withdraw funds and without it, apparently, it was impossible to withdraw funds if I forgot it. There were several cryptocurrencies on the page and the page was a stock page. If I remember correctly, there were only a few attempts to enter your account password on a given page and if you forgot the password, the account was deleted/suspended after several failed login attempts. I still have the e-mail, but I recovered the password to it in 2021 and unfortunately I do not have e-mails from that period, because they were deleted automatically, and I turned off notifications on the given stock page. I also remember that a special key for my account/wallet was created automatically, which came to the e-mail after registration. To this day, I also have the phone number provided on the website, and I remember the login details, but I do not remember the website and I do not know where and where to start looking ... ;/I am asking for any help and attempt to direct, for help in finding pages, I will try to repay each person individually, it is very important to me, because you know how much a given account can be worth now...I am waiting for answers and questions that may help in direction.Thank you",

      "body": "Was it Bitomat? This is the only Polish exchange I could find from that period of time. According to bitcoin's wiki:Quote from: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BitomatThe exchange went online on April 4, 2011[1].The exchange went offline on July 26th, 2011 and on July 31, 2011 the site returned but carried the message that a system failure occurred: \"all data stored has been lost!, Including records concerning bitcoin portfolio and its backups (backups)\". Additionally, the message contained the solicitation: \"Www.bitomat.pl service is on sale\". A few days later the site reopened and trading resumed.The service was acquired by Mt. Gox on August 11, 2011[2].The site is no longer functional though: https://bitomat.pl/And according to this topic from 2011, any Bitomat account was migrated to Mt.gox database:Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=36409.0On August 11, 2011 trading on Bitomat.pl will cease and the website will be shutdown while the migration occurs. Once the migration completes, the Bitomat.pl domain will forward to a Polish language version of MtGox.com and Bitomat.pl users will effectively become Mt.Gox users.So if there's something you should be looking for, it's an email from MtGox but I think it's too late. AFAIK, the repayment registrations were closed last month:https://cointelegraph.com/news/mt-gox-repayment-registrations-closed-here-s-what-s-next",

I looked in the google archive for the pages and both pages do not resemble the appearance of the page on which I registered.The page in question had a slightly purple/gray registration background.I had to specify:Full user data (name, surname, date of birth), password twice, special key/password required for withdrawal, phone number which was needed for authorization during withdrawal.There were also other cryptocurrencies on the site, about 10 if I remember.",

The registration email was saved, but I recovered my email account in 2021 and all emails were deleted automatically...I also wrote to the e-mail service provider if there is any data from the old servers, unfortunately, but they no longer have it, because they do not archive ...I have e-mails from the period from 2017, because then the last e-mails until 2017 were deleted.I remember that after buying Bitcoin on a given site, after a few days of inactivity, an email would come saying \"Your bitcoin is calling you, please log back into your account\"I turned off the notifications on the site and logged out, started living and forgot about this account, as well as the email password. In 2020/2021 I remembered again everything when BTC went from 20 to 60k...Now I'm trying to find the website where I logged in, I remember all the account details, and the key needed to withdraw money, I have the phone number that I gave on the website, email ...Why didn't I save the address in the contacts?... ehhh I was sure that the saved e-mail would be saved.Other addresses with which I had contact (sent a message) are saved in the contacts on the e-mail. Everything else deleted and all e-mails from that period.The site was registered in English, I'm not 100% sure that it was a Polish site, but I know that after logging in to the account, the menu was Polish and it was possible to change languages.Menu could be on the same color like here on this site. But im not sure 100%I deposited the Polish currency and converted it to the dollar and bought BTC with it.The site probably also had a stock exchange, cryptocurrencies at the moment there was a maximum of 10 I think.",
