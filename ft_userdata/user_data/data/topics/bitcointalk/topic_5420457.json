  "content": "I don’t mean the specifics of the code on this device.  More like the basics of how any/every offline wallet works.  I presume they are all fundamentally similar.  Kind along these lines:1) I decide to send some coin and enter the command on my Windows 11 computer with the wallet connected.  Let’s say the transfer is from wallet_send to wallet_receive.  Yes, I do realize, or think I do, the transfer is between bitcoin addresses identified on wallet_send and wallet_receive.2) wallet_send, really the Trezor app on my computer, builds a message containing some kind of public key / hash that can only come from me and my wallet and uniquely identifies the bitcoin address controlled by this wallet.  The message also contains the address to be transferred to.3) The bitcoin network checks out the specifics and decides the transfer request is valid.  The network moves the bitcoins from send to receive.4) Sometime later ( how much later? ) my computer / wallet_send gets a response verifying the transfer.And then5) How does wallet_receive learn that its bitcoin address has received the goods.  Must it be on-line at the time of the send?  I suspect not.  So how long after the send can it be put online and get the message.  Or maybe, when I connect any wallet to my computer the Windows 11 app gets the addresses controlled by the wallet and queries the bitcoin network for the quantities held in those addresses.Thank you for your time and patience.",

It is like a special key, which you use to sign/authorize transactions. Basically, software on your computer creates an unsigned transaction that contains all the necessary information. The transaction is sent to a hardware wallet device, which signs it and sends it back to the software application, which then broadcasts it to the bitcoin network.",

This is how an address can hold multiple different batches of bitcoin from multiple different transactions, but you can still choose which of these to spend at a time.However, the underlying principle remains the same. Your wallet software will build a transaction which includes specifying which bitcoin it wants to spend, specifying which address(es) to send them to, specifying how much to send to each address, and some other important data you don't need to worry about, such as a version number and a locktime. It also includes a signature for each input you are spending. The signature varies somewhat depending on the type of address you are spending from, but essentially is created with the private key from that address. It is easy for other users to verify, but impossible for them to forge. The presence of this signature allows other users to verify that you do indeed own the private key necessary to spend the coins you are spending, without revealing anything about the private key itself.Quote from: bkelly13 on November 11, 2022, 02:36:39 AM3) The bitcoin network checks out the specifics and decides the transfer request is valid.  The network moves the bitcoins from send to receive.Essentially, yes.Quote from: bkelly13 on November 11, 2022, 02:36:39 AM4) Sometime later ( how much later? ) my computer / wallet_send gets a response verifying the transfer.Within a few seconds of broadcasting the transaction, you should be able to see it appearing on the network as unconfirmed/zero confirmations.Quote from: bkelly13 on November 11, 2022, 02:36:39 AM5) How does wallet_receive learn that its bitcoin address has received the goods.  Must it be on-line at the time of the send?  I suspect not.  So how long after the send can it be put online and get the message.Next time that wallet software connects to a bitcoin node or server via the internet, it will ask for updated balances and transaction history for all its addresses. It does not need to be online at the time, but again, should be able to see the transaction appearing as unconfirmed/zero confirmations within a few seconds. How long the transaction takes to confirm depends on the fee it pays and the number of other unconfirmed transactions competing for block space.",

Once a valid transaction has been broadcast to the network, then it is shared throughout all the nodes on the network and will eventually be included in to a block by a miner. Neither the sending party nor the receiving party needs to be online at any time for this to happen. Whenever one of those parties comes back online later, their wallet software will sync up with what happened with the blockchain while they were offline and will show the updated balances and transaction history.",

The recipient (wallet_receive) gets notified of an incoming but still unconfirmed transaction. At this stage, the transaction is not considered to have been completed yet. It's still unconfirmed and not yet finalized. There is a chance for it to be double-spent and moved to a different address. The transaction from your wallet_send goes to the mempool/mempools of the node/nodes that your software client is connected to. Only when a miner picks it up and includes it in the next block, your transaction will get its first confirmation. If nothing happens to the block your transaction got included in (it gets orphaned), that's when the recipient can consider having control of those coins. If something happens, we just go back to the waiting game of having the transaction included in a new block again.",
