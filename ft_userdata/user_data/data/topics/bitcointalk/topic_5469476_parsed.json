Enhancing these two facets has the potential to foster a sense of collective responsibility for addressing wrongdoing among the populace.",

      "body": "Going with your question op, I think there is a factor you didn't mention and it surpass all those three you have mentioned and that is wisdom. All those you have mentioned are summed up into wisdom.If a leader has wisdom then fear of doing the wrong things against the right things will envelope him. Take for example in the bible, Solomon asked for wisdom to lead Israelites and God granted it to him. Can you imagine the wisdom of King Solomon in the biblical story of the judgement of two women claiming to be the mother of a baby boy, 1kings 3: 16-18. It is wisdom to suggest that kind of judgement that the baby to be splitted into two halfs to be given to each of the women for peace to reign, and it was easy for the woman who is not the mother to accept such judgement because she was envious of the the mother, like if I can't have the baby then she shouldn't but the real mother couldn't behold her baby dying not to talk of splitting and the reai mother was known by such a wisdom.So above all whether good education, age, experience or whatever have you, wisdom against wrong is paramount in sincere leadership and African leaders are beclouded by politics of selfishness. Even when they finally select themselves into the dreaded office, they still move around with nepotism, religious affiliations and inclination, that leads to self centeredness, embezzlement with impunity because of the nepotistic leadership and government, no punishment or justice for political thieves and that is why they are usually found guilt when they leave the shores of Africa.",

One of the most important elements for success is the ability to establish alliances according to interests, which is never an easy thing in a reality that is difficult to manage.",

Experience is also important since leadership positions are not easy positions to occupy, but a leader without experience but leadership qualities can be allowed if he will surround himself with assistance that have good experience. For education, some level of education is important as a leader to lead educated people, but in an uneducated place, education may not be important, some other things like physical strength may be the most important.",

There’s a believe that an educated leader will bring new innovations and embrace technological advancement in the society which will make the country better for all. Even the monarch leaders today are been selected by the level of the education they’ve acquired in order to be considered for such positions. QuoteWe've seen others who are very old but believe they need to rule at certain leadership position before retiring and in so doing got the whole system messed up with ancient leadership patterns that had grown obsolete.Those owning leadership to age are not to be regarded as good citizens that wants the progress for their country. But just after their selfish interest. Leadership position is not a birthright of any family and so choosing someone there should not be base on age but other more important factors.QuoteSome served in different positions in the past but with there wealth of experience, when divine vital position make a whole mess of the opportunity divine to them to serve.Considering all these and the kind of leader that the world needs to face it technological advancement, should age, experience or education be the key index for ascertaining who would make a good leader?Education and experience should be the two factors to consider out of the three you mentioned when choosing a leader to lead its people.

On the other hand, some education is also important, it is not completely essential for a good leader to surge, but it helps much.There has been several leaders in this continent who have not had much of a formal education and yet, using their experience and talent, they managed to get quite far, unfortunately many of them may be considered to be negative leaders (specially in politics).There are more positive cases in Europe and USA.",

I will always prefer a young leader who will put in his best to governance without restrictions brought by age. Experience and education are important but they are not the main qualification. The most important attribute of a leader is selflessness. The ability of a leader to put his country and citizens first in all his decisions is the most important quality of a leader. Even if the leader is not educated or experienced, he can have advisers or a cabinet that can give him all the information he needs to make sound decisions. If these advisers know that the leader wants to develop the country, they will always give him good advice. A selfless leader will not be corrupt because he puts his people first. In my country, we have had many educated and experienced leaders but they failed to give the nation good leadership because they were corrupt and selfish.",

Among many other things good leader also needs proper empathy and social skills to understand how to form optimal teams, and what those workers need to be most effective. Understanding strengths and weaknesses of each team member could be a key to make good team a great team. Age necessarily doesn't carry any value, since lots of people don't want to grow up of to learn from mistakes.But if i had to choose from all those, i would chose experience.

Like we put into example corporate jobs, managerial and other leadership positions are given to the ones that have experience and education. And we mostly see these positions are given to the direct proportionate with the age. Although leadership isn't just all about your achievement in studies it still has a factor and plays a role for someone who will be hired for that position. And if we're talking about the leadership of an entire country, there are other factors that many are considering but mostly, this is all about the experience and proven track of record that should be visible that the person is capable of taking over that position and shows responsibility. So, there is more than that if we'll put them in place, whether it's on the corporate, politics or in some organizations.",

This is why most systems and organisations fail. The experienced leaders which most times are old men and women lead the people the way it has always been. Still the old ways of doing things because they met their predecessors do it that way. No room to try new ideas, no innovation.  Maybe there might be a slight differences. The young minds are innovative.  So full of ideas they can't wait to explore. I have been in organisations where the experienced leaders led the people for years.  Nothing changed during these period, it was a boring era. When the mantle of leadership was handed over to a young and vibrant fellow,  the positive impact was felt both within and outside the organisation. Same applies to the society at large.A young, vibrant and educated leader is a goal getter.  Experience can come while on the job. After all, all the experienced folks started from somewhere.",

Even in a democratic setting, the leaders should possess all the good qualities we want but they also be good people. Compassionate people, who genuinely care about the people they lead. The worst leaders are always very wise and educated and also wicked, selfish, and greedy. People that won't want to do evil even if they can get away with it.
