Checking your post history, I saw you already get some loans and paid out them on time or so.what's interesting to me, you repaid the loan and then just after 3 days ask for a new one. In the last three months, you take more than 10 short time loans, why don't you take out a loan right away for a long time, one month for example?Also, almost always shasan accepts your loan request, why now you open a special topic for a new one, why not just ask in his thread as in previous times?note: it's not my intention to spoil anything for you here, it just seems unusual to me the way you ask for loans.",
