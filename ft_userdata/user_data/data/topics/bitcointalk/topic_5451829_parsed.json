  "content": "Introduction:Welcome back to the Cypher devlog! Over the past weeks, we've been working diligently on the consensus algorithm, preparing it for the upcoming integration of our unique Proof of Reception (P.o.R.) mechanism. We've also migrated our Docker image to better support block storage. In this post, we'll discuss these updates and provide a preview of our upcoming focus on block storage and the testnet launch.Consensus Algorithm Progress:We have made substantial progress in developing the consensus algorithm for Cypher. Although not yet complete, it will serve as a base layer for the P.o.R. implementation. The main difference between the current consensus and P.o.R. lies in the forger selection process for block creation. In the current consensus, a random node in the network is selected, whereas P.o.R. will select the node with the best Proof of Reception.Docker Migration:In preparation for block storage, we've migrated our Docker image from an Ubuntu base image to the MySQL base image. This change will provide better compatibility and support as we move forward with the implementation of block storage.Upcoming Focus and Testnet Launch:In the coming weeks, we will concentrate on block storage development. Once completed, we will launch the first testnet for the production version of Cypher. It's important to note that this initial testnet will focus on testing the blockchain components, not the messaging components. The messaging components will be introduced and tested in a subsequent phase.Conclusion:Our recent progress on the consensus algorithm and Docker migration brings us closer to our goal of building a decentralized live-messenger powered by the unique P.o.R. mechanism. As we continue our work on block storage and move towards the testnet launch, we appreciate your ongoing support.
