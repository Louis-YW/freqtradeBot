  "content": "Vitalik just gave his view on the FTX issue and makes a bold cooperation with MTGox on a Twitter postHe also made a point regarding CEX's and DEX's where we can check his discourse is blinded by the concept of centralization. He argues that \"the two act as a substitute for some kind of service. He noted that while DEXs can be used for cross-crypto trading, custody, and even leverages, they are currently unable to â€œfunction as a fiat-crypto gateway.\" This is basically saying that DEX's rely on centralized services to fulfil the interests of the network which is basically that there is no decentralization without a centralized aspect to have it functional...Well, IMHO, the guy represents regulatory pressure; his mind and position are already clouded by a centralized vision of crypto networks to avoid things such as what happened with FTX. Ok, so yeah, I can actually understand that regulation can bring more security to the user, but at what cost??? and where the decentralization concept fits within this matter??? We already saw how Eth went... I see this as a dangerous discourse and total support to pave the way to get all cryptos (including BTC) under a POS rule.Am I crazy, or is this what actually going on?",

      "body": "The regulation in the context didn't come at the cost of decentralization. It's on another different layer, whereas what should centralized entities do and don't. People still have a choice whether they want to use a centralized contained ecosystem or purely choose the decentralized way.The things that Ethereum became easier to be controlled by a few is due to how the ecosystem evolved, it will stay the way it is, and those who want to participate in a decentralized manner should stick with what Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency offer. Regulation will come sooner or later, especially to regulate CEX, but they will barely force bitcoin node operators to fork into POS.",
