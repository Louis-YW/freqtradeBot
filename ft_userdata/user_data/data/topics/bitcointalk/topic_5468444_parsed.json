Dice game, I’m a total sucker on this game because of the pressure on choosing which side to bet(under or over) and whethere if I will increase bet or not. This game is really sucker for me. I change my game now to roulette, craps and occasional sports betting which I have confidence on placing bet due to the live of the game I’m betting unlike dice which I’m just imaging things hoping to see green on my bet history to confirm my win.I try playing couple slot games but I stop already because I never hit huge multiplier while my bankroll is already cut down to huge percentage without getting any good return.",

I gambled with soccer betting that is the game I am very familiar with and my preferred choice in betting because I was a former player as well as watch the game week in week out thus it becomes very easy to choose a particular type of bet related to soccer betting, therefore I had sticked with it for many years and I am not ready to change to other form of gambling which won't guaranteed a regular winning streak, the fact that there are different aspect of soccer betting which can provide income is another added advantage which won't prompt me switch over to another game, there is both team to score, over and under, correct score, etc.",

      "body": "If we talk about my playing experience the first time entered an online casino with a crypto base was slots and from there I had several first wins with amounts that were quite satisfying for me when could still be called beginner.Currently I am sure that slots are still one of the most popular games and have many fans even though they don't necessarily get wins or profits but they still come back to play again.After all not all gamblers only like one game and when one game cannot make a profit they will move to another game and try their luck in a different game.After slots I tried roulette and poker as games that might be quite fun to play when have lost from slots but poker is the main thing because there are several skills that must be used to win.Until now the only things I still have tried several times are slots and poker but roulette after realizing that it really does waste money quickly has and I chosen to abandon the roulette game.",

I'm basically the type of person that believes in trying out so many options so my decision was not because I lost so much in sports, although switching to another type of sports betting was a bit hard especially as I couldn't relate with casino games as the beginning. What I believe is gambling is a thing of chance and some feel a sport is not favorable and when they switch to another, that fetches them winnings, they then believe the first sport was not for them. Nah, I think every sport has its winning days, and it's not tied to only one.",

      "body": "Initially I was attracted to betting on tennis and soccer and I was making profit though I also encountered several losses due to some unforeseen defeats from some teams that was picked but losing a huge amount in tennis I made up my mind to focus on soccer gambling (football) alone for now since it is the only type of gambling that I have recorded most of my big wins. Now to answer the question of the op on how long I didn't win before stopping a particular game to move to another one, I think in my days of playing tennis, my target is to always record a win at least twice or thrice in a month but I lost in a whole month and the last amount I staked that I lost made me to stop doing anything that has to do with tennis.On the football betting, it's one of the gambling I started off with aside tennis and am still enjoying soccer betting till date because they amount I have won is far bigger than the amount I have used to gamble and since my aim of gambling is to make profit I decided to stick to what works for me and soccer gambling has been amazing since the very beginning.",

Sport has become my favourite due to the number of bets I win in daily since it is easier for me to easily forecast a football match and which team has the winning chance from the way they both play.",

Started to play seriously with poker, but then pandemia hit, and i had to play online. It wasn't as fun and i kept making mistakes because of frustration. Then i went to slots, made some money and got exited about those. They were way cooler than physical slots i used to play when i was younger. And the jackpots were way higher, even though they were most likely impossible to get, they were there.So while i was making money on and of and naturally at some point i made more losses. But it took a lot of money to find something else. So i tried betting sports. Turns out it's more boring then i would like it to be, unless i am betting on something i know about and watch that on tv. But i am not that into sports that i would like to watch them for hours to know the score. I might make some money with sports but i am really not so into that.So i came back to slots and house games. This time just for fun and winning is a nice bonus. But i am not in any way counting on winning. I play with smaller bets and i have a system and a budget so i won't spend more than i afford.If i get bored to this i'll find somehing else again. Maybe i'll go back to poker tournaments now that pandemic is over. Those just take so much of my time.",

Gambling had gives your own story based on the years you had involved in the gambling.My first game was dice,even now dice was my favourite game.I had an habit of using twenty percentage of may deposit money into the dice game.The key factor behind the dice was,the dice game doesn’t need a tactics or strategy like the poker game in the gambling.If you get the mind of quit of gambling at any point,you should pause the gambling at that time.The game without the wish or force game is not the good one.So resume the gambling after you get the good mindset in the gambling,which give you good profit in the game.",

      "body": "Is what you are asking about all types of gambling games? If yes, there is actually a lot to share based on experience. the first, is Baccarat. This game is more tense than any game IMO. I even spent the contents of the savings I collected in one year. This type of game is very simple and you don't need to wait long to win. just like blackjack, roulette and several other games. however, of all the ones I like that are luck based are Bacarrat. It cannot be denied that I have won large amounts in just a short time. As usual, the Martingale technique has always been very popular. at the point I lost what I had built for a year, finally completely quit gambling within a few years.Another experience, I like playing slots. If there is a game that I like more, I will play it until I get bored, whether I win or lose. However, at certain points, I have to save more financially because of my responsibility for my family's needs.Now, I just play as casually as I can. I like football betting more because apart from other types of gambling, I have also liked football for a long time, this bet gives me more chances of winning than losing. at least, it can minimize losses.",

Then because I was bored while playing poker, I tried playing slot machines, and it turned out to be more fun so I left poker and started playing slot machines.

It is more of a group game. I prefer slot because it matches my personality. It is just me and the machine. I don't like to talk while I am gambling. What I have done with slots is that I have changed the theme on the slots I play. I do it frequently. I do it base on how I feel at the moment. Today, I played movie slot theme.",

Also the roulette which I love in the last couple of years.It's not that I lost my love on playing slots, I still do play them from time to time. However, if I go to traditional based casinos, I usually go for baccarat, it's more fun and the chances of winning increases as compare to slots. But for roulette, it's the excitement and adrenaline rush to bet one single number and see how your luck goes. But at the end of the night, you still enjoy, entertainment yourselves and have a good time specially if you play with your friends.",

I know that slots is very hard to win, but I have success on playing with some of Hacksaw and other slots provider so I just stick with it even if the outcome is bad for days. If that is the case then I just go with sports betting. Any sports that I know, then I will put some bet and see if my string of bad luck will end or will it continue. For sure there are a lot of slot guys here and maybe we have the same reasons, it's fun and if you are lucky enough, with just a few dollars or even a max bet, you can win big and very happy about that bonus rounds or seeing a lot of wildcards raining on the reel.",
