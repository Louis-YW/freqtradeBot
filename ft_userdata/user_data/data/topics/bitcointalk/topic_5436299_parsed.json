  "content": "There are not many open source Bitcoin wallets and even less of them for other cryptocurrencies, but recently I saw one called Stack wallet and I didn't saw anyone talked about it in forum.I decided to install Stack wallet and make a quick test to see if it is any good or not.Website stackwallet.com is saying that Stack is open source privacy-preserving cryptocurrency non-custodial wallet, and it supports Bitcoin, Monero, Bitcoin Cash, Firo, Epic Cash, Namecoin, Wownero, Litecoin, and Dogecoin.Installation was quick, I was asked if I want privacy or regular mode (with coingecko prices), and for each coin I have to create new wallet, add name and generate seed words.You can select your own Bitcoin node, and there is built-in exchange in wallet, but I think they are using some third party centralized exchanges.Stack wallet have backup option but this is NOT compatible with any other bitcoin wallets, so I suggest keeping seed words instead of custom backup.I didn't receive or send any transactions with Stack wallet, but this could be alternative if you want to keep few shitcoins along with Bitcoin as pocket money, don't use this wallet for larger amount of coins.Stack wallet github page is available but I still didn't saw anyone confirming if their code is verified by wallet scrutiny or someone else:https://github.com/cypherstack/stack_walletFrom my short testing  I can say this is not a bad wallet, but alternative called Unstoppable wallet looks and works much better for me.Another alternative open source wallet is called Cake wallet, that is oriented more towards Monero, but Bitcoin and Litecoin are also supported.Did anyone else tried this wallet and what do you think about it?",

Can the Stack wallet recover wallets created by other BIP39-compatible bitcoin cliets?When you want to create a bitcoin wallet, it will generate you a BIP39 seed phrase which I used iancoleman to check if true or not. For each coins, it will generate you different seed phrase which depends on the coin of your choice that you select, you can only select one coin, no box available to check the coin of choice to make it a multi currencies wallet for a single seed phrase, it is different seed phrase for each coins.Another type of backup is the file backup which can be 'auto backup' which backup your wallet data every 10 minutes on default but you can select other time range for the backup. The other is 'create manual backup' which is also the backup of the wallet files but just  in a way no automatic saving of wallet data every 10 minutes or the time chosen.File backup can restore all the wallets (bitcoin and including all altcoins wallets) that you generated on the wallet app, unlike seed phrase, one seed phrase for one coin wallet, another seed phrase for another coin wallet. So both backup can be necessary to people. The file backup is encrypted.Quote from: Pmalek on January 22, 2023, 11:59:41 AMToo bad, that's the main thing. It would be like deciding what car to buy, but without giving it a test drive. Any information about coin control, UTXO selection, or the liberty to enter your own fees? If no comment about this, I will find a free time to review the wallet more and give answers to these. If it has fee customization, I still doubt it would have coin control because most wallets do not have it.",

I don't want to sound like I am protecting instant exchanges or any other exchanges for that matter, but for the accuracy of the information, it's not the exchange that blocks your coins and asks for KYC. It's one of their trading platforms they work with to facilitate those swaps. ChangeNOW just informs you, hi KYC is necessary because that's what their partners asked them. For an instant swap to happen, multiple transactions take place in the background that the end-user doesn't see and doesn't need to know about. Transaction 1: Your deposit to the swaps platform.Transaction 2: The swaps platform transfers coins to a liquidity provider.Transaction 3: The liquidity provider exchanges coin A to coin B.Transaction 4: Coin B is sent back to the swaps platform.Transaction 5: The swaps platform sends the coins to your address.I am not sure about the last step. Maybe the 3rd-party sends the coins directly to your address. Anyways, there could actually be more transactions if you are exchanging two unknown altcoins one for the other and there is no such trading pair available. In that case, the instant exchange would first need to have its partners swap the unknown coin for something familiar like BTC, USDT, or ETH, for example, and then get the asset you want in the following transaction.  In fact, that's the same way that swaps work on some of the services on Ledger Live or Trezor Suite. If you open the native apps, read the TOS, or initiate a crypto to crypto swap, you will come across information that 3rd-parties might ask you to verify your identity. Sometimes it works without it, other times it doesn't. It probably depends on the amount and the history of the coins.   Quote from: Charles-Tim on January 24, 2023, 01:01:50 PMIncluding passphrase to generate different keys can be of people's preference, just like I have implied before, not using it can make some people to feel insecure as they keep their seed phrase offline...
