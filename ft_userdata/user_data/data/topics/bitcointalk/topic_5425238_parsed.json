Really it is an interesting forum.I find it very interesting that you heard this forum from social media! I guess that the popularity of cryptocurrencies have skyrocketed in the past years given that this forum is relatively famous. Anyway, congratulations on starting your journey here, OP!Yes you are right- there are forum ranks present but they are used primarily for signature campaigns. A forum rank does not entirely determine if a person is trustworthy or not, so exercise your discretion well if you are planning on investing and someone messages you visiting some shady links, etc.If you do not know anything about cryptocurrencies, then this is the best place for you start. I also recommend watching various guides in YouTube in order to understand and get an overall grasp on how cryptocurrencies work.",

There is really no incentive to stay at first sight. In the beginning, it requires some passion and curiosity, and perhaps users who are accustomed to communicating with others on forums can distinguish the different elements and integrate with them easily. And with more time spent on the forum, that passion will become accustomed, and it will become much easier to navigate between sections of the forum.",
