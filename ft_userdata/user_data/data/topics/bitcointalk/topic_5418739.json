      "body": "HelloSince trust building will take some time, I'm looking for a long term relationship.I would like to shift some of my stock portfolio into BTC. Since I think regulation will become stricter, I want to buy BTC with a \"clean\" history.Why I don't just buy BTC on a centralized exchange?Sometimes centralized databases gets hacked. I don't want my name address leaked to the public.Why I don't use other peer to peer platforms?I used Localcryptos once and Bisq very often. Bisq has a safety deposit for buyer rand seller. This weeds out scammers and saves you time weeding out scammers.However on Bisq you can't see which kind of BTC you will buy. You can just buy from everybody once, check the history and then buy repeatedly coins form sellers offering good history. Even if you go through all this effort the mulit-signature-wallets for trading in Bisq leave distinct traces on the blockchain tainting your Bitcoin (search for: chainalysis-kyt).I even got freshly mined Bitcoin on Bisq (for 2% premium). However buying those BTC alters their history (Blockreward + P2P Trading).I'm not here to discuss frangibility of Bitcoin. If you are a miner and think Bitcion is fungible, just be happy to sell them to me for a premium.I would also swap freshly mined BTC for more regular BTC: You pay me 1 virgin BTC, I pay you 1.03 regular BTC. (obviously in smaller steps to build up trust first).",

They are fungible.1 cake = 1 cakeNow person with gun says: \"If you eat the left cake, I will shoot you. If you eat the right cake, you can live\".Now both cakes stopped being fungible, since you value your life.(1 cake + dying) is less valuable than (1 cake + living).Other example: Equal land also has different value created by zoning laws.Quote from: LoyceV on October 30, 2022, 08:14:31 AMBut if you give a bank robber $90k for his stolen $100k, you become an accessory.In my previous peer to peer trading on Bisq I paid between 100% and 105% in fiat for every 100% in Bitcion, so a bad source is not obvious from the price.In my Peer to peer trading I can't see the origin of the coins before I buy. Even after buying the origin is not fully clear to me, but in 70% of trades I can now make pretty educated guesses about the source.Bad source tends to be cheaper 100%-103%, while good source tends to be around 102%-105%. Quote from: LoyceV on October 30, 2022, 08:14:31 AMThis sounds like an exit scam waiting to happen.Thanks for the warning. I am aware that my way is risky as well as more time consuming. Bisq solves the trust issue with a deposit. I was never cheated on Bisq.",

No. But I don't have the guns so I don't make the rules.In many cases it is possible to interfere with fungibility, if it benefits the people in power.So is it beneficial for the rulers to attack fungibiltiy of Bitcoin or not?Probably yes.

Best to close our gate. But if we can't manage to close our gate I will hide in the basement.\"You say: \"Quiet, you only destroy confidence in our caste.\"We don't have a confidence problem, we have an open gate problem.The fungibility issue of Bitcoin is not a issue solved at the marketing level or the social shaming level. It is solved on a software engineering level and on the level of Bitcoiner group coordination.Shaming people to talk about the lack for fungibility, interferes with recognition of the problem, interferes with the group coordination in the Bitcoin community to improve fungibility and delays our response to close the gate, while already being under attack. I can respect solution ❶ and ❷ I can understand solution ❸❶ Coinjoins❷ Monero❸ virgin BitcoinBut trying to solve an engineering problem on the marketing level is harmful in my opinion.",

Money is fungible, houses are not.Used cars are not fungible by nature, they differ in too many important attributes.Land (similar location, similar soil quality) is fungible by nature, but violence breaks its fungibility.Without government land with the same quality and a similar location would be fungible.Turning land allowed for growing trees into land allowing for growing crops increases its value 5x.Allowing houses to be build on the same land increases its value 100x. It is the same land in the same location.So why does the land become more valuable, if the government allows you to build a house? It is not because of the soil quality. It is, because if you build a house without building permit the government will destroy your house and fine you.Even the same chemical molecule can by (i) a licensed medication or (ii) a street drug. It has the same properties in terms of biology and in terms of chemistry. But it has still different prices and different legal standing. Being very similar by nature is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for fungibility.Who would buy Bitcoin for 5% discount from a OFAC-sanctioned Bitcoin address and risk 30 years of prison? I wouldn't. I guess most wouldn't. https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm556I see the slippery slope, today Iran, tomorrow Russia, day after tomorrow the unvaccinated are blocked form using Bitcoin. But do I have the power to change it?Still maybe better to stop this topic, before I get banned. I do some contributions in the German subforum outside of the fungibility discussion and I value the high quality feedback on the forum.",

It is solved on a software engineering level and on the level of Bitcoiner group coordination.I apologize if you think I'm trying to shame you, my goal is to educate you.  But again, this statement causes me to think that you don't understand fungibility.  The fungibility of bitcoin is not in question, the software has indeed been engineered to provide fungibility, and it's quantifiable.  The only thing that can hurt bitcoin's fungibility is our own capitulation to government attempts to \"taint\" some bitcoin.Governments power is provided by the people, not the other way around.  We obligate governmental laws that help to keep us safe, so those who commit crimes are punished, or otherwise deterred.  The use of bitcoin (any bitcoin,) in and of itself is not a crime.  The abuse of power, however is criminal, and should be treated as such.",
