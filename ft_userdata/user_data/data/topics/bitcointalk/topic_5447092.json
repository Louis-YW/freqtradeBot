  "content": "Edit: It was fun but, I didn't enjoy it like the last time we did. Hey Guys!As you know, Bitcointalk.org now needs to solve Captcha before you make any posts. As You can see, a lot of people have already been tagged as spammers (Including me). So, I thought why not search for a solution? I had to deal with forum administration about it. I got limited supplies of coins from Forum. Now, I am the official seller of this Coin. All you need is to pay me $1 for each coin you want and your forum credentials. Â Remember, I got very limited supplies. The coins will be sold on a first come first get basis. You may get banned for not buying coins from me since I am the only Official Seller. You may hire escrow if you want, but you have to pay the escrow fee. The only escrow is PowerGlove as he can verify the Coins Transactions.The price list is below. 1 Coin = $1 10 Coin = $8 50 Coin = $30 100 Coins =$ 50 (50% off)Cheers!",
