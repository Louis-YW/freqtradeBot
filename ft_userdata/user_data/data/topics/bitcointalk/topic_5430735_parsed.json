By the way, have you ever sent PM to either of those two, with arguments why you think there should be a Pakistan local board, or at least to give you some criteria that you have to meet?Needless to say that I think that you deserve local board as well but even if you don't get it anytime soon, at least you know now that it is still possible, as long as you keep your local thread active as you have been doing for some time.",

If Nigerias in the forum were patient enough to have their local board then you can also apply the methods and the approaches used by the Nigerians to achieve theirs. Your application has been seen by theymos and other higher rank members. One thing I discovered from the approval of the local board is the activeness of the particular local members and the total number of active members in the local thread.

As we all know the benefits of the separate board rather than the Thread. As shahzadafzal mentioned our activity is better or at least close to Nigeria, Point is it's hard to catch up on all sorts of information from the same page as there is a political discussion, economic, and sometimes news & updates too so in such type of discussion most of time important content got skipped and feedback experience also got spoiled. As always Shahzadafzal leading the way, I think many other community members will share their experiences soon.Board is much help as we all know that so why not, it can boost education and activity in the community. I think it's a fair-time request.  Almost all of the Pakistani members are interested in their own local board so let's see how much time it takes, we are ready to do our best.",

This is an aspect that affects many local boards. There are many users who, despite being from a particular country or language, end up not participating in that country/language board. Perhaps because of the aspect you mentioned, because they think it has greater privacy or repales.I think this shouldn't happen on a forum like Bitcointalk, although unfortunately I know it happens.In turn, I don't think it's the fact that it only has 18 active users, clearly, that prevents them from having a local board. Those 18 can be much more active than the 70 of other cadres (I'm not saying that those 70 participate little).",

Lets talk about the activeness of our local users on the general forum, you can take a look at the names on the table, alot of them are quite productive on the general forum and Nigeria like thread are filled all over the forum. You guys should come together and make some quality noise for yourself and try to encourage other native users to engage on your thread and carry your total engagement up in regards to users contributing to the thread instead of posts been made. Goodluck on your request, make it a little less competitive but appealing. There you CryptopreneurBrainboss. Sorry if you felt this way it wasn't supposed to be a competitive comparison but an exemplary one.You are right there are active members for us too but they are afraid to identify as Pakistani due to the fear of being discriminated against.Regarding the definition of active members I included only members which are active in last couple of months on our Pakistan Thread only, not bitcointalk overall forum and If you notice I did not even included the creator of Pakistan thread Abdussamad (OP) himselfAbdussamad (Legendary)   Last Active:   December 13, 2022But I didn't include him since he's not participating in local discussion.If I start finding Pakistani users on forums active (but not posting on Pakistan thread) I'm sure I can cross 100.However some user you included I will consider them inactive for example Soldierswitlittlefaith  Last Active:   September 19, 2021Theoboy  Last Active:   November 21, 2021nelson4lov  Last Active:   April 18, 2022Traderbtcc   Last Active:    April 16, 2022So if you ask me a fair comparison of active members is 29 vs 52And this has been consistent for the last few months ... not that bad if you agree?Quote from: Rikafip on November 18, 2022, 08:19:17 AMNumber of active members per local board during October 2022So please I will request for your support too, I know it is difficult for us but let's have patience for each other, let's learn something for other communities. (P.S. It's a truth that Indian, Pakistani, Bengalis will never support each other and the same goes to African people too. We never support each other but we are always ready to point fingers.)",

As shahzadafzal mentioned that he Just included those members who are most active from previous months consistently and as far it is concerned i think there many Pakistani members on the Forum but they are not active on the Thread even dear i know that 70% of Pakistani members don't even know that there is a Particular thread for Pakistani community just because it's in the other languages section.But i would prefer now that Theymos should give us a chance to us as there are many in-active boards but we are active ones so let's see I am pretty excited now about all this and I will definitely try to motivate my fellows in the community and forum to support us.",
