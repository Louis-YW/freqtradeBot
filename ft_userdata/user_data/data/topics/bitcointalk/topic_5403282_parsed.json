Investing the money you can not afford to lose is never a good idea. When the risk is high, it is even a more worse idea. You should try to come up with extra cash to buy bitcoin with instead of borrowing it. For example you could look around your house and see if there is anything you don't need anymore which you could sell. Like an old laptop that you are never going to use. Then use the money to buy bitcoin.",

This is a good idea if you have a very good source of income that you can use to pay it without relying on the profit of your investment using the loan because you will in a lot of trouble if you are just gambling the money that you can't using other source of income.I once do that and I end up burning the money by investing on altcoins during 2017 bear market. I was forced to liquidate the remaining asset since the interest is of the loan is increasing while I don't see any future to my investment. After few years, The market pump including all the altcoins that I purchased before into astronomical level, I regret that part and probably I will hold if there's no interest pressuring me for my investment.",

Though, you can also invest in crypto but it should be you in your control so that when the market is unstable or in a downtrend the loss is minimal. The choice between investing in small businesses or crypto comes down to your own financial goals, desired portfolio, and risk tolerance. Small businesses can be more exciting and may provide a chance to support your daily needs. Each has its risks, and the best scenario is to invest in a variety of opportunities.",

Some people, even rich people do take loan for businesses, that is normal, but taking loan to invest in cryptocurrencies is very risky, it is not advisable in any way. I better just remain not investing on cryptocurrencies than taking a loan for it.In this period, we have not known yet what could be the bottom price, I mean if the price of cryptocurrencies will continue to fall further or not. It is good to be patient, use your own money to invest, if you do not have money to invest, then better not take a loan because crypto market is so risky. Also, donalwqys consider altcoins very risky, like gambling.",

I'm sure that you've read a good couple of times \"don't invest what you don't afford to lose\". And I'm sure you understand that loaned money is greatly in this category.There are 2 problems I see here:1. Nothing is guaranteed, even with the \"proeminent currencies\". What if your investments go down and never recover?2. A very common situation is big price fluctuations. Maybe the coins you buy would end up very good, but first they can easily and fast go much lower than the price you bought at. Since it's borrowed money there's much better chance you freak out, sell at a loss, and the price recovers only afterwards. (With borrowed money you may be more vulnerable / you may get scared much easier by price drops.)",

      "body": "The answer to the question if you should take a loan to buy cryptocurrencies is a very simple one. NO, never! The money is not yours, and you would be taking too much of a risk putting it into something as volatile as Bitcoin. If you have some savings or you would like to invest a part from your salary, that's OK. Would you take out a loan to play Blackjack? Would you do it to place a bet on a football match? I hope the answer to these questions is NO.  If you can't pay back on time, the bank will charge you more. Depending on how much you borrowed, they could seize your assets and possessions. Not paying back on time will destroy your credit rating, and if in the future you need a loan for a much more valid reason like the health of you and your family members, it will be harder for you to get one.",

I know a lot of people who take advantage of loans because they're offered with low interest rates. Some are also taking loans just to increase their borrowing limit. And many of them take these loans just to buy luxurious stuff which are otherwise unnecessary like the latest iPhone. They go shopping. They travel. They go abroad and watch concerts and play in casinos. In other words, they are taking loans and squander them. So if people can do this, why can't you take a loan and invest?

Judging from that, I don't think it's such a bad idea taking a loan to finance a credible crypto investment. However, you should make sure that you've something that can help you repay that loan in case your investment fails and you're distressed. Make sure not to take a loan that will be too huge for you to repay, even spread out on your signature earnings in case you don't have elsewhere you can get cash from. For those saying it's a risk, I hope we all know that life itself is a huge risk too and not taking risk they say is the biggest risk in life.",

Usually, the longer they're taken out for the more fees associated with it. Interest rates will also go up in the future, and usually loan companies have their terms of service written in such a way that they can change the interest rate that you signed up for. What I'm trying to say is, even if Bitcoin did go up to one million a coin, if it takes fifty years, you're probably still probably going to get burned because that loan had to be paid off within five years. I don't think gambling on whether or not Bitcoin is going to be successful in the long run is unlikely, and in my opinion is probably one of the more safe investments you can make, but to put a timescale on it, and then have the time pressures from the loan, that's just asking for trouble.
