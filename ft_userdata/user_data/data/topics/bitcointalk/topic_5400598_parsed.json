      "body": "I don't see a dedicated website for the project.If the token was already listed then you should be ready to go with promotion and Marketing. What's your strategy for that?Despite the solidity of the project and the team with good technical knowledge in the field, it does not really rise to be a real investment project that can be relied upon to earn profits according to the current market conditions.",

You must be concerned about where you have focused to post, in the same time you did post it on Announcements (Altcoins) in another time you did also here.As the post above, what is your concern?. So, I look for how it works, in your site I can't find how to mine and get the token. I don't know whether mining activity is begin or not, as I can see, your token is no premine and no ico like another coin pos did.",
