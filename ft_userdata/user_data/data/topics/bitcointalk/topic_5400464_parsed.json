In addition, you can also use Coinfaucet for web-based faucets. I've personally never used these faucets, so I don't know if the website and mobile app I attached above pays for it or not.",

In my opinion i believe Shiba is just a short term project that would only last as long as its hype does.Quote from: Takyeon on May 28, 2022, 06:50:25 AMThere was a time in 2017 where you can claim free doge coin every minutes or hour through the faucet website but now they are not working again, I guess that's because things have changed a lot, doge coin is no more a cheap coin but I think Shiba Inu is now in where Doge coin was years ago so is there any faucet for Shiba Inu?  You are basically looking for free coins, i am afraid it is going to be difficult to get, and mind you that even if you do it is going to be little or nothing, if you really want Shiba, you better buy some with your cash.",
