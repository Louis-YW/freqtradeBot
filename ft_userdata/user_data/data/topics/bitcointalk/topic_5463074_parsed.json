Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, you would need to have a good amount of bitcoins to be able to live off the profit from a bull run. I have witnessed only one significant bull run since I began my crypto journey, and it was in 2021 when bitcoin hit ATH of $69k.  My target was to sell at $100k so I didn’t sell then. It was a exhilarating experience up to the point when the price started dipping. I missed a golden opportunity to do something I’ve always wanted- sell high, buy low. But it was a teachable experience, I took solace in the fact that 1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin and there was never a loss.",

I entered the market in March 2020 when the Bitcoin price was still at $3k, I wasn't able to buy a lot I would say but still managed to get some up in that sale. In 2021, it went up to $60k which is almost 20x and some altcoins which I saw at $1 were at $220 which is 220x. It was something extra-ordinary and I haven't seen that anywhere.

If someone has experienced it, of course it's easy to say. But, don't ever experience it. it can be strange later... what is certain is that this period is very much anticipated because your investment, for example in bitcoin, will go up high, but, make a note if you enter now and hold it until the time is right. don't come in now it's only been 4 hours out   .",

However, it would bring me greater delight if I could hear about your experiences and get knowledge from them about how you were able to deal with the bull runDealing with bull run depends on holders decision, there are people who already have a selling target price in their mind before they starting accumulating Bitcoin, and this target price is what they work with, and if eventually the bull run comes and the target price is not being meet, they might decide not to sell yet and wait for another bull run, but in some cases you will see that why they are waiting for the next bull run, the price of Bitcoin will drop back down first which might equally lead them to regretting their actions. Why most times some people sell on every new bull run which add little profit to their initial buying price, but later on the market price seems to do double. Which ever the case maybe, to me the best way to deal with the bull run is if you are not a long time holder, you can be taking every little profit that you can achieve from every new price jump in the market as the bull run don't usually come to start for long.",

However, it would bring me greater delight if I could hear about your experiences and get knowledge from them about how you were able to deal with the bull runBull run is what every crypto investor are always on the lookout for because that is the best to time to make good use of the market and cashout big though not everyone will be able to ceize this opportunity or rather let me say not everyone was able to seize the opportunity during the last bull run because so many people were not too focused on bitcoin, they were focused on alt coins which led to to investing in shit coins in which the price is controlled by bitcoin and as time goes some of this shit coins began to experience massive drop in value and made investors loose so much in the end. Not that i have experienced a bull run myself but i have heard and read so much about it. I believe a lot of people have now understand bitcoin better and they are now aware that bitcoin is the most reliable coin and they will now take full advantage of it when the next bull run arrives. We are all here anticipating the next bull run and make use of the opportunity to make huge profits. My advice for you is to avoid new coin when the run arrives because it is now difficult to differentiate legit projects from scam projects so to be safer just invest in Bitcoin and some reputable alternative coins. Those Retiring from their work place just because they own some amount of bitcoin have shown they lack proper understanding of bitcoin and why it was invented. Bitcoin was invented in order to be used as an alternative payment for fiat currency which is not controlled by any central authority in order to give people financial freedom but people often abuse it’s use and take advantage of its price volatility.",

In the cycle we are in, from peak price to peak price, it has only increased by 3.5X. If we were to count from the minimum it would be 20X, but for that you would have to hit the cycle minimum to buy a good lump sum and then hit the maximum to sell everything at that time, which is as likely to hit as you are to win the lottery. And just think that even in that case, if you invested $1K, you've turned it into $20K, which doesn't give you enough to retire on. If you invested $10K, you will have had $200K, which is a good amount, but if you were able to invest $10K, it won't be that much for you. If we go to the previous cycles, the multipliers were higher, but apart from the improbable case of hitting cycle minimums and maximums mentioned above, what has been really profitable and has given you enough to retire is to hold on for two cycles, not one. In my case, as I didn't have a good amount as to be able to retire, I just remember as sweet moments checking the price and seeing that we had beaten another ATH, just as I would enter the forum and it was full of bullish threads, just as on Youtube and social media, everyone saying that the price was going to $150K, $200K, even some prediction $0.5M. The bad thing was the disappointment afterwards, that those predictions didn't come true.",

I haven't seen a bull run, so I can't speak to how it feels or what to do when it gets to that point.  Let me share my feelings about bull run with you, though I joined this forum after I knew about the last bull run in 2021 but then what my friend a senior colleague who introduced the forum to me told me was that \"It's a tensing moment for everyone both investors and traders\" It feels more like I Have Made It seeing the price growing up and up while you sleep and wake up. but if you miss the opportunity then to most it is there biggest regret. QuoteI've heard incredible tales of individuals either retiring in a month or regretting their decision to hold back into the bear market because they believed \"it always goes up\" and didn't want to lose out on bigger earnings. The lengthy path down resumes once they delay when it is time to take gains. It's a frequent notion here in the forum that people retired after a bull run and some regret. Most of the guys who regret a bull run, is either not opportune enough to meet the bull run or those who's ego or greed couldn't allow make the minimum profit. For you to profit in a bull run while holding then you most have a target or a limit set out for yourself when to sell. For instance: the price have never exceeded 80k it runs around 70k down then your selling point should be marked around 60k to 65k. But when people predicts and  wait for the biggest of it all then it turns out to fail them because you can't have everything that little is enough. Greed is the cause of most regrets for me I never regret anything opportunity missed. I believe there is still more opportunities coming.",
