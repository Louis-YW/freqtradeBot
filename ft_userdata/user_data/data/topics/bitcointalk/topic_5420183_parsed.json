Personally,Â  I don't think it is a problem if we discuss something that was already discussed in the past.I just take a look in one or two boards if is there already an open discussion before I create a new topic. I just look the first page. Alternatively,Â  you can Google the\" keywords + bitcointalk \" to see if you find something related.The problem is when people create a new topic when someone already open on the same subject just a few hours before. This generates confusion as nobody follow two discussions. However,Â  for big topics this is most likely happen as there are o many boards and so many people here.But I wouldn't mind this subject if I were you. Just act normally in the forum and don't spam around, i.e., don'tÂ  write what you wouldn't say in a normal conversation",

But if you are looking for something specific, you can try using https://ninjastic.space/ which makes looking for topics or even keywords much easier.Quote from: XEN_Protocol on November 09, 2022, 04:56:04 PMAlso is it wrong for someone else to discuss what a person have talked about before? It depends on what you want to discuss. For example, it won't be a problem if you have a specific problem and you open a new topic about it (but even then its good to browse forum first to see if someone else had the same problem), but if you come to this section with yet another \"Newbies beware of xyz\" that's been mentioned countless times before then you might get that response.",

If you'd sacrifice time to read, you'd realize that we have search engines and you should prolly Know how that works right?!QuoteAlso is it wrong for someone else to discuss what a person have talked about before? Yes, it is wrong. We have a term for that; it's called plagiarism. Simply copying, spinning, inter-changing words in a fact that's not your ORIGINAL idea( where ever you got 'em doesn't matter to anyone). If you must copy and paste, then don't fail to add a source link. Peeps have paid with their accounts for their ignorance in their newbie days, Beware!Sandra ðŸ’‡",

Thats the purpose of search function. Yes for a newbie he may not be aware of it at the beginning, thats why older users inform them that this has been discussed and guided you to go to previous threads cause maybe the answer you are looking for are already there.Its not bad to repeat topics or maybe previous one has been discussed very long time ago.

For example if nobody asks \"who is Satoshi Nakamoto\" for a long time, that topic is still not something that should be repeated to receive the same answers. But if it is something that is still a misconception or there are misinformation about it elsewhere like \"SegWit 'removes' signatures from transactions\" (which is wrong BTW) then it's OK to create a new topic about it even though it was discussed before.",

For example the hot topic now, about CZ and sam, Ive seen different threads and based on the updated issue like, Binance planning to acquire ftx, then the next thing is the deal was cancelled. Thats another topic out of the rebuttals that they did.Its all about the information. We can definitely have some exception to new threads having some changes or like you said misconception.",

And the fact that old users are forced to answer the same questions, in a way, becomes ridiculous. Someday, all answers from one user will be considered plagiarism in some sense. This will not necessarily be the case. Answers to the same questions may change over time, for example due to advances in technology or new information. Therefore, I believe that answers to the same question at different intervals of time can have at least very useful additions. Even in repetitive topics, it is possible to discuss the issue from a different angle and take into account previously missed nuances. So, I agree that there is no need to be shy about asking your questions.",
