And If I sent a fund from those exchangers how will the receiver identify mine and how can I prove him to it's me ------ As OmegaStarScream says you can get information about addresses through TXID, but it is technically difficult to prove that you are the sender because you cannot sign the address from which you sent if that address is with exchanges. because in that case, you don't have complete control over your address, i.e. you don't have the private key needed to sign addresses.",

And If I sent a fund from those exchangers how will the receiver identify mine and how can I prove him to it's me ------ You can withdraw the fund from the exchange to your own address (I mean an address which is fully controlled by you and you own its private key) and then send the fund to the recipient in another tranaction. In this way, you will be able to sign message from your address to prove it's owned by you.",

      "body": "I think OP is trying to understand how Binance works from withdrawal since a wallet address from a non-custodial wallet after you deposit bitcoins will stay there until you withdraw unlike exchanges like Binance once you deposit to your Bitcoin address it won't stay long and it would transfer to another wallet control by Binance.Once you withdraw from Binance all funds came from another address, not from the address where you deposit. This is the way how Binance protects its customer's funds.",

      "body": "The title is a bit ambiguous, all addresses and transactions will be visible in the explorer and I think is enough as a way of verifying for simple cases.If it comes from Binance, some people may not need proof of ownership from binance. Most explorerr sites and Binance product apps have labeled almost all the addresses under their control. It is impossible for Binance to send you bitcoin from your deposit address.",

Since I've only given it to a single person and not expecting anyone else, I've never confused certain payments with someone else. Perhaps this is something you may wanna communicate to the other party? But of course, if you need a proof then signing a message it is as others pointed out.",
