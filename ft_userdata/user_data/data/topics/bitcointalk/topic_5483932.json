  "content": "Flock you know this Billionaire?This is Timothy Cook Draper, the most well-known venture capitalist in USA, and founder of Draper University.Could you guys remember this early-stage BTC investor? Draper is the first strong hand who dared to say BTC would hit 250K when Bitcoin was trading below 4k per unit in 2018! He spread this possibility of Bitcoin to the whole world from Draper University by arranging a blockchain party.According to CNBC Report When Elon Musk started criticizing about Bitcoin and fossil fuels. Draper strongly answered him, he said that \"big banks have their own environmental issues.\"A few days ago I've seen someone in this forum talking about the Silk Road acquisition, if I recall correctly this is Draper who single handly scooped up around 30K BTC (not 30K worth of BTC, its 30K BTC ) from the US govt when they opened an auction to sell BTC from Silk Road operation in 2014.I am a Bloomberg TV show fan,. Last Tuesday it caught my eyes when I saw Draper in a LIVE TV show on Bloomberg with this heading- Why Tim Draper Is Still Bullish on BitcoinI found it very interesting, I'm sharing his statement with you.In this interview, Draper's keynote was that he figured out the US Government's shift to Bitcoin. In recent times the government able to realise the actual benefits of Bitcoin. Also, he said some other things which are very interesting, why? cause I found no celebs dare to make such kind of talk on Live TV show. I am presenting his exact statement to you through screenshots, I also quoted his statement below.QuoteI actually think that there will be a moment in time when I can buy my food, clothing, and shelter all in Bitcoin. And people won’t want dollars anymore.Don't you ever really think that the day is not far away when people will no longer ask for dollar for anything?",

But in long term, it is a depreciative asset. Dollar is better than the fiat of many countries. Why is bitcoin not dominating yet in those countries with high inflation rate? There is nothing that will compete against fiat because it has its own purpose.Bitcoin is not a substitute but an alternative because it is more volatile but it is an appreciative asset. That does not makes it a substitute but an alternative.",

I don't think he ever disclosed the exact amount he paid, but it was worth around $17-18 million at that time. If he held on to all of it (which I doubt), the stash would now be worth $1.3 billion - a pretty fortunate investment.As for replacing the Dollar - it won't happen until some post-apocalyptic scenario, or at least until the current financial system collapses. But that's OK, Bitcoin doesn't have to replace fiat to be successful. I'd rather have it as an asset/currency of choice rather than something mandated by the government.",

If there's one thing I know about these venture capitalist like Tim Draper is that they're not too interested in the technical side of things.

I want to see Bitcoin grow to the point of mass adoption (I believe most of us here want that too) but we've to face reality of that replacement never ever going to happen. In some of my previous posts on this issue, I had stated reasons that wouldn't make that happen.As for Tim Cook, his $250k prediction of Bitcoin for 2022 was off the mark. Come to think of it, didn't he know that 2022 was supposed to be a bear year? But of course, that was what it was supposed to be. It's the same way most of us know that 2026 will also be another bear year. How would he then put a prediction for such a price level that year? He could've said 2021 or 2025 and then we see what happens next. It shows how reckless he's with his predictions and comments. No one should trust everything Tim says without verification even if it gets them excited.",

Gox Collapse. He was such a fearless and strong believer in Bitcoin and it is always inspiring to read about Bitcoin believers like this. His predictions might be correct because Bitcoin has the potential to get to the amount Tim predicted but I don't see Bitcoin replacing the dollars. And I don't also think that Bitcoin was designed to be the only currency. Bitcoin will be an alternative currency for a long time. It is moving to a stage where it will take its place as digital gold, which means it might be used more as an investment.",

More and more people can use bitcoin for payments and other forms of transactions with the Government approves or not. At least to my understanding, that was the whole point of Bitcoin's creation.",

I think that it's better to say that it is the financial institutions that are now into Bitcoin and not the government. Because with the \"shift\" as he said about the US government into Bitcoin, they're just like going on to a thing that they have no full control of it and if they did, they shouldn't sold the Bitcoins that they've seized. Bitcoin as a reserve for the government? I don't think that will happen but there's a slight chance that it will. Whilst for the financial institutions, we've got the Bitcoin Spot ETF and it's being followed by one and the other institutions.

This statement is not true, there is no shift of the U.S. government to BTC, surely for now they are not going to ban BTC or make it illegal, but what they will do is regulate it strictly and try to find out what their citizens do with their coins, in other words attacking privacy and privacy solutions and promoting centralized and custodial services.BTC is not going to replace the U.S. Dollar, we have had this discussion so many times. They are both different kinds of currencies, and if you are talking about BTC replacing the U.S dollar, you are saying BTC is going to become the world's reserve currency, which cannot happen.",

      "body": "I remember that day in 2014 when the US Govt did the blind auction for like 27000+ BTC while Bitcoin was hanging around $600 and Tim Draper won by bidding like $630 or something. Cost him around 17 or 18 million dollars and it's now worth over a billion dollars 10 years later. Eventually he's going to hit 1000x on that and it'll be worth in the tens of billions.Draper way overshot his $250k prediction. $250k I think has a good chance to happen in the 2029 bull market, so he predicted it probably 7 years early.As to his comments...Will we one day be able to buy pretty much anything with Bitcoin. Yes absolutely. Eventually bitcoin payments are going to be in every electronic point of sale system alongside credit cards, apply pay, google pay, etc.Is it going to replace the dollar, or other national currencies. No. Let's get real. Governments aren't going to simply give up the currency that they literally create and control (giving them vast economic power) and switch over to a currency they have zero control over. ESPECIALLY the US because the dollar is the reserve currency of the world and that gives the US huge economic advantages over every other country.But of course times are changing and maybe in the next few decades the world abandons the dollar and its just another currency. But still America, or any other nation that issues its own currency, isn't going to scrap the thing that gives them a lot of economic power and go to Bitcoin.I mean maybe if nations as we know them, or at least the current nations that exist, literally collapse, Bitcoin could potentially be the front runner for global currency to take over. But assuming the geopolitical world stays roughly as it has been for a long time now, no Bitcoin ain't going to replace anything.What Bitcoin will likely do is become the world's alternate currency, used right alongside all the national currencies. And most people are eventually going to probably do most of their savings in Bitcoin because why the heck would you have anything but short term savings in inflationary currencies when you can save in a supply capped currency (which other huge benefits like you own it yourself and its global).And OP, no it's not going to happen soon. Probalby like 98% of people still don't have a clue what Bitcoin really is or they think it is some sort of scam / risky tech thing / it was a bubble \"it's too late now, I missed out on it\" / destoying the environment / etc. As long as the general public thinks those things it's not going to suddenly become widely accepted.I'd say we have probably about two decades until the tide turns and Bitcoin starts being normalized by the general public. And during that time it's going to be a bumpy ride with most people still continuing to bad mouth Bitcoin. By the 2050s I think it'll be normalized and people won't hate on it anymore and they'll have no problem saving in bitcoin and spending it at stores or online. But they'll mostly be spending their national currencies, only using bitcoin to buy things when they are spending their bitcoin savings.",

Maybe bitcoin is gaining popularity and the number of bitcoin customers is increasing day by day in a geometric way but it will be possible for bitcoin to replace the dollar but not easily possible.People's confidence and interest in a currency decreases when the amount of inflation in that currency increases. When the rate of inflation of a currency increases, investors or holders do not want to hold those currencies because holding them depreciates in value over time.When a currency's value declines over time, people distrust that currency. But people's distrust of the dollar has yet to arise and the dollar is still one of the most popularly accepted currencies in the world. Most of the world's investments revolve around the dollar, so replacing the dollar will not be an easy task.However, if inflation is seen in the dollar over time and if people show distrust towards the dollar, on the other hand, if the popularity of bitcoin spreads like a revolution all over the world, and if the world's top class investors invest in bitcoin instead of dollars, then only bitcoin potential will be created.",

I consider myself a Bitcoiner even though my Bitcoin holding is not anything significant. But I do not think we are even close to this time. Bitcoin fluctuates a lot and it's not possible to set a fixed price with Bitcoin for everything you buy from the market. Another problem is the high fees. I don't think people are that much idiot to pay $10 transaction fees for another $20 product. The lightning network could be a solution, but it does not eliminate all the issues. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. It is great as an Investment asset just like gold. But, do you use gold to do regular shopping? I know you don't because it's not possible. If Bitcoin fees remain like that, I don't think dollars with replaced by Bitcoin anytime soon. Feel free to criticize me!",
