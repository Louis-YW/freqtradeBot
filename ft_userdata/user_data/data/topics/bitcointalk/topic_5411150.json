  "content": "I am conducting a research about Satoshi's Stash of Bitcoin. I tried to identify the blocks that Satoshi mined in 2009 from the Genesis Block may be up to 60,000 blocks. When I put the Genesis Block  in the Electrum it shows that there around some Bitcoin people has sents to the Genesis Block address  but it does not show the 50 Coinbase transaction. Which supposed to be the first Bitcoin transaction. I also put many other address but the result is the same. Some earlier Bitcoin address show the balance is 0.0 but in the Block explorer it shows that coinbase transaction of 50 Bitcoin is there but not spent. What is the fact ? Please let me know your comments. Thanks Arigato",

Satoshi client paid to that public key once received. At least that's what Raghav Sood says on Stackexchange:Quote from: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/73378/134811Such transactions worked by essentially contacting the IP address you were sending to, seeing if it was running Bitcoin, and receiving a public key from the Bitcoin node there to pay to.We can look into the source code of the very first software release if you disagree. I'm sure it has nothing to do with privacy protection; pretty much the opposite. Handing over your IP address harms your privacy. But, you don't understand privacy, so it's a waste of time arguing.Quote from: franky1 on August 25, 2022, 02:57:58 PMthe reason electrum does not show p2pk.. is not due to pools. its not due to mining.. its due to electrum. and only electrum not being coded wellAnd nobody said otherwise. It's definitely an Electrum's fault. You just don't have anything to say, as usual, and derail the thread.",

Eventually, Pay-to-IP was phased out, and miners used other mining software which used P2PKH (Pay-to-public-key-hash).hint if you just said \"That's because Electrum doesn't recognize P2PK (Pay-to-public-key) outputs\" and only that. instead of then point fingers in all different places to explain it.. there would not have been need to correct youanyways. to end the sideshow debate of blackhatcoiners pointy fingers by completely correct to debunk blackhatcoiners pointy fingers of p2ip blame blame.. so that everyone can finally know its as simple as electrum just cant be bothered and is at fault...lets just totally once and for all correct blackhatcoiners misunderstanding of what p2ip is so they he can just STOP. and not meander with his misperceptions. and just accept what actually happens and not discuss it again. (im doing this because blackhatcoiner and his buddies like to jump into topics and not say whats actually at fault but say something is at fault due to [insert other bitcoin network thing/node feature that is broke where bitcoin as a whole was/is not fit for purpose]).. p2ip was not about paying a IP instead of a public key..it was about using an ip address to connect to a persons node to request a public key, then create a tx with said public key as destination of funds, sign tx. and send tx to the recipient direct before broadcasting it to everyone elseimagine 2 nodesA and BA wants to pay Bfirst step A connects to b.. B sends A publickey for how to pay B(thats where you stop with your narrative at this point)A then creates a transaction (a payment) and sends the signed tx to Bthe privacy aspect is that A did not have to transmit the transaction(payment) to everyone on the network unconfirmed.instead A or B could then include it in their solo mining block attempts. and the payment is confirmed and only seen by the wide network when the solved block is propagated to the network so that only then can the whole network only then see that there was a payment betwen A nd Bas for IP privacywell all nodes worked via connecting to each other via IPpeople only wanted to trade with other people they trusted and knew so would only use paytoIP with people they knew already.no one used it with strangers and it was not meant to be used to gather info by forcing people to PaytoIP to learn what someones IP was to then DDoS them.people were smarter then that to be demanded to reveal their IP to strangers who could then associate a forum profile with an IPand such it was never used because in many many cases people didnt know/trust each other well. it also got used alot less when pool mining came about where chances of solo  miners solving blocks that included their prefered tx list were not happening as much as pool mining was, so people just ended up just relaying transactions with everyone to greaten the chance of being included in a blockanyway..Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on August 25, 2022, 04:36:35 PMWe can look into the source code of the very first software release if you disagree.yes we can, challenge acceptedhttps://youtu.be/W3rb_26QswM?t=260oh and as for your privacy thingthis is not about telling everyone your IP. not everyone knows or gets to see your IP. you are only telling your prefered person the IP. again its not about having a destination address of funds as an ip addressits about choosing to connect directly to a service you know of who happily wants you to connect to them..well that was the initial idea.hense why satoshi set up the cod as like a merchant tools mechanism so a merchant can be connected to and then send the customer a public key(bitcoin address) the merchant wants to be paid withand yea i made things easy. instead of a wall of text code for you to read i found a video summarising the code",

And it can make sense too (from the wallet point of view).",
