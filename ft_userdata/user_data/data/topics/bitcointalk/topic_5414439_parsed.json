      "body": "Gacha or sometimes called \"Gashapon\" in some RPG games is really addictive. Not just to acquire that monster stats stuffs but usually, it was also composed of items that will bring stunning looks at the appearance of a character e.g costumes, wings, mounts, etc.Is it gambling? Yes, as you need to purchase an in-game currency first before rolling it. In most cases, the price is not that cheap that's why only the game whales can manage to overuse it. However, the reward might not be x10, x20, or x30 of the bet amount like on the usual gambling game but rather in-game items of that said game.Is it an addiction to consider? Yes, for game freaks especially whales.",

      "body": "Gacha games basically swapped out the concept of receiving money for spending money, instead replacing it with cosmetics, art, whatever you call it. Then they add their own odds to it which is basically really really bad if you see it from a gambling perspective, but is rather normal from a gaming perspective. It's addicting yes, but it can also be controlled since they, well, give out free stuff. I wouldn't consider playing the game itself addicting/gambling, the game itself gives you chances or opportunities to grind up and earn currencies you can use to get stuff but spending money to get a specific item (Which in most cases, happens to EVERYTHING that they release) can basically end up a curse of you spending all the time. It can be considered addiction to some extent if you can't control your finances, but well it's much lighter than gambling imo.",

A lot of the content is only available for a limited time so you will FOMO and spend money to pull the character or item you want before their banner goes away.Diablo Immortal was a game that recently launched and it was so controversial because many people considered it's monetization to be very predatory. Gacha games can be fun to play but I dislike their addictive nature and how they can be greedy when it comes to monetization.",

This type of game is only possible on games and not on casino because this game genre is design for collectibles and rpg while casino game is purely aim to just win or lose the money without any complicated feature such collection of characters.",

I think it has to do with Japanese gambling that was modified due to Japan's extremely strict gambling laws. They basically found a loop-hole in the law to make sure the payout was not in cash but in a token which you could then use to \"purchase\" certain prizes, like bars of gold (Which you could then exchange for actual money). It seems like a silly grey area that they should have gotten rid of already but the Japanese seem to enjoy gambling too much to close down the concept of Gacha...Personally I would steer clear. Why? Because those tokens can become completely worthless the moment vendors decide not to accept them any longer.",

In gambling addiction, it is just like any other type of addiction too when someone will be doing things he responsibly not want to do in a way that thing is taking more of his time than usual and also in the process, losing more than win, leading to irresponsible way of gambling.

In gambling, people spend with the expectation to win back, but this I have interpreted to be just like you said that the person only spends money to improve look or ability of their character. If you are willing to spend on looks and appearance of a game character, you are addicted. But not all addictions are entirely destructive and don't have any positive benefits. For one benefit, these games can provide better satisfaction for people who play them and the purchases are necessary to ensure the developers of the game can still keep benefitting as well.",
