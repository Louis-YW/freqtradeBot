You can check it out. I don't think it should be an issue. Don't know why OP is so serious about that neutral feedback.hugeblack, by any chance, do you have bitcoingirl.club in your ignored list? He has already shared the about the feedback OP is talking about.",

Nope, there's no harm, although that's the kind of feedback one would hope could get removed before the person who left it died or abandoned the forum.  Views on genocide aside, this is one of the reasons why I think the trust system needs an overhaul.  It's acceptable to leave neutral feedback for disagreements like this one between TECSHARE and OP, but the fact is that they're notes that should only be viewable to the member leaving the feedback.  Why have the ability to broadcast something about someone for all to see on their trust page?  Sure, most people won't care....but you never know.Anyway, what's the point here, OP?  I don't think that feedback is going anywhere.  I can't remember the last time Theymos or a moderator stepped in and deleted a feedback.",

Mostly the feedback spammers do that.In a feedback system why would someone care a feedback left by The Pharmacist to BitcoinGirl.club if the feedback is something like:\"I trust BitcoinGirl, he helped me a lot\" or \"BitcoinGirl is a freak, I do not trust him\"But obviously someone needs to know the following feedback (if they are provided enough proofs):\"We had a business of $1000 and it went very well, I recommend BitcoinGirl.\" or \"BitcoinGirl scammed me $1000, fuck him. He is not trustworty\"",

However, even Tecshare mentioned \"genocide\" in the feedback on OP's profile. The coincidence is very striking indeed.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on September 13, 2022, 02:01:55 PMQuote from: The Pharmacist on September 13, 2022, 08:05:40 AMI can't remember the last time Theymos or a moderator stepped in and deleted a feedback.Don't we know feedback are not moderated by forum staff? The only one who can change a feedback is the feedback sender.I agree with The Pharmacist on that. The trust system should be overhauled and the new one made in a way that the one who tags or sends a feedback on anyone's profile doesn't have the absolute power to make it remain. There should be other users who can be enabled to overwrite certain needless and senseless feedback. We've seen cases where some members had gone psychiatric, leaving careless feedbacks on others for no just reason. For instance, the feedback I had from \"isoneguy\" didn't even come with any evidence or reference to what he alleged. Just an insane dude with his challenges as at then according to what I read about them. Perhaps, he was depressed at the time and decided to vet it on any account he saw close by.",
