This is essential if you worry about privacy at all.Quote from: https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/what-is-coin-control/Coin control feature empowers you to protect your privacy better since you’re able to move a specific UXTO that might have metadata on you from an exchange; you can keep other UTXOs from being linked back to you.Quote from: Flyingbeaver on December 11, 2022, 11:25:07 PMQuote from: n0nce on December 11, 2022, 11:05:13 PMSince it uses Tor by default, you can run this on a non-live install without worries and less risk of losing funds (e.g. if the USB drive unplugs; poof: offer and funds are gone).I lose the offer, ok. But i lose my coins? Wdym? I can't log back in for my coins?Yes. There is nothing to 'log back in'. There are no servers, therefore no 'accounts' on servers that you could log back into. The only accounts that exist are your fiat payment methods saved in your client, locally. Your coins are in your Bisq wallet. Local. It's just a local hot wallet.Meaning if your local install dies, and you have no seed phrase backup, those coins are also gone.Quote from: Flyingbeaver on December 11, 2022, 11:25:07 PMQuote from: n0nce on December 11, 2022, 11:05:13 PMQuote from: Flyingbeaver on December 11, 2022, 09:28:22 PMSo no 70/30?

Convert all the BTC to XMR. Convert all the XMR to BTC (after some time). Send all BTC one shot to one wallet address??Yes, but by sending all BTC at once you would be linking them (read above about coin control). Best would be to send each UTXO to Bisq individually and sell it for XMR individually; then you could consolidate the amounts in XMR and sell those XMR in 'one shot' for BTC again.There are lots of options you can take, depending on what kind of anonymity you're looking for. If your coins have KYC on them (maybe from the same exchange even) but nobody else knows (i.e. never spent anything to buy goods etc.), it shouldn't make a difference if you link them when sending to Bisq in one go.You could also CoinJoin the UTXOs using Whirlpool, then sell on Bisq.With all of this, keep in mind this is more a 'hack' than a tailor-made privacy solution. What sounds good in theory, could go wrong when doing it in practice at a multitude of steps. Best would be to follow the KISS principle and use a system made for privacy, like CoinJoin or mixing.",
