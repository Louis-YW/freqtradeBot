Do you think May 29 handover will hold?If while Dino Melaye & other party representatives been dey yan for Abuja collation center and yet Prof. Mahmood went ahead to announce Tinubu as president-elect, and yet Buhari went ahead to congratulate him few hours later. Anybody wey tell you say on May 29th say Tinubu will not be sworn in tok big lie, bcos on that day he will be sworn in and yet nothing go happen, and if by mistake una try protest, omo una fit witness another massacre wer go pass \"ENDSars\" oh, bcos these pple no get conscience, and as such they fit do anything just to grab that political power. So my brothers & sisters for this forum, I go advise you say please make you no join any protest oh, bcos I really love una, make we just try dey chop our campaign money small small dey go, and leave politics for politicians",

If you no gree,he ho first sit down for the seat before court go conclude whether na Tinubu win or not. If them pass judgement say no be Tinubu win,definitely he go step down for the winner. I no think say Nigeria go carry power give military to hold first till tribunal judge the case because person must sit in that sit on May 29. Na only God fit commot this corrupt politicians from power.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on April 18, 2023, 06:20:46 AME dey pain me as dis country be, but nothing fit change unless we do true federalism or split.As for my own, na to split sure pass because this country problems and backwardness to big for one man head,come be say na for old man head.",

INEC and other third parties can not stop the hand over come may 29. The law also respect it's order and can not do anything about it. One thing I know is that every one can exercise their grievance at the law court but can not stop it's course from taking effect. There have been many instances and occurrences where things similar in nature to this rants occurred but nothing happened. It did not stop the law from taking its course. So what ever they are planning to do wouldn't hold any water. I am not talking because of political parties involved, I am not talking in favour of any party but I am talking based on past occurrences and events. The hand over and swearing in would hold.",

Already they knew who is to seat on that 001 position but they only came to make it known and official to us, so I strongly believe the country will be at safe side comes 29 May 2023.So, Sir ma please have a deep sleep and forget about government and their political jingoism.",

So as for, peso or any group of persons or political parties no fit cough on that day(May 29) because any funny play that day na straight to nga(prison).It is so painful(I no go lie give you) that Tinubu is going to be our president but what will someone do in a country where rule of law doesn't stand, old and wicked politician doesn't care about the youths of the country. The only thing they care about is the power and fame for themselves and their family. As the matter be so, we the youths go survive whether Tinubu go continue to be our president thereafter after May 29th.",
