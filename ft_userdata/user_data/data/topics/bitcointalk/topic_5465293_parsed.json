      "body": "Scam reporting format Quote What happened:: Scammers Profile Link: Reference Link: Amount Scammed: Payment Method: Proof of Payment: PM/Chat Logs: Additional Notes: Even if there is anyone who has been scammed by the above-mentioned victim, why not share a valid procedure that could be used to file a law suit against the person if necessary? Rather than sending you a PM, who knows what kind of information you could require from them? I'm just saying that for security reasons, it's unwise for someone to send you a PM that you will later redirect to their personal WhatsApp number. Privacy is really important; no one knows who is who. Adding to the fact that your account just woke up after a long sleep also increases the doubt here, and everyone needs to play it safe.",

      "body": "OP in as much as you are trying to do good by calling out a scammer, it is not a bad idea but it ought to be done in the right way so as to avoid tarnishing someone reputation. You are calling someone a scammer when you have no evidence to prove that you have been scammed by that person. Nobody has said about that person scamming them. Do you have any link to articles pointing out her scammed people?I was thinking you had an ill intensions when I checked your profile and it speaks of much volume on this you have done here. I will advise you to provide evidence with immediate effect so as not to wrongfully tarnish the reputation of somebody here because it is not right for you to do this without any evidence at hand.",

Maybe they are still compiling pieces of evidence so they can put him and his associates in jail, This reminds me of Bitconnect and Onecoin I hope they can compile enough evidence and charge them, I don't trust OP doing this, he should be more transparent by providing more information about his post, and also a disclaimer.",

      "body": "It gets me weird whenever someone quickly reports a site or platform for scamming them without any solid proof or evidence to show that the aforementioned website scammed them. Okay even though they are scammer what else do you want people to believe in this point of your accusation, where you had no solid evidence that this site in question scammed you I know it's very important t mind the kind of site and web we should deal with but seeing you accusing site with proper reporting techniques doesn't show a good representation.",
