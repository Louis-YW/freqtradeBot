There's hosting providers like steadyturtle that used to advertise here that might be better equipped/happier with hosting crypto based applications.If you're doing anything more serious (where your intake is going to be quite big) buy the server yourself to host it. Buy a domain name from someone reputable who has a low social engineering risk and get an ip from an ISP (if you're running a mixer this can be avoided if you're going to put it through tor but you might want a second line).",

That's plain BS they're restricting crypto applications. Are they doing it because they think it is an environment polluter? Then they might want to look at themselves in the mirror because environmental activists are hitting them even harder than Bitcoin.But anyway, to answer your question, you can try with GCP, Azure, one of those Chinese cloud providers, OVH, Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Linode - the list is endless.",

      "body": "VPS may have many benefits, but I have a feeling that quite soon (especially in the case of success of your project, what I wish you) your server might be insufficient for your needs - you may want to add new software, node, SPV/LN server etc. It is more expensive, for sure, but why not look for dedicated server?One of main question you must ask yourself is \"am I an admin\"? If not, you really really want someone who will take care of your server, its updates, security etc. If you are just a programmer who wants to host his project, you will face many issues you may be not aware now (besides some weird side-effects of different kinds of virtualization solutions used for VPS).",

You should definitely avoid using Hetzner that publicly said they will terminate every activity related with cryptocurrencies.I have developer friend who used various VPS servers for crypto related stuff and he didn't have any problem with Vultr and Contabo, but I didn't ask him recently if there was some changes.It's best to read tos page before signing any contracts and talk with their support fo clarification, but i would check lowendbox.com website for good deals.",

Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on September 21, 2022, 02:39:53 PMThe best VPS to launch a casino, exchange, mixer is one you own. Let me be more specific: It's one nobody else can access, but you. The reason is simple: You can't trust middlemen with this sensitive information. Take a mixer for example. If you host a mixer in a VPS, it means you're trusting that the real administrator won't report you to the authorities with the first request, and secondly but more crucially, he won't spy on you.Same as with running a full node at home: A person who's hosting a mixer, a casino, or an exchange needs to prioritize security and privacy. While I do agree, it really depends on the person hosting it. If you can't implement it securely, you might be better off relying on someone that can. If you don't live on your own or with people that you can trust, again that's a security flaw that could potentially bite you in the arse. So, I do think while generally speaking having your own VPS is the way to go, I think it highly depends on the individuals circumstances. Obviously, it might be worth reconsidering launching something if you can't implement a VPS securely. However, that's another topic for another day.",

This store appears to be similar to the google play store, and the iTunes app store for iPhone users. I don't believe the specific restriction is regarding hosting anything related to crypto on AWS infrastructure.

If you are running anything on a personal basis (for example sending/receiving transactions on your personal account), a self/at-home run full node will maximize security/privacy. Hosting the backend infrastructure for an app is generally going to be a business doing so. Having an employee (or a founder) hosting the backend in their basement is almost always going to be a bad business practice. Further, any app that is going to run at scale is going to have to be run out of a data center, either via the data center that is housing the VPS you are using, or the data center that is hosting a server you own (or the server you are renting). If you are using a data center, there is always the risk that the operator of the data center is going to spy on you -- there are precautions you can take to prevent and/or detect when you are being spied on, but there is always the risk. Even if you aren't running your backend out of a data center, whatever you are doing can be traced back to your ISP, and your ISP can give up your information to the government. If you want to protect yourself against spying by your data center, your best bet is to use a data center that you can trust will not spy on their customers at scale. From there, you can try to remove the link between what the public sees and your back end infrastructure -- this most likely means running your services through tor.",
