      "body": "Before you open or copy a link, a more important step is where you get the link.If you get the link by searching with Google, that is terrible. They have bad history to let scam, fake applications to appear at top of their search engine results.More safely, get a link from an official website but again, where you get an official link of one project?Start with Coinmarketcap or Coingecko, two biggest crypto market cap websites. Search project name and if it was listed on these websites, you will get links to that project website, media, community links.After searching with Coinmarketcap, Coingecko, you can re-check it by searching with Google or other search engines.If a project is not listed on Coinmarketcap or Coingecko, stop your research about that project. It can be a very newborn project or a scam one.[1] https://coinmarketcap.com/[2] https://www.coingecko.com/",

It can be a very newborn project or a scam one.[1] https://coinmarketcap.com/[2] https://www.coingecko.com/Although the two sites contain more than 20,000 cryptocurrency projects in addition to all service platforms operating in the field of encrypted digital assets, there are projects that did not care to be listed there because they are new projects, and those platforms require a certain trading volume and monthly fees for  listing a new currency.  Also links to Mixing platforms, for example, cannot be found on CoinmarketCap or Coingecko, and it is very dangerous to use direct links from search engines.  In this case, I suggest that the Bitcointalk forum be used to do the necessary research, whether to search for safe links or to verify new ones.",
