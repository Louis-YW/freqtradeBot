If I earn $200 weekly for example, I can use 5% to gamble at once and not think about the losses. I can use martingale for casino game with 3 odds. Like this:The first time I gamble I can use 2xIf I win or lose, I will continue to gambleAnytime I lose, I increase it to $3If I win, I will continue to gamble with $3. If I will the second time, I will stop gambling for the day. If I lost the second, I will gamble with $5.If I win, I stop gambling for that week. If I lose, I stop gambling.What I do not like about martingale is that it will only make you gamble for just short period of time like less than 10 minutes. To prolong it, he can just continue to use $0.5 to have fun.Let him know how martingale can be very dangerous.",

Trying to discourage him or talk him out of his plan will strengthen his resolve to want to go further. The irony here is that if it should work out for him the first time, he will do it again and again until he faces a huge loss but if he losses the first time, he'll hang his head in shame and agree that you were right. If you know the say he intends to execute his plan, be there with him and don't say a word. Maybe your presence will play a small role in discouraging him from overdoing it.",

      "body": "I think you should do research and take all links to stories of martigale's failures in gambling, you should also show him links to data that prove that gambling is not something to get rich, show your friend that no matter how much If he has managed to achieve some successes so far, this does not mean that the successes will be eternal, you can even tell him to continue putting in little money so that he can see for himself that at the end of the day he will lose everything. He probably won't listen to you, that's something to be expected. So why, even if you predict that he won't listen to you, do you have to show him these links?The answer is simple: so that when he loses everything, he doesn't blame you for not stopping him, he doesn't accuse you of just standing by and watching him fall into disgrace. and also because you will sleep without remorse and without feeling guilty. you warned him and he didn't listen, when you think that way you will feel light and free from guilt. People don't listen until they fall into disgrace, after regret comes and they start listening and think about changing. Unfortunately, many times they have already fallen into a hole so deep that they cannot get out of it anytime soon. just try your best to warn him of this danger and pray that he listens to you, that's all you can do for him",

Give him the benefit of the doubt, what if he actually won most of the time with such strategy? Then telling him will make it more negative. Atleast if it won't work well on his case, he'd be the one to realize and learn from it. Allow things to happen. Although I get the point that OP is just concerned of his friend but no one can really determine the future. It won't even be proposed in this industry without any validation from other player and we are just all shooting our shots or playing our chances.

He is a friend and they can also discuss about it. Friends learn from friends. I do not see anything bad for him to tell his friend before it will be too late. Even if his friend will make profit from it, he should just let him knows that martingale strategy can be dangerous, he should still tell his friend and let them discussion on it. Martingale strategy can be very profitable, but so can the loss be.",

Otherwise, what the hell, if they think they can handle the losses. Let them. Their own money, their own issue. I have had this conversation with many people, explaining to them how illogical it is for there to exist a perfect system that always wins in gambling, how casinos would not exist. But some just don't want to listen. I never had to go to the extremes of telling them that they will be in financial ruin, but if it was for somebody I really appreciated I would make the sacrifice. Sadly, telling the truth sometimes can have consequences to you, the message bearer, as well..",

So likely nothing you can say could convince them otherwise.  I hate to be this way, but people of lower intelligence are the ones who often think this way.  A lot more difficult to reason with someone of a lower IQ than one that's higher..typically.  Best of luck though.",

The martingale method is not always effective,  there are high risks of making huge losses if the outcome of two of his gambling results are not equal. And he will keep funding his game until he arrives at a profit. This is not always nice. Since your friend has tasted the sweetness of winning using the martingale strategy already, it will be quite difficult convincing him that he is on the wrong path and this is something to be worried about because he might get himself into a financial mess.He is your friend, talk to him about the disadvantages of the martingale strategy. It is better you talk to him about it than watch him face the outcome of his gamble. It is now left for him to go on with his new strategy or lay low, at least you wouldn't be feeling guilty if he eventually loses. He is an adult and should take full responsibility for all his decisions and actions.",

This is a really tight situation, as you are left with no better options. You might also be considering what the outcome of the discussion will be with him, what he will see it like, and whether he will not think that you don't want his success, and by so doing, you are trying to talk him out of making more money over the weekend. Then again, you could also be thinking, On the other hand, if you keep quiet and say nothing and he proceeds with his decision and makes the deposit and loses all that money to gambling, will you be happy with yourself knowing about it and you did nothing to change his mindset? The best thing to do is do whatever you can to tell him the risk ahead, even if it takes you to show him videos or online articles. Anything you know might look more convincing; just try as you can. If he doesn't want to listen, you can let go of whatever outcome of the weekend gambling comes for him; it's no longer your business; you have cleared your own mind. To me, that's what matters.",

Well, it did just turn out that your friend was lucky on making use of martingale on which we know that it cant really be that profitable in longer runs. It is really just that he had been get used to be lucky on the time that he made out some gambling on this particular moment on which it is really just that a right call that he made out such gambling session.So the question if you would really be telling him the truth?It would really be just better that you should let him be on the things that he would really be tending to do because it would really just that make him realize on the time that he would be experiencing some losses.We do know that there's no such thing about being holy grail when it comes to gambling on which there would really be coming into a point on which you would be thinking that it does existuntil that reality would really be slapping hard into your face and make you realize that this doesnt exist in the first place. People do really need to face up the reality so that they would really be able to learn on what are the things that realistically happens and not living in world on which they do believe that it could sustain for long.",

Well am not surprised at all, as this is the first stage or should I say effect of rush win in gambling, many gambler has gone through this phase before because the excitement of wins in gambling will overshadow your thinking and make you so lose focus on what you tend doing next because at that moment, all what would be playing is how to effectively achieve the same feat on a constant basis which is definitely impossible. Aslo this phase is when the gambler actually takes no advice because of the wins he had already experience so thinking of advising won't be of any use at all as all his taught is to replicate the exact same scenario that got him that same missing funds.",
