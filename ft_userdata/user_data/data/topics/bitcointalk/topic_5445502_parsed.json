  "content": "Hello,My situation is this: my rigs are in a closed rood with only two vents for AC coming in. AC is stuck at 20C/68F.The room is closed: no windows and no way for the air to get out.The room also cannot be modified, since it's not my house and the owner has refused any modifications I proposed.I can't move the rigs to another location. I need help/ideas in ways to cool the room.I have a one S17pro and three T17+ machinesThings I have tried but have not worked:fans with higher CFM/air pressurebig fans mounted right in front of the minersgiant stage fan to move the air around and cool all machines at onceconnected one of the AC ducts from the ceiling to the stage fan to suck/push more cold air in the room: didn't work.My last brain cell idea is to get a metallic rack and just put heatsinks on it and a fan to blast over them to cool the air since they aren't connected to anything, as in they're not generating heat.That's about all I could think of and I'm out of ideas. Could someone please help me with this?",

      "body": "Difficult question, because I think you have already tried everything that is really feasible in your situation. In any case, when there are large amounts of energy used, there will be a lot of heat in the room if it is closed.I think that indeed air conditioning the room could be the beginning of a solution, but it depends of the surface of your room. What is the floor area and total volume of the room in question? With this data, calculations could be made. In my humble opinion, there are two solutions realistically available to you:-Hydrocooling if you can, but I don't know if that would be feasible / cost effective with S17s and T17s. In theory everything is feasible but the financial aspect of this solution will probably lead to a financial loss for you-Hosted mining, send your ASICs to someone who has better operating conditions than you have.Apart from that, I don't think there is a miracle solution for this problem.",

Water cooling might be my only option and buying the kit myself, piece by piece.Not going to work in your room unless you place the radiator outside, water simply moves heat faster than air, it doesn't magically get rid of that heat, if you can't modify the room by any shape or form, you will need to get a stronger AC, calculate your that total Watts and multiply them by 3.5 and that's the size of AC in BTU you are going to need to cool the room.Cooling in theory is rather simple, it's either you move enough air to offset the CFM needed by each miner and that's done by installing enough exhaust fans and having enough intake space, or by sending the hot air outside using AC for air cooling miners a radiator for immersion cooling and/or water cooling, they all are based on the same logic, it's just the efficiency and cost that matters.For now, try underclocking your miners to the lowest settings possible till you have figured out something.",

      "body": "What you can do is convert your your miners to watercooling and easily put out the heat out of the room if you put a hose through the AC hole. Outside of the room you can put a radiator and have no heat at all in the room. This is very expensive however.Second option is to use one AC hole as an inlet for air and one as an output for air. To those holes you connect fans with a very strong pressure and see how far this will get you.",

If you have a quality wood door.Say like this:https://www.homedepot.com/p/Krosswood-Doors-32-in-x-80-in-Rustic-Knotty-Alder-2-Panel-Top-Rail-Arch-Solid-Core-Wood-Stainable-Interior-Door-Slab-AE-1213280SLB/202980361and access to a proper circular saw like this :https://www.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-15-Amp-Corded-7-1-4-in-Lightweight-Circular-Saw-DWE575/203273038you could remove ½ to maybe ¾ inches from bottom of the door.Good luck fixing the heating issues.",
