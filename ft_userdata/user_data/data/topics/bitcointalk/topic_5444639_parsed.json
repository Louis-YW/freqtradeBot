      "body": "I did not see this coming so soon...but it's happening. The private sector might be able to save SVB. Or, the bank will collapse and reinforcements will be called to prevent the same thing happening throughout the sector. I was surprised to see that Yellen said \"no bail-outs for SVB\". I was expecting the opposite when the news broke. Very interesting times and I am intrigued to see how this all plays out, and whether or not a domino effect is coming.What is also intriguing to me is how this will effect Bitcoin when markets open and the weeks following. Will an economic downturn hurt Bitcoin before it benefits it? Or will the fact that this very kind of scenario is why Bitcoin was made, propel it to new highs earlier than we all thought?",

If SVB didn't jump on the \"crypto this crypto that\" bandwagon im assuming they would be doing better, same as Silvergate which tried to become some sort of shitcoin exchange, they are going to pay the crypto bandwagon tax and that's part of the capitulation before we can talk about the next ATH. Im actually surprised stuff like crypto.com are still dumping mad millions all over mainstream sports events.",

I found out it had $209 billion in assets & ranked as top 20 big banks in the US. The repercussion of it might not come out so soon but it would certainly hit the already struggling US economy and would hugely impact the startup environment in the US & globally. I feel SVB fall might become a blessing in disguise for Bitcoin in the US.  I am pretty much sure that we will hear many more names in the coming month.",

But yes, taxpayers money will be used to bailout the failed banking system again for sure! Also now this banking crisis will give another chance to FED to increase the lending rate which will increase the burden on the common people. SVB was the bank for highly risky companies whose roadmap is still not clear. So there was a risk element always present with that bank. It's a good news that HSBC has already purchased SVB's UK business.",

Yeah, bitcoin becomes a store of value (SoV) or hedge against what is currently going on, i.e. banking crisis. So smart investors are looking for a safe haven, which could be Bitcoin on the top of the list or even Gold I must say or Stocks for those who know how to play.So we will see, we've been in the pandemic and Bitcoin survived and it is one of the it's biggest test so far in it's young infancy.And with the banking crisis around, I think we will all be the winner as individuals are looking for a place of security.",
