He has about $1,400 in that wallet, before your transaction, and if he did not have access to it, how did he require you to send your $24 to that wallet?It's impossible.In addition, Binance does not give you private key or mnemonic seed and you can not import it to Electrum wallet. This is correct information because Binance is a centralized exchange and use it means he is using a custodial wallet.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

This one hasn't had outgoing transactions so far.OP, you either got scammed or some clipboard malware changed the BTC address. Did you double check the destination address on a separate communications channel?",

As far as you are concerned, he may be lying about it because there is no valid evidence to support his claims. If he does not accept a publicly available blockchain transaction as proof of payment, then he is trying to scam you.",

I don't know the business you are into with the recipient and you may not want to share for obvious reasons, but if our suspicion is right that the recipient is a scammer, then be careful because they will try to persuade you into depositing funds to them again, do not fall for it.",

So OP just like what the others have said to you the only evidence is to check the network explorer and that was done to see if the funds were sent to the right direction and when everything is confirmed there then you don’t need to bother about his own personal wallet or anything like that",

You still have a copy of it? Lol, scammers don't mind the amount involved because some of them are really broke niggas. Imagine scamming people up to twenty people $25 each and sum up the figures, it'll accumulate a reasonable amount. Someone scammed me amount that is equivalent to $2.5 in my local currency and blocked me   By the way, transaction can be checked by anyone on the blockchain but it doesn't make any difference since it can not be reversed. Moreover, Binance normally notify their users on the incoming transaction even before confirmation. Nothing seems to be clear here, I only perceive scam and Op should move on if the recipient insist not receiving funds.",

So good luck trying to prove to some officer that you had a deal with a stranger, that this is indeed his address, that he received his funds, that's you who has paid this and the funds are legit while with a bank you just fill a standard complaint checkable in minutes!But OP hasn't logged back on since he posted this question so he either got that resolved or realized there is nothing else to do than argue with that person, just like it was obvious from the start!",
