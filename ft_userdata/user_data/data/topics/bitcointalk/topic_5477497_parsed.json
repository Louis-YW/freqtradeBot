What in your opinion is most important for a campaign manager to get right for providing a good campaign? For me, it is a high quality requirement for participants to join. A good campaign manager needs to prevent spam. Of course, he needs to do a research if it's a legit project as well.",

Apart from being a forum rule, all forum members are aware that one of the qualifications for being accepted in a campaign is avoiding spam. Managers have no means of preventing, they only have to select and kick participants as activity behavior changes.",

A good campaign manager needs to prevent spam. They know their job and that's why they're working as one. In selection of participants, it varies from different managers and they have their own factors and requirements so let it alone depend on their likes and what they think is best for the campaign.Quote from: Bounty Bro on December 11, 2023, 10:11:41 PMOf course, he needs to do a research if it's a legit project as well. For the bounties, this is what they need to do. Many of the bounties there are new to the community and this is the hardest task of being a manager. They need to make sure that the one they'll accept to work on is a genuine one. All in all, the reputable ones know their thing and that's why they've built their reputation here because they know how to be one. It's not just all about post counting of participants that others think.",
