  "content": "Snarkcoin: A Post-Quantum Secure Peer-to-Peer Cryptocurrency with Inflation Resistance | SNARK, ₴By introducing the Post-Quantum security signature algorithm, a decentralized currency system Snarkcoin is designed. The operation of the Snarkcoin network is based on mathematical proofs and physical laws. The proof of power consensus and CPU friendly POW algorithm allows  Snarkcoin to be able to achieve a breakthrough level in decentralization, and security. The currency design enables Snarkcoin to run on various types of ubiquitous computing devices, enabling pervasive process of value, even that in multiple worlds.It is time to build a Post-Quantum Secure Cryptocurrency. Snarkcoin is an attempt to build a quantum secure cryptocurrency.Snarkcoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Snarkcoin is an open source global payment network, and fully decentralized without any central authorities. Features of Post-Quantum security make Snarkcoin as a replacement to Bitcoin. Snarkcoin's new cryptography algorithm of Falcon is an lattice-based cryptography algorithm and based on the theoretical framework of Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan. There is no efficient solving algorithm currently known in the general case, even with the help of quantum computers, because the underlying hard problem is the short integer solution problem (SIS) over NTRU lattices.The cryptography used by Snarkcoin is Falcon-512 which is one of NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)'s finalists for Post-Quantum security standards. This will make Snarkcoin to keep on ensuring its security characteristics even faced with quantum computers.Features:NIST's Post-Quantum Security Standard | FalconSymbol: SNARKTotal supply: 10500000Block Reward: 50Block time: 300 secondsPoW only, all coins are minedPoW Algorithm: Quark, CPU friendly algorithm, more inclusiveSegwit supported, reduce block size largelyPost-Quantum security signature algorithmFalcon - Fast-Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU. Falcon follows a framework introduced in 2008 by Gentry, Peikert, and Vaikuntanathan, the high-level idea is the following:The public key is a long basis of a q-ary lattice. The private key is (essentially) a short basis of the same lattice. In the signing procedure, the signer:Generates a random value saltComputes a target c=H(msg||salt), where H is a hash function sending an input to a random-looking point (on the grid)Uses his knowledge of a short basis to compute a lattice point v close to the target cOutputs (salt, s), where s=c−vIn the verifying procedure, The verifier accepts the signature (salt, s)if and only if the vector s is shortH(msg||salt) −s is a point on the lattice generated by his public key.For more information, please refer: https://falcon-sign.info/falcon.pdf======= Links =======Website: https://snarkco.in/Github: https://github.com/snarkcoin/snarkcoin/Explorer: http://explorer.snarkco.in/======= Wallet =======For Linux (Ubuntu), Windows, MacOShttps://github.com/snarkcoin/snarkcoin/releases======= Mining Pool and Miners =======Snarkcoin pools:NONE AS OF 07/11/2022Should be able to mine directly from wallet for now.Recommended to use these miners:CCMiner 2.3.1 for GPUs and cpuminer-opt for CPUs======= Exchange =======COMING SOON======= Community =======Snarkcoin is a community driven cryptocurrency.
