Some leaks suggest that RDNA3 is released in an unfinished stage, and why the next generation should be better (whether it will be named RNDA4 or RDNA3 super is unknown). Not sure how reliable it is though, but I'll keep that in mind since past records show that those leakers have some good track records. But I won't be surprised if they miss again after this.Quote from: FP91G on February 12, 2023, 10:03:00 AMI don't see performance breakthroughs.

For such mining, the miner needs to invest a lot of money in the cooling system.I'm not up to date with the latest leaks, but most narratives that I hear last time suggest that higher clocks are what they are aiming for. Efficiency is probably going to be a problem though unless they do another node shrink or use a new architecture. Judging from how the sales of the 40 series or 30 series are going on right now, hopefully, it will be cheaper instead of pricier. CMIIW.",

I don't have much hope of buying the 4XXX series because I am still not confident enough for the minable coins to return to be profitable in the short term, but it may be that for the 5xxx series things change again and it is good to keep an eye.But in any case I won't go with an immutable plan, I will watch how the market behaves and try to go with the flow.I'll watch the 4070 and 4060, but prices are still high in my opinion.",
