  "content": "From the initial Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi, NFT, Metaverse to this year's Web 3.0, new things are emerging in the blockchain industry, and more and more users and enterprises are getting involved, so the blockchain development wave is unstoppable。However, with the growth of blockchain ecosystem and application, there are more and more operations on the chain, and congestion has evolved from a \"small problem\" to a \"big pain point\", which is holding back the development of the whole blockchain.If the future is to use blockchain to build a value network, it should be able to perform at least as fast as the current real-time data processing speed of the entire Internet information, including 2 million emails per second, 65,000 Google searches, 72,000 Youtube videos, and so on.However, currently, Bitcoin can only process about 7 transactions per second and Ethereum can process around 15 transactions per second. Although some public blockchains in recent years have improved their performance over the previous ones, there is no single blockchain that can accommodate all the ecological applications by itself.Therefore, although more and more blockchains are getting better and better set up, they have become \"information silos\", isolated from each other. If these chains can be interconnected, then not only the on-chain scaling can be more ideal, but also the development of the whole blockchain can be greatly promoted.In order to achieve asset flow, information interoperability and application collaboration between different blockchain platforms, cross-chain technology was born. Twitter's Lightning Network, which supports the \"bitcoin payment\" reward function, is one of the applications of cross-chain technology, improving the transaction speed and usefulness of the bitcoin network.Genesis is focused on improving information processing performance, working to unblock congestion and reduce Gas effort, and paving the way for Web 3.0 infrastructure and the massive data transfers of the future metaverse. It strives to achieve speed and scalability improvements, resulting in a high-speed, stable, low-Gas-fee public blockchain.This means that in Genesis, different blockchains on different protocols and blockchains on other networks can view, access and share information with each other, breaking the information \"silos\" between different blockchains, achieving interoperability between different blockchains, and accommodating most of the ecological applications to some extent.Each protocol in the Genesis ecosystem stores different types of data and transaction information, and the interoperability of Genesis system enables blockchain users to share and access their data across platforms, protocols, and the entire network. interoperate across the entire network.In addition Genesis ecosystem was developed before the Genesis team was well aware of the need for its system to achieve faster speeds and greater scale. Therefore development studies were conducted specifically to address issues such as speed and scaling to ensure global adoption by individuals, governments and international organizations, to facilitate the practical application of public blockchains.The evolution of the blockchain scalability upgrade is fascinating, and Genesis gives us a technical template in terms of decentralized scalability, so let's wait and see the revolutionary enhancements it brings!",
