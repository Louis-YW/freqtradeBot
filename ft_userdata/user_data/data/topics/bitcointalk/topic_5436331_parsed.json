Yes, indeed there are lots of memes that are spread on the internet and we can see them at any time.But I still don't understand what the OP meant by creating this thread did he want and create this thread for an event to showcase the works of meme images created directly by each member of the forum or how I don't quite understand it.Because indeed the OP did not provide a clear and precise description of the thread he made.",

In short, don't criticize what we see in others if we don't want others to criticize what they see in us,it's that simple, right?",

This one is very funny actually, I mean I am practically laughing right now, and I think it is really funny for me because it's something I've experienced before..Went to the casino happy, and when coming back, I was full of thoughts, I wasn't actually actually worried about what my wife would do since I wasn't married by then, I was just worried because right after gambling the money away and walking out from the casino, I began to realize more better things I could have done with the money I just lost, I become anxious and really angry at my myself..",

Many people say we have done something even though we have nothing to do with it. Those who say it are only looking from the outside, but they are not trying to see what is really going on. It's like, don't judge a book by its cover.The picture is a parable that we often encounter in everyday life and many of which have nothing to do with gambling, like the writing in the picture. That's because we are used to seeing things from the outside.",
