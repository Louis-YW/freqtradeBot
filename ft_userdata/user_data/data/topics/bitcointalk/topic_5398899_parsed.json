  "content": "Introducing MDB and MDB+MDB is a BSC token offering perpetual growth thanks to is hyper deflationary nature and Trust Fund backing (liquidity is currently backed 593%!)MDB+ is the newest addition to our ecosystem - a stable backed token (backed by BUSD) that can only ever appreciate in value. Expected safe APY is well into double figures. It's volume dependant so there is no upper limit on the returns!There are some great explanations on our YouTube channel about how the ecosystem works and drives volume and thus growth in value:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNZ8ZADUtu-zHhvQJm-hilwHow does MDB and the Trust Fund work?Our unique and original mechanism, Capital Synergy, creates a cyclical effect whereby numerous components in the project come together to create an everlasting growth effect.‍Capital Synergy is the process of our Trust Fund (and the interest it generates) being utilized together to create exponential growth in the inherent value of the MDB token.‍Simply put, we have designed a system that acts as a growth engine and insurance policy all in one. Our Trust Fund is a high interest generating investment, with the interest used to buy back and burn the token, generating constant and everlasting buy pressure. That is Capital Synergy in a nutshell; MDB’s unique assets working together to create a compound effect resulting in perpetual growth.‍Thanks to Capital Synergy, even if there was zero volume, the value of the token would still increase.How does MDB+ work?MDB+ is an algorithmic stable token offering guaranteed appreciation pegged to USD.‍How can a stable token appreciate?‍Each MDB+ buy and sell carries tiny taxes (1% buy and sell combined) which go straight into the liquidity pool. MDB+ tokens are minted at purchase and burned at sale, meaning that the liquidity is always growing steadily higher than the number of tokens in circulation.‍We expect an APY of double digits comfortably, although it is volume dependent and so the ROI is not a set number.‍If you're looking for a stable token to store your funds, whilst growing in value, MDB+ offers a solution.https://mdb.fundhttps://twitter.com/mdb_defihttps://discord.gg/milliondollarbabyhttps://t.me/mdbtoken",
