Thank you for your comment! We have corrected all the errors!Quote from: OmegaStarScream on July 16, 2023, 10:05:16 AMI made an account to test things out but I couldn't do much since you require KYC, so could you please explain what you mean by \"fees from 0% for withdrawal\" in the OP, and also this part from your website?Quote* Commission adjustments are possible depending on the degree of risk of the business area.Are you charging the user fees based on where they are? I would've maybe understood if you were dealing with fiat and international payments, but this is for receiving crypto.2. As for charges, we charge 0% commission for incoming payments. For withdrawals, we charge Crypto: 0.5% + Network Fee, and for Fiat: 1% + Bank Fee.We do not charge any fee to users, which might depend on their location. Whether it's Cyprus or the UK, the fees will be the same.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on July 16, 2023, 10:05:16 AM* Commission adjustments are possible depending on the degree of risk of the business area.The commission may be adjusted depending on the riskiness of the project activity, e.g. gambling, casino, etc.Here's an example.If an ordinary online store selling clothes wants to connect to Acceptcoin, it is clear that there are no risks for anyone. Everything is legal, and the legislation does not prohibit this type of business in any country. However, if it is a project of some dubious nature, for example, in some countries, there is legalization of the sale of certain drugs through an online store. For instance, Australia recently legalized LSD. Therefore, if Acceptcoin wants to connect a person from Australia with such an online store, it is a big risk for Acceptcoin. As a result, we can adjust the commission in such a case. Verification of such projects is done through the administrator of the resource, with whom commissions and other important issues are negotiated.",

We are a licensed service and provide our services exclusively to verified users. Therefore, KYC and AML policy directives require registration. Thank you for your recommendations, but this service has a different approach to client interaction. Accepting digital assets without registration and an associated account for transaction management and analytical monitoring is difficult to envision in the implementation of an open-source solution without an account registration.",

Which differences exist between what you're offering to market leaders?Operating under KYC/AML policies will be an advantage for those businesses that wish to remain 100% within the legal framework. Furthermore, the crypto-business sector is progressively falling under regulatory oversight, and it's possible that our competitors, particularly market leaders, will soon implement similar requirements. In this context, we are acting ahead of the curve. In addition, the identity verification procedure is necessary to prevent any fraudulent actions with your funds.",

Although I haven't subscribed to any of your services but I think the services provided are good for a start. One thing I noticed is that the Acceptcoin.io doesn't have a mobile application on iOS and even on android. I think improving on that aspect will increase the usability and credibility of the platform. Another thing is we cannot tell were your company is located which is bad for business.The question I also wanted to ask was whether the company has considered bringing in the P2P platform that will allow you trade directly with other users?",
