No need for cgminer when running an asic pointed at a poolI would like to view stratum data between my ASIC (S9) and mining pool. The previous answer mentions wireshark....would this be my option? What particulars do i need to setup this connection to monitor stratum data?All help appreciated",

You can tell exactly what is going on by yourself from your own mining software talking to your own mining pool.Bitcoin Magazine: Why Bitcoin Mining Needs Stratum V2Sigh, still trying to trumpet that waste of time.There's nothing new there.GBT existed long ago and died for good reason, trying to resurrect GBT for marketing and calling it v2 is simply that, marketing.The data requirements make it unusable, so as before with GBT, no one ever implemented any transaction bias within miners.... and what you call v2 is that, transaction bias. Previously called GBT.This issue about risks of pools destroying bitcoin is as ludicrous as saying that miners will destroy bitcoin.The system exists in such a way that it is to the advantage of pools and miners to not alienate themselves from the rest of the network.I will agree that miners in general are indeed stupid, and greed makes them blind.This is clearly apparent by the fact that most mine on pools that risk the bitcoin network on every block change.Your pool does this also.Or I could also point out that they let slide pools like yours ripping off their miners and sweeping it under the carpet as you've done 3 times.Alas that has no effect on bitcoin itself, but on you as happened when you recently lost a massive amount of hash rate.I guess you guys never learn though, coz you lost it before for the same reason.Though probably the fact that you make enough money anyway and recover by deception is the reason why you keep doing it.",
