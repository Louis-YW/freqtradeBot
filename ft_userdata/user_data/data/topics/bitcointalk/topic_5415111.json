  "content": "Sweeteye's sweet auction of a very beautiful .1 Silver Lealana buyer funded with Black letters reminded me of an ongoing question about the rarity of these coins. The Encyclopedia lists the following numbers: LEALANALTC 1 with BF/Blk - pop of 40LTC 5 with BF/Blk - pop of 10 LTC 10 with BF/Blk - pop of 10 BTC .1 BRASS with BF/Blk - pop of 100BTC .1 SILVER with BF/Blk - pop of 10BTC .25 SILVER with BF/Blk - pop of 10BTC .5 SILVER w BF/Blk - pop 10BTC 1 SILVER 'Gold B; w BF/Blk - pop 10Honorable mentions: BTC .25 & .5 with Gold Holograms (25 & 10) and with Gold Hologram and BF/Blk (<3 of each)Every time these numbers come up they are disputed (which I am not arguing for or against). I am curious to know what we actually know. Any insight can help get closer to the real target numbers. Huge thanks Steeley",

This helps and kind of muddies the water at the same time. I’m not sure there will be a definitive number of Buyer Funded Black accounted for. It also gets muddier with the .5 and .25 btc silvers. For example, Smoothie says there are 1000 .25 BTC silvers, 200 with gold holos. how many are black ltrs, bf/blk and  of the 200 gold holos how many  are green, blk and  BF/Black? 10-20 bf/blk probably using Sweeteye’s suggestion of 5-10%.  Then… An even bigger rarity is a BF/Blk version of these two coins with a gold hologram instead of the standard silver hologram, but even Smoothie’s accounting does not specify these. Anyway, this is all very nerdy but I hope we celebrate these as rarities. It’s good for the hobbyist.",
