  "content": "Do you have a morning routine as a day trader? I find that  whenever I follow my morning routine before trading, my focus is unbeatable in the charts and analysis. I usually wake up by 6am and start with cardio or just walk my dog. Next is a light breakfast. Eating light meals is essential because I won't feel very heavy and dull. And on some days, depending on how I feel, I skip breakfast totally for some homemade juice. I repeat my mantra several times ,\" today is already a great day.\" After which I go to my computer and start trading. On somedays I make good profits on some other days, I don't. Overall, my morning routine keeps me mentally prepared to face the day. Kindly share some of your morning routine before trading.",

How you start your day has an effect on how that day will go. A good morning routine that sets you out feeling good and positive will influence your energy for that day, you will have a clear mind, clear mind which is required to make good analysis. Imagine having a bad morning where you have a lot of emotional trouble in your head, your analysis may become flawed. A morning routine affects your whole day, as a trader, having a good morning routine that helps you clear your mind and boost positive energy can be essential to making good trading analysis.",

      "body": "It might have. I mean if  a certain routine makes you feel better, it would force you to make good decisions. If you somehow missed your routine, then you won’t feel so good and when a person is upset about something (in this case it is your daily routine), he/she tends to make shitty decisions. It is all human psychology.However missing your daily routine is not the only thing that would make you upset. It could be anything. Maybe you had an argument with you wife yesterday and you are still angry at her. That could affect your mood and decisions in a bad way as well.When you sit in front of the PC and start trading you should be able forget all that. If you can’t trade when you miss your daily routine, then you shouldn’t make any trades that day. Simple as that. First prepare yourself mentally, then make trades.",

      "body": "Not related to trading - But, I noticed that each time I joined some student in their early morning jogging routine when coming back from my class, I'm always active and have some unusual energy. Normally, when you return from night class you're supposed to sleep throughout the whole day to reagain your energy. But, each time I carryout exercises in the morning like jogging from my class to hostel I always observe strength and also that desire to sleep and water the whole day leaves. So I guess applying it to trading could also yield same results as it help to increase your mind's focus and also increases concentration which is essential for trading.",

At least at night I can sleep away goodbye on losses in case I have a bad profit. I usually do day trading if there's an action in the market like FUD or Hype to make sure that I can earn decent profit on the volatility by just using low leverage trading only. But  I doubt that my morning routine will affect my trading even if I will trade in morning because my trade still depends on the chart and my recent activities usually doesn't affect the result of my current activity unless I have a bad incident on my morning routine that will make me loss focus. I will halt on trading if that's the case tho.",

You feel that everything since the morning is going right, you have followed your routine which means everything is going right so you manifest that your trading too will go correct this time and you trade with the right mindset which ultimately gives you profit. You can say it's sort of a chain reaction which sets the mood for everything.",

Sports activities and the like can reduce stress in our minds and even according to health it is very good to do. If our body is in good shape and our brain is fresh, then our mentality will be very good to start trading.We can feel it by ourselves, if we just stay silent then our bodies will feel heavy and even as if we are doing hard work, even though, we are not doing anything.

It helps our body to have better fitness that impacts our mental health too.With better physical and mental health, we can work better, more productively and efficiently. If trading is your daily job, you have many hours in a day to trade so let's spend about one hour in early morning for physical exercise. That is good for health and your trading too.Beside health and mental issue, another issue is if you over trade, you make more mistake and get more loss.An important step before I open a trading position, is to zoom in and zoom out the chart and consider long term and short term situations.",
