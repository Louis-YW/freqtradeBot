This means you will spend awhile minus withdrawing trading profits to spend, but this must be followed by strict risk management strategy to avoid making huge losses in case the market does not move as intended.",

Consequently your ROI will be lower.Anyway, I think borrowing to trade especially if you aim at big capital is bad. You will lose control someday.On exchanges, you can do it with leverages but I don't recommend it for above reasons.In the forum, you can borrow money in Lending boardIf you are lazy, you can check a short list from my topic: [Overview] Bitcointalk Services from Bitcointalk Members",

So if you are basically talking about fund raising or getting some fund support or partnerships then i would say that this would be tough.Why? Trust issue would be the main problem on here.Everyone could really make out some claims that they are profitable and say they would be needing funds.How you would assure the security of those funds for you not to easily ran away with those amounts?It wont be surprising if you wont really be getting anything on what you are tending or plans in mind.So the best shot you do is on having that bigger capital is to take up someloan or simply re-roll your profits until it becomes big since you had mentioned you are profitable then it would just be easy for you to do so.",

Although @tranthidung has written some interesting things, I'll add my thoughts o that:* I don't think that anybody on this forum will lend you money without collateral; it's too risky, no matter what you say* it won't be easy to convince others give you money for trading cryptocurrencies; again, too risky* even if you get somebody lend you money, it won't be good, since you'll be then under pressure to perform and, as said, that's how mistakes start piling up; even more, mistakes can make you lose your money and the loaned money, and then you will be in trouble. So imho, this direction you want to take... doesn't worth it.",

I know nothing about  fundraising so please guide me through this process for my better future. Thanks. Raising fund is not the best option for you here in my view,  to quote you \"trading since more than Four years and earning good\" why would you need fund raising in that case? , some of those your earnings should have been added to your trading funds (compounded) meaning if you had a trading capital of $500-$1000 for instance, should have double or trippled in size which should bring your trading capital around $1000-$3000 even in both plus and minus (profit and lose) since that four years by doing so.which means if you're exposing 2% of your trading, you should be having enough money to trade and would not be looking for fund raising. But if you need larger funds then \"BluFx\" can help you on that.",

You have been doing trading for more than 4 years, normally you must have that kind of knowledge. One of them is knowledge about money management. Money management is one of the key factors in trading. This includes how much to invest and how much to earn or gain. Additionally, it also includes how you can manage again your money from the profits. If during trading you don't make any money management or use some parts of your trading profits to increase the capital, you may not be able to rise higher. In my opinion, the best thing is by using some of the profits to add the capital for trading so that you can also earn higher. Never think of taking loan in this case",

I second this. Never ever borrow money or get a loan so that you can use it to trade (Borrowed money is money you can afford to lose) and trust me when trading you will have a lot of pressure and emotions will affect your decision making.Also, never selling something valuable like a house, a business etc. so that you can trade using that money. It in most cases ends so badly. Got a friend who sold off his business not so long ago to buy some shitcoins, shortly before the that Luna crash.The crypto crash left him so devastated and suicidal as he expected to make some quick profits within a week to pay up a debt. Life has never been the same again for him.",

You've said that you are earning well, then I could say that you already have the capability to increase your funds. What you gonna do are,  - save your profit - stop the overspending habit - stay focused on your goalApparently, nothing could help you achieve what you want but just yourselves. If you have the commitment to do this then it was not impossible and even no need to ask for opinions from others as it was literally YOU who could make it.",

When you already have structured financial management, I think you can raise money for bigger capital. If not then no matter how much you trade and no matter how long you have poor financial management it's hard to achieve. You are a trader, you should already know that trading is not only focused on profit but instead dividing the income into one container and separating the capital first. This is an essential thing that was definitely realized from the start. Plus crypto trading is volatile which doesn't always show the crypto that is traded always gives a profit.",
