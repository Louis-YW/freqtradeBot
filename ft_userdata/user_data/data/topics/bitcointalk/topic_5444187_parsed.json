  "content": "Hello EveryoneI have been using Exodus wallet for years to receive and to send crypto.On 10 Feb 2023 I decided to make two swaps to exchange 1.3 BTC  and 1.4 BTC to ETH.Before to make a swap Exodus tells you that operation is going to be performed by some 3d party but they do not let you accept some 3d party terms and they do not name directly exchange which will perform the operation:This is how it looks like:In fact these swaps are made by http://n.exchange/ Bot of my swaps were suspended.And only in three days they replied me that I need to pass KYC:I asked if it is possible to cancel both swaps and just get the refund.They said OK and asked to wait for 21 days:However after two days they changed their mind and asked to pass KYC even if I want just my 2.7 BTC back, yes just back to the originating address.I passed that damn KYC    Yes I disclosed my identity and my residence address with all supporting documents. However even after the KYC procedure they refused to make a refund and requested some “substantiating record”  Every time I asked what it can be they could not explain. Examples of the stuff they asked:“exchange withdrawal history”“chat logs with your partners”“pictures or any other written proof”“wallet screenshots of the parties who sent me bitcoins before” (even half a year ago)for some reason exodus screenshots (even if my partner has Exodus wallet too) would not be accepted ha ha  Today, after one month passed and I persuaded my partners to make screenshots of their wallets and provided all the rest my 2.7 bitcoins are still on hold by the fraudulent n.exchangeYes n.exchnage just holds my coins.Let me sum up:1) I passed KYC2) I fulfilled their AML request by providing  substantial records from my counter parties3) I checked tx they asked screenshots for by AMLBot and the risk score was just 11-13% (!)4) There is no any request from any law enforcement or police related to my identity, activity and/or crypto transactions5) 31 days have passed since the lockI assume that in such case they have zero risk to return bitcons to the the originating address I sent it from. I do not ask any swap or exchange anymore – just return me by bitcoins! To ME, to MY WALLET I sent it from.All the month I was in communication with Exodus support as well, and I was shocked that they were aware of the situation. But every time they say that they cannot be responsible for 3d party API.Ridiculous, Exodus integrated  N.Exchange as it's back end, sends tons of traffic, received feedback from me (and not only me) that N.Exchange is a pure fraud but does not do anything. But after I found that back in 2020 Exodus had the same experience with 3d party API of CoinSwitch (you may google “exodus coinswitch scam”) I think that this is just a business model for Exodus. Otherwise I cannot find a reason why they put an absolute scam exchange on their backend and do not do anything when they get 100% scam report from users. As for N.Exchange  it was founded by Oleg Belousov (Oлeг Дмитpиeвич Бeлoycoв) , born on 11.12.1990 (11 December) in Uzbekistan,  a citizen of Israel, lives in Germany and operates most of his business from Lithuania.They do not display any legal or physical entity on their site. Support phone has never been picked up. Telegram group is restriced  for posting. It took me some time to understand who stands begind the exchange. They do not provide any personal information to stay in dark as much has possible and at the same time they keep saying that they have to follow KYC/AML policy  His legal entities in fact are:YOA Ltd in UK and Nexchange solutions UAB in LithuaniaTomorrow I will have an appointment with a lawyer and my next steps will be to restore the justice in a long legal way. I dont care how expensive it is going to be but I have enough spare satoshi to make Belousov and Exodus pay off the debts.Please write here or PM who found himself in the same situation with those criminals from Exodus and N.exchnageMaxim",

While for the exchange this is my first time hearing of it, and since I have no experience at all with it it would be difficult for me to give any thing related to it. The  main question I have to ask concerning Exodus and N.Exchange is; Do they have any official account here on bitcointalk? If they do you could pm them to help you look at the issue and besides Exodus should also involved themselves in this issue because they were the main cause of this issue, if they had not used N.Exchange I'm sure everything would have gone smoothly. This is one of the major reasons why I don't use wallet swap options I prefer to send the coin to a more reputable exchange and do whatever I want with it there.",

I think it's already out of Exodus' jurisdiction with your transaction as you're dealing and talking with a nexchange support staff. The problem is on them and basically the amount you've swapped with them probably triggered and caught you off guard even if you just want a refund. On this case, it's hard to be prideful even if you don't want to comply with KYC but if it's your fund that's been held by any of these platforms, you can do nothing but to proceed and obey.Just don't use them again.",

I wouldn't even be surprised if there are deeper connections between Exodus and N.Exchange as that would explain why are they using them for swap when there's so many alternative options. Another argument for that is that they don't even let you know that they are using them for swap, and that doesn't make any sense unless they somehow benefit from it.Btw what's the situation, did you apply some pressure on Exodus via their social media accounts and channels, or is there any reply from N.Exchange?",
