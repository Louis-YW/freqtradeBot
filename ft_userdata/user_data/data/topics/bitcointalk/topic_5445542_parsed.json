I'm not sure if the problem is with your hosting or if the coding is problematic, but if I have to wait between 30-60 seconds to open the page I lose interest very easily. if you want it to be attractive for anyone to advertise there, you have to significantly improve the speed of the site.since you are relatively new in this kind of service offer, it is also a good idea to first create your own brand and secure a visitor base, and only then start monetizing such traffic.your page is not even ranked on metrics like Similarweb, which confirms that you are at the very beginning. I would like to see the basis on which you determined that advertising on your site is worth as much as you indicated.Quote from: pingu39 on March 19, 2023, 10:42:19 PMThere are many websites where you can list your coins and tokens for free.do they have a monopoly on this type of service? healthy competition is always good, right?",

      "body": "I'm not sure about speed, but OP should improve the listing filter. There are many projects that got listed with a presale dated back to 2022 with terrible information. For example, stuff like this[1]. There is no way a trader would use this website compared to others who have better listing information. You need to improve your service if you want to compete with them unless your target shitcoin developer who wants to market their projects as cheaply as possible.[1] https://www.coinvotelist.com/coin/shiny-inu",

      "body": "I like the settings of the website, it has the necessary pages expected of a responsive website. As for speed, the pages loads faster on mobile, I don't know for PC. Above all, what matters is providing quality to visitors, so that they won't fall into the hands of shitcoins that'll end up wasting their time and money. Also the submission page you have there is quite necessary as you claim to review the projects before publishing. How do you predict a good project before listing on the website? Lastly, why not create an about us page that open differently instead of writing it below the home page, or add a sub topic, About us, to the one you already wrote. Good luck.",

      "body": "From my side, I will not be in bad faith, the site is very fast. The pages load in two or three seconds maximum, it's very responsive. I don't know if the capacity of the servers is limited and if the site slows down a lot when it's busy, but after reading the previous feedbacks, I was pleasantly surprised by the navigation on the site.The organization and the infrastructure of the site is rather clean, it is pleasant to navigate on it. I only use the dark-mode, so I didn't see the site without dark-mode but overall it didn't give me a headache.On the other hand, there is a page that surprised me a lot : https://www.coinvotelist.com/kyc-projectWho would want to pay 1 or 1.5 BNB to pass your KYC? You have no legitimacy to collect, store -and potentially resell- such sensitive personal data.Who will guarantee that the site will not be down next week? What guarantee do you offer to those who decide to pay? Nothing about the storage, and the security of the said datas.I find it very shady, we are supposed to contact you on Telegram, to pay you, all that to self-doxx myself to strangers? That won't give confidence to anyone.",
