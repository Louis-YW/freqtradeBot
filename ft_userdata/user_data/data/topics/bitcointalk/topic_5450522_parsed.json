At the moment, that puts them somewhere around 4 vMB from the tip of the mempool. Neither transaction is opted in to RBF.Your options are to wait a bit longer (I would be hopeful they would confirm within the next hour or two), or perform a child pays for parent. I assume bc1q8s5zta0e6p2aafw2n9te4nsn0qkjzcmtv6cfkr is your change address.If you send all the coins on bc1q8s5zta0e6p2aafw2n9te4nsn0qkjzcmtv6cfkr to another address you control, the transaction will be ~110 vbytes in size. Combined with your other two transactions, that would be a total size of 526 vbytes. To get to an effective fee rate of 40 sats/vbyte, you would need a total fee of 21,000 sats. You've already paid 7,264 sats in fees, so the fee for the new transaction would need to be around 14,000 sats, or 125 sats/vbyte.",

Electrum is one of the popular open source Bitcoin wallets that has that feature.With an RBF enabled transaction, Should it get stuck for sometime in Â the mempool due to lower fee rate that the current fee rate required to confirm the transaction in the next block. All you have to do is bump up (increase) the fee rateQuote from: cardozltd on April 28, 2023, 04:09:55 PMdo you have any eta of how long it will take?No exact time, it could be in the next 30 minutes or even several hours depending on the state of the mempool which keeps changing and how quickly the next blocks will be minedAlso on of the members submitted your transaction to the ViaBTC transaction accelerator, if ViaBTC mining pool mine a bitcoin block earlier, be sure your transaction will be included in the block by the miners.",

You could get fast confirmation with lower fee rate. In the past 24 hours, any transaction paying at least 40 sat/vbyte has been confirmed in the first block after being broadcasted. By the way, as mentioned above by DaveF, OP's transactions have been already confirmed.",

OP first message in 2017 was also about struck transactions and 6 years later he still has same issues. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1792773.msg17876238#msg17876238I set fee according to urgency of transactions. If I have to do an urgent transactions then I set high fee and vice versa. With Low fee we need to be patient, as its takes time for a transaction to settle.",

I would recommend you stop using it. There was absolutely no need for you to pay such a fee.For a very accurate but slightly more complex way to select an appropriate fee, read the graph here: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),8h,weightFor a slightly less accurate but very simple way to select an appropriate fee, pick your priority from the box here: https://mempool.space/As hosseinimr93 says, there was only one instance over the last 24 hours where the minimum fee to get included in the next block was 40 sats/vbyte. It was never anywhere near 80 sats/vbyte, and most of the time was sitting somewhere between 10-20 sats/vbyte.",
