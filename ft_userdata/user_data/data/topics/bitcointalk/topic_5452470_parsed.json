  "content": "The cornerstone of AI, a new beginning.Since OPENAI released GPT-3, the development of large models has seen explosive growth. However, expensive computing costs have slowed down the pace of AI progress. The use of GPUs also requires certain skills and experience, which is also a threshold for beginners. Therefore, we hope to establish a decentralized machine learning platform using R2D2AI, so that anyone can use their GPU computing power to train large-scale models and receive corresponding rewards. This will make machine learning more open and democratic, allowing more people to participate in the development of machine learning.The previous PoW algorithms mostly used GPUs or mining machines to calculate specific hash values, which not only wasted computing power but also huge waste of electricity. R2D2AI is implemented based on blockchain technology, but no longer uses computational power to calculate hash values, but instead uses computational power for training and reasoning of large models. In the R2D2AI network, GPUs that meet the requirements can become nodes and contribute their computing power to ensure the operation of the network. At the same time, users can rent out their GPU computing power to those who need to train models and reasoning, in order to receive corresponding rewards.Some Links:https://r2d2ai.orgWhitepaper:https://r2d2ai.org/r2air.pdftwitter:https://twitter.com/R2D2AIRobotemail:admin@r2d2ai.org",

How many developers do you have working on the project currently? because if you want this project to scale you will need a lot of capital to employ good developers to keep working on the project. I will keep looking at how the project develops with time, give a time they say",

      "body": "Do you mean like render token? Yeah that is a sound idea there is gonna be demand for your GPU power. Dont think it makes sense to narrow it down to AI field cos GPU power can still go toward math computations or editing work. There is a hodge podge of things that could put computing power to good use. If done in decentralized manner this can be a win for all project.",
