ARB is indeed good for a long-term investment and I have started to investing in ARB, so if the price of ARB rises to reach the ATH price or even create a new ATH price, then of course I can get a big profits from investing in ARB at this time, so from that I have started to investing in ARB every month.",

Bitcoin needs to dump below 25K in able for ARB token to dip that far from the current price. Crypto market is on the uptrend movement plus ARB tokens is very hot. The chance of this token to pump is very high base on the current market condition than dipping to 0.5$. Probably the crypto rally is over for ARB tokens to go that far.Anyway, There’s no harm on waiting for the price to dip just to play safe. The only problem was you might missed the hype of this token and buy when it’s already stable on the dip.",

As said being a rising star, we still don't know how long will last the trend that it has got recently. Those that have invested a lot on it, hopefully, you're able to capitalize your profits on it and can now buy while it's on $1. I haven't bought it yet but trying to monitor as there's a huge community that has been built through it and that's what my factor being thought off as a support to its potential rise.",

However, the current value of ARB is $1.32 and is considered very positive compared to the volatility of other altcoins. Arbitrum is a layer 2 platform of Ethereum that provides a solution to reduce costs and speed up transactions on this network. It helps to solve problems related to slow processing speed and high transaction fees on Ethereum. Arbitrum uses a technique called Optimistic Rollup to compress transactions into a block and minimize the number of times transactions need to be confirmed on the main chain.It's basically bringing its own solutions that can be the direction of development and explosive trends for many projects in the future, so I don't have any doubts about its price or potential. it in the future.",

From the point of someone who has used both: you can't even compare them. Well you can but any other similar service is so much behind that i would short them all now. If arbitrum doesn't end up have a fatal exploit that would compromise everything, they are definitely winning the space. I mean why would i use anything else now that i can use something free of charge?I am not sure how much people value the governage token model, and how much value the token will have but it sure as hell can be more than any competition.",

Please contact me should you have any inquiries. Well Arbitrum is by far the most used Ethereum Layer 2 at the moment as far as i know so it definitely has a reason why it entered the coinmarket cap ranking at around rank 30 from the beginning. I am not so sure though if there is enough room to grow in the future. I would think that the hype around Arbitrum is at the highest point right now because of the huge airdrop and so on. Also a lot of people are still holding their airdrop tokens and as soon as the price would try to break 2$ for example i would guess that people from the airdrop would start to sell off again and that would create a huge resistance. I think there are other projects out there that i would rather invest in now.",

And we can say that right now, it might be hype for investors and just wanted to make money out of it.But if you believed though that it's a good project with their promising Layer 2 then invest on itWho knows, in the next bull run it could be big, so good luck with your project.",

This of course will have an impact on price increases as well as the adoption of Arbitrum itself.

In the future with that many coins there will be a lot of inflation and the price will be much lower than now. ARB is just another airdrop hype, nothing more.
