  "content": "In a recent interview with SEC chairman Gary Gensler, there was something that caught my attention. The chairman stated that \"Bitcoin is not that decentralized\". That's \"partially due to the prominence of centralized crypto exchanges\". You can read all about it here: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/14/cnbc-transcript-sec-chair-gary-gensler-speaks-with-cnbcs-squawk-box-today-.htmlI'm afraid he's right, especially when CEXs hold most of BTC's circulating supply (eg: Binance). It's even worse now with the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC. Institutional investment companies like BlackRock, VanEck, and MicroStrategy are accumulating large amounts of the cryptocurrency. We're essentially selling our BTC to companies driven by mainstream governments' own interests. With this, Bitcoin's true value proposition has failed (banks win). At least, the code is open source. If BTC becomes compromised, what's stopping us from moving to a more decentralized chain in the future (Litecoin, Monero)?Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

Perhaps it is a much bigger problem for us that miners from China (and other parts of the world) have moved to the US, and we can never know what the politicians in that country may come up with literally overnight. If Mr. T becomes president again, who knows what crazy ideas he might come up with.As for who buys or sells BTC, it's a free market and no one can do anything there, and no matter how you turn it, someone won't like it. Let's remember what the reactions are when a bank refuses to process crypto transactions, or when a well-known banker says something negative about Bitcoin - and now that they have begun to speak and act positively, we again wonder where this is going.Fortunately, not everyone sells, and it remains to be seen what will happen when (if) supply becomes greater than demand.",

Later, he follows up with a bit of US history, about the idea of 'buying the basket' instead of buying individual stocks, and how that democratizes but also centralizes finance.To me, it looks like it's just his overall position that centralization is natural and perhaps even positive, so he views Bitcoin in light of that position.But as long as people are legally allowed to store their coins in non-custodial wallets, I think it's fine that some choose centralized platforms.",

So if you are an individual who wants to keep your BTC in self-custody, youll always have that right...  unless you opt to sell off your stash, that is!  Sure, selling might mean rebuying at a higher price later, but thats on you, buddy.  You cannot have a global decentralized internet currency without a free market.Really, the only way bitcoin loses its decentralization is if the bulk of node operators voluntarily shut down their setups.  But I dont see that happening in the foreseeable future.",

For them to affect the network they need to control more than the total hash power of the network and that’s still limited to some decisions as they also need other nodes to accept some consensus rule, this is decentralization to me even if it is not total decentralization.",

In other words, most Bitcoin investors hold Bitcoin in the same way they hold AAPL or MSFT.That's not in any remote way, \"decentralized\". Most investors don't even know what a \"private key\" is, let alone keep it physically on their person.As I wrote in the Anon Paradox, most average consumers don't want the kind of \"privacy\" that means escaping the government, they just want their actions kept from everybody else but a government with a court-ordered subpoena. For the latter, the only people that actually care about that are those who go against the law where they live, and most people don't want to tangle with their government.So Bitcoin's decentralized architecture is not a value to most people who invest in Bitcoin, so it makes sense that most people don't use it that way.Today, in practical reality, Bitcoin for most people is an investment in a brand, or an abstract idea, or a name that they know and think will go up in value. They don't know what it means and they don't care.Yes, the blockchain architecture enables a decentralized ledger, and yes, technically Bitcoin is decentralized, but that's not the way consumers use it, and that's what somebody like Gary Gensler concerns himself with in his role as SEC chair.",
