It's unfortunate short posts are not usually valued whether valuable or not. So, we try to bloat certain posts that are meant to be short just to please the reporters and deleters. My only issue with the deleted post is the word \"cycle\". It's as if it's saying we are guranteed to have rain which comes in cycle. You know how difficult it's when you realize that no rain blessed regions is immune to drought and certain rainmakers have power to cause rain to fall in regions experiencing draughts.",
