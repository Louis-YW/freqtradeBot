But how can an nft system be of trending if thats not gonna hold its current era right. Werent gonna stick on blockchain itself cause technology is evolving. These nft are created for a reason and not solely for scam I believe. We can say its a bigger problem if its a lot of issue happening than blockchain hindrances.",

I believe you're mad because you're rekt in NFT while you can still made a profit on LUNA/UST, that's why you call NFT are more dangerous than LUNA/UST.

And owning something by registering it on the blockchain was back in the Namecoin I think where someone just add his data on the blockchain like he own a domain. The technology was there long time ago, its just today it was pretty much hype like the P2E which already existed back in 2017 game and then hyped in 2020. But marketing makes a difference and so making a living out of it becomes a trend.",

As per my understanding on Ethereum they are in the form of Erc-721 format and every single of them is uniques. If you have any proof that they are not on the Blockchain then please share some proof here. I do agree that they are over hyped and I also believe that just like dotcom bubble burst this hype will also burst in the coming days. I beleive that NFT's has become a way to convert black fiat to white fiat and this process of conversion won't stay much longer.",

Well, I half agree with the case of NFTs but not because of where it is stored. It is the assurance of the capability of an NFT to be valuable in the long run. It's a risk that might be worst than just buying an altcoin directly. But who knows, when we are young did we even know that baseball cards or basketball cards will be valuable someday? No. We just played it and traded with our friends.",

The hash or metadata of the token itself is indeed unique, and the ownership is owned by a specific private key. Nevertheless, the content itself does not represent within the metadata or is even unique. The content is only being pointed by the metadata, for example, only to centralized storage services which conclude OP opinion. After all, some NFTs were indeed only pointing to a centralized service whereas the token or the content can be removed.",

Anyone can open one of those art pieces on his device without even buying it and press the print-screen button on the keyboard, paste on photoshop or paint and voilà, he owns the same content the NFT buyer is going to own: a digital picture displayed on his screen. I think the only reason pirates aren't interested in copying this content to resell in large scale it's because the art pieces are worthless and nobody is really actually interested on them, but on the speculative hype or on the benefits it can generate for some wealthy people who are used to launder money through art pieces.Good NFTs are the ones which bring features and real benefits to users.",
