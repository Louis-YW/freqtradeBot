  "content": "The big problem isn't the spike proteins found in natural covid. Rather, its the spike protein 'soup' found in the vaccines that is the problem.The vaccines apparently work for spike proteins, even though they present many problems on their own. In fact, the vaccines work so well, that they lock the body into believing that it will never be invaded by spike proteins again, even though this is not true. Then, when covid invades again (or for the first time in some people), their bodies don't detect the covid, and the people are left without a fighting mechanism in place. They get sicker than ever, and often die, all because of the vaccines.So, here is help.EXPERT: Nattokinase detoxifies covid spike proteins from the bodyhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-02-23-nattokinase-detoxifies-covid-spike-proteins-from-body.htmlDr. Peter McCullough, MD, MPH, has dropped another bombshell revelation, this time about how nattokinase, a natural enzyme found in fermented soybeans, is a powerful remedy against Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) spike proteins.McCullough says he is asked all the time by people who got “vaccinated” for covid what they can do to “get this out of my body.” This inspired him to write a piece about nattokinase that calls the substance the “holy grail of covid-19 vaccine detoxification.”“The mRNA and adenoviral DNA products were rolled out with no idea on how or when the body would ever breakdown the genetic code,” McCullough writes. “The synthetic mRNA carried on lipid nanoparticles appears to be resistant to breakdown by human ribonucleases by design so the product would be long-lasting and produce the protein product of interest for a considerable time period.”“This would be an advantage for a normal human protein being replaced in a rare genetic deficiency state (e.g., alpha galactosidase in Fabry’s disease). However, it is a big problem when the protein is the pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 Spike. The adenoviral DNA (Janssen) should be broken down by deoxyribonuclease, however this has not been exhaustively studied.”(Related: The SARS-CoV-2 “virus” has still never been isolated.)So what can one do to induce the dissolution of these spike proteins? Nattokinase, McCullough says, holds the greatest promise out of any other detoxification agent of which he is aware. And the best part is that it is relatively inexpensive, and is sold over the counter as a dietary supplement....",

      "body": "If you can't detoxify Covid, maybe you can use your Covid knowledge to help detoxify the government and hospitals. But remember one thing. About 25% to 30% of your friends and neighbors work for the medical. You just might make enemies of them by accident.How To Survive COVID Hospital Protocols https://www.activistpost.com/2023/08/how-to-survive-covid-hospital-protocols.htmlIt explains that preparing a simple form now and submitting in the right way at the right time can help protect your rights and life if you have to be hospitalized.In 'Making a Killing': How Hospitals Profited From Deadly COVID Protocols, Stella Paul said on 5/19/23:The federal government sent Patty Myers $9,000 to pay for her husband's funeral — she used the money to make a documentary about how COVID-19 protocols killed patients like her husband while generating big profits for hospitals.The article points out:\"When the federal government sent $9,000 to Patty Myers to pay for her husband's funeral, she got angry. \"I didn't want to take a penny. It felt like hush money, like they were paying me to keep quiet about how my husband died in the hospital,\" she said.In a burst of inspiration, Patty decided to take the government's money and use it to make a documentary. She found a director through a church friend on Facebook. She created, \"Making A Killing,\" which exposes the COVID-19 hospital protocol that she believes killed her husband and thousands of other Americans. \"When I started making this film, I didn't know about the federal money driving the protocol. I do now,\" Patty told me.\"...",
