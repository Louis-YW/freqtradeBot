  "content": "I bought an old S9 last year so I could take some pics and upload them to my Unsplash profile so the world has access to more royalty-free bitcoin images. After I got a few pics uploaded, I decided to turn the old housing into a lamp and hang it from my ceiling. Naturally, anyone can make their own but I decided to sell them on Geyser to see if there's enough demand for people who want one hanging in their own house, garage, workshop, office, etc. Here's what it looks like. I also made a post on stacker news about itWhat do you think, plebs?",

I have concern the carabiner isn't durable enough for hanging stuff 24/7.The empty miner shell is made of aluminum so it's actually really light. I just used a floor scale to weigh it and it says 2.4 pounds which is just over 1 kg at 1088.622 grams. I don't have any concerns about it falling down and if ever I do, I would just use some more robust mounting hardware.",

It will hang there without cracking the ceiling but is it practical for daily life. The light distribution in the hanging image is terrible so your angled spot light proposal could give miners a new use.",

It's like hanging an old printer with a bulb inside and calling it a lamp. It definitely produces a softer light but it lights up my office quite nicely. The idea is for it to look kind of cypherpunk so it wouldn't go in a living room but probably as a light in your garage. workshop, or man cave where you build bitcoin stuff.I appreciate your honest feedback.

Although i wonder how heavy is it after you replace unused parts with the lamp. I have concern the carabiner isn't durable enough for hanging stuff 24/7.To work that lamp in the Asic miner some part will have to be removed which in return will make the whole machine become lighter, I am already thinking about how he make this work, the easier way is to loose the motherboard from the machine and replace with a complete lamp component, someone with less tech idea can still manage to pull this off.Its nice to see this happen, I do have a old s9 that I don't care about anymore, gathering dirty in my store with some other older graphics cards and motherboards, nice try OP.",
