  "content": "I'd like to start a discussion on Bounty managers allowing Newbies to join in bounties. How does everyone feel about that? A good number of you really could care less, I know that, but those who care about the forum might care and join in on the discussion. Let's start with I personally am guilty of allowing Newbies in bounties myself. It doesn't matter that I barely manage bounties, what matters is when I do, I have allowed Newbies. I kind of looked at it as they aren't hurting anyone and may live in poorer areas of the world. They need money too. Then I see THIS TOPIC by lovemayfamilis and it really kind of pissed me off. Not because lovemayfamilis was catching cheaters, but because every single account out of 67 was a fucking Newbie. I hate to start a controversial topic that might take away a Newbies ability to earn money, but if a good number of you are going to cheat then fuck off. We make it so easy for Newbies too because what's going to happen if they're caught? Not a damn thing! They get tagged and create a new account as if nothing has changed. On top of that, managers are kind of being dishonest too because we are allowing these accounts to join. Companies contact us and we give them an idea of the participation we might get them in a bounty campaign, but the numbers are way off since we are allowing these cheaters to join. Essentially, we are no better than the bounty cheaters because we are unknowingly lying. Well most are unknowingly lying. Others just down right don't give a damn long as they get paid.So what's the solution? Here's my thoughts on Newbies and what can be done.1. No more allowing Newbies in campaigns. Make newbies rank up and have something to lose if they're gonna cheat.2. No neg trusted accounts can join periodNow, what about managers? Should we tag managers who are outright being dishonest by allowing Newbies? Or tag managers who really aren't caring about the forum? Should we just hope they will try to make a change? Or does anything really matter? I don't know the answers, but I think together we can all make some good suggestions to try and slow these cheaters down. Maybe also change managers ways. Thoughts?",

Why not? if we would have tagged these managers, for sure the others would have paid much more attention to the people they accept in their campaign, because red tags=no more campaigns to manage.Of course, the majority of the forum was afraid to do it.Let's face the reality, when a manager accepts a bag of newbies, he knows what will be the result. Why keep doing it? Because the manager needs to provide results, and the project behind needs to hit a return on investment.It's all about the hype, and sometimes, managers are ready for everything to create this hype and to make the project happy!",

We were all Newbies at some point.You may need to read the full excerpt from that post, but I'm willing to quote it again for you.Quote from: theymos on June 25, 2018, 03:16:59 AMQuote from: Flying Hellfish on June 25, 2018, 02:12:36 AMBased on the fact that I now felt that the driving force behind theymos' decisions was not $Right, I don't care about making money from the forum personally. (I've actually thought about getting rid of the forum ads, since it's often a big headache and the forum has enough reserves for a long time, but operating at a significant loss while there's money basically just sitting on the table feels wrong, even if the level of loss is sustainable for quite a while.)The things on the forum which encourage spam are allowed mainly because it's part of the forum's mission to be as free as possible. Eg. banning bounties would undoubtedly reduce spam, but that'd be destroying an entire economy/population/culture which has been able to develop due to the forum's freedom. I am willing to take this sort of action, but only as an absolute last resort. It's always preferable to handle these problems by reshaping the environment to make them non-problems, rather than removing some freedom.It's wonderful when someone is able to constructively do something on the forum instead of continuing with whatever they were expected to do under the status quo. Enabling that sort of thing is exactly why Bitcoin and this forum were created. Though bitcointalk.org is not a worldwide welfare organization, and people are not entitled to make money.Limiting newbie participation is very harmful for a community. Newbie jail will never return: I consider the newbie-jail period to have been extremely damaging to the forum. When barriers to participation are too high, then the best people often just won't go to the trouble of joining, and the people who are willing to jump through the hoops are often people who aren't good for the community: people with nothing better to do, scammers, get-rick-quickers, etc. Having a permanent newbie jail policy would improve things a lot in the short-term, but would end up being a fatal poison to the community.The low signal-to-noise is a real issue which seriously annoys me and is often on my mind. But as you mention, fixing it non-destructively is difficult.About the question in your thread, I totally support the idea of ​​limiting or eliminating newbie from bounty participation. Of course I don't want that to be done by the forum because maybe the admin doesn't want any restrictions on newbie participating regardless of whether they want to make money or something. In my first post in this thread, it's clear that managers can apply that rule to any campaign/bounty they manage [I support it], of course.",

      "body": "^^ You have a good idea. I've considered this before while bursting alt and discovered that it's very easy to farm newbie accounts and nearly impossible to farm Members+ accounts because most bounty spammers are shitposters who can't rank up his farm accounts to a member rank, which would automatically reduce bounty cheating. Sometimes I wonder why a manager would accept a bunch of newbies accounts with less than 30 activity or less into their campaigns; if they truly cared about the company they are promoting, they would not accept a bunch of alts into their campaign, but since the majority of them don't give a fuck as long as they get paid, I don't mind.. If we're being honest, bounty hunters farm the most accounts because they want to take all of the tokens from the project they're managing. If I ever host a bounty campaign, my minimum acceptable rank would be Member +; it's the only way to eliminate a slew of newbie farms.Quote from: _BlackStar on October 22, 2022, 06:48:08 PMAbout the question in your thread, I totally support the idea of ​​limiting or eliminating newbie from bounty participation.

This would just make bounty hunters double the amount of cheating accounts they have in a campaign. Let's be honest for a second. If you are a bounty hunter in 1 campaign and that campaign has Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Instagram, and telegram in it, you will spend a total of 5 minutes on that campaign in a week. It's not very time consuming to retweet or share a post on all these platforms, and if original content and hashtags needs to be added the users post some bullshit as their original comment and copy/paste the hashtags.

Most of campaign managers are newbies or Jr member with no history of managing bounty but still getting campaign because of their charge.Quote from: sheenshane on October 22, 2022, 11:59:57 PMWhat do you think if there's a new rule that newbies won't allow to run bounty campaigns and also there are merit and rank requirements the same as the bounty participants? Rule from the forum? I don't think it's going to happen. Also, management doesn't necessarily depend on rank though I agree that having a high rank CM is advantage for the project in numerous ways.",

As you said, managers are intentionally/unintentionally being dishonest though I can guarantee not every manager is. Anyway, if someone participates from 30 account in a single bounty and there are 10 different such farm participating in a bounty, it will be almost half of the total participants.Quotebut I highly doubt $50 a month is anything for an Englishman.Of course he is not an Englishman, nor someone who will honestly work for you.

Make newbies rank up and have something to lose if they're gonna cheat.Some bounty managers are also newbies so they won't even care, but I think if the reputable bounty managers set high standards for hunter's then am sure it will reduce the way newbies just create new accounts and join bounties again after their previous account have been tagged. Let's assume managers set standards that they only accept member rank upward in their campaign, then am sure any bounty hunters that can rank their account up to member rank then they won't want to go against the bounty rules so that they won't lose the account, and if they are caught cheating and their accounts are tagged, it won't be easy for them to create new accounts and rank all up. I notice @CryptopreneurBrainboss managed a bounty campaign recently, it was stated in the rules that account with less than 100 actives won't be accepted, and I noticed lot's of hunters were rejected, am sure most of those accounts that he rejected are people that their previous accounts was tagged and they created new accounts. The way hunters are cheating in bounty, I don't think their task will have impact on the project because most of them are just spamming. Quote from: yahoo62278 on October 22, 2022, 05:54:12 PM2. No neg trusted accounts can join periodI think that will be better but some managers don't care, their are some managers that even encourage ban invation, I was going through some messages in a bounty Telegram group few months ago and a user complained that his account got ban, he then asked the manager if he can create another forum account and countinue with the task and the manager asked the user to send him private message, which I was suprised because I was expecting the manager to say No and not to request for the user to send him private message.",

Here I agree entirely with you. And precisely because many are poor, I would like everything to look at least not so bold. , they are just as disrespectful to other hunters who are just as poor. I can assume that others have alternate accounts as well, but this is done very carefully. No one will ever catch alts if they don't have matches. But because the people from this farm are very greedy, they continuously create even more accounts, thereby getting confused in them.But in addition, no one will forbid beginners to create and subsequently participate in subscription companies. This is much more profitable than wasting time on incomprehensible tokens. At the same time, seeing that the newcomer has the first post in the bounty section, it becomes clear that this is not a newbie but someone else's alt. And then the \"catch me if you can\" game begins.",
