  "content": "Many people are debating what should be used between POW and POS.But why not set up a program to run them alternately?It will combine the advantages of both，and this will allow both parties to cooperate and concentrate more resources on developing blockchain.Can anyone develop such a project?For example, add a pow block to every few pos blocks, when doing accounting.",

It is used to ensure that all transactions occurring on the blockchain are genuine, as well as to ensure that all miners arrive at a consensus. PoA is a combination of two other blockchain consensus algorithms: proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS).",

      "body": "In 2012 PeerCoin, the first blockchain to incorporate PoS, combined both in a way. Later in 2014 BlackCoin was based off their ideas, but limited mining by a total number of blocks. Recently Zcash announced plans of a transition phase where the two coexist in other way.While the mix is possible, don't forget that it brings not only advantages, but also disadvantages.",
