You can keep calling some bad news as FUD but the case that already happened with FTX was actually how even a legit project can doomed instantly. Bearish market was good as long as it will be only related with FUD but if that was about the thing that affecting the market and this would not be good. I have some money stuck on FTX caused by this exchange site goes the same like what already done by MTgox. This is giving massive impact to the crypto market.

And that is a big lessons for them, they have to think that bear market is not as bad. We just have to take advantage of it.",

He gets to buy FTX for cheap now and all the others lose a lot of money.This is why we have analysis to support our entry to the market. Traders do have fundamentals and technical analysis that contains data and even multiple backed data from other trader to make their entry strong and more precise. I believe that we are just starting and I pretty much expected this situation but I really didn't know that it will  happen today. Market is quite on a ruckus right now and people are still selling, I just wait a little bit more to buy some crypto. Well we can't blame CZ at all, It's a business move and it is his technique to remove and acquire his  competitor. The crypto market is just brutal.",

The more we listen to them and give about it without listening to the other side of the news, the more likely we fall into just being down and less focused on our goal. In fact, if we analyzed it carefully the bear market is an opportunity, not totally the downside of the market. As we can see, many people are happy and waiting for this season as they can buy cheap potential coins that are likely to give us profit once the bull market comes. But if we are a close-minded people, doubted if it will appear on my mind but just only negative.",

Like what happened this time, the market is very dropped because of some bad news in the crypto world. The news is very influential. And many people are scared of this, doing some exit even at a very low price, making some projects fail and then turned into something worthless. Panic is the main reason some projects failed very easily.

Exactly, the bearish era is the time to buy more coins that really have value for holding the long-term period. This is a great time to make more investments in Bitcoin and top coins in order to prepare for the higher price during the next bullrun.",

The bear market is really the best opportunity we have to acquire and accumulate more coins at its considered cheap price. Especially for those who will just make a new entry, that makes sense to spend everything they have as much as possible to take advantage of the trend.Unfortunately, there are people who already did some mass buying prior to the bear market that's why they considered this trend as the worst situation they need to deal with.

I think, Ethereum and Solana are good to invest in this bearish season, because their future will be bright for traders and investors to have something good to achieve in the future.

We have seen this scenario many times and having DCA strategy will surely be a great tool to accumulate top coins while the dip market is occurring. I don’t have the same thoughts as you. I don’t have the mentality of getting rich and choosing cheap. I only choose to buy some digital currencies, including Bitcoin, when the crypto world is healthy. Bear markets are normal, but today’s situation is unhealthy, so I  have seen someone on the forum who has the same opinion as me.

When you're also in profit, don't be greedy as If you become greedy, you'll regret it when the market tanks. Always secure some profit that can be used in raining days.This profits shoudn't be stored on any exchange or coin neither should you hold any stablecoin as they can all get crushed just as we have seen in this bear market.
