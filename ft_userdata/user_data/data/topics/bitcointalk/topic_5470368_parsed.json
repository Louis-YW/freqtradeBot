A lot of people prefer traditional gambling as they feel more comfortable playing offline. There's no guarantee that even the online gambling sites won't do away with you money, so how every you choose to gamble, you have to be smart and use a more reliable medium to play. Most of local bet shops these days, don't pay in cash but funds you using bank transfer using your betting slip so I don't think the situation is common. But still we should be bet wisely.",

It’s too risky to gamble on this kind of agent casino, better to check first if they are a legit business before you gamble. That win can be big, and hopefully that gambler get the money he deserved. If you are doubtful about any small casinos, better not to gamble that much and just gamble online with the best site with this, it can give you an assurance that you will get money when you win and the good site will not run.",

We can't generalize that physical betting is not the best to consider for most gamblers as both have pros and cons and gamblers have different considerations. That story of yours might be an isolated case or that gambling shop is not a registered business.I don't find any advantage of the owner running away since if the business is legit, they have the ability to cover all the winnings and since they are registered, running away does mean the owners just put a danger on their name of being a wanter person.If the said business is not registered or legit, then I think the obvious ones to blame on that story are the gamblers themselves.",

There's nothing you can do but cry and file up some complaints if ever you do know such information legally but in regarding on such situation then this would be thatsomewhat pointless yet there's no way about on retreiving those amounts back and this is something that most likely to happen. Therefore, dont make yourself thathopeful but as much as possible as long you could see some leads then its not that bad to take up some actions.",

For these people, their preference to gambling is not gambling online and some of these kind of people are even on this forum. How can these people avoid being in that kind of problem? Play and gamble only in physical Casino's where you can see evidence from set up that they will not be tempted to cheat you of your money when it is not the biggest money they have successfully paid out.",

Some gamblers never believed this story until they experienced it themselves and trust me, it would be one of the most touchable and tragic moment in their life's. Playing gambling for life is an unwise decision which will see us to our early graves. Funny how your narrative story turns out to end, a gambling worker flee away with customer's winnings, it would definitely be a good reason why the worker flee because he or she might have never see such figures before or he or she is in debts that needs to be pay off.",

Also, since this is a landbased casino, or the agent is more likely affiliated with a casino, then the player could just go directly to it concerning agent’s misconduct. If it is comparison between landbased and gambling sites even with good reputation, gambling sites could turn to a fraud if they would want to especially for a really huge amount, with ease. Think of how many online casinos are being acused and reported as fraudalent; reason is not all online platforms are registered to any government, making it easy for people behind it to hide their identity. Given that both has risks for the same concern, we just cannot help its occurence so better be preventive of the amount you would engage to any platform.",

Yes, it’s actually more risky to trust online gambling sites than to bet at a physical betting shop wherein you will personally meet the owner of the shop. At least, you know that shop has no ghost manager, unlike most of the online gambling sites that are only using random names to act as their gambling consultant or manager that we don’t even know if those people really exist or not. And because of that, our funds will be put at a high risk as they can hold it or run it anytime especially if we are winning at a consistent basis.",
