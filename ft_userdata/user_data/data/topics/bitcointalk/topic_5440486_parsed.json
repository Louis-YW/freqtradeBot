  "content": "QuoteDigital ruble payments will be launched for retail purchases and peer-to-peer transactions, a central bank official said.The Bank of Russia's central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital ruble, is ready for its pilot phase, said the bank's deputy governor, Olga Skorobogatova, on Friday.The project will be launched for peer-to-peer transfers between individuals and for retail purchases, Skorobogatova told journalists during a fintech conference in Russia. \"The pilot will work on real operations for real people, but only for a limited number of them, with the 13 banks that have signaled they're ready,\" she said, according to Russian news agency TASS.The central bank will pilot the CBDC with sets of selected clients, she added. After the pilot, the Bank of Russia will decide on the ways to expand the project, according to TASS.Russia's central bank first proposed a CBDC project in October 2020 when it published a consultation paper outlining potential designs of the digital ruble. In later comments, the bank said the project can help decrease the Russian economy's dependency on the U.S. dollar and mitigate the impact of foreign sanctions on the country since its invasion of Ukraine.The pilot was initially expected to go live in 2021 but provoked some concerns in the Russian banking community that rolling out infrastructure for the digital ruble will be burdensome for lenders and make the banking system more centralized and less diverse. The Bank of Russia later promised to modify the concept so that it doesn't hurt the traditional system.https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/17/bank-of-russia-to-pilot-cbdc-in-april/....Interesting.QuoteRussia's central bank first proposed a CBDC project in October 2020 when it published a consultation paper outlining potential designs of the digital ruble. From the initial proposal to pilot program phase of russia's CBDC program in 2020, it appears 3 years have passed.From pilot phase to full deployment of russia's CBDC, an additional span of years will be required. It is possible the war in ukraine will end, before russia's CBDC reaches mainstream.It is known russia has sought to build a banking alternative to the SWIFT system since 2014. We are now seeing development time measured in a span of years with some CBDCs. Venezuela's petro CBDC which still has not materialized despite its initial proposals 5 years ago may serve as a good example.",

Therefore, they are looking for a way out of the difficult current situation that arose due to the military attack on Ukraine.At the same time, if the emergence of CBDC in other countries is a completely new and relatively risky project, then in Russia it is doubly risky. And yet little is known about him. Even whether it will use blockchain technology. Of course, the digital ruble can be used in international settlements where it is difficult to do this due to the shutdown of SWIFT. But let's see how it will be in practice.",

      "body": "This means that there are already 2 countries that will conduct CBDC trials in April. namely Russia and Japan.1it seems that several countries are indeed motivated to develop and test CBDCs more quickly in 2023. And the Russian state will certainly be even more massive in this regard. because it was motivated by various sanctions imposed on Russia.2Maybe in this case, Nigeria has already taken the initial step of adopting CBDCs than other countries. although it is said that the adoption rate of CBDC there is running slowly. but it looks like it's going pretty well.3But in terms of the speed at which digital money adoption (CBDC) spreads it looks like China will have the upper hand. because China has always had strong ambitions and always wanted to be ahead of anything. including in the progress of CBDC adoption they are doing on their currency i.e. Digital Yuan (e-CNY)4.but in my own country, namely Indonesia, it seems that there is still no further news regarding the development of this CBDC. so of course I doubt whether there will be a trial run this year.but at least hundreds of countries are currently competing in the development of CBDCs. and let's see if the trials that Russia and Japan are doing will be successful. because these two countries seem to be conducting trials in the same month and year, namely April 2023.-------------------------------Reference :1. https://www.liputan6.com/crypto/read/5211451/jepang-bakal-luncurkan-uji-coba-yen-digital-pada-april-2023?source=amp-baca-juga2. https://pintu.co.id/news/21678-alasan-rusia-adopsi-cbdc-di-tengah-perang3. https://id.beincrypto.com/pengguna-cbdc-nigeria-baru-capai-05-persen-dari-total-penduduk/4. https://id.beincrypto.com/sejumlah-negara-percepat-adopsi-cbdc-pada-tahun-2023/",

CBDC will probably be very popular because it is the same financial system as fiat even though it is developed differently.

They want to have absolute control on their citizens financial data. Fiat still has some certain degrees of anonymity. But with CBDC, that little bit of anonymity will be permanently gone! Government can do whatever they want! It can be anything from freezing funds to arresting people over high value transactions. The first country to successfully pilot CBDC was China. One of those authoritarian governments. So the gameplan is very clear!",

If Russia issues and uses its own CBDCs, this solves practically nothing, since trading using the digital ruble also requires the involvement of the banking structures of both trading countries.
