Safe as in you're in total control of your funds, however, of course we all know it isn't. You might want to read Bitstamp's FAQ as regards PayPal transactions for further information. In particular, you might want to take note that in connecting PayPal to your account, you \"need to make sure that you use the same email address and name associated with your PayPal account as the ones you've used to register your Bitstamp account.\"",

Besides that do you know if it works in every country because I had to use a VPN and to log out from my Paypal account to be able to see the page from your link.  I am quite certain that it will not work in every country because of concerns on compliance usually in Europe and maybe in the same jurisdictions where big exchanges similar to Binance were banned.Also, I would be careful in logging in and using payment processors and exchanges with a VPN. They are unpredictable sometimes.",

In addition Paypal knows my identity and my exact location, so it's up to them to allow or disallow me to access this feature without banning me.",
