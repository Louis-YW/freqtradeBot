It was introduced just in 2019.Quote from: waONE on August 13, 2022, 03:07:58 PMBluebit is one of the commodity markets, cryptocurrencies and forex, How so? Can you name any commodities and forex markets in that exchange?Quote from: waONE on August 13, 2022, 03:07:58 PMof course their market and their volume is much bigger and will probably be the biggest market,You have no idea on what you are taking about.",

I can consider this as part of the hype as well considering the market is getting better right now and seriously, we know the hype for meme token is still here and with this as a proof, we should be more careful. Well, usage should be improve so they can rise again, but if its all about exchange listing then I think its not that big.",

Lol. Anyhow, the exchange is fairly new and there are more exchanges with reputation that has listed Shiba. So all I'm saying that it's better to trade it to other exchanges than to test your self against a new one like the one mentioned by the OP. Of course it will be good for Shiba's liquidity, but it doesn't matter at this point, so my advise is be very careful of this new exchange.",

Not unless he/she a crypto advocate since then and want’s to improve the regulations with cryptocurrency but if not, I guess its all about the hype and politics. I’m not familiar with that exchange OP, is it bigger than Binance? If not then I believe it will have no impact in the price of SHIB and probably an ordinary news for the investors. Meme token might still active today but if they remain like this, probably they will just remain as a meme token with no usage.",

He will need every support he could get and even if that means supporting a memecoin without any use case at all. He knows what he is doing and I admire that. He also knows what is happening in social media especially Twitter where Shiba's heart is positioned. But, there's no assurance it will be an impact to his candidacy.

It will still not convince anyone to invest in SHIB especially because they know it's a meme token hyped again without a real use case. Dogecoin I think has somewhat created its own use case when we kept using it in casinos. But Shib is not. The only hope it gave to users is that there is development going on despite it being a meme coin. It was recently added on the notable exchange too before BlueBit.io. Maybe it won't hurt to buy a $100.",

I just heard about this bluebit and I just now checked it in google search now, and in my opinion this event is in favor of those who believe in SHIB and those who hold it in the long term. I'm not a fan of this token, I only bought it once when I saw that it fell to around 0.000006$ and then when it rose to 0.000013$ I sold it and then until now I didn't buy anymore because I prefer to buy from someone else alts who knows if it's better than SHIB, although I'm not saying this token is ugly, it's always up to you if you want this token.",
