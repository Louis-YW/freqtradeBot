  "content": "Apparently, the request by members for casino review is becoming demanding due to some experience they have had with some casinos coupled with the complaints of account banning, suspension and poor customer care service which is now beginning to eat deep into casinos with claims of account holders defaulting their policies which if properly investigated, the gambler is not guilty of the penalty and actions metted against them. Some cases here onboard this platform have been sorted out with some gamblers being innocent and funds by winning being released to them while some casinos and their representative are no where to be found. Of lately, there have been some issues with casinos locking their thread preventing further discussion by members while directing members to their website customer care which is barely active in responding to members.Nevertheless I was thinking if there could be a thread under the Economy board created separately for casinos review ( all casinos registered here) with star ratings whereby members could also take part in the ratings for casinos and their performance which would make them seat up doing things right. This would make all registered casinos and their various representatives onboard this platform to doing their work diligently in responding to customers and being active here.  However, if a casino fails to doing or resolving issues between a member and them and consecutively, such casino is being reported here and after much deliberation on the scam accusations board or reputation with no fruitful result, hence there is every possibility of blacklisting such casino by high rank DT1 and DT2 members after they have put efforts to resolving the issues but the casino fails to resolve.With this, I think casinos would start being up and doing accordingly to avoid being blacklisted here because if they should get blacklisted, that means they are not upto standard for operating  here. With this casino review and ratings board members both old and new would know better casinos to identify with and if any member chooses to identify with a casino after seeing their ratings and review to be very poor, that member would have no option than to face his or her problem by themselves when it dawn on them or if the case is otherwise.This is an opinion which would welcome more contributions and possibly ways to develop this particular board if considered and deemed fit to hid to.Thank you",

And, interestingly, if such a comparison/reviews topic gets traction, it will pretty much stay on the first page of gambling topics, so it should be OK.Plus: if a gambling business doesn't act fairly, the Scam accusations (and maybe Reputation too) areas are welcoming the users with complaints.So, sorry, I don't see why an entire area would be needed for reviews/rating only.Keep in mind that there are nations present on this forum having only a single topic for themselves. Maybe this gives you a better idea.",

      "body": "Well, actually I would say that we already have the tools in the forum so people can discuss about specific casinos and experiences on them. so I do not see much of the point on implementing such changes. Besides, does not this star based system require some coding work to adapt the forum software? Or do you mean to use the survey model to vote with stars instead?.Though, I must say that the blacklisting system sounds interesting, it may go against the censorship policy of the forum. People is allowed to tag alleged scammers, but tags do not mean a ban will get issued.",

If you are already in the forum, one way is to check the trust summary of their representative in this forum.You can validate if the feedback is valid or not by checking the reference link of each feedback.Because some complaints are just to troll a given casino, and you will know if they are just ruining the image of the casino by checking their proofs.As you said, anyone can just browse their thread and see for themselves what's going on with the site.There are also few casino/bookie ranking site and reviews that are for me worth to take a look at that you can also find in the gambling section.As many users are already promoting casinos, it may really be a spam thread if we will create another one specific for this topic.",

The forum is the right place to execute such requests, though the members are doing a great job to trace legitimate casinos, but not every user knows where to lay their complaints. Hence, currently, such reports fit into boards like service discussion, gambling section, meta or reputation section which gets answers from different members in the forum. Some people who give out answers on the reputation section may not be opportune to see a thread on service discussion or other boards, relating to casino review, because they don't visit those boards. I think creating a board can unite every user who wants to contribute on casino reviews to always be active on that board and also mods can then move every thread regarding casino review to the board. It will help provide quality responses from members in the forum, other than creating a thread on economic section which may not get the attention of every member.",

They might point you to a different web page but that's nothing. I do think that if a casino is going to advertise on this forum or use any portion of the forum, they should have an active representative on this forum and an active topic so that poeple have a way to interact with the casino. Any casino without a thread and rep should be locked. I 100% disagree with sites who refuse to participate in certain sections of the forum due to whatever reasons. Specifically the scam accusations section. If you have an accusation against your site it is your responsibility to defend your site. If it's a valid accusation fix it, if it's not then disprove it. Trolls are everywhere, get over it.",
