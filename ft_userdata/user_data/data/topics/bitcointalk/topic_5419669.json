Binance would have never made it this big without CZ just like how I think Ethereum's success is also connected to Vitalik. CZ has also changed the direction of Binance to a more regulatory friendly platform which probably helped them sustain that success.",

I do you think its connection to CZ and Binance will be its downfall?BNB has a chance even to surpass ethereum in the future. Despite the hacked case that happened with BSC but binance has a solution for that by doing burn even longer to make sure the supply will be going back again to the 100 millions BNB, Binance is the main reason why BNB can do that easily even breaking new ATH against bitcoin. It's caused by the trust that came for CZ is starting to increase even higher. The recent problem that happened with FTX was making some people feel not confidence with FTT and they were moving their assets into the BNB. Binance backing is the main reason why binance coin can have a good performance during the bearish market. I can imagine how big the growth that will be happening to the binance coin once the bullish market will come back later.",

Bitcoin alone would not be able to build a market, and without altcoins it is unlikely that bitcoin would be where it is today.",

Congratulations to those of you who have sold BNB at this high price, and hopefully, BNB can get or reach the previous ATH price and create the next new ATH.But it is still difficult for BNB to take over the number 2 position on the CMC or Coingecko because we know that ETH is a strong coin that will not let any coins beat them. But I will be glad if BNB can return to its last ATH and try to break the next highest price.",

So it take a lot of time to bull run and next bitcoin.That didn’t last though, the market started to dump again and BNB experience the same faith simply because it will be hard for the altcoins to pump if Bitcoin is not doing good. BNB is a good coin as well, but we can’t expect a smooth pump from this coin, new ATH might happen in the next bull run and this is why many started to collect more good coins, they already what will happen in the bull trend.",

We are talking about reaching so high on btc that, even if btc goes back to what it was, then BNB would not go back to its ATH, it would go higher. Thats how the achievements and new big ATH prices can be reached. Right now BNB is lower than its ATH that's true, just like all the other ones it had a crash, but it didn't had as much as the other ones, and when the bull run happens, BNB may reach huge prices.",

The BSCchain really is the closest to ETH when you look closer. If you trust ETH to go high while it's now POS, you can therefore also say that BNB can  be trusted and you are earlier in terms of price to invest in BNB.",

Influence definitely helps in these times. Elon Musk did it, now it's CZ's turn. I am not really a fan of CZ so there's still a doubt that he made this all happen to surface BNB again and be the demand after attacking FTX.The same goes with his exchange, perhaps there's monitoring for the number of users entering Binance and the chart is going down so he badly needs to move them all back to stay on the top. Well, that's all my conspiracy theory about all these events, I still wish they are all not true.",
