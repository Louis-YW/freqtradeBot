I actually tried to search on Google to know if they supported the network but I couldn't get any reliable Information on that network, hence the best is to withdraw LTC as is also cheaper faster to withdraw from exchange.",

That’s by the way, if you can always convert your holdings to tron as the above have suggested or you can convert to USDT and withdraw through tron network, if I can remember correctly coinbase most times don’t expose their withdrawal fee until you have selected your preferred network, so if you have tried to withdraw with any given network and the fee is high you can stop the withdrawal and try out a different network until you get your desired fee.",

There are some other coins with cheap fees but LTC is the top one when it comes to fees. And, it's accepted on almost every exchange so that's why go with LTC instead of any other option. I recommend you to avoid withdrawing with USDT because my experience hasn't been good with that coin. USDT is best option if you want to do P2P trading on platforms like Binance but it isn't a good choice for withdrawing purpose. If the other network is accepting LTC and is giving you a LTC deposit address then go for it.",

So, if you are withdrawing your USDT from Coinbase, make sure to use ERC-20 wallet address so you don't lose your coins. I have used coinbase while ago and I don't remember if I were able to exchange coins between currencies. So, I am not sure if you will be able to exchange your coins for some efficient coins. If you talk about withdrawal or the transaction fees, I guess TRX or Doge is the best option to make cheap transactions. Also, it takes only a few minutes to get confirmed.",

I have heard from a couple of sources that they wrote their BSC address to withdraw their funds, but later, they saw Coinbase used the ERC-20 chain to release the USDT withdrawal. If anyone uses the the same wallet address for both BSC and ERC-20 chain, they may able to get the fund but if someone does not have access to multiple chains, the fund is lost. I did not used Coinbase for years and I am not up to date. But, as you can see from this case, they did not let him choose the network. So, I assume it's same how it was years ago. So, I am 99% sure they do not support multiple chains for USDT withdrawals at this moment. Oh wait, I found a official source BTW[1]Tether (USDT)is a stablecoin available on several blockchains that aims to maintain the same value as the US dollar. The company behind Tether, Tether Limited, claims to hold reserves that fully back each USDT. As of 2021, USDT is the most widely-used stablecoin in the world, with a market cap over $30 billion. Please note: at this time, Coinbase only supports ERC-20 USDT running on the Ethereum blockchain.[1] https://www.coinbase.com/blog/tether-usdt-is-now-available-on-coinbase",
