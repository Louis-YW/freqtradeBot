Here's what we're doing - take it or leave it. I've been in a few communities over the past few years that promise the world. This big development is coming. The Dev is working. blah blah blah. Nothing happens. Here it's the inverse. Community just pushes and pushes. Many of the holders are ride or die, and if you look at the chart, at times they should have been left for dead. But we're here and we're building. Happy to have people join us or not.",

What would normally happen and how this might be different. Today the dev extended the timelock on the LP so nothing specific will happen on Dec 21st now. As the community grows stronger the dev has continued to extend that lock longer and longer. The presumption is once the DAO can make decisions on the future of Mikaboshi the access to control the LP will be important so it has not been burned or locked for an extreme timeframe to allow all potential options.It appears the project is closer to the release of a bridge to BNB which will allow a larger audience of participants access to the token across more than one chain. This is big news once it is released!",
