He only sent a link that is an end to itself and doesn't lead anywhere only the front or cover photo. I think he could make a write up for users to know what this is all about or what he wants. He is rather in a haste if they have not finished the work of which he is posting the cover page. Moreover, he should understand having a newbie account under a casino is not always sellable on the platform because of trust, except he is affiliated with reputable casino or can prove the trust. It is not always proper for a user to do a preliminary search on what a promoter wants. I see this is about igaming platform but you need to do a good PR .",

Prize pool is big enough and caps at $8000 so I expect to have bigger bonus value for Leebet users.I agree with you that it is like a typo and if it is, the Leebet team should fix it as soon as possible. First to avoid confusion on their users. Second to avoid fud and impacts on their reputation.Bonus program should be managed well with clear terms and with good detective tools to check cheaters.",

Is it an I-gaming platform or a gambling platform? We have to clarify this, because there's a big difference between gaming and gambling? Anyway, the giveaways/bonuses at the launch of this platform seem to be just way too generous. Almost too good to be true. What's the point of joining a Telegram bot and answering a bunch of question in order to receive a prize?OP should post here the questions, which the participants must answer, in order to get a reward.Good luck with this project, OP(I'm assuming that OP, who started this forum thread is the owner of this project, but I might be wrong).",
