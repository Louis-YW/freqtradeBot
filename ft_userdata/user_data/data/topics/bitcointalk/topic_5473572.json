In case you cannot see the whole table, zoom out, move the mouse over the table while holding Shift, or activate Reader Mode. You can also simply swipe the post right/left on mobile or use the horizontal scrollbar at the bottom of this post.As with the other thread, for full information about the card, go to the vendor's website and beware of scams.This table only lists the websites which provide a crypto debit card program. Gift card vendors and websites which resell prepaid cards will be listed on other tables below.Prepaid (non-reloadable) cards can be found here.Gift cards can be found here.Physical and Virtual Crypto Debit CardsServiceProviderCurrency3DSPhysical CostVirtual CostBTCETHUSDTUSDCLTCTRONUSDTDOGEXMRCard Fund   Wire Fund*  USACAUKEUEEARUSpend Anywhere*Monthly FeeLoad FeeATM Withdraw FeeATM Withdraw Fee Intl.Apple PayGoogle PaySpecial FeaturesPST UltimaVisa, MastercardUSD✔N/A$1515✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔$15158%N/AN/AnoKYCSolCardMastercardUSDN/A$3-$6✔✔✔✔✔✔✔$05%N/AN/A✔✔noKYCPayWithUsMastercardUSDN/A$30✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔1.5%5%N/AN/AnoKYC, PayPal13CypherVisaUSD✔$50$0✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔$00.5% - 3%3%3%✔✔Zypto VirtualVisaUSDN/A$10✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔$54.5%N/AN/A✔✔Zypto PhysicalVisaUSD$1514N/A✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔$12$6 + 4.5%$4 + 1%$4 + 1%Ledger (CryptoLife)MastercardEUR✔N/A€0✔✔✔✔✔✔✔€01.75%N/AN/A✔✔SpritzVisaUSDN/A$0✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔1%$0N/AN/A✔✔Bit2MeMastercardEUR✔€20€0✔✔✔✔✔✔✔€0€00%2%✔BitPandaVisaEUR✔€9.90€0✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔✔€0€0€1.5€1.5✔✔Gemini12MastercardUSD✔$0$0✔✔✔✔✔✔$0$0%3%3✔✔Fiat24 (inc.

Only load the cards from Volet wallet or they will be blocked.3 Only the Mastercard version supports Apple Pay and Google Pay.4 Card is temporary unavailable.5 Card is shutting down.6 Ad-blockers and popup blockers may prevent 3D Secure payments from working.7 Nexo Card can operate in one of thre three currencies at a time, but the fees are denominated in EUR or GBP depending on where you ordered the card from.8 This is actually four different cards, each one with a different combination of network (Mastercard, Visa) and currency (EUR, USD). For brevity they are listed as one entry because they have the same regions, parameters, and fees, but the currency they use for them is the same as the currency for the card.9 This is actually a an annual fee, not a monthly fee.10 The HKD card can only be obtained in Hong Kong and has different fees. In the case of OneKey, it is the only currency that supports 3DS.11 Higher tiers offer lower load fees.12 This is a credit card, not a debit card.

In case there is also Region Lock the address must be located inside the country.* Google Pay and Apple Pay integration is not guaranteed to work on prepaid cards, even for the ones that support it, due to background checks performed on the IP address, device and network at the time of linking.* If the validity is not specified, then the card is valid until its expiration date. In some cases, the expiration date may be shorter even if a validity is specified.* Region Lock means the card can only be spent from IP addresses in a certain country. Failing to adhere to the Region Lock may result in your card getting blocked.* BINs are identified on a best-effort basis and involve buying the card if the number is not explicitly stated publicly.1 Using a VPN while paying with the card is not recommended as it will cause a card block.5 The inactivity fee starts after a 9-month period of not using the card and ends when you make a payment.6 BIN is PayPal-enabled.Cards may support cryptocurrencies other than the ones listed here. Check with the website for more information.Prepaid card best practices:Don't make lots of declined transactions, otherwise the will may be blocked.Don't use prepaid cards for monthly subscriptions; they are not designed for that and will usually give you a headache. Use a virtual or reloadable card instead, or buy the annual subscription.If the prepaid card requires a name or address, and you don't receive one automatically, ask the customer support for it. Don't use random values at checkout.VPNs will usually allow you to quickly change to a country's IP address for payment purposes (but see important limitations above), but for best results, use a residential proxy provider.If you buy high-balance cards, spend the majority of the amount in the first few transactions to reduce the chance of funds loss from card blocking (for whatever reason).Don't use any of these cards with PayPal unless you have a consistent setup with IP address, browser, etc. across sessions, and you've checked with the card website to make sure this is supported. Otherwise your account might get limited.",

You didn’t even ask me about running my own topic with my original data instead of me,I really liked your original thread and appreciated its contents. The ideal scenario in this situation would have been for you to never delete the thread. I don't know why you did in the first place actually.If your thread was never deleted/locked, nobody could have copied it as it would have been a duplicate. Quote from: Ratimov on November 10, 2023, 11:21:47 AMYou didn’t even ask me about running my own topic with my original data instead of me,To me it doesn't make sense to have to ask for permission to create a thread about debit cards just because you did it before. It's just public information. The importance is in updating the info. Not collecting and formatting it... Likewise I had a thread about debit cards in 2015 but got bored of maintaining it. And after I abandoned it I didn't go after anyone creating similar threads. Honestly I don't see why all the fuss here. Threads on bitcointalk don't make money anyway so no reason to get upset at someone for wanting to spread information. But if you want to restore your original thread, I would be supportive. What matters is to have information available. But if you restore your thread it would indeed be the true original and hence no duplicates could exist unless NotATether made significant and meaningful contributions to alter it.",

It works because all of the text is very small. But the nature of this text is such that things like \"Supported Coins\" and \"Supported Countries\" will naturally be longer. Unless, I list only the main coins and regions and make yes/no columns for each one.

First of all it's unclear if there was good reason for Ratimov to delete his thread. But so long as his thread remains deleted/erased, I don't think it's reasonable to say that he owns the formatting of text about a certain topic more than anyone else. I mean yes, in a court of law this argument might stand. But hey we're right here in this forum for running the bitorrent of money, we don't value copyrights that much as real rights.BUT! If Ratimov wants to bring back his thread, as per forum rules, his thread would be the original, at least in my opinion. He showed to have strong feelings on the matter and yet didn't show interest in maintaining his thread. But Really there's not much he can do. To me it's on him for deleting his.",

I'm going to have to move all those links into the defunct category. I'm also in the process of updating that section to the new design.There are also quite a number of new services that need to be added as well, for example Bitrefill which was already mentioned. All that is going to be taken care of in due time.",
