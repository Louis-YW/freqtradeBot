      "body": "Your still open thread is here, the reason why that happened is because you created a similar thread on the same board (which will only result in the same answer from other members). If you don't know, here is a link to your topic historySorry to say, your current opponent is rocketpot.io and not this forum. Even if you mean to force rocketpot to pay your money, over-creating new threads will only get you into trouble. Just focus on one thread, post all the updates in that thread. I think other members will be more comfortable following your case that way.Good luck.",
