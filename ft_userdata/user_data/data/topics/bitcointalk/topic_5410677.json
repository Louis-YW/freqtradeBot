  "content": "Here we go alexnder dugin taughter accident by bomb.Why those things happening ?It s simple becouse of the current war some very influencial person got touched.Off course if putin send rockets on the back of poor people or no influecial people backs nothing personally happens becouse those regular people got no connections got no money and power to revenge.They are harmlessBut imagine now if more influencial people will be touched you can imagine what they will do and also a lot rich wealthy people are criminals mobsters if those people got touched or their loved ones by the war then those people dont care about anything they will revenge and not a nice ways.Best advice for putin is to give warning to influencial successful wealthy people first before he do something becouse he will get into trouble.Therr was story about brooklyn when guy robbed wrong house it happened to mobster house.The next day he was finded and mobster whos house he robbed made him to rob all houses for small money and the rest of the profit goes to mob boss.Its a lesson in life u do bad things and harm others until you touch the wrong person. Once you mess up with wrong people there is war now between you and them.The question is why putin want that ?'why not live in peace and relax but no he now mess with wrong people and things might turn in ugly.All of this making nice locations unsafe such us london, south france monaco where is a lot russian people related to putin also.Becouse of ukraine and russia cant deal with their problems like normal humans using talking not guns like grazy the whole world nice places will be not so safe anymore , imagine if you relax somewhere nice and rich places and then suddenly some bomb will explode then i might just take holiday in bagdad lol...I doubt that putin even have chance to give warning to elite people such us mobsters i guess he all ready crossed the line becouse many important and influencial people families and theirselfes been touched.Off course its not a problem for putin but also his handlers and influencial people dont care about those elite rulers handlers, again until they mess with them.We live in the mobs world you dont touch other lions thats the rule.All this is will create more chaos now thats why its important that thugs and gangs make peace no beefs Nato should acting as a main gangster on the block to keep peace but it might be too late.We can only wondering if some of the putins rockets will touch the albanian people those guys are full mobsters and it will be worse then war. Stayaway from those resorts where those kind of people and their family might be u might get bombed for no reason wrong place wrong time.And all becouse of the adult people dont think before they act",

Great job!!!Unfortunately, her dad was not in the car with her.If it was a paid hit, then hopefully he will be denazified soon.It's interesting who did it. Either it was Ukrainian partizans who acted in similar way like Mossad. Or it was inside job and Russians started to fight and destroy each other. Anyway, I like both versions.Yeah, Dugin was target, but his daughter weren't innocent girl too. She was not much better than her dad, she was fierce propagandist who supported this war actively.",
