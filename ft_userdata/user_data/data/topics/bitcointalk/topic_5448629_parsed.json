Zone out from the merits and ranks and activities and build your knowledge, learn from others and ask questions when you get confused. This is a discussion platform for talking about bitcoin, that should be the first priority here, when you have learnt, you can then give back to the community by helping to answer the questions of others.- Jay -",

If you are talking about merited post, then you should make more improvement by dealing with your content. Its okay if theres no merit popping in, it doesnt mean you arent a good poster, you just continue it and dont mind if its appreciated or not but as long as you did help or contirbute something thats fine.Also dont be too hard on yourself or pressuring to do more than what you need to share. Topics here can be discuss naturally and no need to make every threads just to meant you are contributing. A simple replied might be helpful already if you suggested or recomended something in a topic. Anyway you are doing great. Ive seen some seriously wanted to change their routine and thats already a big step.",

Creating a thousand threads that don't talk about anything useful will be defined as a detriment to the forum rather than a benefit. But no matter what you say, your supposedly smart conclusions still do not say that you see the situation correctly.This is exactly the same for the OP. OP, it will do you good not to litter the forum with topics that have been discussed many times; other than that, don't consider yourself too tricky, thinking that no one sees anything.I would just like to advise all followers similar to these two that all first topics are always considered on a larger scale by users, including the entire posting history of the creators of new topics. It is desirable to see the sequence of all topics so that one day your fantasies do not put you in an awkward position.",
