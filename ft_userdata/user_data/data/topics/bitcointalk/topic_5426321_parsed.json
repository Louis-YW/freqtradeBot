Besides he is not using an affiliate link on his OP so I don’t find any benefits for non official affiliate of this casino to this kind of promotion here in the forum without getting any benefits in return.Hey OP, I’m only viewing white page on the homepage of your casino and also the transition of banner is very laggy and not smooth on transitioning from 1 to banner to another. You should purchased a copper membership so that you can post an image for a better ANN thread.",

Every transaction is deposited or withdrawn via metamask. User should do KYC before they purchase USDT or other cryptoIn addition, domain is a new, because  to distinguish it from our previous website (Bitfair only focus on Crypto).

But after years of experience, we provide good experience to customers Can you share the original website of Bitfair that you are referring as an established casino. Proving that this casino is connected to your old casino will be very helpful to trust you with your word that you cam from old casino because anyone can create new casino and claim to be affiliate with reputable casino without any proof here.Forum user is always very delicate on new casino especially to those who are claiming to be trusted without any proof backing it. There’s a lot of scam casino launch here and most of them are new casino that trying leech some popular casino reputation and use it for there own advantage without the consent of original casino.",

But have nothing good except it yet. I even can`t say that i will check this thread and site time by time. When the OP even don`t ready to spend several $ to buy copper membership i have some doubts that he presents serious project. Today we see lots of cheaters with cryptocurrencies, it would be better to use trusted casino until such projects don`t get positive feedback from the users.",
