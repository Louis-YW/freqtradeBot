I don't see the future of mining in this coin.Well done if you do mining and save some amount, that's how it was with ERGO and Ethereum Classic, and that's how it was with bitcoin and ethereum, but now the amount has reached production and now you can't have any amount, we have to think in terms of long, because the potential in BEAM is the same as that of ethereum if we calculate it on marketcapof.com, it also had the privacy that the transaction or the money you have cannot be sold, the essence and the future of this coin is a very good one example I take:a whale is discovered and if he wants to, you can put his money in the beam and that job is over,also in Beam's roadmap, it appears that the halving will happen from 2019, which was created in the next 5 years, in the 6th year and in the 7th year I will do halving and this time will come, like Ethereum, which will release 0.01 Beam for all mines.l.also had NFT GALLERY & DOMAIN NAME .beam and had a very hardworking team.Do not forget my words now beam is only 0.18$, I think it will explode very soon,",
