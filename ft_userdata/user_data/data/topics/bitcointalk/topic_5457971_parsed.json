Unfortunately, recovering the full private key with just the first 9 symbols is highly unlikely. Since the amount is not negligible, It would be a good idea to look for a paper and document restoration or forensic laboratory in your local area that specializes in handling situations like this. They might have the expertise and tools to assist with reading the other characters from the damaged paper. Reading other characters from paper might be easier than attempting to brute force the missing characters of the private key. Good luck!",

Okay, I admit, I made up that last one, I have no idea if that's possible, but it's more likely than brute-forcing the private key.It's actually what I would try to do: use a microscope and inspect the washed out area very carefully. You don't need a lot of magnification, the ability to look at different angles on the inspection area is sometimes more important that magnification. What kind of forces did the writing tip excert to the paper, are traces of that still visible on the paper fibers. That's a reasonable approach in my opinion.In the end it comes down to what treatment of the paper caused the wash-out. Was it unstable colors, sunlight exposure? Did some sort of friction on the paper make any color deposit be rubbed away?Trying to get as much of details off the paper is still a better route than trying to bruteforce into the unknown.",

Of course, such a procedure has a price, but considering that it is 1.09 BTC which today is worth $33k+, here we are talking about something that can easily be worth five times more in the next few years.",

After clicking \"Start\" (to process the key and initiate the arrays) you enter \"1\" in the textbox and press \"Similar letter\" button so the list can be populated with \"1\" and \"L\", then you can continue modifying this list by adding or removing characters if you don't like the suggestions.Then you move to the next position by pressing the \">\" button and repeat the same thing. Here you simply click the \"Add all\" button to populate the list with all 58 characters.When you are done setting the search space you finally click Find.",
