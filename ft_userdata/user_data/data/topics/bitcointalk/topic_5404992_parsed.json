  "content": "Shiba Inu and Dogecoin holders can now pay for Uber Eats food deliveries with their cryptocurrencies via BitPay. Other cryptocurrencies supported by BitPay include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, XRP, Dai, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and stablecoins. According to a blog post by BitPay, since Uber Eats does not yet accept direct cryptocurrency payments, this method of payment is exclusive to BitPay gift cards and BitPay cards. Alternative payment methods include BitPay partner Menufy, which accepts payments from cryptocurrency wallets for takeout or delivery from regional or national restaurant chains.Food delivery companies such as DoorDash and GrubHub, as well as takeout restaurants such as Grill, Chili's, Carrabba's Italian Grill, Steak 'n Shake and many more, are accepting crypto via BitPay.

It's not quite clear why these food deliverers have started accepting coins as payment that have no bottom and can fall indefinitely, because they are just meme coins, without any utilitarian properties or deflationary model. In my opinion, accepting such coins as payment carries additional risks for business.",

I even used bitcoin before and sometimes still use it for the same use. A third party that makes us spend for this feature is actually good. They're making our lives easier and spending cryptos very much easy. Those companies that are scared to adopt crypto for payments into their products or services, they can use third parties like Bitpay.",

Those companies that are scared to adopt crypto for payments into their products or services, they can use third parties like Bitpay.Third-party cryptocurrency payments/gateway has always been in the business of easily and quickly integrating business across many sectors, while also may give the client easy finance/tax reporting purposes, they also give a direct conversion onto a local currency that the business chooses.The thing is some business aren't want to deal with the volatility of cryptocurrencies or legal hassle, and that is the price they willing to take instead of running their own payment services.",

I think that a few years ago like in 2017 or so news like this would be a pretty big thing but nowadays crypto is already pretty mainstream in my opinion and news like that are really nothing special anymore. Also the current bear market is dominating everything and this is another reason why i think that this news will probably not have much impact on the price of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.In the end those two are just useless meme-coins anyway and the long term trend for those two coins is downwards in my opinion.",

Anyhow, not sure if this is going to be good for both coins, yes they enjoy the support nevertheless a smart investors knows how to play both or not invest them at all.Maybe they are faster as far as transaction, but there's no stable blockchain such as Bitcoin just saying. Maybe Uber Eats really wanted to expand and capture holders of Shiba and Doge, but whatever.",

There was no way for crypto other than helped by the third party to create a bridge where people can actively spending their crypto for something in our real life but this has no impact to the price of the shiba inu and doge coin.

In general, meme koins perfectly reflect the essence of the altcoin industry. It doesn't matter that the coin has no utility, what matters is that it can be used to speculate as long as possible.",

Using this as a mode of payment doesn’t gives us the good updates, if SHIB and DOGE will burn their total supply then we might be able to see them rising again.

This might be another attempt to hype meme tokens again, but for me they are done already because we are moving on into a new trend which is the NFTs.
