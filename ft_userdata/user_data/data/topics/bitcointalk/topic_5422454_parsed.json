      "body": "There is a necessity to announce an LP pair: LUNC-CMCX. When CMCX is burned, the burned coins should automatically buy LUNC through the LP and this way prune it out of circulation. LUNC would be burned this way as part of CMCX burn. When LUNC is burned it should swap for CMCX with the exact purpose of burning CMCX as part of bipartisan effort to burn coins on both chains when either is burned.",
