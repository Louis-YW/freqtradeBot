  "content": "Hi All,I typically don't post on forums or anywhere but I am generally a quiet researcher that likes to verify postings about companies and see user experiences before indulging myself.Scamming site: Rollbit.comBackground:Over the past six months I was a user of a site called Rollbit, which many of you may know and enjoy. They offer a variety of casino games (I don't particularly enjoy any slots etc), NFT, Sportsbook, Lottery and much more. I generally used the sportsbook but dabbled in the occasional NFT lootbox, ultimate texas holdem for fun. The rewards program was fantastic as it gave you a rakeback and if you had a rollbot attached to your profile you could even get more % back from your bets. To be clear I only ever used 1 account, Markobagz, and many in the community/chat knew of me. I was sometimes active in chat and talked with a couple influencers online about Rollbit news. Over this time I deposited and withdrew around 30 times each without any issue, unless a particular crypto was done (SOL lol). I started to implement a strategy that I thought was going to make me money instead of just blindly betting without any thought process. The idea is to minimize your risk involved with bets and bet on extremely safe options that have low odds, 1.003 -1.02. The likelihood of you winning is high and you get the rakebacks involved. I typically would bet on CSGO over 18.5 rounds and they would hit more often than not. I must say I did lose around 5-6 of these bets on the csgo rounds. I also bet MMA with 1k bets on Israel adesanya in his last title fight, I do LOL at 1.5 odds. I bet basketball at 1.01 (Which failed more often that not) during live games. I liked Dota 2 as well just as it is fun to watch for me. I had a 5k bet at end of march at 1.02 odds for Aster to win a game in their match that lost. The majority of my bets were on random odds and not super low ones.  What happened: I try to login to my account on saturday morning, April 15th 2023 and it says account disabled please contact support. This was alarming as I have no clue what is going on. My last bet the night before at 1.003 odds LOST $1000 for the csgo game as well. Couple days before I was putting 1k on Dota 2 at 1.3-1.8 odds for around 20 bets. I start thinking to myself that they pulled a fast one on me and are keeping my funds, which is around 10.2k in my account. So, I email their support saying what has happened to my account, my funds and why they have not given me any explanation on the situation. Their reply was -\"Hello there,Your account has been disabled permanently for abusing our Sportsbook feature.MoonlightRollbit\"This was shocking to receive this response back form their support and I still did not get any reason why I was abusing it. They are putting the odds up for users to bet on, and I am placing those bets on the odds they provide. I was not trying to abuse anything and on top of that, I was losing a lot of bets every day!  I reply back saying I am confused and to explain why I was abusing it and i get this reply back \"We have nothing further to comment on this situation.Your account was found to be clearing abusing our sportsbook.It will remain locked, permanently.LunrRollbit\"They still did not provide me any sort of response on my funds, apart from my account is closed permanently. I don't know what else to do at this point as I send 5 more emails to support without a reply. So I take to twitter to ask for assistance through their community members and people related to Rollbit. Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/SmokeyLisa_eth/status/1647243443209469953Their community manager states:\"The remaining funds on the account were rewards attributed from sportsbook abuse. Your account is up overall so you have not lost any money at all. I have just analysed your betting patterns and it's clear what you are doing.\"I keep asking what I abused and to provide me the reason as I was losing money with my last bet even. What really shocked me is her saying that my account is up overall so I have not lost any money. That seems ridiculous. On top of that, I was rewarded around 19.5k give or take from Rollbit. That would mean they believe that I abused the sportsbook for over half of my bets to consider the 'remaining funds on my account is attributed to sportsbook abuse\". No one on twitter replies to me or support anymore and they won't tell me what they are doing with my funds. Honestly a big letdown from Rollbit as they never mentioned to me anything I was doing was wrong. It seems that if I won the bets and rewards that is not ok, but if I lose bets for large amounts then that is ok. Links for proof of conversations: My account April 14 with 10.2k in it, Proof of Payment - https://imagizer. imageshack. com/img923/6984/p9xpxZ.jpgPM/Chat Logs, Conversations with support - https://imagizer. imageshack. com/img924/9297/wfadoU.pnghttps://imagizer. imageshack.  com/img924/228/CYnbFO.pngSome Images of me losing large bets with low odds - https://imagizer. imageshack.  com/img923/6068/PbgIkR.jpghttps://imagizer. imageshack.   com/img923/3903/2BLLj4.jpgAmount Scammed: $10,200 plus a rollbot worth 1k. Additional Notes: There is not much recourse for people in my situation it seems but the thing I will do is file a complaint with the CEG and maybe files complaints against their payment agents in Cyprus. My goal here is to warn others that this can happen to you too and you might not have any recourse. Of course I would like my funds returned to me but the chances of that are slim from a company like this. It really is sad to see as Rollbit was a favorite platform for me. If anyone has any comments, or suggestions on what I should do I'm all ears. If you took the time to read this, I appreciate it and wish you the best of luck on your future playing. Edit: I have created a Flag against Rollbit Razer (Rollbit's Admin) due to the lack of explanation in this case. Please see here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3178Would appreciate the support in this matter, thanks all.",

But even a 1% rakeback would make it +EV.Yes, it is not worth it to make $3 off that bet but when you get a rakeback of 1-2% of your bet it makes it much more worth it. There are no minimum odds for rakeback which was strange and that is why I thought it was a good strategy. Intention was not abuse but to increase my EV. If they thought it needed to be changed, then either set minim odds for sportsbook rakebacks, or restrict my account from these types of games/odds. Seizing funds and NFT's should not be the option.",

Some months back stake was hacked and user data such as email addresses were stolen. About 2 months ago almost all platinum+ VIPs got catered emails from rollbit with bonus offers, the higher the VIP level on stake, the higher the bonus was.In conclusion, Rollbit bought the stolen data from the hackers, therefor a company that uses such shady things to promote its own business can't be trusted in the first place in my eyes.

They advertised it as \"no strings attached\", but in order to be able to withdraw you suddenly had to deposit and send document for KYC.

I also got it, and my email was ONLY registered on stake, no where else. All platinum 4 users got 100$, platinum 3 got like 40 and 2 got 20$ I think. Diamond players got 4 and 5 digit $ amounts. So rollbit knew the VIP levels plus the emails of stake players.In the threads you can see screens as well of the original mail, \"no strings attached\" included.https://stakecommunity.com/topic/69379-stake-data-leaked-did-you-get-a-bonus-email-for-another-casino/#comment-1482333https://stakecommunity.com/topic/69364-email-from-diffrente-casino-anyone-else-got-it/#comment-1482119",

The likelihood of you winning is high and you get the rakebacks involved.Wait, you are getting rakeback from bets that win +99% of the time?1.003 decimal odds is like ~99.70% win probabilityRollbit can't be this stupid, right? There has to be minimum odds requirement for rakeback.QuoteQuoting for image view. I've also send a PM to Rollbit Razer notifying him about this issue. Let's wait him to be back online and see if he has an insight for this matter. But if I may give my amateur opinion based on your strategy quoted below, this seems like a value bet. I am not sure if rollbit explicitly forbid this and if it's specifically written on their ToS, but the general consensus applied by bookies is that it is see as something that's frowned upon.He risked 1000$ to win 3$, one of the dumbest bets I have ever seen. But even a 1% rakeback would make it +EV.Yes, it is not worth it to make $3 off that bet but when you get a rakeback of 1-2% of your bet it makes it much more worth it. There are no minimum odds for rakeback which was strange and that is why I thought it was a good strategy. Intention was not abuse but to increase my EV. If they thought it needed to be changed, then either set minim odds for sportsbook rakebacks, or restrict my account from these types of games/odds. Seizing funds and NFT's should not be the option. this could probably be the reason why they banned your account. they realize what you're doing and banned your account.Quote from: AHOYBRAUSE on April 20, 2023, 10:39:29 AMRollbit and stake have a connection. Some months back stake was hacked and user data such as email addresses were stolen. About 2 months ago almost all platinum+ VIPs got catered emails from rollbit with bonus offers, the higher the VIP level on stake, the higher the bonus was.In conclusion, Rollbit bought the stolen data from the hackers, therefor a company that uses such shady things to promote its own business can't be trusted in the first place in my eyes. That's all I meant to say with it.do you have any sources about this? I am quite intrigued and would love to read more into it. I won't be surprised if other casinos do this too, I mean it is a great way to get new gamblers especially if you already know that they are gamblers that are willing to spend a lot of moneynevermind about the source looks like you posted it while I am making my post.",

Well how do you even abuse a sportsbook?  Players make bets available and its fine when people loose money on it, but when they are making money its called abuse. I have numerous bets that lost with low odds, is that considered abuse? Theres nothing about it in the TOS and if you are concerned about people gaming the bonus features, address these issues by having a minimum odds to trigger them. You should not punish players for following your rules and TOS and when they start winning lock the account and take funds. Still does not give the right to Permanently close the account, without any warning, limitations or whatsoever, just locking you out of your money and thinking its fine \"because he is UP\".",

If I may clarify and better understand the situation, my guess earlier is correct, that OP was banned because they utilize a strategy that can be considered as a value betting, in form of taking advantage offered by rakeback? I am not sure I quite understand the part of your statement I underlined. Does this means the 10.2k was not OP's fund and their deposits? And the entirety of it was what OP gained from the rakeback and value bet?As for OP, may I know what amount you deposited on rollbit?",

If you offer a bonus or whatever, how can this be abused? If every site would do this, and every site has some kind of bonus or rake back, then nobody ever would place bets online again.Also, how is it justified to take his deposits/winnings? You could just strip him of the bonus money, I doubt that's 10k$.Those are really shady excuses to not pay the man. It's actually ridiculous.",

      "body": "As for OP, may I know what amount you deposited on rollbit?[/quote]I don't have the total I deposited and withdrew on hand, but if I were to guess I was in profit. But profit not from the value betting at all. First and foremost I appreciate the forum and community for giving me a space to explain my side and what has happened. The goal is for me to be transparent and show the evidence I have that I was not abusing. Never in my life would I think betting for value is considered abusive when they put odds up for players, but anyway here we are. I have some points I want to address down below to give more perspective. 1. As I stated before, It is completely ok for me to lose 5k or 2k on bets at 1.003 odds but when they are winning, then it becomes abuse? I have lost plenty of bets at these low odds but Rollbit is fine when that happens. Link to more bets that lost - https://imagizer. imageshack. com/img923/2990/kLkbAW.jpgThis lost bet was for 3k on 1.003 odds^. If it wins, I'm abusing, but if it loses it is ok... 2. This 'value betting' was not all the betting that I did nor did it make up most of winnings! Majority of my bets and wins were at higher odds for LOL, Dota and other sports such as UFC, Basketball. Two days prior to my account being banned I was betting on 1.3-2.5 odds for Dota and made over 3k back that I lost when I lost some bets on 1.003 odds (The above bet). Bet history would PROVE that as well as the photos that I can show you here.  Links to my bets recently with various odds - https://imagizer. imageshack. com/img922/5097/a4buEh.jpghttps://imagizer. imageshack. com/img923/245/k8FQEU.jpghttps://imagizer. imageshack. com/img924/8172/4McWUZ.jpghttps://imagizer. imageshack. com/img922/1237/Kdwa1W.jpgAs you can see, I was betting on such a variety of sports and odds with a lot of those winnings coming from this. I can post more of my bet history if that would help my case too... I want to establish that I am not just winning bets on one particular thing. Those wins above are over 3k just there! 3. With their remark that 'because I am in profit is enough to keep funds' doesn't make sense. Saying this is 'Pretty standard sportsbook abuse case', I have not heard of anyone getting banned and funds locked for what I was betting on. 4. They stated multiple times that 'The rest of the account's funds are from sportsbook abuse rewards'. I completely disagree with this statement as I have place bets on a variety of sports and odds that added up to around 19.6k in rewards. The first 5 months of me using rollbit and betting, it was NEVER on low odds or value betting. Mainly just me and my dumb bets hoping stuff would hit. Does that mean I was abusing it then as well? With this logic, 60% of my bets were deemed abusive (Still don't get why it's considered abuse) as my account has 10.2k in it plus a Rollbot worth over 1.5k, so 11.7k in value. Link to my rewards as of April 9th - https://imagizer. imageshack. com/img923/6522/hnmuXH.jpg5. I have NFT's and a Rollbot in the account, but Rollbit seem content to keep these? 6. Why is it considered abuse if I didn't break any terms of service? I firmly believe what I was doing is above board. If Rollbit wants to put requirements on the odds to earn rakeback on, then that is on their side, not mine. Value betting is not a reason to suspend an account and take winnings! What do I have to do in order to get my funds returned to me?  I would like some more clarity on this from Rollbit... Thanks everyone - much love.",
