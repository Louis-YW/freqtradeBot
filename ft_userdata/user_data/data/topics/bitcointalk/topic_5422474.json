AFAIK BlueWallet is using Electrum servers, which means you must install one of them. Personally I recommend electrs (https://github.com/romanz/electrs)Then of course you may use it with Blue Wallet.",

It also explains which Onion address (better than IP; built-in encryption, tunneling, static) and port to use.You basically get it from /var/lib/tor/<hidden_service_name>/hostname; then you can use http://<whateveritspitout>.onion:50001 in your SPV wallet.Do be aware that if you use push notifications in BlueWallet, your transaction info will still be sent to the devs' servers, who then push notifications about confirmations and such, to Google / Apple servers, which finally deliver the notification to your phone. Kind of defeats the purpose to use a private Electrum server.Unless you host the push notification service yourself, too; it's called Ground Control, but I haven't tried it as I don't use this wallet.",
