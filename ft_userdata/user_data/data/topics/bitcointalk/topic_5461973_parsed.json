That will mean too many symbols for Bitcoin users to be aware of and they could get confusing.",

Honestly, pushing a new symbol for a decentralized asset class as spread as Bitcoin at today's date is nearly impossible.

I think we’re gonna stick to just “sat”, similar to “USD”. The other ideas are imo too complicated or easy to confuse with other symbols and shortnames. You can see a conflict on BTCtalk too, some use sat, others use s, others prefer other shortnames which are less known. It’s a neverending conflict.",

My personal interpretation says that because the satoshi is the smallest unit in Bitcoin, that is why it was written with the letter “B” in lowercase letters.",

The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin community will make it difficult to adopt a single sign. The small case b looks like a brilliant design but the community is used to the sat sign. Modifying or bringing a new design will be subject to the approval of the community because the power to do such doesn't rest on a single or group of individuals.",

IF so, the use of sats will become more common.If you look at the most used core banking systems in the world, we have the following four rows:Currency - Currency Symbol - ISO Code - decimal placesLet's say we make now a transfer of 550 Sats, assuming that they would have a value significantly higher than today. This would look, today, like this:Bitcoin - BTC - BTC1 - 0.0000021 Due to the fact that sats are a fraction of BTC, the BTC currency code would be used.2 Most core banking systems have a limited number of 0 they can display after the comma, usually it is 4 to 6 in currencies. This doesn't apply to all core banking systems, but to most of them. 550 Sats would not be displayed, i.e. not transferred.A go-around-solution would be to enter Bitcoin as a commodity in a core banking system or with a stock symbol. As a commodity, it would need a definition according to ISO 4217 (900–998). However, this would then again be error-prone in other systems. A stock symbol would be the easiest way.BIP 176 https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0176.mediawiki is a proposal which says that \"Bits is presented here as the standard term for 100 (one hundred) satoshis or 1/1,000,000 (one one-millionth) of a bitcoin.\"When Jimmy Song proposed this, I was in opposition. Today, I look a bit different at this and wouldn't oppose an ISO-code for Bits, the symbol as defined by Valentina. It would make it easier for core banking systems to use Bitcoin. And it would make it easier to use sats.",
