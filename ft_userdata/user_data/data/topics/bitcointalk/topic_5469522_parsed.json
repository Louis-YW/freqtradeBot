  "content": "Okay, since I think i have either posted here before shortly a very while back, or have never posted..I realized suddenly it would be a good idea for me to post on these forums, my thoughts I were having for a few moments.I've been here to read before, not as much recently though..I currently posses no cryptocurrency and a while back cleared my old wallets, now with nothing and no investments..Though I'm posting on these forums because I do follow crypto and computer tech and have had thoughts about the technology since i do programmatic things.Now I do not have kids or a partner, and my reality of what mainstream is is simply browsing and checking in on sites, since technology has changed a lot of to what seems to be a more privatized level.I cannot comment on a more collective reality, such as avidly watching national tv daily with a family or something similar, but the advertisements and gist of what I see on something like a youtube site or android tv commercial or what the android device apps show I am able to watch, something seems off in comparison to what technology is capable of showing the masses, what it actually shows.Now with generative advancements in programming and code base development a computer can \"throw-up\" a lot of interesting things and stuff, but what I see is a lot of violence and horror in tv, shows, \"whats funny\" advertisements, and gaming.  I can't comment on consoles, gaming consoles.. but I do have entertainment gaming platforms installed, avidly check in and game, currently for a standard desktop, being steam, itch.io, examples, so I can browse, lets say steam, which is a big one, and I see a lot of a mess , and even more so with translated cell phone type of coded advertisements.Now what keeps sold or monetized code a secret, it seems ironic since it's no longer a secret but translated to make money, yet so what is altered in the translation to the public? See i am not focused on money, and I am indifferent to a person who only sees money, because that is what they follow, or if they study and teach, that is how society evolves in one aspect to the total of a societies evolution.  But something seems very wrong and i can relate this to what is presented to the youth, or families, or anyone.  What is the secret which transforms the good into such evil?  It reflects on a lot of levels, of entertainment at least, but I see that it obviously influences real life, especially for the youth.I cannot figure this one out, and I guess i came here to just spout out these thoughts, since it seems better than a discord bot channel or some kind of adult chat or forum site with invalid information.",
