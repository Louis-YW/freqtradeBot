      "body": "This is the truth behind living in Nigeria, because if you have no handwork or skill you learn, even though you invest in bitcoin and get profits, you won’t have an idea on how to utilise the profit you have gotten because you will be thinking that you want to open a business, and when trying to open a new business, you have to do adequate research about the business. If possible, you should learn the business before starting; if not, you will end up losing everything and regret it because if you have engaged in any skill before, you can still practice it with the money you have received as a profit. Because in Nigeria, the truth is that youth shouldn’t even think of jobs after graduation but rather start planning strategies for creating job opportunities for other people, which is by creating a self-employment skill that will bring income to you, to the country, and also reduce the issue of unemployment in the country. That can only be achieved by learning a skill and also practicing it.",

      "body": "You have hit a hot nail on a hot iron. Most youths nowadays find it difficult to pay money to learn skills. Some of them find it difficult to pay for the skills they want to acquire, and they don't end up using the money for reasonable things, so what is the essence of not paying the money to learn the skills?It is good that if we want to do something that will help us in future, let's not try to look back and lose preoccupations, so what is best is to pay for learning skills and not think about the money we would pay to acquire the skills.While on this forum, in other sections, I have seen some discussions where people, including me, are talking about risk. It is not that while trying to acquire skills we are risking it because it is all about patience, but when we have to pay to get the skills it is like a bit of risk is involved, so we should not look at risk before making any move.",

But as an average naija citizen to fit survive you need chuke hand somewhere whether na carpenter, abi na hair dresser or na graphic designing or copywriting you fit learn. And to get all this skill no be free because knowledge too is not cheap, you gats pay for some kind knowledge if you must gats know am.

See the money as an investment on your self, because you day pay to learn something way go profit you, na how you follow up the skill go determine well and good you’re doing.   Make nobody reason the money way you use learn skill, because once you done learn the skill you don learn finish, you fit come be master for the skill. As I talk before reason the money as money way you day spend on yourself to be better. Na good thing for person to get one skill, because as the country day go na the skill fit save you oo, and ee get some kind skills way fit help you commot for the country.
