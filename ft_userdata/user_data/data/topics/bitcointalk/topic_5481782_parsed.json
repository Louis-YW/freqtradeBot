And you have the option to \"debank\" yourself in Argentina. It gives more options and more freedom. Nothing wrong about it.",

      "body": "Paying house rent with bitcoin is a good thing and not a bad idea. You are using the current value of bitcoin, both in price and market value, to determine what you are going to pay for, and I don't see anything wrong with that. Paying with fiat in the same amount total and also paying with bitcoin is still the same thing, provided that you and the landlord have a mutual agreement. If you have some bitcoin to spend, you can just pay it and let go, and you can always convert that fiat to bitcoin anytime you want and hold it as long as you want. Mind you, there is no guarantee that the bitcoin price will keep its value as of when you pay the money, and till that time next year, the price might double, no doubt, or the price might also drop in value, which the landlord might be recording some loss if it has not yet sold out.",

      "body": "If Bitcoin is used as money and treated as money, that presupposes active exchange of Bitcoin for goods and services. So paying the rent with Bitcoin makes sense from this perspective, and there's nothing bad about it. I think I'd be down to pay my rent in Bitcoin if it was accepted, but it's not, so I use fiat for that. Allowing monthly rent to be paid in Bitcoin can be a step toward accepting Bitcoin as legal tender in Argentina. It makes people more used to the idea of Bitcoin as a type of money, and it's beneficial for landlords if not tenants. Actually, it can be good for tenants, too, if it motivates them to adopt Bitcoin wider and to accumulate it regularly, instead of doing that with fiat.",

The tenant will transfer the funds monthly through Fiwind, a local crypto platform. The report highlights that both counterparties to the contract are experienced crypto users.The government has also eased the path to legalizing crypto holdings even if they’re overdue on tax declarations. Under the framework of a regularization scheme, taxpayers would pay a flat tax on assets of 5% if they declare holdings by the end of March 2024, 10% from April and 15% from July until the end of September.",

People buy houses, buy cars, book hotels, pay for flight, pay for cruise, pay tuition fees in Bitcoin. So why would paying house rent in Bitcoin be a financial mistake? Bitcoin is a medium of exchange and can do what fiat does. Choosing to pay the landlord in bitcoin will not make the tenant go broke or make him not accumulate more Bitcoin for himself. It's very likely the tenant earns in Bitcoin and also I think the purpose of news is to encourage people to start accepting cryptocurrency in the country.",

Isn't it too simple a thing? If no one pays using Bitcoin, your Bitcoin will stay in a wallet and there won't be an increase in demand. I have said this many times already in several threads. If people do not use Bitcoin to pay for their regular expenses, why would some companies adopt Bitcoin? Tesla started accepting Bitcoin a couple of years ago, I don't know if they stopped accepting Bitcoin or not. But let's say they still accept Bitcoin but nobody paying them using Bitcoin. So, what is the benefit of that adoption? This is the simple thing people have to think about.",

Bitcoin is a type of currency with an electronic system so it is not wrong if people use Bitcoin to spend it, such as paying for a house or other payments like currency.To me people paying for a house using Bitcoin doesn't sound strange and isn't like a mistake because they use Bitcoin as a currency function.Still the same, for me Bitcoin is an alternative currency so there is nothing wrong with people spending it. Because Bitcoin is an asset that is able to maintain a hedge, so for users who use it as an investment asset it sounds like a mistake if someone uses Bitcoin as a means of paying because it can still be done to pay for a house using fiat currency.My conclusion is that they are not wrong in using Bitcoin to pay for whatever they need with Bitcoin because Bitcoin is a currency that can be used as an investment asset for those who want to expect profits when the price experiences a large increase.",

Well, putting aside that Bitcoin is a volatile asset that can also go down in value as well as up, the question would be, \"what problem would this solve\"?In other words, how would this be any different than converting your Bitcoin to the sovereign currency and paying with that instead--something that could be accomplished in a few minutes?In the real world, Bitcoin is an investment, not a currency. For transactions, no cryptocurrency can even remotely rival the efficiency of the worldwide credit card and banking system, let alone a pure digital currency specifically designed for efficient transactions.",

Maybe when there is such a congestion problem with the transaction fee, it is possible to pay him temporarily in cash for his house rent.
