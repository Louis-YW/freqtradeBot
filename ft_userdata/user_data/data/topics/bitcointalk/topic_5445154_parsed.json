But so far I haven't found a statement that Satoshi has ever created a particular game that specifically involves private keys.I'm sure it was just created by someone else going by the name satoshi. Without the reference to the game you are referring to, my first guess is that it's a scam game.",

The problem is probably you're believing anything you see on the internet. There are so many fraudsters out there who try as much as possible to use Satoshi's name when promoting their projects because they know that some noobs with jump into the wagon just because they mentioned satoshi.",

It sounds like a movie plot. No way Satoshi would place those private keys on an obscure board game knowing someone could masquerade as him/her with those on their hand. and no mention of this was made either. Remember, private keys = ownership.To add on, I skimmed at their previous posts and they're into conspiracy theories. No reason to believe this.",
