  "content": "Quote from: https://twitter.com/BraiinsMiningStratum V2 Development & Adoption UpdateIn short… it’s happening!Today we’re announcing a working group established with @spiralbtc to accelerate adoption of @StratumV2, along with the release of the first open-source SV2 reference implementation (SRI).This SRI is now available for initial testing, but it’s not a full implementation just yet.In early November, the working group will release a more robust version of the SRI that will support additional functionality, including job negotiation.An open-source SRI changes the game for SV2 adoption by drastically reducing the barrier to entry for more pools and firmware developers to implement it, whether by simply using the SRI or developing their own implementation.Critically, the working group helps coordinate adoption across all mining companies and other compatible implementations both closed- and open-source to ensure that all Stratum V2 projects can interact with each other based on the protocol standards.Spiral sponsors @TheBlueMatt, Fi3x, & @pavlenex. @galaxyhq supports @_rrybarczyk, @FoundryServices supports 4ss0, @BitMEX supports @chris_coverdale, & @summerofbitcoin supports @lorban6.Other mining companies interested in contributing to the SRI or supporting Stratum V2 developers are invited to join the working group. To learn more about it and see contact info to get involved, go to http://stratumprotocol.org.Momentum to push Stratum V2 towards widespread adoption is at all-time highs. On that note, stay tuned for more announcements about adoption from big mining companies that are in the works.",

I have messed with stratum last year on my node. i got it working some what but the hash rate was 4x what was expected so i just abandoned it as the provided solo pools were easier and the entire everything is a lot to digest.KanoPool is the best pool. 110% <3",

The argument of more secure is good but who doesn't encrypt the network of their stratum anyways.But what it does allow is it allows them to push the agenda that it is okay to allow transaction bias and censor the bitcoin network. The exact opposite of what my friend Satoshi strived for...",

No need for any stratum updates imho. It seems to me like larger pools and companies are trying to focus in on and make sure keep their somewhat grotesque advantage. I'll pass.",

Not like he is infringing your copyright or anything...It looks like you are focused in a pool luck situation (again), well go to the thread of that pool and discuss it there. Guess what, other pools have implemented it, since its been out there for years and independent parties released a reference implementation.No one stops you from obtaining such implementation and pointing the developers (not Braiins) of the issues. But seeding FUD is cheaper than reading code and pointing specific flaws.Those \"me too\" obvious fake users that add nothing to this discussion will be removed.What is happening? Adoption, that is what.",
