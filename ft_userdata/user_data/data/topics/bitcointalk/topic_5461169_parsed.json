  "content": "He might not get the nomination to become the Democrats' presidential candidate in their Democratic national convention, however, he is giving free advertisment for bitcoin hehehe.Also, assuming that Robert Kennedy, a politician, really purchased bitcoins for his kids as part of their inheritance, I reckon that we might be witnessing bitcoin's mainstream acceptance as a collectible.Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr has always been outspoken about his support for cryptocurrencies. The 2024 presidential candidate has time and again made promises outlining the policies that he will enact if he is elected to power, including some targeting Bitcoin. However, RFK revealed Wednesday that he has actually purchased Bitcoin, 2 BTC for each of his seven children.RFK previously disputed owning any Bitcoin of his own but confirmed owning 14 BTC in a Twitter space when asked about the subject. “Right after the Bitcoin Conference, I decided to put my money where my mouth is and bought two bitcoin for each of my seven children,” said Kennedy.Read in full https://watcher.guru/news/rfk-jr-says-he-purchased-bitcoin-for-his-kids",

Maybe it can make an appeal to them that a Presidential candidate is also in BTC.And if this true then being rich and have a lot of money, the family might think of it as a sort of investment or something. For his kids and grand kids, bitcoin could be look upon as a potential generational wealth for this wealthy individual. However, average joe like the majority of us here can also think of BTC that way.But as what others have said, this id free publicity for RFK Jr, so still a win-win for him.",

Most likely Trump will be on the lead unless there is some hard evidence about his crimes and he ends up stuck in court for the next decade.Maybe he should of started campaigning earlier. Because trump started pretty much since he lost the election and hence why he has all this support. Most people never heard of RFK Jr until perhaps 2 months ago.",

Not a big enough number to win the elections, if you ask me.I remember that in the 2020 US presidential elections, another candidate from the Democratic party was pro-Bitcoin, but he got a ridiculously low amount of support. I even forgot his name. Stating that you are pro-Bitcoin doesn't mean anything. What if a republican candidate also declares, that he supports Bitcoin? I think that Ron DeSantis also made some public statements in favor of Bitcoin/crypto.Most crypto supporters are right wing libertarians, so I doubt that they will support a left wing liberal/socialist candidate.",

For Bitcoin communities, he actually helped Bitcoin get more attention, appeared on more news and ignoring his personal motivation, these news actually help Bitcoin adoption one way or another.

In his favor, and not bitcoin, as @bbc.reporter suggests. Perhaps in this way to show loyalty on RFK Jr part to bitcoin and crypto currencies in general. He wants the votes of the voters and this is a way to get some of them by promoting this event.There is not a drop of mass BTC-acceptance here, and even more so, as a mass collector's item.This event is presented under the guise of something mega-grand, but in fact, it is completely insignificant.",

After all, they already have it and can buy more Bitcoin if they want.We won't know his motives other than buying Bitcoin for his children, especially in these times. But it does support Bitcoin that politicians have also started buying even though some have been buying it long ago.And by saying that he buys Bitcoin for his kids, it does free promotion for Bitcoin and shows that Bitcoin is not a tool for illegal transactions. And hopefully, more politicians do the same and say it publicly so it gives people confidence that Bitcoin is not for anything to do with crime.",
