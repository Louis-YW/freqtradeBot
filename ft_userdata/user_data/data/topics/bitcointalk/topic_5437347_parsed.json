They pull out the \"fuck you\" clause and cancel the contract.I had a 1 btc contract with bitmain in 2017. I got in at 1200 a btc. BTC whaled and whaled and whaled and when we were in October they cancelled me at about 4000 a coin maybe 4500. We all know by December it got to 19k. May contract should have ran until dec 3 when we were about 11.5kSo if you go with a bitmain cloud company and BTC shifts way up \"fuck you\"orBTC shifts way down \"fuck you\"the only way it is a decent deal is if BTC goes sideways for months and months and months.All of the above assumes you find a legit company.80% are not legitand the legit ones do what I described above.",

Thanks guys.It's the best thing to do if you can't buy and maintain the equipment to mine. Imagine a few weeks ago, BTC was worth around 16K and today is worth approximately 23K. That's a huge ROI compared to so many ventures you would try out without breaking much sweatCloud mining is a huge scam and nobody should ever think of wasting their time and money in it.",

Thanks guys.What cold storage? Can you share more info on this? Because not all cold storage are real cold storage, I just care about your safety that's all, the safest option to lock your bitcoin away for a long time is a hardware wallet, do not let anyone tell you it's not. If anyone is running a cloud mining right now it's a scam or Ponzi scheme, gone are the days where cloud mining was profitable, some legit companies have run cloud mining years ago and the legally closed down because it's no more profitable.",

You may find some legitimate mining service for cloud mining, but it is hard to tell which will provide the service. All of them may give you some in the beginning but when it comes to claim your profits, they end up asking for you to deposit some of your own money to do it. If they are really legit, they will deduce the amount from the mined profit as a fee. And there has been already many topics about this one. Read this. Be sure to find them and read all the reply on those topics. One legit I saw was available on Binance, but it was already sold out. So try to avoid them.",
