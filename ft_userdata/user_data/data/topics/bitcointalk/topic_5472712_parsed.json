Even men and women in general. Well, no matter the reason for the conflict between the two countries I believe that human rights need to be protected as it is never justified for an unarmed civilian to be slaughtered in cold blood. When war of this nature happens it's always the innocent ones that suffers the outcome of it. Alot of Israelis and palestinians in Gaza have been slain so far in this war so continues attack on each of these countries will still lead to more innocent civilians being killed. They should rather resolve their differences in dialogue rather than continues attack on each other.No matter the level of provocation that the Hamas in Gaza have put Israel into, i think Israel should consider the innocent palestinian who are suffering severely for something they ain't involved in, they should allow medical care, foods and shelter to be given to the palestinian in Gaza as their is no justification to deny unarmed civilian access to medical care, food and shelter.",

A Russian-led draft resolution calling for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” was voted down last Monday and the following Wednesday, the US vetoed a Brazilian-led text that urged “humanitarian pauses” to deliver aid to millions in the Gaza Strip.",

It’s something that everyone should have sympathy for. Nobody on this earth should starve today. The problem is that Israel says that those supplies will be used by Hamas, so they do not allow a normal supply, not even a really minimal one. However, having hospital ships (a few nations have some type of these, large or small) does not allow for Hamas to use or retain supplies for their own use, so there is not an issue of possible use for military purposes. Also, the people in the ships are much more controlled that in camps.",

Indeed this is very sad.I know hen it comes to international wars like this, the supper nations are in the best position to solicit for a cease fire but we are facing a situation where most of them are playing politics with peoples lives and will keep quiet to defend there pride rather than make statement than has high potential of bringing this war to an end.I weap for the innocent chilren and persons who are dying daily in this war.",

Even if they get support in the form of aid from the West and the Arab world, it will be difficult to cater to two million people and nobody knows when this war will end. But I read that Joe Biden who is the top financier of Israel made it clear that Israel will not occupy any invaded Palestinian land. The are even reports that the Hamas will be replaced by the leaders of West Bank. But if Israel has the intention of chasing Gazans out of their land to occupy it, they should be sent to Israel because another country shouldn't bear the burden of fending for the people they displaced. QuoteSend hospital ships to GazaGaza doesn't need hospital ships, they just need fuel. Israel should allow the supply of fuels to enable hospitals to power and use important health machines.  Patients that need special care are dying painfully and Gaza is at risk of a health pandemic because of decaying dead bodies.",

I thought we would have seen this evidence in the media but what was shown made this claim look more unreal. Israel has just been able to showcase a few AK assault rifles, laptops, and other irrelevant materials such as anti-rust spray. I began to wonder if it was because of these military hardware that many people were killed and about 7,000 patients, women, and children have been allowed to die of thirst and hunger. Even if it might be alleged that Hamas soldiers escaped with the arms and other military equipment, did they also move with the network of tunnels under the hospital?",
