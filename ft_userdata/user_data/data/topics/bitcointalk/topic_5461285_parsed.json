Or just travel in Japan and plan to visit this area?Price is flexible, but always should be fair for both parties.Anyway, if there is anybody I would be happy to get a message.",

You can't even register at an exchange when you don't have a long term visa. Now I am still waiting for my application to go through so p2p is my only option here.Of if anybody is here, or knows somebody that is, it would be very helpful. Would pay around 5% or something for the troubles of course. Can give preferably US$ but Japanese yen also possible.",

I can't just send some 4 digit $ amounts to strangers for obvious reasons. These transfers are no reversible and especially paypal, which I stopped using years ago, is a pure scam trap in my eyes.Also, I can't open a Japanese bank account yet for stated reasons. If I had one I could also just use a Japanese exchange.",

Until around 2018 there were some but when the new law came they were all shut down.Even localbitcoins didn’t offer p2p meeting anymore after that. Trust me, I have been through all possibilities here and finding someone to buy from p2p is my only chance , even though it’s kind of illegal, at least for Japanese . Maybe it’s not but I think it kind of is at least. Of course if you are a foreigner tourist or whatever this is something different .My credit card provider peaced out this year so for the moment all I have is cash. I know it’s hard to find someone here, even google can’t point me to some kind of Japanese crypto forum or whatever . That’s why I at least tried.",

Everything must go through an exchange here  .If I had other possibilities I would use it.Been in Japan and Taiwan for the past 7 years and because of losing my card provider I have no way of purchasing crypto online now, as I now stated several times. So also a site like bisq doesn’t help me when I only have cash at the moment, no online banking whatsoever.After I got my new visa this situation will all change but for now I am out of options and can only use p2p I cash.Thanks though.",

Thanks man. I appreciate the effort.But, did you you see the prices for buying with gift cards? 50% and more above the actual price, lol. I can't spend 1500$ to receive 1000$   .Also, gift card exchange for whatever always smells like a total scam, I think we both know that.Furthermore, all of these people offering this are not located here, so if anything happens, they cannot even be found.I want to find a seller, but I am not desperate, overpay 50% and more and then run the risk of being scammed.  Tried to get Bisq.
