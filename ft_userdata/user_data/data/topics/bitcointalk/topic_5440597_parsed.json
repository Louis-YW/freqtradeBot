      "body": "The usage of Bitcoin in the agricultural sector is currently too limited. The reason for this is because while farmers are still away, Bitcoin is technically ahead of them always. Most likely, a number of smaller farmers are familiar with Bitcoin. Nonetheless, there is still a chance that Bitcoin will be used in agriculture. Farmers and consumers can transact with Bitcoin by purchasing goods and necessities. All we need is a mentality change, and we also need opportunities. More people will be interested in your area if you utilize Bitcoin in the agriculture sector. So, the connection between agriculture and bitcoin is possible.",

From there, the few people who don't know about Bitcoin will grab the idea, and others who already have the idea will be impressed and spread the news, which will be among the things that will also make you stand out among your competitors.",

This leaves us with using it as a means of accepting payments for agricultural produce or making payment for equipment or other necessities.You can try to think outside the box and figure out a way to create a totally redundant coin which runs on the block chain tech and aids agricultural purchases or some other garbage that devs sell to market their shitcoins. But this would not in anyway be linked to Bitcoin.",

I think you should research the market and see what your competitors are doing and what you can be doing differently. For example, I know the popular bitcoiner in Nigeria aka Bitcoin Chief has a agricultural based platform for his farm and created his own crypto that’s being used as a transactional token to purchase agricultural products from his website. You can do something similar that can displace your competitors, people will more comfortable using bitcoin as payments than alien tokens.",

The idea will come for you once the service is functioning and most of the time you can read some suggestions from our members too. I think the first thing you need to try is the exchanges you will use or your BYC wallet to receive payment, you need to understand its downside before using it so that you will gonna have the remedy once you choose to receive bitcoin payments with it.",

But the only problem could be, not enough people are using bitcoin right now, adoption still has a long way to go, and considering that agriculture is a kinda conservative industry, I think there will be even fewer people using it. And the second problem you can face is the governmtnet. One guy already made a post about using bitcoin in his business but in the end, he was forced to stop accepting it because the government didn't like it. I think it's because it's not regulated enought. But it's worth to try, just saying what kind of chalanges you can face. Good luck.",

You can make fast and secure transaction through banks and it will be the most supported payment method in this business. You will have to put your time and resources to find ally that accepts bitcoin payments and then you'll find it difficult to negotiate with them.I think that only benefit bitcoin can bring to your agricultural business, is marketing. You can pretty much gain attention from media probably as the first agricultural company in your country to accept bitcoin payments.By the way since you want to improve your business and at the same time be associated with crypto, you should start thinking about blockchain.

It will give addresses like a tree structure as you explained.Wallets chapter in Mastering Bitcoin.QuoteFirst, the tree structure can be used to express additional organizational meaning, such as when a specific branch of subkeys is used to receive incoming payments and a different branch is used to receive change from outgoing payments. Branches of keys can also be used in corporate settings, allocating different branches to departments, subsidiaries, specific functions, or accounting categories.The second advantage of HD wallets is that users can create a sequence of public keys without having access to the corresponding private keys. This allows HD wallets to be used on an insecure server or in a receive-only capacity, issuing a different public key for each transaction. The public keys do not need to be preloaded or derived in advance, yet the server doesn’t have the private keys that can spend the funds.Centralized exchanges credit their customers receiving addresses like this too if I don't misunderstand.",

The Blockchain technology that bitcoin operates with is what can have a real world use case in agriculture if you are looking for other use cases for bitcoins (crypto) in agriculture asides it's payment function. Blockchain technology can improve data collection, food traceability, QuoteWith increased globalization and intense competition in the market, food supply chains have become longer and more complex than ever before. There are some common problems in food supply chains such as food traceability, food safety and quality, food trust and supply chain inefficiency, which add additional risks on the entire society, economy and the health of human.From the producers’ perspective, the use of blockchain technology helps establish a trust relationship with consumers and build up the reputation of their products, by transparently providing individual product information in the blockchain. Enterprises can better achieve the value of their products and thus increase their competitiveness. This would make it difficult for suppliers of fraud and low-quality products to stay in markets and force all suppliers to improve the quality of products in the whole agricultural and food sectors. From the consumers’ perspective, the blockchain makes true and reliable information about how food is produced and transacted available. It helps address consumers’ concern about the safety, quality and environmental friendliness of food (Ge et al., 2017). The use of blockchain provides the possibility for consumers to interact with producers because consumers can understand the food production process more conveniently and in more detail. It supports consumers by removing obstacles in the exchange of goods to tighten their relationship, and thus strengthen consumer trust and confidence in food safety. From the regulatory agencies’ perspective, blockchain makes reliable and accurate information available for them to carry out informed and efficient regulations (Zhou et al., 2016; Chen, 2018).Blockchain is capable of recording the information of a product from its provenance to the retail store. It provides a secure and immutable way of storing data collected at the start of the supply chain...(It is a really long read, but it is worth your time since the question has been raised, you can read more  HERE  )",
