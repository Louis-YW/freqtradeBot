You look at how actively the team is working and how much they are promoting themselves and spending on ads. What kinds of acquisitions they are making and if any institution is considering or has already been in tie up with them. Then do they grab interest of influential people. Then how good is the future scope of the project, will it stay viable long term basis.For all of this you can go through Reddit , Quora and YouTube channels of prominent people in this field. Also watch only content with a from a credible platform, these days 1 year olds are explaining how to invest in cryptos , so better stay away from getting scammed",

Otherwise you'd end up brainwashed by pretty advertisement where they first create a fake problem (eg. \"bitcoin is slow\" or \"bitcoin uses too much energy\") then introduce you to their own scam coin that supposedly fixes those fake problems (eg. a shitcoin \"faster than bitcoin\" or one using the fundamentally flawed \"PoS algorithm\"). When you are fooled into buying that shitcoin, they dump their premined coins on you and make a lot of profit while you end up holding worthless bags.",

When you are confident, start with a small sum so you can practice with wallets, private keys.Then start buying small amounts over fixing periods (something called Dollar-Cost-averaging) and go on studying.Bitcoin can be a very complex matter, you’ll stumble in very different points of view. You will fined your own.And, above all, doubt of every investment tips, of course. Everyone want to put their greasy hands on your precious satoshi’s!OMG! Me included!",

Thanks in advance..You do not need to read many books, learn many computer language or anything at all. Do only two things.a. Read the whitepaper and read it a way that you understand the 9 page file.b. Learn how to create a wallet and secure it.Take it simple. You do not lean how money was created, who control money, what paper it needs, what printer, what other material to create money. You only see money, have it to you, keep it in bank, spend it.

Though the article is wow!!! I really enjoyed reading the article to gather more information to the ones I I have gathered. That is why learning is a progressive process that has no ending. Then the second link is very nice for the books (The internet of Money. Volume one to two and the other book) stated there. But I discovered that the books can no be accessible unless you pay or buy the books from Amazon. That is poor users can not afford it. For the OP, you can use the two links that have been provided by Maus0728 to equip yourself with bitcoin and also make more research on search engine like Google and Yahoo. But all depends on your interest and ability to learn. You also need time to read or navigate the net to search for information. You might be interested to read but time is a very big disturbing factor in learning.",
