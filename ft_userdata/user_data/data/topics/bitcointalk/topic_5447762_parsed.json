      "body": "Well this is something I always would do when a new song came out or a new movie that I want to watch. I would simply visit a torrent site and download free copies to my computer not realizing that one day I would download a huge software virus. Let me tell you it was not easy and it sure was not cheap to save my computer. Since that incident, I have now learned my lesson to just pay a trusted streaming service to watch my movies or hear my favorite music. I do not pirate software anymore, it is a risk with much unknown malware or virus that is simply too costly. Fixing this problem is expensive and time-consuming and nothing but headaches. If you think about it someone can be spying on your activity and even steal important information.",
