Good question. A little of both. Usually, it would be on an individual basis. However, upon official releases and other special sales (like this one), we often get hit with several orders at one time, then we wait a day or two until all payments have arrived before we drop off the orders in a large batch to the PO. Unfortunately, sometimes that one or two days of wait time will slowly turn into two or three days, then three or four days, etc. Eventually, we ship all paid orders without waiting for all the payments to come in. That deadline is usually about one week. For this particular collection of orders, that one week deadline is today, so all remaining paid orders will ship first thing Monday morning. I hope that helps to explain our unofficial, odd, likely illogical, and ever-changing shipping system. Chris@TBPCo.",
