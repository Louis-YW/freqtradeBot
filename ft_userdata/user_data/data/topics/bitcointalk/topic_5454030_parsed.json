I can't really get my head around any reason why someone would just sit down and start looking for ways to mock others. This is mockery, JSYK.",

I think it would have been a better thread if the title was not misleading and there was actual substance within the thread.Quote from: KingsDen on May 26, 2023, 11:27:58 PMJG is known for being strick and at times dramatic with giving feedbacks. I have seen where JG used someone's feedback space as a note or a bookmark for self Some time ago I noticed Hhampuz writing on the lines of note-to-self when he left feedback therefore I thought it could be something useful for me to use when needed. If memory serves correct I used that format just a few times",

Negative and neutral feedbacks bring sad memories so they are not funny or experience to laugh over. It might be funny to you but brought pain to the victims. I looked at the thread created by @joker_josue to solicit support so that the neutral tag can be reversed and I will not want to go through such a process because it could lead to confrontation and antagonism. My take is that there is no need for this thread because it will bring back sad memories. It will be better to create a collection of commendable positive feedback that will motivate members to contribute positively to the forum.",
