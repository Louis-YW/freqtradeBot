That gonna be a changing game for this project while Shiba Inu has already reached that level.",

And if BitGert has the potential to grow in the future, maybe BitGert can increase in price and have more investors. And I guess, while the price hasn't risen like the Shiba Inu, maybe I'll try to allocate a small amount of money to buy and hold BitGert. But I will do that after researching and if I find the project is interesting to be another investment.",

There will be more risk in a new project than in shiba, however, seeing what Bitgert is showing so far, I feel pretty confident in my decision to invest in Bigert.",
