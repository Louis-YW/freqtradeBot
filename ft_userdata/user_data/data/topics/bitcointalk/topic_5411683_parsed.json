Might to think Bitgert is one of the growing and promising project in the future but who know exactly what gonna happen this project knowing that it is just about to start and the sad reality is that it was hard to gain trust and attraction if nobody like an influential person helps to promote it. That gonna be a changing game for this project while Shiba Inu has already reached that level.",

And if BitGert has the potential to grow in the future, maybe BitGert can increase in price and have more investors. And I guess, while the price hasn't risen like the Shiba Inu, maybe I'll try to allocate a small amount of money to buy and hold BitGert. But I will do that after researching and if I find the project is interesting to be another investment.",

There will be more risk in a new project than in shiba, however, seeing what Bitgert is showing so far, I feel pretty confident in my decision to invest in Bigert.",
