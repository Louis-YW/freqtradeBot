For example this board in particular is called beginners and help and as the name implies it for primary to help newbies out and also help members that has any difficulty such is the case with other boards.In addition boards has a quick introduction attached to them that explains to you what the board serves at, all this isn't difficult you just have to read properly",

For example you can’t start a thread that actually contains tips for beginners and you place them on bitcoin discussion board or you move a speculative discussion of bitcoin price to economics. Even from reading the threads created by reputable members in a certain board will help guide you to understand what each board entails. The forum moderators are even more active when it comes to moving threads to appropriate board. Some threads are actually moved out from where the OP wants it to be most at times based on the the type Subject that thread is giving. In all I don’t see the need to create a thread explaining each board because I feel each board name has done justice to that. Quote from: Ambatman on June 30, 2023, 08:07:11 PMAnything that doesn't fall on a specific boardGoes to Off topicI would say anything outside cryptocurrency and politics and discussion are entirely off topic to the forum. Most at times people feel bad when there threads are moved to off topic board (because it is one of the least boards that reputable members go to), this is most at times due to a bad subject giving to the thread",
