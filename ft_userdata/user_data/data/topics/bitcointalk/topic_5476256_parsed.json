If you were to convert your Bitcoin (BTC) to Fiat (NGN), based on the current Bitcoin price will you be proud of Bitcoin you have in your portfolio since you started investing. I have very little of some other cryptocurrencies because I don’t have enough money to buy Bitcoin. However I am not satisfied with the amount of crypto I have. I feel like I have not giving more attention in investing due to my current financial strength. Since this topic is about Bitcoin, I believe many here are new or old investor in Bitcoin, this is why am curious to know your thoughts towards your own accumulation. Perhaps this topic may remind or bring your mind back to take your investment more serious if you are lacking behind. I understand the economy of the country and I know it may affect some persons to not fully invest the planned amount due to life unexpected happenings.",

You still will remain in good condition to continue holding, but if you are so aimed at making quick profits, that is the only time you will have issues with the Bitcoin market behaviours since you may have to wait a long period before you make anything out of it.So sure we may think we are too late or that we have not accumulated enough Bitcoin, but along the line, we have discovered that we are still among the early birds, considering the what the price of Bitcoin will be future.",

But you need to hurry because the day United States SEC will approve spot bitcoin ETF is getting nearer. I think it will be between December 25th to January 10 based on what I have been reading online. But the price will still increase more as bitcoin will halve in April 2024 and more people will invest. Bitcoin is likely going six digits before 2026.",

      "body": "First of, your writeup is as confusing as hell and it's not easy to understand the message you are trying to pass across to be honest but regarding the question on knowing the amount of bitcoin we've accumulated, Should the amount of bitcoin you've been able to accumulate become your major concern? The amount of bitcoin you have at your disposal is dependent on a whole lot of things and ranging from the time you knew about Bitcoin to the way you used in accumilating your bitcoin and of course, how much you have that you can use in investing into bitcoin that wouldn't give you a restless mind. So what ever quantity of bitcoin you are able to accumulate based on this parameters, you should be okay with it and look out for the most convenient and efficient way you can use in increasing the amount of Bitcoin you're accumilating.",

I understand the economy of the country and I know it may affect some persons to not fully invest the planned amount due to life unexpected happenings.  If you’ve not accumulated enough bitcoin, you still have time to do that and await the ultimate bull run season. Many things must have happened one way or the other while accumulating bitcoin that will stop one from having a lots of them stored in their wallets for the bull run. That shouldn’t weaken you but rather continue accumulating gradually. If you stop when you can invest as little as you can that’s when you’ve began to fail in your investment. You don’t have to borrow money to invest, just keep it simple and continue your accumulation. The ultimate goal is to gain profit and that will happen after investment and patience which is expected from every investor as they await to reap their profits.",

So make im just take note for dis one say di subject of im topic get a different meaning from di content, but all di same we get di meaning of wetin im de try talk.My take for di matter be say now na very good time to de accumulate plenty bitcoin, because after halving next year na serious bull run go follow, and investors go cash in plenty profit. But at di same time if we no get di money to accumulate am, we no go kill ourselves or go steal because we must accumulate bitcoin. Di most important thing be say we don de informed of di financial benefit of holding bitcoin, especially as we de enter ATH. Wetin sweet me pass for bitcoin investment matter be say im no get a price tag wey person suppose take start, na as your power reach na im you go take start to de hold am. Small small you go de accumulate am and before you know you don hold plenty plenty bitcoin, be dat.",

I understand the economy of the country and I know it may affect some persons to not fully invest the planned amount due to life unexpected happenings.  I don't really think the hardship of the economy will prevent one from not investing. Even as the economy is hard I think people still eat, nobody has ever chew grass that is to say you can squize yourself to be removing some portion of your fund to be buying bitcoin. Although is not a must, but if you have a steady stream of income, you can be saving gradually. But if you don't have work to back you up then you can relax till you meet up to demand.",

There is absolutely no amount of wealth ever be enough for a man so as there is no amount of Bitcoin being accumulated would ever be enough for every Bitcoin investors. This is actually why we hodl and strives for a long-term investment because we believe tomorrow had the best nomatter how appreciatable today may be.",

Op, this current Bitcoin price will not make me convert my Bitcoin to fiat because the current Bitcoin price is showing strength for the Bitcoin halve that will take place next year in April with no estimated date. And if I convert my Bitcoin to fiat na me go still lose because Bitcoin will set another ATH after halve don takes place o, I would rather hold my Bitcoin till the new Bitcoin all-time high reaches.  Quotethis is why am curious to know your thoughts towards your own accumulation. I mainly used the DCA strategy to accumulate my Bitcoin because, with the DCA strategy, I can buy my Bitcoin at different prices which will help to control the volatile part of Bitcoin in my hodling. But sometimes if I have enough money I accumulate my Bitcoin with three strategies which are lump sum buy, buy the Bitcoin dip, and buy through the DCA strategy, these strategies help me to accumulate the quantity of Bitcoin that I want faster.",
