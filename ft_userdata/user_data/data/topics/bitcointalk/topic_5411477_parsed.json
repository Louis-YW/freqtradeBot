If you are able to provide the accurate KYC, the exchange supposed to help you recover back your account.You will have to keep on sending message to gate.io, but it is a centralized exchange where you have no complete control, people should always take note of that.",

If you have all have the email used, mobile number (if required) i guess that is enough for them to help you recover 2fa and your account unless they are up to something.Also, what's their response for you to say that \"they still don't give  you access back\"?",

Well, I don't know what your experience is like with the exchange, I've been a  user of gate.io exchange since 2018, I have 2fa activated on my account and I've once been locked out of my account due to lost access to 2fa because I changed my phone and didn't have the correct back up code required to restore my account 2fa.I contacted their customer care, this was way back 2020, I followed all the process I was asked to, it took some time, about a week or over, in the end, my account 2fa was resetted and I was able to login again and set up a new 2fa.After the incident above, I learnt to withdraw all my funds on centralized exchanges to my non-custodial wallet before changing my phone or performing any thing that has to do with factory reset.",

This is the first time I read this kind of complaint maybe the problem is on your end or side you've changed your 2FA setting or replaced it, if they are doing that then we'll read many similar complaints like yours and with thousands of users they will lose their reputation and eventually their business, you have to back your complaint if this is intentional then show the proof, you have to be patient and keep sending a ticket, you did not also mention how long this issue has been.",

I have never faced any issue like what you are mentioning as 2FA stopped working even when I had a few times more funds than you. Make sure that it's not a problem from your side. Did you try contacting their support? Also, as mentioned above, KYC has been mandatory to complete if you are going to use the exchange.",

I had some occurrences with them where the support agent did not know what they were talking about…",
