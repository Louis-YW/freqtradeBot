It is even not taken maintenance cost, staff salary etc.Check how shit coins are easy to mine but in return, nearly no profit. See at Revenue / Profit column.https://whattomine.com/If you want staking, Staking / Masternode coins are here but likely you won't get profit by investing a node and stake it to get reward.",

We know that something that can be obtained easily will be worthless, just like the blockchain system that we build, we build a system where everyone can mine coins easily and that's the problem, because that's going to make a lot of coins circulate, and that's will make the value of the coin worthless. And how can we possibly keep the blockchain system we built from collapsing, while the price of our coin alone is worthless?",

      "body": "BTC was orginally easy to mine at the beginning because then it had little value and the mining competition was not so much. The algorithm just had to be created in this way in order to give BTC more value and to secure or protect the network, because that is exactly what the miners do when they validate transactions.If it was so easy for anyone to mine BTC right now, it may be easy for an attacker to hack and control the network or to have 51% of the networks hashrate, because it would be no different from the centralized shitcoins that are very easy to mine and reverse transactions. The difficulty of mining makes the network secure, and that is why the network algorithm adjusts it after 2,016 mined blocks to keep the system secure and moving fine.Finally, i think mining difficulty is also essential so that the timeframe set for the last block to be mined would be actualized, if it was so easy to mine BTC, probably by now we would have mined the entire 21 million BTC so quickly and it may reduce the value of the coin so drastically.",

There is no value in \"easy and cheap\" unless you are the creator of an altcoin.The fact that Bitcoin is difficult to mine adds to its value which in turn makes it expensiveto acquire. Its deflationary nature feeds into the \"supply v's demand\".",

Op this is the fact high demand rise the cost and currently the same thing is with the Bitcoin system Hash rate increase due to an increase in the hash value which is based on the manners. There is no possible system that can do it practically according to my observation if you dare to create a system then it will directly hit its market value and supply and no one wants to mine some shit worth nothing. You are possibly influenced by the recent spam mining apps such as Pi and etc etc. I think your idea to distribute power is very good but it's just theoretically similar to the OSI model in networking. Still if somehow we consider such a system is lunched by handling all the impossible outcomes with an idle case then how can you say that there will be no spam if you can mine it with your low-spec device then everyone in greed will go for mining more by adopting spamming ways.Correct me if I am wrong on it..",

The competition for the next block attracts huge computing power to the network which contributes to protecting it against getting hijacked.Ease of earning means uncapped supply which increases exponentially as the coin becomes more popular. With no way to regulate the introduction of new coins, you get hyper inflation, or a worthless currency.Quote from: thecodebear on March 29, 2023, 04:10:57 AMSo the goal is that even after your theoretical cryptocurrency is very popular some years after it is introduced and lots of people are interested in earning coins through whatever system you set up, you need that system to allow them to do it easily/cheaply. Your average Joe should be able to reasonably participate in earning newly issued coins without large time or capital expenditure, including capital expenditure on investing which makes PoS not satisfy the requirement. Okay, go!This is not a practical theory to consider. A system cannot constantly add value without any requirement or input to regulate its supply.Even though fiat is introduced solely by banks, it is still prone to hyper inflation due to the uncontrolled printing of new notes, imagine if everyone could print it in their homes with relative ease.- Jay -",

I wanted to see if anyone could design such a system that keeps a blockchain secure, focuses on equitable distribution of newly minted coins rather than competition of resources (like how PoW works), but also enforces against \"spamming\" or \"hacking\" the system to destroy the equitable distribution, and of course would need some sort of mechanism to keep the supply limited in some way to create a sense of value (though it wouldn't need to be super strong, I mean look at dogecoin its an infinite supply and a useless memecoin but because Musk pumped it two years ago people still think its 'the future' lol).I was thinking about it because of the idea of needing the fiat onramp into crypto, and if there was a way to onboard people into crypto in order to bypass the need for fiat onramps by design a blockchain that could distribute tokens equitably in the way PoW originally did before competition for PoW made it too hard for the average person to do anymore. There many not be a way to do it, just wondering what people could come up with.",

This is why toilet papers were dirt cheap, but when the pandemic struck, and for some fucking reason the Americans hoarded so much of it that stores jacked the prices, resellers sold it for so high the inventor of toilet paper rolls will wet his shorts and shed a tear, and thus the prices soared up high. In that regard, if you want to build a cryptocurrency project that prioritizes mining over the value of your coin, why don't you just build something like DogeCoin lmao, infinite supply, so the coin is worth practically nothing. in short, you gotta understand that a tradeoff between value and supply must be made if you want to prioritize one over the other. For most, they'd rather put value over supply, but for some deviants out there, supply is king.",

If there is an equitable share of tokens and anyone can easily mine it, it will be a coin with no value at all. Why would I buy a coin at $1 from you when I can mine it myself with ease? And then who would buy it from me if they can mine it too?Bitcoins algorithm and tokenomics are made in such a way that makes it valuable. I don't think that Bitcoin would have had any value if Bitcoin had an infinite token supply and everyone could easily mine it which means that almost everyone would have at least some of it or maybe a lot of it.
