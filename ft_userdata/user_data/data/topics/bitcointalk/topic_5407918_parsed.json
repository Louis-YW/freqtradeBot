  "content": "I was reading a post where financial professionals discussed their views on bitcoin. how it influences both people and the government's desire to impose regulations on them. Some people, however, supported its existence and the issue it resolves, while others continue to believe there are reasons why it is not advisable to invest in cryptocurrencies as a whole. Such criticism has always existed as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to expand, among others. What really impressed me about the post was the comment section, where readers shared their experiences utilizing bitcoin. One of the commenter named Paul Krebs described how he lost his bitcoin to a bogus blockchain.com imposter on Facebook, where they contacted him as blockchain official support. They gained access to his blockchain wallet, and 7.0938 BTC were taken. However, he claimed that the bitcoin was returned after he emailed a recovery expert with contact address - BLACKJOCKER10x @ PROTONMAIL COM. Different professionals who aid in retrieving stolen bitcoin were suggested by other commenters. This post explains how cryptocurrency newbies like me, who are also interested in learning more about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can receive assistance from professionals who can aid in retrieving monies that have been taken from their wallets. And how to spot bogus blockchain official supporters when they are dressed as one. We have experts in the forum who can shed more light on this as well as how genuine those commenters were and determine if their testimonies were not fake. By contacting such experts, people won't be persuaded to fall victim to another scam.",

So when your Bitcoin was sent to any address that does not belong to you, you lost it, forever.You can not recover it, never.But you can recover your wallet if it was hacked, compromised. It does not make sense if all Bitcoin in that wallet was stolen already. However, with a non custodial wallet, you can do more than just making a transaction. You can sign a message from that wallet (from a public address and a key) and sometimes, you have to do this for business deal.But because that wallet was compromised, you should abandon it after you can prove your ownership and inform others (trade, business partners) about the situation. After that, you must use a new wallet for storage, signing message and so on.",

With the shared opinions, positive and negative opinions, as a listener or reader it somehow just creates confusion in our minds about what is right and what is wrong. That is why having this situation we should not have to weigh all of those things we heard but it was for us to even try to further know what really it is (Bitcoin) and to verify something (potential investment or scam).",

Also if the mempool is congested and full, low fee transactions in the mempool would be replaced by new transactions with high fee, the low fee transactions can be used in another transaction.But this is not about this topic at all though.

      "body": "I believe that people should learn about basic safety of storing and using Bitcoin before investing into it, but that the main risk of investment is the price volatility, not stolen coins. If you do everything right, your coins will be safe. They get stolen if you stored the coins on a centralized platform where the keys aren't yours, or if you're very negligent with your seed. And because you store the coins yourself, there's more responsibility for it (you can't ask an authority of some sort to freeze your account, restore your access to it or reverse a transaction), but that's the trade-off of financial freedom.If your coins were stolen, the chance of getting them back is very low. But sometimes it can be possible if there's certain data available, and if people know what they're doing. I once helped a friend save BTC when a situation was quite dark (not out of deep knowledge, though, but merely out of luck and cold mindset when it was important). I also got lucky once with recovering 40% of my funds on a platform that performed an exit scam (I was very new to cryptos back then and didn't know about the 'not your keys, not your coins' thing), but it was also about luck, not expertise. I do know that there are some successful cases when authorities catch the criminals and seize funds, which victims can sometimes get in return. And I also know that sometimes, when there's some data available and some data lost, it's possible to get help from experts and recover the coins (not in the case they're stolen, though, but rather when you accidentally lock yourself out of access).",

Those kinds of comments are easier to spot and very popular on social media, most of the time, on youtube channels. This is where a single person will comment on how MR A has helped him trade $200 to make $11k and the rest of the testimonial bots replies will follow the comment just to convince people to try out the fake service.",

But even if the hacker sent the stolen funds to his private wallet, and then at some point to CEX, the owner has a chance to get them back if he contacted as many CEXs as possible and sent them the coin address where his coins ended up.Those hackers who know what they are doing will surely use coin mixers, decentralized crypto exchanges, or some other methods to cover their tracks.

With some educated guesswork you can maybe trace coins across a few transactions, but it is very easy to get it completely wrong and still doesn't tell you anything about who is making those transactions. Deanonymizing a single address is different. This can be done if funds from that address move to a KYCed account on a centralized exchange or other service, if the wallet software being used is custodial, if the wallet software being used leaks information such as IP addresses, if the address is posted on social media or a forum, and so on.Quote from: Asiska02 on July 28, 2022, 02:01:21 PMAlso, does this means if the funds is not sent to a centralized exchange but moved to another personal wallet it can never be traced as far as the funds remains in such wallet??Coins being moved between personal wallets become increasingly difficult to accurately trace or to deanonymize, if the users in question know what they are doing. It also remains impossible for any \"bitcoin recovery service\" or similar to infiltrate such a wallet and recover any stolen coins. Anyone advertising such a service is almost certainly trying to scam you.",

I contacted him for guidance, we talked for while and I did subscribe to their bitcoin investment/mining program, believe it or not he made me $490,050 in just 6 weeks and i was very much impressed at his skills, and I only started with a small amount.Look at all those opportunities, contact Professor Mike Hang now!!!!!",
