  "content": "Hi Bitcointalk, it's been many years since I last visited it, due to personal circumstances I am in need of $1000, preferably in ETH. Will pay back with interest (name your rate) 25th of January 2023.I have about $1800 collateral locked in an Ethereum smart contract of which I'll transfer the ownership to you before you send me the funds. I am a developer (employee) of a protocol on Ethereum with $15m+ in TVL and 2+ year operating history, will do all the verification I can with you in private.edit: enough tokens will be unlocked by the 25th of January to cover the loan. The contract only has 1.5 month of vesting left.",

There's no need to trust my word for it. Ownership will be transferred to the lender and he or she can do what he wants with it.It is not a \"promise\" of me giving you something, you will have full ownership beforehand and nothing I can do to stop that.

From what I've seen, the project does seem to have some legitimacy, and has a decent amount of liquidity/volume relative to the project's size.

Neither said that this is a scam. The main problems is that 1- they are locked and 2- if the price drops, how you will put extra to cover the lender's loss?
