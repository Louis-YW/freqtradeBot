Well you got a point. It was not clever from me to compare the big players with a freshly launched project. I might have rushed as well with the statement that it will be a finished product. development never stops right? - so the terms of service and privacy will be updated (its already written) - consider the platform as \"beta\" with all elements working - also pragmatic play is available on the casino section. where you able to check the sportsbook and the crazy amount of sub bet options? You have to admit building a platform like this with 0 external funds is pretty impressive. regarding whitepaper - there is a pitch deck if you are really into reading sheets (jump into TG and ask for it) - but the concept is clear and simple (share 50% of house net income with staker) and you can read out the main vision on pepe.bet as well. So dont see that as a concerning point. until next time - cheers",
