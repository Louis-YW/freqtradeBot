  "content": "Hello, I decided to play on csgo500. I topped up $25,000 and bet on x3. I managed to win, I was lucky. When I started withdrawing money, I encountered a problem and was asked to go through verification. Everything went through, then the administrators started saying that I used an exploit  , they did not provide any evidence. Never play on this site, if you win a large amount you will be scammed( my email arnoldsamoylov7@gmail.com ), admin csgo500, u can checked.",

      "body": "Hey Muki972, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you share a little more information and evidence so we can see what this is really about? You said something about being accused of using an exploit? What happened exactly? It's hard to really understand without more details and  it would be super helpful if you explained more about the accusation - like what exploit they think you used, what you were actually doing, stuff like that.  Also, what were you betting on when this supposed exploit thing happened? That's an important piece of this puzzle.  I think with some more background details we can probably get a clearer picture of this whole situation.  No judgement here! Just trying to understand so we can chat about it reasonably. By the way, if you want, you can use this format for your scam accusation.",

Have you informed them about it after creating your new account? Perhaps, they have taken the actions when the system noticed similar device/IP activity or wallet address connections.Based on the self-exclusion rules, you aren't allowed to make deposits and place bets during the period. But you tried to escape the rules by creating a new account. Which is a clear violation of the terms. Providing fake documents for the KYC verification is another violation of the terms. Control your gambling habits and forget about the forfeited funds.",
