I recently made a mistake buying a lot of Dogecoins after Elon Musk changed the Twitter logo into the Doge logo. Price was surging and due to FOMO, I bought a lot at the price of $0.099 and afterwards it started to dump like hell. If I continue to hold Dogecoins, the price might be dumping even lower but if I sell them now, the losses become concrete and I'll never have a chance to win back.

Invest now before it is too late, Elon Musk will tweet again and the price will rise.And the next morning, when logical thinking returns, the loss has already been made.Unfortunately, emotions have a decisive role in investing, but you are the only one who can turn them into something useful or a real loss.Turning it into something useful is by following a specific strategy, thinking several times before investing, it is true that thinking will reduce your profits, but similarly it will reduce your losses.",

There were also cases where it didn't and I ended up with more losses.",

Elon do that frequently so its like you caught the big wave and now caught it by suprise. Of course some will take profit from that those who are like a second of the news who liyerally bought a lot and when many have realize the pump. There they can unload their bags on the late comers. But its okay if you hold it for long term maybe youll experience the same pump when Elon drop another cheap trick on socials.",

In investing, there is always a temptation, and it only takes a little carelessness for greed to surface and we will pay the price. In terms of investment, doge is a meme with no utility, and many say it's useless. But we come here to invest, and seek profit, so if it's an opportunity, we shouldn't miss it. For me, you buy doge at that price is not too much to worry about, doge will still recover and increase because there is still Elon behind. He's making good money with it, so there's no reason to ditch it now. If I invest in altcoins, I would rather invest in Doge than invest in old altcoin projects.",

The most important thing is to avoid similar mistakes futurely.In your case, that is to be careful with speculators like Elon Musk who has already lured many investors into losses. This DOGE logo on Twitter's incident we saw days ago, was expected to turn into what you described above.Next time don't get too excited about following Musk's steps on investments. And always invest aiming long term results, while avoiding shitcoins such as memecoins.",

I would brush it as a rookie mistake but have comfort in the thought that you weren't alone. Elon is just the newest influencer, there have been many in the past that people follow. This will pass too sooner or later. People eventually get bored on combatting with trading bots and Elon's tweets.Quote from: FireDAOJackie_Z on April 12, 2023, 06:55:27 AMPrice was surging and due to FOMO, I bought a lot at the price of $0.099 and afterwards it started to dump like hell.

Why do you think you never have a change to in back your money? I am not saying you will but if you don't hodl, you won't be making it back. Least not with doge. Selling in loss now might be the best option as this was the ultimate peak for doge visibility. There are no big events to wait for doge anymore.Quote from: FireDAOJackie_Z on April 12, 2023, 06:55:27 AMHave you ever had the same experience ? What did/would you do ? Please share your opinions.

Have you ever had the same experience ? What did/would you do ?Well one of the rules of crypto investing always was \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" which means that most of the time it is to late if you buy a coin after they have released some big news. You need to buy them before those news become public, that is not possible in most cases though if you are not an insider. So you at least need to be very fast once the big news are hitting. If the news are already 1hour old or even older i would not buy anymore.Losses only become a reality when you sell those coins. So if you can afford to hold them longer, then i would definitely do that. If a new bull market comes, then Dogecoin will definitely pump together with the rest of the market and you can sell your tokens then.",

Not quite a big mistake dude, you actually follow what you think is right and besides, many people had also gained profit from investing in Dogecoin but unfortunately, the time does not give you a favor, I think you come late. But, I was believing that you can still make money for this project, you only have to wait for the next hype and sell them right away. But on the other side, whether we make mistakes or make wrong decisions but I don't think we need to regret doing it. Instead, consider this as a lesson to learn and avoid such decisions in the future.",

Those are big names and holding them until the bull comes is a great idea and should be done. However, there are also a different type of situations where we are talking about a bit lower than that, stuff that are low rank means that they could be as low as out of top 100, which would not be really that much of a big deal considering that we are talking about something you can sell and get out of. So that's the situation, most people will hold the big ones, and maybe hold the smaller ones but could potentially get out of those ones.",

But if you think that you can no longer win them back, try to win them back through other means. Investing in bitcoin is the best way to win some back from your losses in other cryptos. Don't be too focused on meme coins, they're now pumped and dumped coins and the gains that they'll give you were passed done already before Elon gets a hold of it. Not all of these coins will recover when we've come to the point of being in the bull run again. It doesn't go like that at all times.",
