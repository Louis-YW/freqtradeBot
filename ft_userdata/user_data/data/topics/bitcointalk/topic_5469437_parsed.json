  "content": "The key to unlocking your full potential is when your Decisions align perfectly with your Purpose, Words and Actions.Most people give up because they set too big of goals to start and then get overwhelmed trying to do too many things at once.Start small: \"I am going to open up my journal and write 1 sentence today\" then Do It!\"I am going to do 1 pushup right now\" then Do It!If you write 10 sentences then great! If you do 5 pushups you exceeded your goal. At least you took action and did what you said you were going to do.Discipline means Doing what you Say and Saying what you Do. As you become more disciplined and accomplish small goals, you will have more focus to accomplish your larger goals.",
