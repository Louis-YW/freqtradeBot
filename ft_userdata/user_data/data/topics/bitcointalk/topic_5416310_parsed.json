I could remember how I lost one thousand Canadian dollar because of a means of sending it across. The sender was a friend on Facebook and we've been friends for over 6 months and one day I really needed help which he offered to render but had to use ria money transfer to send the money and after sending the money, the riamoney agent told him the transaction would take just 15 minutes for reflection and ignorantly I didn't get to check because it was a Saturday and banks don't open here on Saturdays so I felt it should have reflected by Monday. Got to the bank to get the money but it wasn't available yet because it actually takes 3 to 5 working days for reflection. I asked him to go back and get the money and then send it using a Bitcoin machine, only for him to get there and was discouraged by the ria agent and I lost that money and got evicted from my apartment. Bitcoin has faced so many challenges similar to this and even worst but Bitcoin remains borderless since it's decentralized and no one can stop Bitcoin even in countries it has been prohibited.",
