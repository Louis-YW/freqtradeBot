  "content": "Hi all,I realise there has already been a lot of discussion around crypto signals (specifically from Telegram groups) and whether they should be avoided, so with that discussion aside, I wanted to understand a bit more of how they are supposed to be read and set up.I have done a fair bit of research already, but am still unclear about a few points. Let's assume the following signal has come through:Coin: $COIN/USDT (LONG)Leverage: 1-3xEntry: 46 to 55OTE: 52Targets:5759616366707479...Stop Loss: 39Assuming OTE Means \"Optimal Trade Entry\", I would create an order for $COIN at 52 for $10 capital (as an example) with 1x to 3x Leverage (completely understanding what \"Leverage\" means in terms of risk). I would then add partial take profits at 57, 59, 61, etc. - with a Stop Loss at 39.The thing that I am a bit unclear about is, how would I best structure the take profit percentages? I have seen examples of 4 TPs, so a 25% take profit at each TP would make sense. However with this signal for example, there are around 20 TP recommendations. Instinctively I would have said to take 5% at each TP (100/20), but that seems to leave me exposed for a fair bit until I am at \"break even\". So a higher % at lower TPs and then tapering it towards the higher TPs.Are there any suggestions or good strategies of how to optimise this risk/reward ratio and structure the % at respective TPs? Or would it make more sense to just leave it \"running\" with potentially a trailing Stop Loss until that hits? The concern here is that I may get closed out too soon if the market is quite volatile.Cheers!",

      "body": "My advice is simple, try not to rely on signals received from telegram crypto signals because everyone is working towards their own interest and there are alot of means people got things manipulated this days, why not work on yours and depend on what you read about the indicating signals than working on someone's else that may not actually work as expected, DYOR.",

      "body": "Although I agree with the above users saying that signals from Telegram groups should not be trusted, I also am the type of person that mostly learns from own mistakes.The TP strategy mostly depends on your own risk tolerance and the amount risked.For example if I were to risk $10 than I would try to cash in most TP as high as possible. A YOLO moment. And if it doesn't work at lest it will get Telegram signals out of your systemÂ  If the amount is higher, everyone has a different meaning of considerable abount, that the first priority is ROI and then see what extra profit you can obtain once the initial amount is accounted for.Not sure if there is such a thing as perfect strategy but hey, food for thought.",

They are up for the gain and not for the good of subscribers. They make out signals for free at the beginning and with limitation and after that it is off and requiring money to get them. It is still not that you won't have some failures in it, it is not a guarantee that everything will turn out fine with it.",

To invest without research is a wrong thing because in cryptocurrency we have some coins always for pump and dumpe . If you go that way it is not for a longtime hodling and you will lose your money. There is also scam in the telegram group that the developers use for the investors if you make contribution they don't like, you are blocked.",
