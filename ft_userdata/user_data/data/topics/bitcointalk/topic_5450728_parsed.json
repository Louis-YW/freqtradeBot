The only time we can’t trust this 3rd party slot provider is when they show irregularities but being doubtful to them without any valid reason will just make our gambling experience full of doubts. Like what Stake did. The only thing we can do is trust the casino that accepts this 3rd party slot provider since they are the one who review and audit this games to ensure the safety of their customer. For me I can still trust some of the slot provider that has good track of record for providing a quality slot game.",

Who are auditing their games and who are checking if the advertised RTP are being configured on their servers? Let's discuss....  The whole casino industry is using third party slot providers except when some are becoming big then they are developing their own slots. For a starter casino developing in-house games / slots are too expensive and easier for relaying to others. I don't think the demand is not going down any time soon.About trust and things? The gambling industry is doing business. A piece of software is easy to manipulate especially when it is not open source. So no matter if that is an in-house slot from a highly trusted casino or third party integration, you always have the chance to lose big money and become a victim of manipulation.",

I rarely see this slot games on other casino that I play as featured slot games. I browse the list of provider on Duelbits and Bitcasino but this YGGDRASIL provider is not available. Only selected reputable casino adds this provider. Actually, Only Stake is the only reputable casino I know that list this provider.",

Sports betting is live and there is no way someone can manipulate the game. The outcome from the match is what you get from the bet. Even all those scam accusations are from the casinos. I have not seen sports betting sites have been accused of scamming. Even if happened it is rare. The way slot games are even developed is not favorable. Casinos use 3rd party and anything 3rd party can not be trusted because they are also looking for there profit apart from the MD of the industry.",

We won't know anything or can't find information about this unless we ask the provider directly, but I'm sure they won't want to say it.Maybe the regulator will audit their games or other parties periodically check it, but we know that it's all easy to do.

Let's discuss....  Supposedly the countries in which gambling is deemed legal should have a specific agency to deal with these issues and make sure that any company registered under their jurisdiction is not cheating their customers, so if a third party provider is showing signs of irregularities then it is the job of that agency to see what is happening and take the necessary steps to stop this from happening and apply the necessary sanctions, however this is the ideal and as we know there is a lot of corruption everywhere, so it would not surprise me if some slot providers could get away with some cheating and this only stopped once the casinos themselves discovered what was going on.",

I believe it is better that casino's drop these third party slot providers if they suspect irregularities with them before these third party slot providers pull them down and spoil their business name that they have fought so hard to build up to the reputable stage that it is. These casino's understand the importance of a good name in business and the need to protect it. It is the right call dropping them especially to make other 3rd party slot providers sit up and do better.",

I never heard. so why do casinos ask for KYC if curacao never even inspects the casino to see if the casino complies with the rules?there is no way for ordinary people to know if all games are demonstrably fair, that's why I prefer sports betting, it saves me a lot of headache, for me to win I depend on myself when I make a bet, whereas in games where they depend on of luck, in addition to luck, the person must also pray that the game is demonstrably fair. as in games that depend on luck, even if they were not rigged, the person at the end of the day will still lose everything, so it doesn't matter if the game was rigged or not, most people have already put it in their heads that gambling is not they are to make money and they are right. even if the game is the fairest, what will change is just that people won't lose as fast, but at the end of the day they will lose everything anyway",
