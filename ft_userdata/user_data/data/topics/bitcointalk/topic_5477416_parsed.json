A guy claimed he won $5000 on a poker machine and that's where his addiction began, and when it get to the point that he lost his rent money to gambling he decide to take matters in his one way. He proceeded by going to gaming commission and had his name banned by himself, ( Someone please tell me how this is possible?) never seen such in my country before. he claimed he still go back to casinos at times and he knew he can't ever win big again, because his name was flagged in the system, and if he win big they won't pay him. He said he was limited to winning $200, that anymore than this he would have to sign his name and be subject to prosecution for trespassing. He claimed his move took his joy out from gambling real fast, and now he haven't been near a casino in over 10 years. What do you think? This is an insanely move on oneself to stop addiction, something done right? Would you do the same if such is possible in your country?",

This means you will not be able to gamble within their venue, or via their website or app. Gambling companies must offer you the option to self-exclude by law.https://www.begambleaware.org/self-exclusionSo yes, you can do go to the gaming commission and ask yourself to be ban. I know a guy that has been banned, but he didn't do it himself, his wife did. The wife call the casinos and describe his husband and obviously his identification.And then he told me that he was surprised when he go to a casino and that he was stop and was banned from entering. Later he found out that his wife is the one responsible because that time he was really addicted to that point that he is playing money that did not belong to him (he was a government employee that time).",

The problem here is that the money still goes from him to the casino and yet nothing goes from the casino to him. The casino should've outright denied his entry instead of doing something like this. It's like a willy-nilly slapshot of bandages that was done haphazardly. That's just... dumb. Wouldn't it be possible to report that or something?Anw to the topic, yes OP it's possible afaik. Not specifically to gaming commissions though but rather instead to casino directly themselves. May vary from country to country I guess? It's not really an insane move, more like it's pretty common sense to do so if you're able to wake up for a bit. Just that the process itself is kind of iffy for me? As I said, casinos should outright deny the entry instead of something like this.",

A guy claimed he won $5000 on a poker machine and that's where his addiction began, and when it get to the point that he lost his rent money to gambling he decide to take matters in his one way. Every gambling addict has a story similar to this, big win at the beginning before they become entangled in the euphoria of easy money. It is always good we discuss this kind of things in this forum so that people will learn from others mistakes. Gambling is a very profitable business when followed systematically with greed and fear under check.

He is neither a hero nor a fool but somebody taking proactive measures in solving his personal problems. You are not in his shoes so you will not know the extent of damage he might have suffered from his ordeal. Gambling is not for everyone, so since he realised he had to stop gambling, the approach he adopted may just be what he consider most effective. There are a lot of gambling addicts who cannot help themselves unless they adopt this approach.",

But as the story goes on, this person can still get into these casinos and still play but only get a 200 USD win, man can still waste money and not be able to bring back a profit because he can't win big which is stupid, if you're not stopping from gambling even after you did those crazy request from the gaming commission then nothing changed because the money spent is still there and he's still gambling.",

This is simply how I see it because of the fact that he cannot control himself hence the Fool and because he did it to himself to save himself, then he is a hero for himself. That's just how I see it and if that's the only way he can, then it's good he did it to help himself. A weird take on this is he can still play. I mean I would understand if it's online but if it's land based, it's still weird. It's like the ban is not there if he could still play. The Hero turned into a Fool since it's like that lol.",

OP, could you please give us the link to the source of your story so we can visit it ourselves and get some other salient points or parts of the story you failed to mention like what it took him to get his name banned, how he was able to overcome the temptation of creating a new account and even using a friend's documents to register a new account as the addiction spirit possessed him sometime later?. There are various valuable process lessons myself would love to draw from the main story.Anyways, he did what was best for him considering the fact that he was very displeased with his new addiction, and he was that determined to change and straighten his path. Different things work for different people. If he achieved his aim, then it validates the process as the end surely justifies the means.",

You can actually make a case if they will keep on e-mailing you about promotions and events while you already signed up to be excluded from them because of the gambling addiction problem. Well, in the case of your story, it's both good and bad for him. He cannot win big means he should not also be allowed to lose big amounts. And now that he won a huge amount he won't be receiving the full of it. He ain't playing/gambling now because of that reason. IMO, that was a successful way to avoid gambling. He can now just relax and never be stressed about when or how he could gamble. Never mind the $5000, I think deleting the urgency to gamble is a better prize than it. If he receives that amount then he may have not stopped gambling. Right? I think he did the right thing at the end of the day and he will be thankful for it when he remembers what he had done.",

If he had already taken the step of abandoning the game, then it would be more logical not to approach it.

You do not need to go to gaming commission or something like for self-exclusion. You can go for self-exclusion on the gambling site and enable it for certain period of time that you want. Although, what OP explained is similar to self-exclusion. There is nothing like you to pay anything if you have gone for self-exclusion and violet the rules by gambling. Only what would be done is that you will nit be able to access gambling on the site that you enabled self-exclusion and nothing more than that.",

Surprisingly i haven't heard of this happening in my country, I believe it is happening in most of the countries. If it is allowed in my country i believe majority of people have stop gambling so far, I don't think I will stop gambling the way he did, because no matter what happens, if you have ever gambled and then stop for a while, you will eventually miss the time you spent with your friends when you feel like you could be having fun again. I know it's best to stop gambling when one is becoming addicted to it, the most important thing is to do whatever is necessary for you to stop. If it is best for him to do so, it is well good, but i won't do it, there are numerous steps to follow and stop gambling for a while, not to ban my name from it in that way.",

I don't know how can that guy be a hero if he's just into himself but can be said that he's a hero on his own by doing such things.Anyway, let's just have it this way anything that you do for yourself to help you get out of addiction is a good step. Whether it's something crazy like this or even crazier, as long as you're trying hard and helping yourself out then that's the best thing that you're doing because you are initiating things. As they say, if it works then it's not stupid at all, right?What can be other crazy ways of stopping oneself from addiction? I'm thinking of a lot of gamblers who are dealing with addiction and doing odd but effective ways to help themselves. It is a tough battle to fight your own addiction because there's no one there that's going to do it for you and no other people but you alone can do it.",
