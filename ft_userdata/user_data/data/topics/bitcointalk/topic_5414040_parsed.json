  "content": "GOTHIC CROWNSTHE WORLD'S FIRST COMMEMORATIVE COIN MINTED ON A BLOCKCHAINCELEBRATING THE 70-YEAR REIGN OF HER MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH IIWEBSITE LINKNOTE: each user will be entitled ONE claim. so make sure you have stacked all the CROWNS on DAPPNET that you want to exchange 1:1A fully private confidential asset cryptocurrency, built on the Beam Privacy blockchain and offered COMPLETELY FREE to participants of this giveaway, to mark the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and her exceptional work to the Commonwealth during her 70-year reign.Among the most beautiful British coins ever minted by the Royal Mint in the 19th Century, they are exceptionally scarce, ornate and stunning. Since only 8,000 original Gothic Crowns were ever struck in the 19th Century in Great Britain, the Confidential Asset on Beam Privacy;CROWN (ASSET ID 4 on the Beam Blockchain) will only ever have 8000 CROWN minted and will never be sold by the issuer, only given freely as a Confidential Asset on Beam to remember fondly, the reign of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.The Beam Privacy GOTHIC CROWN is the first ever commemorative coin to be minted on a blockchain, and preserves all the aspects of Beam Privacy, making it just as private as any cash transaction with all the exceptional privacy preserving qualities of Beam.The original Gothic Crown coin was issued during the reign of Queen Victoria and on the front side, featured a portrait of Queen Victoria by William Wyon. She had first sat for him in 1834, before she became Queen in 1837. Her first issue of coins in 1838, the year of her coronation, featured an effigy by Wyon that would become known as the ‘Young Head’. This was an elegant and flattering depiction. It pleased Victoria so much that it would remain in use on British and colonial coinage until she was well into her sixties. On the back side of the coin detailed intricate depictions of the four corners of the United Kingdom, with gothic lettering in latin, identical to the 1872 silver Florin which used the same obverse and reverse as the rare Gothic Crown of 1847.To bring that history in-line with the 70-year reign of QEII, the giveaway of all 8000 Gothic Crown on Beam Privacy will commence immediately after the period of mourning for Queen Elizabeth II ends on 20th September 2022. After this time, everyone who has collected Crowns in the Beam Dappnet asset swaps by this date, will receive 1:1 Crown on the Beam main-net – a valuable asset which you will be able to trade within the main-net Beam Wallet in the asset swaps function.The giveaway will last until all 8000 GOTHIC CROWNS are distributed and there is no limit to amount of CROWNS you may claim on Beam main-net.Read below to find out how to get your CROWNS. There will be a partly manual process to this and you will need to contact me directly in my support chat on telegram.HOW TO GET YOUR CROWNS..
