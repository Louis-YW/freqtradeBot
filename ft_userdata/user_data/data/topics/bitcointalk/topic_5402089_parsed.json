Today I noticed Mr. Blue king Send 3 Merits on This Post and another 2 Merits on this post. While Mr. Blue king Only Earned 20 Merits He had only 10 sMerit. He didn't find any other post to merit and he generously distributed 9 merits to his alts (Khanvilla78 got 5) and sent 1 To BitcoinBunny (She must be lucky).So I tried to figure out if there is any connection with those accounts. Mr. Blue king uses a Telegram Named @blueking78 Which can be confirmed from the quoted postQuote from: Blue King on June 06, 2022, 03:27:13 PMTelegram Username: @blueking78and his alts also use a similar Telegram named @blueking7 which can be confirmed from the quoted post.Quote from: Khanvila78 on June 10, 2022, 06:06:49 AMI want to work with you.But what kind of work do you do?Contact: https://t.me/blueking7He also uses another Telegram named @khanvila7Quote from: Khanvila78 on June 07, 2022, 04:32:44 AMTelegram Username: @khanvila7The Common thing he likes 78 and 7Let's Check Other accounts.

But, I guess meriting alts is unethical.",

Never use the same address for multiple accounts. But, recently he decided to rank up. So he started posting on the WO thread and meriting his alts and expecting merits from others too.I don't have a problem if anyone expects merits from others. But, I guess meriting alts is unethical.",

(SOLVED), on 20th May 2022. The post he quoted that allegedly got his naim027 account the ban in the first place was dated 13th May 2022 therefore his naim027 ban took place between 13th May 2022 and 20th May 2022.naim027 created his Hello World || Welcome back again! on 12th October 2022 after being unbanned.As this thread was created on 10th June 2022 by naim027 using his Crypt0S0ul alt-account after his naim027 account received his ban, it means this thread was created by his Crypt0S0ul account after naim027 was banned under his naim027 account.I hope I articulated that correctly ¬†Quote from: The Pharmacist on November 05, 2022, 08:59:53 PMQuote from: JollyGood on November 05, 2022, 01:24:50 PMThe irony here is the title of this thread can easily be applied to the OP: Merit Abuser || Bounty Cheater || Alt farmarI've developed an oddly warped sense of time--wasn't this thread started before naim027 was exposed for ban evasion? ¬†Either way, I agree that it's certainly hypocritical on his part to call out others for those particular offenses. ¬†The nerve of some people, you know?",
