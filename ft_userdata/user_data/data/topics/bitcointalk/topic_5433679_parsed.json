There are good Nigerians out there making Waves and making good name for the country also, earning a good and legit business. In as much as there are Nigerians virtually in almost every part of the world, they are making the country proud. I believe it is the situation of the country that leads to all these bad name calling of Nigeria and Nigerians in diaspora. If the system of government here is favourable and economic growth is in a growing state, I do not see any reason why people would get themselves involved in illegal activities just to make a living but the situation of the country is not the type that one would seat and watch but think of alternative means of survival. That is the situation of things in Nigeria.Â  If the government can not deliver on the the dividends of democracy, the people lacks capital to start up their various businesses what do you expect and I ask who is to be blamed?",

There is no doubt the fact that there is a high rate of unemployment /underemployment in Nigeria and the rate of poverty is high in Nigeria as a result of corruption stealing of government money and poor anti citizens' government policy. - But we should know that we still have some youths who are not legit within Nigeria and their are involved in crimes such as. - Rituals,Â  armed robbery, kidnapping and internet frauds. Â  Â this has been exposed many times just because their Â  Â want to live above their means and the rest of the world has a bad experience about Nigerian scammers. -We also have other Nigerian youths who are legitimately working hard just like me and you. The big answer to this is that. - Day in and day out, 9ja youth are also doing well in other positive things and contributing to global development, this can be seen in various sectors, such as ICT, Software entertainment industry. The Topic of scams should not only be attributed to Nigerian alone but all the other parts of the world, how then do we protect ourselves from scammers and hackers is the big question that we need to provide answers to because, in one way or another, we have all be scammed at one point. -Â  cryptocurrency is an independent financial tool, at the same time scammers can use it to be untraceable",
