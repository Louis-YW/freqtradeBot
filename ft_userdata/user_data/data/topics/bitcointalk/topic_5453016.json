  "content": "This is an Update To My earlier warning post about this project \"Strech to Earn\" being a possible scam, link to the previous post is https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5451476.msg62208177#msg62208177The Token was listed on Mexc and was Dumped the Same day. There still exist some people in the telegram group that is still hoping for this token will pump so they can recover their money but too bad.The token was listed on Mexc but was quickly delisted when things went south, the chart is visible now only through the poocoin app: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5451476.msg62208177#msg62208177And is now only available on pancake swap. The core of the team that scammed people has left the Telegram group with few admins left to give some ridiculous responses such as \"Because of the excess number of applications being sent your KYC processing will be from 3-7 days\" etc. and a whole lot of washed postings in the group.I mean if you bought @ $0.01 and the token is now worth $0.0009. pretty Much You've Been Scammed. Likely they will start another Scam with d aid of Bounty hunters whom they will not pay.Thank you, for your Time.",

It's not how to report a scam works here, Â you better lock this thread and just update the old thread, no need to create a thread for confirmation.",

      "body": "Thanks for the update warning.There are hundreds of these tokens out there on centralized exchanges and people are falling victim to it, this is not the first and it won't be the last anyway.For the Mexc exchange it is a good exchange but in the end they care about taking the money in order to include the token in the exchange and they don't care what happens after that, what is the point of deleting the token after people have been scammed. They will simply tell you \"WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE AND YOU SHOULD DYOR\".",
