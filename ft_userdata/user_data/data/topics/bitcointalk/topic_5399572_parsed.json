There are numerous Move-To-Earn applications and they all work a little differently, but most of them require users to earn move-to-earn cryptocurrency through in-game activities such as completing workouts, walking, or winning races. Which of them do you use? Which ones do you think are the most profitable? And, what is the average revenue generated by these types of apps?",

It can be said to incentivize users for the apps, especially I see this have some potency to be integrated with an established fitness app.Nevertheless, there is a few concern about this kind of app, including invasive tracking and an anti-cheat mechanism. Some people that I know never use any fitness app due to privacy concerns, if those M2E projects are able to provide transparency about the user data they needed to use, yet also have a strong anti-cheat mechanism to prevent bad users, I believe we will see the idea is thriving.",

I also noticed few projects that are m2e and based on my observation most of them are truly gaining attention and some people are so involved in it. And yes maybe it can be the next big thing and there is a possibility that it might last because it is an amazing crypto concept. And I believe more and more projects would be created with a m2e usecase and also most of them would be scams. So be very careful at the same time.",

The fitness industry is a multi million dollars industry and at that any play to earn project that is the native token as a utility token will easily survive the market in the long run, so it's better not to look at the hype but look closely at the tokenization of the fitness industry with a reward system.",

More to come in the future.Like I said, new projects will be hyped and will fade, and that will be the same with Fitness-based projects that are emerging right now and TBH, I don't see it as a sustainable project. Correct me, but just by seeing the project, you can already see that it is almost the same as Play-to-Earn and the only difference is the way you get tokens. In Play-to-Earn, you will play in order to get tokens while in this, you will get tokens by moving or in this case exercising. Well, there might be a twist in some projects but to answer that question, it will last for a short amount of time only.",

It might last longer since tokens may be harder to earn due to it being related to fitness, but all the same, it'd probably die out if the economic problem isn't resolved. Not to mention that once known, hype people would probably kill the projects that use the m2e model (if they can, I'm not sure about the \"can\" part tbh). The idea may survive longer though if global sports companies integrate it for their promos and the like, kind of unlikely though.",

Did you still see axie infinity? even when the price was dumping so hard and ROI became even longer than before but the players are still very enthusiast to grinding SLP to be sold in the market. This caused by they can use their free time to play to game and this is pretty similar with the move to earn. As long as people keep walking, running and this will make the hype will sustain for long term.

So it is really not a big surprise that there are now a lot of new fitness or move to earn projects appearing after the big success that STEPN had. People see this kind of success and also want to achieve that. The sad thing is that a lot of people want to achieve that by creating a cheap copy of, in this case STEPN, in order to hop on the move to earn hype train with as little effort as possible. The truth is also though that almost all of those copycat projects are failing and 99% of them will be dead again withing a few weeks or months.I have not looked into the project that you are advertising for OP but i guess it is also just a copy of STEPN.",
