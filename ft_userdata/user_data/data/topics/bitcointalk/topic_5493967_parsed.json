From the start i believe it was a terrible idea for El Salvador to launch their own wallet, they should let people to use any wallet software they want, is a stupid idea to do a KYC process for a wallet, that goes against bitcoin nature.",

I don't think that they hate the government too, it's bitcoin ecosystem of El Salvador that they've attacked, if they really hated the government, they would've done something much worse like hacking their financial infrastructures, leaking the data of their government employees, messing with the power grid or the traffic system of the country. Nonetheless, it's still a sad thing that they've been had on this one, it's going to create rifts in trusting the current administration about the bitcoin adoption there if this thing can lead to people losing their bitcoins.",

Blame it on the developers of the software behind Chivo. The hackers are always everywhere looking for their next victim. It can be hackers from China, Russia, North Korea, America, Germany, Australia, everywhere! If there is a weakness, it will be attacked. We can very much be certain of this. What we should learn from this is it confirms our argument that KYC does not make it more safer for the users, this is making it more dangerous.",

Well, that's not new, bad actors exist all over the world. What really shocked me is this group of hackers has been hacking a lot of data from El Salvador, I mean I just checked the threads they had made on Breachforum.All of them are providing us the data on El-Salvador Citizens. It really indicates that a group of people is interested in them or is from them. Means he must be from the system (government) or maybe he is the enemy of the El-Salvador Govenrment.

These hackers specifically mentioned the government and didn't want any ransom. the $30 incentive thing bottlenecked and broke due to el salv being conned by a LN 'adviser' telling them to use LN instead of bitcoin as a backbone of chivo in 2021LN had bottlenecks and caused alot of users to be unable to claim their $30 due to liquidity issues of LN. within 3 months el salv closed it and replaced the backbone with a CEX(alphapoint) as the accounting and withdrawal system(custodian) of chivo value/transfers. majority of people just gave up after the first phase and didnt use chivo again. even under alphapoint CEX custodian services.not all el salv citizens even used chivo in initial LN phase and not everyone signed up to alphapoint in second phase. so the \"over 5 million\" is an exaggeration. the database the script kiddies ARE SELLING is a con in-of-itself.. (scammers selling to scammers)as for the 'hackergroup'(script kiddies) giving ATM files for free.. thats because its public info, anyone can find the ATM masterdocs, the ATM manufacturer is not even el salvadorian.. the manufacturer sells ATM's and maintenance guides/access to files to franchises like its candyyou dont need to hack a government to get the files. and there was no government hack to get them..these files are just a phase two promotion by skill-less script kiddies, hoping of proving they are hackers.. but they failedthere initial phase of the database of citizens is their hope of a money maker. hoping scammers would buy the database.. which the script kiddies didnt get much custom so doubled down pretending to be hackers of the ATM files as hope of proof of being legit hackers.. and as i said failed to prove anything",

I mean, leaking stuff about public figures or events that are of great public interest is something I can understand, but here we're talking about leaking the whole database of users of El Salvador's state wallet (which happens to be almost all the country's population).It does show the risks of custodial wallets, though, which can be a good talking point for advocates of self-custody. I'm sorry for those whose info got leaked.For the fun of it of course and not to mention that if you put the lives of people that aren't part of this attack, you would have it easier to ask for your demands because believe it or not, the government cares about the well-being of their people also, it's more fun for them and makes them more powerful when they do this kind of thing to those innocent people and you never know what you're going to hit when you hack indiscriminately. There's also the fact that hackers sell these data to people that will use it for malicious stuff and the more data you've got on a lot of people, the more handsome the payment is going to be for you as a hacker.",
