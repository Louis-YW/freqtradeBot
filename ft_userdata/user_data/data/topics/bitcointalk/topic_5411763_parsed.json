I wonder how many lawsuits will be flying after this one.'My Son Hunter' Trailer Hits 3.5 Million Cross-Platform Views After Truth Social DebutQuote from: https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2022/08/29/my-son-hunter-trailer-hits-3-5-million-cross-platform-views-after-truth-social-debut/The full theatrical trailer for the highly anticipated feature film My Son Hunter has spread like wildfire online after its official debut on Truth Social last week, racking up more than 3.5 million cross-platform views. The trailer debut was followed by an all-star panel discussion hosted by Truth Social CEO and former California congressman Devin Nunes, who hoped his platform’s success in pushing John Rich’s hit song “Progress” to the top of the charts could be replicated with the promotion of My Son Hunter.    BREAKING: The full trailer of \"My Son Hunter\" was released exclusively on Truth Social tonight.    Pre-Order the Hunter Biden Movie now and reserve your copy: https://t.co/R2OKYZltx6 pic.twitter.com/A1Xo1Xz9Mi    — My Son Hunter | The Hunter Biden Movie (@MySonHunter) August 26, 2022The Nunes-hosted panel discussion on Truth Social included Donald Trump Jr.; My Son Hunter director Robert Davi (Licensed to Kill, Die Hard, The Goonies); Government Accountability Institute President, Breitbart Senior Contributor, and bestselling author of Red Handed: How American Elites Get Rich Helping China Win Peter Schweizer; and Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow.As Nunes and Donald Trump Jr. noted during the panel, one of the objectives of Truth  Social is to provide a platform for artists and individuals facing woke cancellation. The overwhelming success of John Rich’s song “Progress” provided a perfect example of the Truth Social mission in action.As Breitbart News reported:    Rich’s anti-woke anthem was shunned by record labels and destined for oblivion until Truth Social—under Nunes’ leadership—decided to promote the song.    The response was an overwhelming success that shocked the music world. Thanks to Truth Social’s promotion, Rich’s “Progress” rocketed to the #1 spot on iTunes, becoming a global #1 single for multiple days, eclipsing other artists like Lizzo, Billie Eilish, Kate Bush, and Beyonce, and then landing on Billboard’s Hot 100 list and hitting #1 on Billboard’s digital song sales list.    All of this happened despite the attempts to cancel the song. As Rich explained in an interview with Just the News, “Here I am with no record label, no publisher, no marketing deal.”    “I just got a song that speaks to a lot of people, and Truth and Rumble pushed it out there,” Rich said. “And man, I’m really proud of what we did today.”Watch the panel:...My Son Hunter Full Trailer | MySonHunter.comhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCvb6TfBXFk&feature=emb_imp_woyt",
