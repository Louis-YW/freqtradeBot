That's why we must have basic knowledge about trading first before really entering the real world of trading. How can we control our emotions if we have no knowledge of what we are doing. If we have a friend who has the same activity, it is better to learn from them. Because with the experiences they have that are shared with us, it will be very helpful.",

Many started cheering after seeing the profit in the first place. Later on that joy they again started trading on the trading platform. When they start trading based on emotions without analyzing the market, if the market is dumping due to any reason, they incur huge losses. They get very worried and sell their trading at a loss. Then when the market starts to rise again, they start trading there again, only to find that they suffer huge losses. So I mean one should never trade on a trading platform with passion. Trade wisely using the trading platform strategy will bring you success.",

Even though he can buy at a low price, he doesn't have any more bitcoins and has to repeat everything from the beginning. The goal of investing in bitcoin is to collect as many bitcoins as possible so that if the bitcoin price goes down, it would be a good moment to buy more bitcoins.But I think we must control our emotions in trading to analyze, monitor, and do something related to the market. And this self-control process requires time and patience so we cannot achieve it in a short time. But this will really help those of you who want to trade without emotion because emotions are your enemy in analyzing the market.",

I mean, everyone knows in theory that one should trade away from emotions such as fear, greed, and Hurry, but in practice it is very difficult to control these emotions completely.Many people, when you sit in front of the indicator and see the coin starting to decline, do not control their fear of loss, so they sell immediately and then regret it. The same thing is also in the case of greed when they see a pump, for example, they Hurry and buys, then regrets it.Market making depends mainly on the manipulation of emotions, so the best thing for those who do not have control over their emotions is to give specific orders and then stay away from watching the screen all the time.",
