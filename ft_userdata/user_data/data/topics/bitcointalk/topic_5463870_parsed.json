Ever since Cyberconnect came to Binance, many fake airdrop websites have been created using this project name and continue to do so. They have created this Twitter account in such a way that no one will recognize a fake account after first viewing, but when someone reads their tweets, it will be easy to understand that they are trying to scam with tempting offers. So crypto users should use their wits and be careful not to fall into this easy trap and give access to the wallet to scammers.QuoteDomain Name: cyber-rewards.orgRegistry Domain ID: d5cf4a83eb774b4686531e2706720c3f-LRORRegistrar WHOIS Server: https://www.nic.ru/whoisRegistrar URL: https://www.nic.ru/whoisUpdated Date: 2023-08-17T19:33:45ZCreation Date: 2023-08-17T19:10:34ZRegistry Expiry Date: 2024-08-17T19:10:34ZRegistrar: Regional Network Information Center, JSC dba RU-CENTERRegistrar IANA ID: 463Registrar Abuse Contact Email: email@nic.ruRegistrar Abuse Contact Phone: +7.4959944601",
