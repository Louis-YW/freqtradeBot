Did you also start investing in bitcoin because of some celebrity ? Or you know people who belong to that category ? Is it a wise decision to do so or we should do our own research for better results ? I started to invest in BTC because of this forum and the wise words of the members of this forum. If we go in details like how? When I got accepted in signature Compaign, I started to accumulate BTC I use some of it for my expensive the remaining ones are keep piling and at the end I was left with my savings in BTC. So these savings in BTC started to gain value, as my average buying is around $28k. Speaking of why I kept accumulating till now, that's because a lot of people shared techniques to control your emotions, I learned them the hard way by losing some, at least in the long run I can to some extent control my emotions now. We should definitely follow influencers who are experts in the field, and we should not follow those celebrities who are actors, have no knowledge and we are just doing what they are doing with no understanding make us vulnerable to lose money.",

No, celebrities might have influence Bitcoin to be mainstream, but I doubt that is the main reason why some of us are in this market. And if I'm not mistaken, this celebrities just went out around 2017, whereas there could be members here who have been in this community prior to that. I don't understand what you mean by better results, Bitcoin has been the prime mover of crypto and so it's the first crypto that everyone will invest and it involved itself from payment system by Satoshi to a investment, as an assets or hedge. And for those who haven't seen the roast of Tom Brady, it's even mentioned by someone.",

I didn't get influenced by any person into investing into bitcoin, friend's found it, we all got curious about bitcoin and did our research, found it to be a viable way to make money while we're still in school. It was an awesome experience to be learning more about bitcoin. To the people that are still following celebrities and their tips in life, just so you know that the difference of how they live and how we live is like heaven and earth, it can't be the same so stop following them and what they do and learn to live for yourself and your loved ones.",

Is it a wise decision to do so or we should do our own research for better results ? Celebrities hardly advertise Bitcoin so I doubt if much people heard about Bitcoin from them. Who will pay them for such advertisement? Besides, Bitcoin does not need any advertisement... I think this has been a topic of debate in many platforms I have joined and I really think there are some merits in it. Instead of Bitcoin, what I have noticed celebrity advertise are altcoins, NFT and other projects that mimics Bitcoin. Founders of these projects made special budget for marketing and that is how the celebrities get paid. There are actually few early adopters of Bitcoin that couldn't resist the urge to flaunt their wealth in social media, they have huge followers but they are extremely few and most of them I know have even gone ahead to create some other coins and platforms in which they advertise using their big stash of Bitcoin as bait to attract people to them. Instead of people investing in Bitcoin because of them, people end up investing in their new creation with the hope that it will perform like Bitcoin.",

Celebrities promote many things in exchange for money which we call influence. they create video content only to show people with no guarantee that they will engage in it. So of course it is important to do your research before investing money in anything. But I am always encouraged to invest in Bitcoin. but I don't invest in influencers when they promote them for anything else. and Bitcoin has no regulatory body so I don't think the influencers get paid to promote Bitcoin. so I will definitely invest in Bitcoin",

I decided to invest because bitcoin is worth investing in especially to people like us in this forum, because the forum is a big opportunity for us to invest in bitcoin since we talk about it always and you are given the opportunity to also earn bitcoin here.",

I am glad that I got into Bitcoin without seeing any signs, it was a decision I made myself, and for myself only, I understood the risks and since the government was always troublesome for me I felt the need to become a Bitcoinist. There are some influencers online who may have influenced a lot of investors into Bitcoin, let's not forget that some people only take actions when they are been told so, only very few numbers of people want to be different and take actions without anyone's opinion. I have seen some influencer's videos on YouTube, and most times these influencers are doing this for money too, that is why it is hard to see crypto influencers talking about Bitcoin only, they always bring in other altcoins too as form of promotion to get paid, they advertise for new crypto exchanges and all that, Bitcoin is just a part but their main goal is making money.",

Although you will be lucky if a celebrity influences you to invest in bitcoins, it is not still good that you get influenced to invest without your own research.

The development of the digital world, including social media, means celebrities have the power to influence their fans through posts on social media, but I consider myself lucky because I have never been influenced by what they convey through posts on their social media accounts regarding anything, including Bitcoin, and it seems like I already knew about Bitcoin long before these celebrities were interested in Bitcoin but actually crypto, and I found out about Bitcoin from a local forum how he through the forum and also his personal blog taught how to get Bitcoin for free because at that time it was quite easy to get it, and I was lucky to learn about Bitcoin from someone who didn't take advantage of the knowledge he had.And to be honest I think celebrities only convey what can benefit them so that's not a wise thing and we should do in-depth research for whatever they try to convince us because of the risks we will face",

I don't care in what form you know about bitcoin, because bitcoin has become so popular that it is not difficult to see it today. As long as you use the internet, social networks, it is not difficult for you to see it. But I want to tell you that before you want to invest in any property, any business. You should research everything yourself before making a decision for yourself instead of relying on the advice of others. Although bitcoin is a good investment, it will also cause you to lose miserably if you do not have knowledge and invest blindly. A good asset is not enough to make you rich or successful, you need knowledge and experience and to get those things, you need to learn and research yourself.",
