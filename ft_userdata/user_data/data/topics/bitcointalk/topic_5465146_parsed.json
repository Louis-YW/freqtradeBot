DM me with what you haveUSA buyerPrefer meet in person, or escrow if needed. I’ve got one in excellent condition. The question is always how much are you willing to pay. At least a ballpark figure might be helpful for others who own one of these. I’m sure everyone would like to buy or sell at some price, so having an idea of what yours is will certainly assist in making a deal come to fruition.",

Thank you for all the generous tips on escrow with minerjones. I'm well aware of the process. I am NOT a newbie to physical CAS coins as I am an avid collector of these.",
