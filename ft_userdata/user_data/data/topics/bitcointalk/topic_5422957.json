But If you do not know much about cold storage and also need an easier alternative, use a hardware wallet. Open source hardware wallet.For small amount, you can use Electrum. Quote from: Cruxleo on November 24, 2022, 09:39:34 AM2. Is there an alternative to centralized exchange?There are decentralized exchanges. You can try https://bisq.network/, but you strickly need a computer for it. Going for a mobile option, but not as decentralized as Bisq, you can check this site:https://kycnot.me/Note that the exchanges listed are no KYC exchanges, you can read the review on the site to know how perfectly decentralized or centralized they are. Kucoin for example is centralized while Bisq is decentralized.Quote from: jackg on November 24, 2022, 09:47:20 AM2. There are decentralised exchanges and peer to peer ones.

I would appreciate suggestions that are less technical as I'm not grounded in tech. I would suggest you at least be more attentive, not necessarily technical as it you can read the code or something. But understand how everything works specially in a wallet, like private keys and mnemonic phrase and how you are going to protect it. Might come in handy as you go along with your bitcoin journey.",

No matter how much this life lesson costs you, I hope you learn not to trust spoiled rich people no matter what fairy tales they tell.Quote from: Cruxleo on November 24, 2022, 09:39:34 AMThough I had passively heard little on such risk but it has never been detailed and explanatory.

Not to think of a total collapse of such might.Such things are always written in very fine print and no one reads them, and because of this, all those who make such scams can mostly get away with the help of an army of lawyers. I don't wonder at all if something like that will happen again, it's just a question of who is next - and I would say that these are the ones who are the loudest in terms of bragging that they are the best, but in fact they are one step away from everything collapses like a house of cards.",

Since FX has taught lot's of people lesson, I will always advice buy with centralize exchange that's at your reach, after that move your funds into a safe wallet which you have 100% control over it. Lots of cold and hardware wallets have already been suggested above, just pick one that you can afford and move your funds from Cex to personal wallet, it's safer their.",

To maintain bitcoin security much better is to use a hardware wallet it will be more secure than anything I use Nano Ledger X to store Bitcoin assets. Or you can use Electrum, Trustwallet, Coinomi, Exodus which is important to have a private key that we can control ourselves.Namely decentralized exchanges as an alternative maybe you can try some of the decentralized exchanges mentioned, but I myself still use centralized exchanges but I never keep them there too long just simply trade or convert and then withdraw them.",

I want to know the difference between the two as it's not well elaborated therein.Without any doubt, without going too much into technical details, choose a SegWit address - let's say that you will be able to save on fees for all future outgoing transactions. If you ever need a legacy address for some reason, you will simply create a new wallet within Electrum and name it Legacy wallet. Read more in this thread -> Legacy vs segwit",

The exchange can also turn on you and seize your money, or report you to the government and blockchain analysis companies, it is unsafe to use centralized exchanges in many ways.",

I want to know the difference between the two as it's not well elaborated therein.STOP!Electrum no longer shows you the option to create legacy wallets, and hasn't for over 18 months. While you may simply have downloaded an old version by mistake, you may also have downloaded a malicious version which is waiting to steal your coins. The current version is 4.3.2. You should download it from this link and only this link: https://electrum.org/#download. Ideally, you should also verify your download by following the instructions on that page.Electrum remains one of the best choices of wallets to use, but you must make sure you are using it safely before you send any coins to it. I would also suggest that after creating a new wallet and backing up its seed phrase (after you are sure you are using a legitimate version of Electrum), you practice restoring from your seed phrase back up before funding the wallet.",
