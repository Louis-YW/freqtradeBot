  "content": "It is very common today to hear sad news from people about how they lose their funds but I am so sure that all the victims somehow made a mistake or do something very stupid that compromised the security of their funds. Some people say that they are hacked and when they explain how the whole thing went you will found out that it's not a real hack but their own mistakes, it's either •They fell for a phishing scam •Clicked on bad malicious links •Signed some weird transaction that leaks your private keyThe only thing that scammers are praying for is your mistake, they are hoping that you do something very stupid and dumb so that they can take advantage of your mistake. My advice is don't do things that goes against the simple security measures of every crypto wallet, either crypto hardware wallet, PC crypto wallet or mobile crypto wallets, do not do the dumb things.  Example of mistakes and dumb things you can avoid  1. Don't give out your seed phrase and keys, no one should ever ask you for your seed phrase, if they do just block them instantly, if it's a website get out immediately.2. Do not click on random links from DMs or download any files from DMs especially on telegram, discord and Twitter, also stop downloading torrent files they have malware most times. 3. Don't keep your crypto on an exchange, even if you are a daily trader you won't see any danger coming so always take out your profit and leave behind that little amount for trading, use 2FA authentication on your wallets and exchnages.4. Do not use same password you are using on other websites on your exchange platforms, it is dumb, this days hackers get password hack easily. 5. Look into the wallet address you are sending coins to very well, avoid sending them to wrong addresses, nowadays hackers are used to keylogger attacks, the address you copied might change if your PC is infected.",

Dumb things sometimes can happen due to careless approach to such incidents. Many users are fond of free airdrop or free money and they will give or try any process for it to work regardless whether there will be some consequence or even private info that will set them into a more dangerous situation. Avoid being like that and dont focus on free money online. Think that no one will give it for free instead.",

The last sentence sounds very illogical.How can people not do something that goes against all the rules if these are the people who do not know the rules themselves? Someone hurt themselves on purpose, knowing that something is wrong?OP, if you want to prevent people from making mistakes, it would be helpful to make a complete guide on why and what not to do, etc.Although such topics are posted here daily, they will have value not in general rules like \"I warned you,\" but in the correct and accessible explanation of all the little things.",

Mistakes are not only made from dumb and stupid moves, but also from moves that you think are the smart ones to make, that is why we should always be cautious as OP says.",

Imagine if the day trader made withdrawals every day. External danger is only a possibility, but exchange picking up user wealth by degrees is a certainty (because of your tip).",

IMO, the fact is that some people will always fall victim to these scammers. I was not aware of the clipboard virus that Nwada001 mentioned, until I came across the thread \"Clipboard Virus,\" and then I realized that someone can copy his wallet address, which can automatically changes to a different address, so if the user is not smart enough to cross-check the wallet before sending out his or her crypto, vualah!, funds will be lost to a bug wallet.While some are lucky that they had a handy teacher to put them through every step they needed to sail along the crypto space 🚀, we who learned on our own by just reading stuffs and watching videos made a few mistakes. OP, your thread is yet another reminder and warning for some crypto newbies.",

In addition to your examples stated @OP, - it is always better to log out of an exchange or app after using it.- avoid saving passwords on your browser after logging in to an account.- when too tired or stressed out, avoid performing transactions that require careful navigation, especially as regards to exchanges and during P2p or funding crypto wallets/accounts.",

If they miss out of this and give their security key out, then they’ll need a more proper orientation and enlightenment about the whole cryptocurrency market.Quote3.

Although most exchanges have available 2FA verification before accessing them, but that is not a sure gateway that they’ll be no any form of attack to the exchange and your funds. The case of FTX should have thought a lesson by now not to leave all your funds in an exchange.",
