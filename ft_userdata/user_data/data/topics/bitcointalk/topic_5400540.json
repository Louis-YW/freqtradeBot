Now days even videos. Even more than missing out on the price. I miss being in crypto earlier because it was so easy back then to just buy crypto anonymously.",

If you live in an area where there are Bitcoin ATM's, then it is a good way to buy bitcoin anonymously with cash, you can also try out other peer to peer options like Paxful, HodlHodl, Bisq were you do not have to provide KYC or identification to exchange your bitcoin.Quote from: Anonohmon on May 28, 2022, 06:10:18 PMEven more than missing out on the price. I miss being in crypto earlier because it was so easy back then to just buy crypto anonymously. Are you so sure about that, buying bitcoin has never been completely anonymous, except through peer to peer decentralized options, or if you want to buy from a friend, you send cash in exchange for bitcoin or the other way round, centralized exchanges have done their business in this way, you either comply or not use them.",

In other words if there is a company behind an exchange then it can never be decentralized like the case with Binance and the joke they created called their DEX! Any other ones that don't require KYC or don't enforce it are no different, they can decide to change that rule at any moment and mandate it for everyone.",

Takes a little bit of getting used it, but it is easily the best way to buy and sell bitcoin at the moment without having centralized third parties spying on you and exercising complete control over your money.Quote from: Anonohmon on May 28, 2022, 06:32:37 PMwhat would happen if an exchange opened in a super crypto friendly nation decided to ignore the US demanding it have KYC?Then they would very quickly be banned from operating within the US or serving US citizens.",

That way you can buy BTC at some crypto ATM, although there will certainly be a limit for unverified users, or at physical crypto exchanges that also do not require KYC up to a certain amount. Such exchange offices exist in at least one EU country (for now), and the amounts you can buy/sell are from 1000 EUR up to 2000 EUR per transaction. However, this is a specific case and you cannot do it online. Try using DEX or find someone in your local community who wants to sell BTC for cash, and stop fooling yourself that Bitcoin should be something anonymous because it never really was.",
