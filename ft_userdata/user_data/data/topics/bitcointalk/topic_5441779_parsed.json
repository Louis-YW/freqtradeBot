Which relies heavily upon compounding interest. The catch is, like most investment strategies it performs best under bull market conditions when averages are rising. The opposite of our current bear market. Image link:  https://i.imgur.com/kgzTlED.jpgThe chart he displays @ timestamp 13:37 (above image) illustrates the long term earning potential of long term compounding interest with dividend stocks.In previous years of low inflation and economic stability, many americans were able to leverage this type of long term compounding interest to retire early. Unfortunately things are much harder now.",

      "body": "I like your conclusion on this topic, people should not use a certain stock/shares to judge what a dividend would be in the long run. A lot can change, and as you have rightly concluded, those that had almost-certain plans about some shares and their dividends on it are changing it now because there are many factors to consider which are beyond the companies themselves. The old/present performance of any company can't be the indication of future performance, so everyone holding a share is taking a risk, with no guaranteed dividend whatsoever.",

That's why my monthly investments are divided between crypto, stocks, mutual funds, Paper gold and insurance payments. So when one sector goes down, the other sectors can support my investment. There is a trick to pick up good dividend paying stocks. From the exchange data, see the companies where they have stakes from government. Government invests in companies for dividend income. So when you will see investment from government, go ahead and buy them. Dividends will be guaranteed!",

High interest stifles innovation and makes capital cowardly. Instead of investing in development, agricultural or economic projects, you freeze your money and aspire Others default on payments, and thus you earn more, but you will reach a stage where individuals are unable to pay, and the economy will stop.So increasing it is not a good thing.",

But you have to pay tax from 7% profit anyway  XD2- high dividend stocks are not always good. NOBL (most popular ETF with SP500 dividend aristocrats) pay 1.9% in dividend. If some stocks can pay 7%, 10%, most often there is a reason why investors avoid it. It may be irregular payments or the current high dividend is caused, for example, by a temporary increase in the price of raw materials. It will come back down together with company profits. Perhaps the company is located in a country threatened by its neighbors. Meybe there is a corruption and high crime in the country. Maybe the new tax rules that insiders know about will drive margins down in the future. Maybe there is a thriving competition in the area, quite by chance related to the government of the country. We don't know it but mostly there is a reason for too high apy.3- there are many examples of companies paying dividends and not making profits. these companies go into debt to keep their payments going (to become a dividend aristocrat or stay in this group). If it doesn't work out well, you can invest a future bankrupt. 4- too high dividend in relation to profits may indicate that the company has nothing to invest in. Which may lead to a collapse of profits in the future and an outflow of capital (decrease in the price) and a real loss. (and you will pay tax on each dividend anyway )So be carrefour. 2% dividend on good stock is better than 7% on future bankrupt but both will give you a real loss when inflation is at 10%. So now the game is to keep the purchasing power of your money for as long as possible, not to \"retire early\".",

On the other hand, there are some who are doing a thorough research on this dividend-paying stocks that even though they are giving lower dividends, they surely are a better company. Warren Buffett is one of the reason why I switched to dividend investing, and I've already set my goal this year with regards to dividend investing particularly into stocks.It's just amazing how he is earning 56% of his total investment in Coca-cola annually, and that's only from one stock. He owns some other stocks that are paying dividends to him as well. It's kind of ironic though that he is invested heavily to some dividend-paying stocks, but his company Berkshire Hathaway aren't giving dividends to their shareholders.

Well, that 13% annually is already a huge one knowing that they are paying the shareholders either monthly or quarterly. If you really want a continuous cash flow on a yearly basis, REIT's is a way to go since the company will always pay the stock holders.",
