With topics created out of curiosity or for information purpose or for directional purpose, as long as it is discussed or inputs in form of comments are made I learn. Same goes for all.One reason why I made this post is just to appreciate the beauty of heirachy in this forum as the topic implies.  Those who have ranked up in their time here and have taken out time to inform those of us just joining with the information we need are the real VIPs.I just love it when I see legendary or hero members or senior members or other high ranking members make great insightful comments that helps really. Everyone would agree it is quite hard to even know the right questions to ask these days with current market trends in crypto world, fiat world, and with all the development and innovation taking up space and filling the web everyday.Thanks to the innovation of the ranking system and the brains behind it. More power to the elbows of all top members for your contribution in the form of comments or post or guidance.",

High rank does not actually mean what all those on the high rank said is the best, which is absolutely correct, just as Un_rank has said there are a lot of newbies and even junior members in this forum who are very contributing in their ways.Indeed, there is always no limit to which one can say they have learned enough. The more things I come across here in the forum, the more I try to contribute, the more correction I get from other experienced users, and the more I add to the little that I have acquired before. It's just a way of life; the more you continue living, the more you will continue learning. What matters is what you are going to do with the knowledge you have acquired. Will you share it with the people here in the forum and outside who need it, or will you just choose to keep it to yourself?",

More power to the elbows of all top members for your contribution in the form of comments or posts or guidance. Agreed. Dear op, you really point out the same thing, that was in my mind. And you mentioned all the ranks who have contributed to this platform and make this forum a hierarchy of Bitcoin. As tbh, at the start i was only involved in bounties and wasted my time (well not all time), so after participating in the threads i find it more interesting and fun. As i have learned a lot of things about this forum and BTC.Like, after around 1 year, i came to know that Satoshi Nakamoto was also on this forum and he was the main founder of this forum which i don't know before. So I just got more interested in it and tried to learn more because I knew everything on it will be generic and unique. After all, moderators are so active to remove and manage everything here. Overall, i have recommended many of my friends to join this forum who were insisting me to teach them BTC and blockchain technology. I told them i am no expert but you will learn a lot from there if they really want to. And in last, you mentioned the rank system, from what I have observed, most of the legendary members rarely make big threads but they are damn helping to both (community and to this forum) with tools and development. But most of the lower rank members like Junior and full, senior contribute more to this platform with content",

The forum rank was indeed one of the best initiative ever implemented, as that tell the difference between an old experience member and a newbie in need of help. And secondly, that was implemented so as to differentiate between quality posters who add value to the forum and spammers who only come here to partake in bounty offers. But however, ranking up on the forum has never been that easy, as it takes time, dedication and hard work for one to attain such height, which possibly anyone can achieve same result with the right motivation.",

Newbies and other low-ranked members can contribute to threads without discrimination. Low-ranking members also receive the same recommendation and rewards as high-ranking members if their contributions are exceptional. But this will not push aside the fact that most high-ranking members are more knowledgeable.
