There's also a number of leagues with one being called SFC (slap fighting championship) and they have a women's division too.Draft Kings, which is an online betting site that was supposed to start accepting bitcoin last year, but probably postponed this due to bear market, allows you to bet on slap contests. It's actually fun to watch, especially when there's a large weight and size difference between contestants.",

I guess Dana will also hype a champ for this league.Once we know it's easy to bet on matches but are bookmakers going to add them? I certainly would watch this power slap.",

There is no reason to put a league if the money movement gambling in that sector is really small.So, can \"Power Slap\" get a sport on bookmakers? the answer yes but they need to bring a lot money into gambling industry otherwise bookmarked are not really interested at all.",

Most of the competitors that will join this competition would surely be in for just a few fights and afterwards, they might think that the damage that they're receiving is not worth the prize money. That brutal knockout that happened just a few days ago shows how brutal and unsafe this sport can be, and it seems Dana White doesn't care that much about the safety of its competitors but more about the revenue they can generate off of the viewership they gain from the sport. Hopefully they reinvent the rules of the sport, but there clearly is no 'safety' on the side of the fighters here really, because you receive a direct blow to the face with bare hands of your opponents.",

The first day I watched one of the matches, I laughed out loud and began asking myself why peeps be getting weird slaps all in the name of sporting? ...I remember their participants getting slapped until he wasn't able to get his ass up...lmao It's a game of utmost strength and I'm always wondering how they go bout Thier trainings.Edit: bookmakers ain't in a hurry to get a contract deal with them, they only need a little more stability and fame ( cus nobody bets on games he's not conversant with)Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

Pretty sure a lot of people have heard since then of this sport and has made renditions of it. But they got nothing on the OG. So far however, this Slap League Dana White's holding up seems to be up to par with how professional the Russian ones go, complete with bodyguards and enclosed within the Octagon.

I don't know if the participants are allowed to use some drugs to reduce the pains or impact of the slap during the slapping match. I have watched few fights and saw how well-built participants are knockout by some superpower slaps that sounded like a loud clap. Just like boxing and other extreme sports, power slappers need to be well paid. Underpaying these sportsmen would make the slapping league unattractive. I have never seen or heard about bets on the Power Slap League, maybe because it a relatively new competition. In few years such gambling section might become popular.",

Personally i think it's going to bring much more attention.I found this news article to clarify things about safety measurements taken before every fight\"Power Slap president¬†Frank Lamicella¬†points out that before each bout, the strikers undergo a battery of tests‚Äîphysical exams, MRIs, performance-enhancing drug screening‚Äîto ensure that they are fit to compete. Multiple physicians and first responders and ambulances are on-site at fights.\"Source: time.com",

The production will serve to pick out the main exponents of the modality and assemble the company's inaugural rankings.I don't like boxing, mma or similar, I find it too \"brutal\", but I confess that this new competition is intriguing me because \"it's just a few slaps in the face\", they are not capable of causing permanent sequels to competitors. I will follow the competition more closely, I believe that soon there will also be bookmakers for this new sport, and I will probably place some bets.",
