Not only during the bull run but during bear run Bitcoin should be the first investment for the one who are into crypto-market. Bitcoin is well-known for its steady growth and has been in the crypto-world for much longer than any other crypto-currency. I would always recommend everyone to buy Bitcoin now because in the coming bull run profits are assured if someone invests in Bitcoin. I predicted that Bitcoin may reach $50k before 2024 and still I'm positive that Bitcoin can reach $50k during the final days of December 2023 maybe on or after Christmas.I would say that investing in other crypto-currencies especially the ones listed on pre-sale sites can be very risky. Investors get attracted to crypto-currencies a lot during the bull run and mostly new investors make mistake of going with crypto-currencies that promise higher profits in short durations. I know that a few of those projects can give more than expected profits like in the case of Shiba Inu but it's some kind of gambling to find those rare coins and in their name the social media marketers promote useless coins that will empty up the accounts of the investors.",

Spread your net investments across different projects to reduce the impact of any single coin's poor performance in your portfolio. Always keep in mind that BitcoinBTC should be your first priority in Bull run. I think we have to go down to the meaning of diversification, the reason why someone is diversifying is only to avoid losing on the single project or coin, if that’s the case I wouldn’t call investing into other Alticoins after accumulating bitcoin as a diversification of portfolio because bitcoin which is the bedrock of cryptocurrency once it falls every other coin will fall also, so that’s defeats the purpose of diversification. The only reason people go into other Alticoins is to maximize profit since all this low cap Altcoins usually increases in price more than bitcoin does, and This isn’t diversification but form of risking or gambling your funds. The only time you will choose to diversify when you have only Alticoins then you go into many of them to avoid one dumping and losing all your funds in it but as for bitcoin, if any negative effects affects it then all other coins also suffers too",

Diversification is a step that we make in Risk management which's why both topics seem so close to each other, we should diversify our investment and it reduces the risk of losing money only in 2 or 3 tokens, I have observed this strategy but in paper trading, I made a trade on paper of some token but it did not generate my any good profit then I found 3 to 5 different tokens and separated the same amount that I invested in first token into five parts to invest in 5 different tokens equally.The thing that I realized is, if even any 2 or 3 of the tokens I have chosen will not perform well but I would at least be making some good 5x to 10x profit on my other 3 or 2 tokens, but its not that the first tokens will lose me money, no they will also be making me profit but lesser than I anticipated. The thing is, we should diversify our investment at all costs.

I think diversifying portfolio is like creating additional means to lose one investment so cheaply, don't quote me wrongly but just try to derived my point of view.When you diversify your investment into a none reputable coin/tokens and you later finds out that such project isn't trusted knowing too well that bitcoin has been known also trust has been established if not for anything else holding enough volume of bitcoin doesn't make you risk your investment because it's just a matter of patients compared to other altcoin out there that you can't defined about their direction and progression of their newly launched token except investors are interested about doubling their money without undermining the risk associated with such project. Let it not be as if I am too biased about or towards altcoin, altcoin that has been established can be worth diversifying ones investment, otherwise newly birth projects aren't worth to be called for one to diversified their hand earned money knowing too well that after bull run what we may see in the market is nothing less than blood bath which mostly affects all altcoin and bitcoin inclusively but at some points bitcoin do survived   otherwise most altcoin finds it very difficult to scale up again to their previous standard.",

Investors are advised to have a diversified type of investment in crypto because when a particular altcoin hoped on fails, they have other altcoins in addition to bitcoin to give them much-needed profits that won't put them at a loss side to the altcoin that didn't do well in price during the bull run season. In terms of diversifying investment in crypto, I own 80% of bitcoin and 20% of altcoin. Someone else can decide to have 100% of their portfolio in bitcoin and that is a good decision also.",
