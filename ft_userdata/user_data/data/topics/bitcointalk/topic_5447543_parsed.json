(eg: 3090 does 14 kh/s with stock settings)The hashrate increase of this release is not because of any actual improvement. It is simply because we are using single precision(doing math calculations up to 7 decimals) for simulating chips compared to double precision(up to 15 decimals) that was used in the previous version. Double precision is important for dynex jobs especially the machine learning job and we will switch back to it in the future releases.
