If possibly he should go for the transaction first before you sending to him, if at all you really want to deal with him.From your request to get the amount in crypto is simply means with the current price of btc today 27/10/2022, 5:53am at $20817 Is therefore$100/$20817 = ~0.004804BTC please also know that this value may likely change if the bitcoin price goes high or low.",

And I am aware of the possibility to send fake tokens or a wrong chain. I've also seen people who try to send private keys or accounts on shady websites.QuoteFrom your request to get the amount in crypto is simply means with the current price of btc today 27/10/2022, 5:53am at $20817 Is therefore$100/$20817 = ~0.004804BTC please also know that this value may likely change if the bitcoin price goes high or low.My point was to set a hard amount instead of something that fluctuates.",

Just check out his post history to get a clear picture of his intentions.",
