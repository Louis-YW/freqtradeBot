  "content": "I really have an idea to solve the problem of the electrical network, the dependence on fossil and state-owned supply, this means that they stick their noses in our consumption, that prices rise and that they play as they want. That would help a lot, let's say, for btc mining.Micro electrical grids, totally clean energy, a couple of batteries and returning excess electrical flow to the main network.I would like to discuss, analyze and make energy calculations",

      "body": "He should even explain more about the microgird. How will the electricity is going to be generated? Let us say that in the setup there are batteries, batteries are very costly and the batteries capacity can reduce over time as it ages. How will the electricity be generated? Through solar, wind or what? Which means microgrid is not only about batteries, there are other things like turbine or solar panel need to generate it. There are many ways that miners are generating electricity now, but I will not advice anything that requires battery which is costly and the battery capacity reduces as time goes.",

      "body": "In reference to your concern about fossil fuel dependency when it comes to electricity production, doesn't micro grid and it's reliance on battery would open a whole new can of worms? I mean have you seen cobalt miners? Their workplace is literally a human rights abuse. Also, @odolvlobo is right, unless we find a scalable solution, the success of microgrid for bitcoin mining would be far too impractical.",
