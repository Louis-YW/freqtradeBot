DaveF already mentioned the problem behind that. I dont want to share old wallets that are used for tax evasions.",

So I was thinking it was that. Here in the US we have short term gains which are under 1 year and long term gains which is over 1 year. But, as I said, I have heard that some countries have a 5 year (or longer) time to get a different rate.-Dave",
