I would argue to say that most folks who own keys to coins do not, simply because they don't expect to die anytime soon, especially if they are millennials or younger generation. If they die the discovery of said coins is left completely up to chance, unless they made sure their significant others/family knows the whereabouts/that they even owned the crypto/NFTs, etc. So for that reason, there has to be some sort of round about way that heirs could find this and that it could get distributed evenly. Because lets face it the first person in the family who finds this stuff gets it, and basically from that point forward it is up to their own discretion to distribute evenly, etc. So any person who owns coins and has a will set up, none of what they wished to have happen to their coins would actually happen, unless they were to procure the right service. Honestly at this point I say a treasure map would take the cake!!! hahahhah But seriously there has to be a way, some roundabout way to achieve this......",

Nobody expects to die today. People's lives are full of hope, even when they are dying. It would be impossible to pass on the seed phrase to relatives in order to ensure access to it. Even the living today do not completely trust their loved ones, let alone adding their names to their wallet for access after death. Essentially, this is impossible because it contradicts the bitcoin framework's decentralization.QuoteHonestly at this point I say a treasure map would take the cake!!! hahahhah But seriously there has to be a way, some roundabout way to achieve this......Oh yeah, and it will take a long time to figure out something that will work in this manner.

Alright, some insurances are nice to have admittedly, and the government backed scheme of guaranteeing your money if your bank falls through, is quite nice. However, that goes against Bitcoin's principles, and there's no realistic way of doing it. Who, in their right mind would insure something that can't be proved to be lost? Unless, you gave your insurance company all of your Bitcoin, and they controlled the private key there's no way of doing it, and it should go without saying, but that's a big no, no.",

If it was all backed up in their house then there would not be enough room for enough safes and putting them all in one place would be pointless for creating backups. i think you took my numbers too literally.. its more of the mindset that people think they should only have 1 back up. yet nothing stops them having moreas said before if your worried about a sibling then there are many different ways for you to encode your key you are not locked to only relying on a trezor or a paperwallet(one option to be stuck with) you have freedom of choice of options. thus can create your own cunning methods to back up your key to evade snooping siblingsplus sibling needs all keys of all relatives to then be able to steal funds. so just finding one siblings key is as useless as not finding 1 siblings key in a 5 of 6 multisig because he needs to find atleast 5 keys hidden by 5 people in x number of different ways. thus its not a case of just needing to steal 5 trezors. you have freedom to back up in many ways EG tell family you have key on a trezor. and let them waste years sneaking around he house trying to locate your trezor. when actually you etched it on the inside of a metal ball point pen grip which then needs to be sha256 hashed 10 times with a salt nonce of a special number to reveal the private key or some encryption.. (theres a world of options)",

Part of the reason baseball cards, sports memorabilia and collectibles appreciate in value over time. Involves many cards, collectibles and memorabilia being lost or destroyed, resulting in deflation and scarcity of assets.The same principle could apply to bitcoin. As coins are lost, deflation and scarcity increase. Which naturally would contribute towards the price being driven upwards steeply over the long term. Lost coins would contribute towards bitcoin becoming a more exclusive and rare asset. Like mining rewards halving it would drive the price of bitcoin upwards, under natural market mechanics. Speculation and volatility are the unknown variables. If it were purely a matter of market forces and trends, bitcoin's value could be expected to appreciate at a linear rate as coins are lost and become defunct.",
