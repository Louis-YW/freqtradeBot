My feeling is it should be the other way round since you are in need of the exchangeHave you tried to look at Bestchange (https://www.bestchange.com/tether-trc20-to-perfectmoney-usd.html)? Not a very good deal of 1.050 USD PM that you expect, but I can see offers starting from 1.041 USD PM, that is if you don't mind KYC that most of those exchangers may require.",

I do not think that Perfect Money will allow an average joe to accept this money daily without asking him about the source of the money.In his previous posts, you will find that the user had PAYONEER and was looking for USDT. With some one-line posts, it is difficult to think that he would want an activity of about 3 million dollars per month.",

Well I will tell you that this could be very hard if you are to provide escrow and again the transaction must first be initiated by you and not the reputable DT member because it's very hard to trust a newbie for a huge transaction of such amount.",
