A guy who can trust me and I can trust him.The best way to advertise in this forum is through signature campaigns but it requires a strong budget and only a long term campaign will give you noticeable results and build your brand in the forum. Also, you may start with a review campaign initially if the project is in development phase. I may help you if you want to do this.",

Just send the files to the server? You are a dev you should know that. Marketing is a tough topic but you need to have a working product first so you can market it. It seems to me that you want to attract hundreds of people right in the first day. That's not going to happen. You are not CZ, you are not SBF. You are lucky if have a couple of players (wait were you developing an online casino lol), in the first week.",

If it's just a blog or info site, you can certainly handle it on your own. But if the project is larger, a partner would certainly not be bad. But beware, there are many scammers in the bitcoin market. Good luck for your project.",

You could get better feedback from the community and additional exposure for your website. If it's really good like you described, it's possible to get some people keeping an eye on it as well. I suggest get the website to have some basic information about what you will be offering and a way for people to get updates thru email.",
