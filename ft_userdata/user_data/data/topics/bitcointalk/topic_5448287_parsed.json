But it must be considered that Bitcoin Core can run in pruned mode, still verifying blocks, but discarding them, needing far less disk space and hence less investment in hardware.That said I do not really know how much space this would require.Quote from: bitmover on April 10, 2023, 08:22:32 PMQuote from: JamesBorn on April 10, 2023, 06:56:24 PMIn case someone wants to build bitcoin nodes as beginner!

If you're not planning to mine Bitcoin there's no reason for you to make use of Bitcoin Core, you can just make use of an easy-to-use and simple Bitcoin wallet like Electrum.

      "body": "Yes, Bitcoin Core is a good software to support the running of a Bitcoin node. It is the original software created by the Bitcoin community and is still widely used today. Additionally, it is open-source, which means anyone can view and contribute to the code. As for the electronic device to run the node, it depends on the size of the node and the number of transactions it is expected to handle. If it is a small node, a basic computer or Raspberry Pi should suffice. However, if it is a larger node, it may require more powerful hardware such as a server or specialized mining hardware.It's also important to note that running a Bitcoin node requires a significant amount of storage space and bandwidth, so make sure the device has enough resources to handle the workload.Also, you can go with Electrum as bitmover mentioned in his post.Links that might help: https://bitcoin.org/en/full-nodeYouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc_TxlByxeYGood luck.",

Another things is what's the reason for your friend to start up a node? not my concern though, but maybe he might have had the wrong idea regarding running a node, if it's purpose is to make much gain out of it. He should probably consider buying and storing some crypto rather than spending those money for the main time. Until he understands the full system and how the blockchain works.",

Its the most widely used and well supported client for the Bitcoin network and its relatively easy to set up and use. But In terms of hardware you don not necessarily need anything fancy to run a Bitcoin node. Any computer that can run Bitcoin Core and has a stable internet connection should be adequate.",
