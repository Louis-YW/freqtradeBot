And as the market goes, that's why during the bull runs, the importance of having your profit or maybe some of it into a stable coin is a good option. Even you don't have that much, it's okay as long as you're prepared when the bottom of this bear market comes and you're able to buy the coin that you want to have during its sale.",

Bull run should be the time to make profit and sell at least take some and enjoy your winnings2. Bear run is when people should start to accumulateIt's a hard lesson for me when I started because as you have mentioned, there are people who sell at bear market and losing money. But now I have learned that it should be the other way around.",

Also, cash can help you with your emergency needs, aside from having your own emergency funds it can help you a lot once you have other extra funds. Cash management is also important, we should not just buy during bear market, we still need to analyze as well.",

When we bought the cryptos during the bullish era and suddenly the market crashed at that time and we have not taken a profit yet, there is no other thing besides holding them until the next bullish era or a certain time period. And to deal with this situation probabilities, this is how money management works, to decide how much to spend and how much to save and take. We need also to understand how much we can afford to spend during the bullish era and what kind of investment strategy we have. For, this will also determine our money management. Taking profits and cash out the profits itself will also depend on our strategy. I am sure that many traders will also cash out their profits, although it may not be the entire profits. I personally always cash out the profits at least half form it and make the least for saving o the exchange or for another capital for investment. But, this will also depend on the curtains situation, there may be some different strategy or changing strategy again depending on the codnition at the time.",

The market is doing whatever it likes so we don't need to bother yourself about it but to keep waiting so things can finally stay in place. We should not lose hope in the market now that everything is just getting well and some persons have seen that truly the market does not move in a single direction but always try and reset to take another direction or to continue.",

This is how I invest because we never know what will happen in the future and opportunities often come very unexpectedly so there is always cash to spare. Although in the bull market most coins will increase in price continuously, but when it comes to profits, we should also take some profits, not hold them all, taking profits is never wrong.In the bull market, we should also limit our buying, especially the coins that have pumped strongly, we better ignore it. Don't be afraid to miss out because opportunities will always appear during the bull season.",

Mostly we did no preparation as we thought money is easy to get. People are sometimes blind to see the reality that once the bull season end, the bear market starts, it is usually out of our mind while enjoying the bull party and making a lot of money during that time. Most of us are financially illiterate and have no control over spending money which makes no wonder why we don't have a money reserve.",
