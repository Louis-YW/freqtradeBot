  "content": "Launchpads are slowly becoming the backbone of the Decentralized Finance ecosystem, offering small and large cryptocurrency projects, whether it be gaming, metaverse or a Move-to-Earn app, access to a pool of investors wanting to find the next gem. They are helping connect like-minded individuals to enthusiastic developers, where anyone and everyone can invest and gain from this emerging market. Crypto Launchpads, also known as incubators, are platforms which allow decentralized crypto projects to raise funds by selling a percentage of the projectâ€™s token supply at a discounted price. They satisfy two fundamental needs: Decentralized crypto projects acquiring capital to fund marketing and development and investors getting the opportunity at, in their eyes, undervalued tokens. A launchpad most commonly makes money by taking a % of the total revenue generated by a project to fund their operations and as a reward for their service. Launchpads like AdLunam are innovative platforms that allocate tokens to the investors and their users based on a proof-of-allocation model. Using this model, small scale investors like me can engage with the project before its IDO and get allocation based on my engagement! Learn more: adlunam.cc",
