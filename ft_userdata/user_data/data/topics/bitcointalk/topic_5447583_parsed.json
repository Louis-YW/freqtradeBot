  "content": "Are you already feeling the hype of Arbitrum airdrop? And you feel like you will never miss out on the next upcoming airdrop like Zksync and StarkNet? This warning message is for you.After the Arbitrum airdrop was a success and many people are claiming their arb tokens some people claimed that they lost all their arbs after claiming them from the official claiming website into their wallet, including a friend of mine, you want to know how it happened? This is howThere is no way you won't use Twitter if you are into airdrops, even if you don't want to, some tasks will require you to follow the project's official Twitter account, some crazy people are sending Tweet out on Twitter about how to pass for the next big Airdrop e.g Zksync and they will drop you a link, or ask you for your BSC address.     Look at the red spot very carefully, the links are phishing links, they can easily have access to your recovery seed once you connect your wallet to the link and wait patiently till the claiming day of the real token or send you a malicious fake token.Stop visiting every links you see on Twitter because you want to qualify for the airdrop, Twitter is no more a safe place, Twitter is the most dangerous social media platform, especially for crypto-related things. I passed the Arbitrum airdrop myself, using Airdrops.io and Airdropbob, they are oldy and trusty, it's been over four years since I've been using these two, Zksync task is currently on the platforms. Stay safe and do not forget that not all that glitters are made of real Gold.If you have already interacted with any link on Twitter all in the name of Airdrop, please go back and check the link very well, make sure it says lite.zkysnc.io or bridge.zksync.io, if not , please change your old wallet you are using for airdrop and use a new wallet address.",

      "body": "This is exactly what I mean when I try to warn people against social media influencers; if this is true that the links there are phishing links, then there is no length to which these scammers can't get. Earlier, I guess there were some criteria one needed to meet before his account could be verified on social media, but now it's more business than before; if you can pay for that blue badge, they will hand it over to you. There is less of a suspicion when one sees any information posted online from a verified account; no one will ever suspect that. This warning is not only for Twitter users but for all social media, email, and any site at all. To be security conscious, we should always avoid links from unverified users unless they're from the project itself, and even if they're from project owners, we should be mindful of the kind of link we open on our mobile device, which we usually use as storage for crypto. Most of these Web 3 projects and airdrops online, which require users to connect their wallets directly to their sites, impose more risk than good on users and should be avoided. Me personally, I don't connect my wallet to any site of any kind, most especially my crypto wallets. Back in the days when I still participated in airdrops, I had a separate wallet for each airdrop that I participated in, for security reasons, so that if anything were to happen to the wallet, I wouldn't be a complete loser.",

Telegram, Facebook crypto groups, Discord, and Reddit are mostly used by these scammers.Sorry to say this, but based on my gathered facts, Twitter is actually the most dangerous social media platform when it comes to this kind of scam. The reason is that Twitter is the most used social media platform by crypto lovers, and as such, every scammer whose main target is crypto holders targets Twitter before they can even make use of any other means.No social media is safe, no site is also too safe, and scammers can use any place they want irrespective of who their target is.

Most newbies don't just know when to give up; that's why scammers still have the time to map out new scam plans because they know their victims are always ready to fall into them.",

Clicking links on social media is always a risky thing to do. One can never be too careful with security. Twitter is the social media site I use the most and I have seen different forms of scams on that platform. If you decide to click links from only handles you know and trust, that's still not a good idea because these scammers buy accounts too, or they just find a way to hack them if the user is not careful. These days, with how easy it is to get verified on Twitter things are much worst. Before you can trust a verified account to an extent but these days anybody with $84 a year can get a Twitter verification.  Sometimes the people posting those links do not even know that they're posting an unsecured link because they just want to refer people as it is a criterion for most airdrops.",

The time completing those tasks and creating different social accounts can be applied to some other endeavor which would be more rewarding.Altcoins are full of traps, like bars in Thailand I've noticed there are two kinds of people in here. One stick to holding and trading known, verified coins. They have BTC, ETH, maybe go crazy from time to time and buy a shitcoin like Doge when they feel like it may get pumped by some influencer, that's it. The other kind is a bounty hunter that does not verify. That bounty hunter jumps into every single project without even knowing what it's about. The only thing these guys care about is the money they can make from it. They jump into the water, not knowing its depth or temperature, thinking there's a treasure waiting for them, but often it's just an old shoe, or a shark ready to bite.Believe me when I say it, claiming airdrops is one step forward, two steps back. You think you're ahead one month and then someone cheats you the next.",

Many typical airdrop hustlers don't have that few dollars which is why they miss out on this huge airdrop that pays thousands of dollars.

Yes, there is no wrong in participating in airdrops as I was doing it in the past but never did it again after wasting my time while just only getting shitcoins.
