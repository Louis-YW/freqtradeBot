However, people will still use custodial wallets just because it's simple but one of the key points of Bitcoin is exactly to have full control over our coins which brings full responsability back to us and this is many times a problem because you need to have some knowledge to be able to be responsible for your coins and many people don't want this responsability.",

You should educate him more about the bull and bear season, getting upset over every mention of market dipping even lower won't help him health wise,  every season has an expired date, bear period will expire at some point no matter how severe it may look, what he need is patience.This type of news is a constant reminder that exchanges are not the best place to store your asset.",

They filed for bankruptcy protection. The courts and others now have a lot of control over what happens. Coinify can be a separate owned entity that is 100% solvent and profitable. But if the judge or whoever decides to close it or sell it or change the way it operates pending a deep audit or whatever else then that is what happens. It can also be a self fulfilling prophecy. Even if Coinify is fine, now that people begin to stop using it because of this it will start to shrink and loose clients and money and then......-Dave",
