For me when i am depressed, I do undermentioned things-Bath-Listen Songs-Travel with bicycle-Watch travel videos-Listen Spiritual religious things-Eat at outside(Food also a meditation)what you do to overcome these temporary depression situations?Simply feed your body or yourself with good things, such as Good information(audio, videos, etc), Good foods, Good drinks, etc. Spend time alone or with people who do similar/same things you do, while feeding yourselves with good things. Believe and enjoy the good things you feed onAlways remember that Good things are things that can solve your problems and increase your quality of life/existence, without creating more problems for you. Avoid feeding on things that are harmful to you. Feed more on undefiled natural things made directly by our CREATOR. Whatever you feed on must be safe... if it's safe it's good.The only way to know what is good is to know things that are not against the Commandment of our CREATOR or things that are according to HIS Words. You can find the commandments and HIS Words In Holy Bible. His Word teaches us what to consume and what not to consume. And HIS Commandments is simple: Love the CREATOR and your neighbors. Those who truly love the CREATOR, will not misuse or abuse things HE created for us, including our own bodies.Feeding/focusing on worldly things can make people depressed, hopeless, defeated, dumb, confused, etc. So feed more on the good and avoid the bad totally, if possible. . If you can't avoid them totally then don't believe them as long as they are not according to the holy Words or Commandments. The more you feed only on good things, the more your unseen shield becomes stronger. And it will become harder for things from the World to sip into your life or shield.",

Having a pet to play with can help your mind be put at ease. Starting off with having a fitness tracker is a tool to keep yourself balanced. There are settings on the fitness device that can set an alarm for â€˜mindfulness timeâ€™. A technique that helps you to slow down your day.Â  Slowing down to ponder, watch your inhaling and exhaling, and focus. Maintaining physical activity such as having an exercise routine, or brief stroll around the block or two. Limiting caffeine intake to one cup of joe and none after twelve oâ€™clock.",

I think, it's great that you have a list of activities that help you feel better when you're feeling down. Self-care is so important for mental health, and it's different for everyone. Personally, when I'm feeling down, I like to take a break from work and do something creative like drawing or writing. I also find exercise to be really helpful, whether it's going for a walk or doing some yoga. And sometimes, just talking things out with a friend or family member can make a big difference. So, it's all about finding what works best for you and prioritizing your mental well-being.",
