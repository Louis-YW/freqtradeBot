Critics will say bitcoin is too volatile and also bitcoin mining is demanding for too much electricity. No one can say bitcoin is not a currency because bitcoin is money and what represents it as money is its currency part.About the illegal use of bitcoin, fiat are used more for illegal dealing.Bitcoin is not fixing anything related to this because there is nothing to fix regarding this.",

So what are your opinion towards the people that are investing in Bitcoin? When you are at first engagement or totally noob about Bitcoin then reading up its WP would be giving out that direct idea on what it is https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfOn the moment that you do make yourself aware on what it is then you would definitely be having the idea on what you are dealing with. It is really just that a bonus that its value is something that do increase but we cant really be able to deny that majority will really be giving out some emphasis when it regards on making money rather than on its actual usage or utility.Investing on Bitcoin and what are points to consider? Invest on what you can afford to lose, dont expect something about 100% assurance. Bare up with the risks involved when it comes to volatility.Get prepared in terms of those cycles whether bull or bear cycles.  Expect tons of criticisms or other negative inputs and legal issues and never ending sentiments that this marketcould really have.",

So what are your opinion towards the people that are investing in Bitcoin? As stated on here many times, the best way (typically) to invest in anything is utilizing a strategy called DCA, or Dollar Cost Averaging where you're putting your money in to bitcoin, say $100 every other week throughout the entire year.  No one knows for sure when bitcoin is going to be high, or low, so this strategy allows you to make sure you at least hit some of the \"lows\" to get more bang for your buck.",

So what are your opinion towards the people that are investing in Bitcoin? So when investing in Bitcoin you dont need to consider whether some people use it for illegal purposes or that it doesnt operate as a currency, they are irrelevant considerations.What newcomers should be considering on a basic level is that there is not going to bea 100x profit and profits will take time depending on what way the investment is done,like by trading and/or DCA. Other considerations are at what stage in Bitcoins cyclethe investment is starting and how long you are willing to wait.Quote from: Ojinga on May 16, 2024, 07:54:00 PMSo what are your opinion towards the people that are investing in Bitcoin? I dont have an opinion about other people, they are free to use Bitcoin as they see fitfor themselves.",

The purpose of bitcoin is not based on a big exchange, although most people buy and hold bitcoin because of the people who are selling it, and they prefer to hold it on an exchange as they believe it's the best place for them to store it.  What I will say to those who invest in bitcoin is that they made the right choice, especially when they invest in it with their spare money, which means the price dump and shake won't affect them at all as they will be patient enough till the price of bitcoin increases.",

I know their are so many things to be consider with when it comes to anything investment. Mostly concerning the highest exchange in the world. So what are your opinion towards the people that are investing in Bitcoin? Yes, bitcoin price is highly volatile. Are you willing to invest in a project you are not certain about it's outcome? I think this is the very first thing any prospective investor should consider before investing. Most of these Bitcoin critics who are using bitcoin price volatility against Bitcoin base their judgement on the fact that they or someone they know lost their hard earned money after a very short while of investing.  This can really be painful,  especially when they are not prepared for such a loss.A person who has already put these price fluctuations thing into consideration will bring up strategies to reduce his risks so he can make some profits. It's either he adopts the DCA approach or invest for a very long time as there are possibilities that the value of his investment must have appreciated as at the time he will be ready to withdraw.",

I know it's very difficult for Bitcoin to crash, but what if it happens in the future that Bitcoin got down. Then all investment are gone, we all know that Bitcoin is heading very far  it will surely be as safe haven soon. I like your response and believe towards it. And the banks they already know what's coming, seeing things and how Bitcoin operates and price hitting up it shows something huge is coming. I like your consideration.",

Then the critics should also tell your the functions of the fiat currency so that we can see if there is any different between the two. And if I am not mistaken, fiat currency is to exchange goods and services physical and in the recent time it has used as the digital Banking system which is known as cashless transactions of buying and paying things. In my country if you go inside the bank, the highest amount of money will be given to you now is $6 or $8 and I don't know if because we are from the poor people.But when I went to the bank to take some amount of money, the cashier told me that it's only $8 they're giving out to customers and I took the money and left. Because of the things we buy now is transfer and not cash a again. So I don't see any different between bitcoin and fiat anymore and the only different is that bitcoin has lost it core value of digital currency to buy things but people are only interested to invest with it.",

Bitcoin definitely has some issues that give people pause.  The price jumps all over the place.  There is some shady stuff happening on the dark web.  But Bitcoiners know what they signed up for.  Either they truly believe in the whole decentralized currency revolution thing.  Or they just wanna make a quick buck on the volatility. My take? Hey, you do you.  If you wanna dive in go for it.  Just make sure you learn about it first, get the risks, and dont come crying if you lose that money.  Bitcoin has always been a gamble.",

Bitcoin's volatility is the whole essence of the introduction of monetary decentralization. It's also majorly the reasons why it's regarded as a digital currency that appreciates with time.As for Bitcoin mining, I don't think critics are actually the main people behind the escalation; bitcoin hasn't been a secret right from time being, so I guess alot of people have been looking through to either make a rough estimation on how profitable it is to mine, or basically, the miners themselves put everyone on the know.QuoteAbout the illegal use of bitcoin, fiat are used more for illegal dealing.

Anyway, to answer the topic itself, what does the beginner or any people need to consider first before entering in bitcoin? Well, for me, the most important thing is awareness of the risk. We know how risky bitcoin is, and many investors or people who recently entered in bitcoin just because of the hype, so they ignore the most important thing that should be considered, which is the risk. Yes, maybe they have earned from riding the trend, but how about the other days? Or weeks? How could an investor survive without the trend? Of course, if you enter bitcoin without the basic knowledge, then you will know what the risk is in bitcoin, the risk of losing money, and you should be aware of yourself if you can take those risks and lose money in the process.",

So what are your opinion towards the people that are investing in Bitcoin? Yea i wouldn’t say many people today do not treat bitcoin as a currency but rather they treat it more today as an asset to hold as a result of the distinctive characteristics that bitcoin possess and which are characteristics for good asset to hold. People today to not just bring out their bitcoin to trade like that but rather look for other means. There is nothing wrong treating bitcoin as a investment so my advice to any one trying to come into cryptocurrency or specifically is to think long time. Many people fall to losses today in cryptocurrency or bitcoin because of the duration of timing of when to buy and sell.",
