But from the cost of transaction paying in Bitcoin for items that cost a few dollars is not encouraging. The picture you attached that showed the business you claim accepts Bitcoin made me doubt your story. How will a business that sells sachet drinks that cost less than $0.11 adopt be Bitcoin payment option? It will be a total waste of time and funds because fiat will be the best option for such a business.    QuoteI've read some post about businesses accepting bitcoin and I want to know if they also face those challenges mentioned above and how do they face and solve these challenges as I think this initiative in my local community will also help to raise awareness about bitcoin and since I'm still new in the space, I would love to spread the news of bitcoin but I think it will be at the right time when I get the required knowledge.Some of these business that accepts Bitcoin use Lightning Network.

From the profitability point of view it doesn't make much difference for the seller yet. Maybe in the following years it might start changing for the better, but as far as I know there are no expectations regard it.",

That alot of people don't willingly want to pay make payment with bitcoin as a result of the high transaction fee This one of the biggest problems associated with accepting bitcoin as a means of payment, that’s why I don’t recommend it for a micro transactions Because the fees are most at times higher than the amount of the commodity. Another problem associated to transactions is the confirmation time, sometimes a single block confirmation can take more than the average 10 minutes not with standing the number of confirmations that the merchant will consider acceptable. Most at times 6 confirmations which can span beyond 60 minutes.Quote2. Security as alot of customers also shy away from making payment in bitcoin as they don't want to be identified as people who own bitcoin.Yes this is what paying with physically with bitcoin actually causes, personally I prefer cross border transactions where both the buyer and seller do not even know each other physically. The issue of privacy is protected here except you link that address to a KYC exchange. Quote from: Patikno on January 30, 2024, 04:58:40 PMSolution: Using a centralized/off-chain service that does not require moving bitcoin on-chain.The problem with this is that you need to be using same exchange with that merchant and also you must have funds on the exchange. I believe you know the risk associated with storing your coins on exchanges. Also off chain transactions like lightning network for a one time transaction is not advisable because you will need to create a channel with the merchant which actually requires fees",

Many owners and hodlers of Bitcoin see Bitcoin as investments and not to be used for daily transactions especially in local shops so they are all unmotivated to use their Bitcoin for transactions when they have fiat for it.",

      "body": "Probably it is with Bitcoin's market price volatility and overall usage. A business simply needs to revolve the gross on expenses to run the business itself; salary of employees, maintenance, inventory of goods (if you are in retail), and the likes. Imagine accepting Bitcoin payment for the whole week and the market price by that time is high. What to expect? High transaction fees. Then on the following week, the price suddenly declined, and on the same instance, the retail shop is in need of raw products or products to be sold, would you be selling your holdings immediately? That would be resulting to permanent loss. Would you wait? It will be a problem running the business while waiting. This is the possible challenge I view assuming that all transactions will be in BTC. Overall sustainability of the business will be a problem in such conditions. The only instance I would be seeing Bitcoin adoption as a mode of payment for businesses if if it is  stand alone and a service provider that does not require that much of revolving funds to run it. For example, a law firm run by a single attorney. He/She could endure holing as his sacrifice to earn profit once the market recover after a decline. Am I making valid points here? I saw small proprietorships in my country which tried to do the same thing and unfortunately they eventually closed although not sure of the particular cause but thinking of possibilities then it might have been a factor. So if you are planning to also do the same thing then make sure to do your own research about it. Things won't be easily actualized given that adoption of something which is not common to all of your target market or audiences. Always manage the risk.",

Math says this can never work, but that doesn't mean you can't sell thins for bitcoin. The value of an item must be much higher than the fee for it to even have the slightest chance of success. As for the solution, there are even better ways of fixing this. You can sell in bulk, like Chinese manufacturers, or do hat many online stores do and allow clients to load funds onto their account. They can send 1k USD to the store at once and be able to use it for purchases throughout the year. Bitcoin is a great tool for auctions, where you need proof of funds. In traditional auctions you usually have to send some money before you're allowed to participate. With bitcoin you can sign a message and achieve a similar result.",

In my opinion, there are many challenges and reasons faced by businesses that accept Bitcoin and for Bitcoin users themselves, except for large-scale businesses and nominal goods with large prices, for example: cars and so on.Businesses with Bitcoin payments are hampered if they are limited to small and medium businesses, it can cost more to send than the purchase price, of course you know what I mean.In my area there is a restaurant business that accepts payment in Bitcoin, but it has only been running for 5 months for various reasons, one of which is that one dining table of 5 people only spent $80, but the costs incurred are not commensurate with the food paid for, which is why currently the restaurant no longer accepts Bitcoin, that is a small challenge and there are many other challenges it faces.",

So, as a business owner, you are likely to face two problems, one which I will discuss in this segment and the other which I will give to the next person here. For this, you are going to face issues with your direct customers and clients who are patronizing your products or services in terms of making payments. Not a lot of customers are ready to make payments to you using your wallet address, especially when you are still a small business and dealing with petty trades out there. Setting up a business in a developing country, like Nigeria, will amount to almost 0 participation in customers that are willing to pay to your wallet address rather 99% of them would prefer to make payments via Bank accounts, traditional banks or online banks than to use the new invent of wallet address or cryptocurrencies.Quote from: Patikno on January 30, 2024, 04:58:40 PMAs far as I know, there are 2 main problems facing businesses that accept bitcoin as their payment.1.

This law has a significant impact on business actors, because they cannot differentiate and offer other payment method to make things easier for their clients/customers.The second aspect is what I will discuss here, which is the transaction fee like you rightly mentioned above and the laws of the country.For a country like Nigeria that just lifted the ban on cryptocurrencies, although have not allowed the full implementation of that policy, which implies that banks are not allowed to make transactions using cryptocurrencies, it becomes a lot sketchy for a business to make use of those modes of payment in a day-to-day business arena. The transaction fee which has been increasing almos by the day is another plague in the adoption of Bitcoin  transactions for small businesses. Let's say, for instance, if you are making $100 sales a day and you're forced to remove transaction fee that is up to more-or-less $3 to $5 in a single transaction, what do you then realize at the end of your business day. Why can't you make use of the normal mode of payment and redeem those transaction fees that you lose during the process of using Bitcoin.",

Some of those businesses are not knowledgeable about crypto currency. Even if they want to offer this service, they don't know how to handle the process or what the best approach and strategy is when it comes to accepting crypto. The other is that some crypto investors or holders will choose not to use their assets as payment. Imagine always paying using bitcoin; then you will not have enough holdings, and honestly, for me, I'd rather not use my assets as payment because they are for my investments. In short, there are much more challenges to face when it comes to adopting crypto currency in a business, and it is risky if not handled and managed correctly.",

I think that not every business person should accept bitcoin for the sake of accepting bitcoin for payment because other businesses are doing it and they want to stay competitive or look progress. There are steps to take. One of the steps is to invest in knowledge and training. If the business owner in the story invested in knowledge and training, he would have anticipated the problem and challenges of accepting bitcoin as payment from a business standpoint and a customer stand point. He would have then be able to effectively tackle if.  Using a centralized/off-chain service that does not require moving bitcoin on-chain like you have said is the best solution. Zero hassles. The customer's mind would be at ease. Let me throw in more light for anyone who may not understand it, the business own simply needs to use a third part payment system that would help process payments received in bitcoin. These transactions that will be carried out are off-chain. They are not registered on the blockchain, therefore the customer will not be charged any transaction fee and there would be no delay even if there is a congestion on the bitcoin network.",
