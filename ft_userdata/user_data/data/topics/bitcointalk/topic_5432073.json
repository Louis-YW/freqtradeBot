      "body": "Agree with the discounts. It's what attracted me to try spending in Bitcoin (a small discount or cashback or similar in return for the additional inconvenience). It's also what attracted my very first Bitcoin paying clients -- often, especially on larger invoices, 5% off can be quite a savings, especially over long-term contracts.Quote from: LoyceMobile on December 27, 2022, 08:52:00 PMDon't ask your customers to use third parties that can ask for kyc.Yep. Terrible idea. And that KYC can get both parties in trouble with frozen accounts. As a consumer/customer I truly appreciate when a website doesn't force me to use Bitpay, for example. It makes my life much harder, forces me to overpay fees and estimate a high amount, forces me to disable RBF (among many other inconveniences!).",

It seems you're actually don't know what you're talking about? is there any hardware wallet that doesn't support Bitcoin? nope, every hardware wallet always accept Bitcoin, it's only limited for shitcoins.As long as your customers pay with Bitcoin, not a fake Bitcoin e.g. BCH, BSV, WBTC etc, using on chain network, not a centralized network e.g. BSC, no matter address their use (legacy, segwit, native segwit) they can send it to your wallet. Don't confuse if they need to use Coinbase or BitPay.Anyway why on earth you classify Coinbase and BitPay is a wallet, they're an exchange and require KYC!",

Or if they have a credit card, it's easier to pay with their credit card. You seem to miss the point of your own topic: if you want customers to pay with Bitcoin, use your own Bitcoin wallet.QuotePhysical wallet/ledger for storing bitcoin received from customers.So you meant hardware wallets. That means you'll have to connect your hardware wallet to a computer (or mobile) to show them an address (or QR-code). It also means you're exposing your hardware wallet to many people, and someone may hit you on the head for it.It's much better to use Electrum as a watch-only wallet for your hardware wallet. That allows you to create a new address for each transaction, and funds can't be moved from the system you have in your shop. It's still not perfect though: Electrum will show your total balance by default, even on the \"Receive\" tab.Quote from: Despairo on December 28, 2022, 01:49:36 AMIt seems you're actually don't know what you're talking about?Correct.

Coinbase specifies it as \"Self-custodial\".As for your overall suggestions, I get it what you mean.If the customers already have hotwallets like Coinbase App, Trustwallet, etc. they can just scan qr codes to send btc as payment. Although I doubt anybody who's using a hardware wallet would be insane enough to bring it to a bar to pay for his drinks.For convenience, the business owner has to adapt to the needs of his customers. Accepting BTC as payment through various 3rd party apps.Here's an example, I recently saw a couple (vloggers) who took a 1-day challenge wherein they can only use Bitcoin as payment in Boracay (a popular tourist destination here in the Philippines). They've paid BTC through an app called Pouch.ph. The app converts the BTC they've paid to fiat (Philippine Peso) when the store/seller recieves it. It kinda beats the purpose of Bitcoin and whole idea behind it but it's a good start.",

How can we expect people will pay through lightning network if they didn't even know what's the difference between non custodial wallet and centralized exchange lol, only knowledge users and experienced are know about lightning network.

Because government will possibly their convincing factor since if authorities will confirm that they are making it legal and everyone can use it to purchase goods then many people will provably use bitcoin for everyday transaction. But if you force to do this to your costumer will maybe they get confused about your intention and might they get discourage on bitcoin because they might dislike its volatility and would hardly stay using fiat because they might say that this is more cheaper to them.",
