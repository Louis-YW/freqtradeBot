Probably we need additional compression for transactions like this because that all have same amount, fee and OUTPUT address, or some other solution. I heard that Stratum V2 firmware can potentialy solve some problems by giving more freedom to individual miner, which can avoid this transactions. What are you thinking about it ?",

What is wrong with those transactions?They are valid transactions, getting accepted by nodes, and they pay the fee just like others, who are you or anyone else to decide what should be allowed and what not? Besides, the individual miner, unless he somehow manages to get 2-3 Exahash of hashing power so, about 10-20 thousand miners at least can't and won't be able to do a thing.Yeah, let's start censoring stuff we don't like because obviously, that's what Bitcoin was designed for!Next will be thumblers and mixers because they make hundreds of tx, then there will be consolidations cause they also take too much space, then transactions under 10$ cause they present no interest then banning transactions between same wallets as they also clog the mempool, then miners won't accept transactions unless the owner of the originating address hasn't already submitted a sperm sample along his KYC data.",

Miners are not the only ones benefiting from higher transaction fees but some altcoins and exchanges, in 2017 there was a high volume of hashtags to support the BCH hypothesis and prove that Bitcoin is not suitable for everyday transactions.Miners are the weaker party in the spam attack, as they do not make a profit from it, but on the contrary, the spam transactions that they make make the block full, while it could have been to include more transactions in that block and earn more fees.If you think the fees are high, stop sending transactions.",

That would make sense if there is a collusion among the miners to artificially inflate the fees but generally game theory negates all of these collusion and would result in a far lower profit than expected. Besides, the fact that most wallets are biased towards mempool size rather than historical block data as a fee estimation makes this less likely to influence the fees to a large extent.",

As I said in the first reply, those transactions are related to ordinal scams and are not made by miners.If such transactions are made by miners, not only they don't earn any money from them, but they also waste some money. All those transactions are creating dusts and it would be very expensive to spend them.",

In other words this is a very costly attack for the pool.BTW you can't just find spam by looking at the raw fee in dollar paid by transactions. Actual blockchain analysis is needed.",
