I don't think there's many casinos accept privacy coins e.g. Monero, Monero even get delisted in many top exchanges due to risk of money laundering. There's a chance if Curacao license doesn't accept Monero again, all licensed casinos will delist Monero too.AFAIK Freebitco.in is no KYC casino, but there's a case before Freebitco.in openly posting user data so it's completely impossible to become anonymous in centralized casino.",

Casino is now being regulate and there license is being use against them to implement KYC to the customer. Right now there are still casino that offers no KYC but soon anonymous gambling on license casino is not possible anymore.",

I would say if you are just average gambler then you can be anonymous, but if you are a whale, at certain point online crypto casinos will ask you to undergone KYC.",

You could just stop using crypto casinos that are asking KYC or you can use your very anonymous wallet to gamble in casinos that don't ask for KYC.   Cryptocurrency is not banned or illegal so there is nothing wrong to it. But there is also nothing wrong if one wants to remain anonymous so do whatever you need to do to stay anonymous if you wish.",

Does it mean that gambling online anonymously is no longer possible?Well, that is a hot topic for discussion.. because the early casinos where very \"anonymity\" conscious, because Crypto currencies were illegal in most countries back then. Since the early days.. a lot of regulations has come into play and Crypto currencies has become less anonymous. (Also the introduction of third party services like Exchanges and wallet providers has almost killed anonymity, before your coins reach the casinos)    The Fiat based casinos that converted to Crypto currencies were \"regulated\" before they started to accept Crypto currencies, so nothing changed with them. Some of the Crypto casinos grew bigger and bigger and they had to license their casinos and most of these licenses require that the casino ask for KYC/AML verification.",

Does it mean that gambling online anonymously is no longer possible?There are some blockchain gambling site that are existing. Just like there are centralized exchanges, that does not mean there are not decentralized exchanges, so in gambling too.As long as you are using a centralized gambling site, they may request for KYC from you. I have not committed any crime, I am not a money launderer and I am not in support of any terrorism or online crime activity, the reason I played on those gambling sites. As long as they provide the services I want, that is all that matters, the reason people are using them. Not that is have huge amount there, so I do not consider not having privacy while making use of such gambling sites. I was once on many fiat based gambling sites before.Mind this, crypto is not for anonymous payment, only few like monero, some means of transactions of litecoin, dash and zcash, including some other privacy cryptocurrencies are used for anonymous transactions.",

      "body": "I think it's contradictory but crypto casinos can't do anything but comply with the regulations from the regulators because it is related to the licenses owned by the casinos. If the regulators weren't as strict as they are today, it's unlikely that casinos will force their customers to KYC so we can still play anonymously.But the government must be wary of money laundering cases in casinos because when people play with big money, the casino and the government must know where the funds are coming from. And if it is indeed connected to money laundering, they will easily catch the culprit if the culprit does KYC.But I guess there are still casinos that keep working anonymously because we see that some casinos use private wallets to connect to someone's account so they will go through KYC. But there is still the possibility that the person will be asked to do KYC.",

However, when talking about anti-money laundering (AML) rules, providers need to make KYC rules for deposits and withdrawals with a certain nominal. If there is no KYC, the potential for money laundering will be higher. So as long as KYC is the only way to avoid money laundering, then KYC will always be applied. Unless there is an identity tracking method and AML prevention efforts with the KYC free method, the provider will definitely implement it.",

Of course, a casino found guilty of failing to provide a correct spreadsheet will face a penalty by the regulatory body in the manner of having a revoked license.  Also during payouts, most casinos if not properly regulated may fail to payout winnings for reasons of improper I.d cards or another document to ascertain the identity of the user. There's less anonymity in the crypto space these days because the usage keeps gaining momentum from new users, hence the reason for KYC verification which helps to show new persons joining the network that their funds are secured from scams if they can only adhere to security tips and processes.",
