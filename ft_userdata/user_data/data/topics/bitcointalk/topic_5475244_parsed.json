If you want to avoid your Country tax. Then it's better you move to another country where they don't pay crypto tax (there are still many of them) become a citizen there, set up your accounts and start happily trading.",

If they're being stubborn though, then you can probably ask around your local community and see if they have some options to make your trade more affordable while still paying your tax. The last choice would be to move out as mentioned above.Btw, starting a crypto journey is a broad term. You don't have to start it by trading. Learning about Bitcoin and how it works, how to set up your wallet, etc is also a good step to take. It is not like you'll magically earn $10k and need to pay $3k for tax as soon as you open an exchange account.[1] https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/09/indias-controversial-crypto-tax-should-be-cut-after-failing-to-achieve-aims-think-tank-urges/",

      "body": "You can't avoid it as long as you are still an Indian citizen because it means you have to obey all the rules of that country and every violation has a penalty. If you feel reluctant to pay taxes from your crypto trading activities, then move to another country that does not apply this, but if it is not possible to move, then there is no need to carry out crypto trading. In fact, trading is not an activity that will provide certainty of profit, many end up experiencing losses. So actually you are afraid of taxes for activities that don't necessarily provide a profit for you, maybe you will even stop trading before you can make a profit because trading is not as easy as you imagine.",

In my country, people evading taxes is a crime that can impose sanctions on the offender and this is no joke because they make regulations regarding taxes as state income. If your country makes such rules then I think there is no way to avoid them because even if you insist on ignoring them then you yourself will accept the risk.The solution is to move to another country if you object to the taxes charged or you can also wait for a revision regarding the large taxes being waived for people trading in your country. Encouragement from outside parties as the wider community in India might make your government revise these regulations and although it is a bit difficult that is the most rational plan.",

Therefore, you have paid a tax on 30%. % and increased your Bitcoin holding.If the taxes are for all transactions, it is better to use a DEX such as BISQ, and then reduce the sale of stable currencies and keep a record.In any case, try not to use CEX if taxes are imposed on all profits from all Bitcoin transactions, including profits from selling altcoins.",

Try using exchange like Binance or other international exchanges which are based out of India for trading but withdrawal I am not sure if your government can get data from them as I have not seen such things happening but if you are intending to withdraw huge amount then it's advisable to go for OTC. Mate this taxation rule has just killed the Crypto trading industry in India.If we try to get it transferred to other country to your contacts and get it from them through different mean that would become money laundering and get you in legal troubles. If you trade at massive scale which requires you to withdraw huge then relocate to crypto friendly nations until this rule is taken back.",

A 30% tax rate is a big money, and I assume it's on the profit, not the transaction amount. Shouldn't you be able to freely ignore this tax system if you're not making a profit?And if the current regulations aren't providing any advantages for crypto adopter in India, just wait for the next set of regulations. Governments or bank typically move swiftly to ensure fairness for both crypto users and the government itself without underestimate some their ecosystem. This allows for a balanced law as the crypto market evolves in India.",

I am still struggling with that, so 30% is a lot of pain in his pocket. Think of how 30% of his salary in one month will go to the government.For example, if your salary is $100 a month as an employee, only 70 dollars will be left, not enough. So it is not surprising that the life situation in India is difficult. Maybe the only thing I can say to avoid that tax is that the best thing to do is to invest in mutual funds or in real estate. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are also possible.",

You can avoid tax on crypto trading only if you are willing to do all your trading either on any offshore trading platform like Binance or something where TDS laws aren't applicable as of now, honestly not sure, they might even come in the future for Indians specifically. Another safer yet more complex option will be to use DEX instead of CEX. You won't have to do any KYC on these exchanges and honestly, your money isn't that easily traceable either. But no matter what you do if you want to redeem the money in INR you will always have to pay a tax on that. No choice at all.PS: Obviously legally it's not allowed to do so & not a wise thing to do as well, so please DYOR.",

The only thing wrong is the percentage imposed on them, which is 30%, which in my opinion is too big and not just. It would be okay if you saw a good economy in the country of India.  Here in our country, the tax collected from our constituents is three times less than 30%, and the percentage of our economy is improving, but in India, that is not the case, which means there are too many corrupt people. who are government officials in that country. So, I think even if you invest there, you still won't be able to get rid of that burden. The only way I see is to put money in the stock market. That's why only rich people can put money there, no poor people, or people who are unable to invest in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.",
