I don't believe in TA, not even in FA: with the tools we have at the moment, pretending to know what the price will be tomorrow based on all these data is a bit childish IMO, in a market where so many random events and news affect the price so easily. All these predictions are more pseudoscience to me.But, while hodling might be the best investment strategy in the mid/long term (who knows, I don't have a crystal ball either), it is true that playing (betting) a little bit with orders intra-day can be motivating for newcomers who want to learn about different cryptos and concepts like sell walls, stop losses etc. in a more practical way.So, like with gambling, I would recommend to trade responsibly, being aware that the chances to make some money this way are lower than he could've expected at first glance, and just as a way to have some fun, not make a career out of it.",

      "body": "The good (and I suppose also bad) thing about trading cryptocurrencies is that you can enter the market so easily and with so little amount of money. For example a lot of altcoin exchanges have a small 20k satoshi trading limit and there have been some with smaller 1000 satoshi trading limit!That means anybody who wants to learn and become a professional in trading can start very easily and with the least amount of money at risk. But at the same time people tend to get cocky when they make a couple of good \"bets\" specially during the bull seasons like 2017 when anything chosen blindly would have given you profit. That can lead to increasing the investment at the time when the losses are kicking in like 2018 till today where altcoins have been dumping.Bottom line is that in my opinion if you want to make an investment just buy bitcoin (using DCA) and avoid everything else and if you want to trade, altcoin market is good for short term profits but make sure to start slow and don't suddenly go big.As for the percentage of income, there is no rule that fits everyone. It depends on how much money you can spare and how much risk you want to take.",

Quote from: Ruttoshi on August 16, 2023, 09:53:15 AMSo many newbies have the wrong orientation on bitcoin and they think that it is a get rich quick scheme,which makes them rush into investing and after investing,what comes to their mind next is trading. Trading should be the last thing on  your mind as a newbie here,what matters is after buying your bitcoin is to learn on how you can keep your bitcoin safe and how you can also add to your bitcoin by using the DCA method or how to take advantage of the market when bitcoin price dips. The best way a newbie can make profit from bitcoin is when he holds his bitcoin for a very long time and the profits will come by itself and not through trading. A lot of people get the wrong idea about bitcoin, they think because you made profits from it they can just invest make money from it too fast. The annoying part is that they don’t bother to acquire any form of knowledge about bitcoin they are just blinded with making profit off it as soon as possible. Like you pointed out, holding bitcoin for a long period of time is the best way newbies without knowledge can actually make profit from investing in bitcoin. After investing they should spend their time in learning about other investments they can participate in in order to make money while waiting on their bitcoin investment, they can also spend their time to learn about trading and make sure they have learned alot before they start trading, they should make sure they separate their investment account from their trading account so they don’t end up losing their investment.

Don't see bitcoin trading as job that you can use to earn a living because you will get disappointed after a great loss,or something that you can use to earn high profit within a short period of time because that is not how it works.Taking a trading course is the best thing to do as a newbie and it takes several months in order to understand it because it’s a very risky thing that can make you lose so much in a few days. Even experts are always cautious while trading that’s why it is advised for a newbie to avoid trading in their early crypto days. Even with all this being said some newbies may still neglect all the advice and proceed to trading without having any knowledge about it that’s why sometimes the only advice i have for them is that experience is the best teacher.",

But I would like to say that before a newbie buys his first bitcoin he should first of all try to know about wallet security and how to keep his Bitcoin safe before buying. It would be wrong to buy Bitcoin first then be looking for how to keep it safe because the person might end up losing it or keep it poorly secured.Just like every other skills, trading should be learnt and mastered. A newbie should learn the fundamentals of trading first, test his trading skill by opening a demo account and when he feels he has learnt enough, he can start trading with Bitcoin. I think it's unwise for anyone to quit his job because of trading, one can still combine trading and another job or business.",

To know more about popular demo trading platforms you can visit here: https://learn.bybit.com/crypto/best-crypto-demo-trading-accountAnyway some will think demo trading is worthless but to be true it's a better way to gather your experience and control your emotions on trading. Beside this you should focus on technical analysis and fundamental analysis. For technical analysis like chart or pattern newbies should visit https://tradingview.com for better analysis. Here you will find others opinion or analysis too and learn from their research too.So not only newbies but anyone can start crypto trading when he have these :  Knowledge about technical and fundamental analysis.
