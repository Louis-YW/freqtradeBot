For example these days we have the recession that has been keeping the price down then on top of that because a lot of countries like US are increasing interest rates, that sucks all the money out of all other markets like bitcoin into US bonds and stuff like that hence preventing bitcoin rise.In the upcoming halving we have the interest rate stagnation where they can't increase it any more or if they do, it won't have the desired effect. That means we have two reasons for big rises that won't stop that easily like previous halving rallies.On top of that as the inflation in US rises with interest games failing, it would act as another fuel for the bitcoin rocket to the moon...",

The halving determines it and there are other factors that are also responsible for it. Historically after every halving we have seen the bull run, which runs for a period of a year, and then the bear market starts. When the last bull run happened it was the institutional investors who were purchasing Bitcoin. They are known as diamond hands and those who were selling cannot be called weak hands as they were making a profit. Weak hands become active more when the market is in the bear cycle or if the volatility increases.",

So everything is for profit and everything because of profit, buy cheap, sell expensive and repeat it as many times as possible? It looks good in theory, but in practice it obviously doesn't work that simple, otherwise the world would be full of ordinary people who would get rich in a fairly simple way.Even if we take into account that most people invest in BTC only to make a profit, the fact is that most people wait for the bull run to start and only then buy. If you are already there just for profit, then learn how to detect the bottom and then buy as much as you can. DCA is not a bad method for those who do not have savings and have to buy in smaller amounts, but I would say that the real deal was done by those who bought under $20k.",

With or without the expectation of a bull run or Bitcoin halving, everyone who is serious about investing in Bitcoin needs to have done more research about the Bitcoin market and the price movements both in the bear market and the bull run markets. Any investor who has basic knowledge about the bitcoin market and blockchain technology will always make good decisions that he or she will not regret.QuoteAnother thing that everyone of us must also avoid is greediness which can lead to the lost of all gains.

The most important thing is to prepare yourself for the arrival of the bull run.Many people hope to see a bull run but forget to prepare for it and don't invest while the bearish market is still around. They say that the market is still bleeding and will continue like this so they just wait and not invest in anything until the market finally starts to increase slowly and immediately flies high. Those who are left behind cannot feel the bullish conditions in the market because they don't buy anything when there is still a bearish market.So you can hope that a bullish market is near so that you have also prepared to welcome its arrival.

Because if you look at history, the trends that occur are usually like that. But even so, every bitcoin investor does not know when a bull market will occur. So this is still a big question mark that every bitcoin investor has been waiting for. Therefore, we just need to wait together until the bullish market arrives.Quote from: Forever101 on September 20, 2023, 08:49:25 PMAnother thing that everyone of us must also avoid is greediness which can lead to the lost of all gains. Strategic selling is required to avoid selling too early or too late.Having a sense of greed in bitcoin investment will indeed be very dangerous, especially when facing a bullish market. Because when a bullish market occurs, every investor's mentality will definitely be shaken a bit. Like being afraid of missing out on selling when the bitcoin price is really high, or having thoughts of wanting to sell bitcoin at a higher price. Therefore, careful thinking and definite goals are needed here. So basically we have to have a goal regarding what market price we will sell bitcoin at. Because if we don't have a goal or plan like that, afraid we will get carried away and hesitate when selling our bitcoins. Therefore, from now on, we must be able to determine at what price we will sell the bitcoins we have. Because to greed and impatience, this inevitably arises because do not have a clear goal regarding the goal of selling bitcoin at what price. So basically our thinking will be divided into two, between selling it at a fairly high bitcoin price or waiting until the bitcoin price rises even higher. And feelings of doubt like that, in my personal opinion, will have a negative impact on bitcoin investment.",

Yes, it cannot be denied that the Bullrun era is highly anticipated, I'm sure, by almost all crypto players. I personally do too. Expecting profits that are many times greater than what we have held and been waiting for for several years is normal. Moreover, the positive trend that always develops during a bullrun will certainly have an extraordinary impact on the crypto market.However, we cannot predict the bullrun era 100% when it will start and end. Therefore, there must still be good management to take profits from the coins we invest in. It's necessary to have high hopes, but you have to stay tuned and see how the market develops. Because it could happen that the market suddenly collapses as quickly as before until we are too late to take profits. This will really make us feel regretful and depressed. Therefore, we have to be smart and wise in managing our targets when taking profits.",
