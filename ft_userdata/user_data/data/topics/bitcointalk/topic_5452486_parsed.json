I could be wrong but do you have a business and accept Bitcoin as a payment method.

I believe it will be handled, though it might take some time to normalize. My advice to you is that if you feel you are spending so much having to cover fees for customers and also that they are not willing to cover the transaction fee themselves, you can yet take a pause, and when the fee is normal, you can start accepting again.From what tranthidung said, I think you should create those thread and announce it there.",

Is there a need to stop accepting Bitcoin though? Why don't you just give a notice that paying with Bitcoin is not recommended right now? Even if you are running your own payment node I don't think the cost is that high (CMIIW). Unless you don't accept other payment options, I don't think you need to stop it. What kind of business payment are you doing with your BTC? Is it swapping to fiat? If that's the case, you can probably pause that and accept the volatility risk and wait until the fee stabilizes to liquidate your money.",

Op the transaction fee of bitcoin has come down so your business customers can continue the payment method of bitcoin. The fee price as for now is 0.00002963. the only bad news right now the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin price right now is $26,400. You giving discount for bitcoin payment can't spread the news of bitcoin but can only give the news of your business. With the transaction fees in bitcoin, you can't give discount on bitcoin payment but you can give a bonus. Your bitcoin acceptance business is not clear to me. The thread is looking for another thing here.",

The network can be congested a few weeks or months and if you fall into such periods, mempools will only get cleared a little bit but still likely congestedI'm with you on this, I've taken my time to study the wide saying that the Mempool is less congested during the weekends, and by virtue of that, lower fees are awaiting transactions. In reality, this is constructively true, but practically, it's not always so. What I observed is that the Mempool always follows the condition it gathered during the week-long towards the weekend, and if the condition is bad or affecting, there is no miracle it would do.In case everything is normal where no factors affect the Mempool aside from normal transactions, then the weekend will get fewer activities that could lower the fees.",

Even if there are a few places that accept bitcoin as currency, with the commissions you have to pay, proportionally higher the lower the amount, it is not going to be worth it. The same thing happens with gold today.I also don’t see the need as it is now to accept payment in bitcoin for small transactions if it is not a cross border transaction. The little transactions can be done in fiat currency and if OP needs to save them in bitcoin then he can just convert them to bitcoin after accumulating them either weekly or monthly. The transaction fee won’t actually favour a smaller payment at anytime.

The weekend and night transactions been easier with the less mempool les congested was before this saga, I also did a midnight transaction and a 36sat/vbyte was confirmed. But my thinking is since everyone is trying to move their transactions to the weekend with same hope of it been less congested wouldn’t it result to congestion of the mempool. Even last weekend the mempool wasn’t that less congested.",

I understand how it feels mate that your expectations in regards to bitcoin payment was cut short but that should not be a thing of concern to you. Putting an end to bitcoin payment on your business isn't a cool one you know because customers are already aware of the happenings. You are indirectly telling them that you do not deem it fit for payment irrespective of the ordinals attack. There is a better way of doing such rather than coming up with that direct actions.It is optional interns of payment for goods and services. If any customer of yours  can afford to pay with bitcoin including the fees that's no problem and if they insist you have no option than letting them pay as to making sure you satisfy your customer and that alone Will make them come back with more customers in refference to buy more. This is business and as such should be treated as business. Do not stop any payment process for your customers let them make their choice in payment  option.",

Many have already been told about Lightning Network above.I can suggest one way that you will not like. In fact, you can let your clients know that they can charge low fees to save them from overspending. But the side effect will be that the confirmation of transactions will be very long now.
