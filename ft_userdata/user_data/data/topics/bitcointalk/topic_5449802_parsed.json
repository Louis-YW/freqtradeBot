Whoever is afraid, whether it is from a platform or from members, use any mixing service that will ensure that your identity is well disappeared without problems with most exchanges.Some good mixing services that have active signature campaigns:https://[banned mixer]/enhttps://sinbad.io/http://whirlwind.money/Quote from: Nwada001 on April 22, 2023, 05:03:21 PMIn instances where you send your coin over to a mixer platform, those coins are sent after their percentage (fee) is deducted.

This is the mixing way that ChipMixer used and it does not work now, but CM has been sized by government agencies, and I do not think that there is any mixing service that currently works to provide a private key to withdraw.It is strange that you are promoting a mixing service in your signature and you do not know how it works.

Coinjoin has been the mixing method used by most people that I know that an exchange seized their coins. Or can you point to anyone that its coin was seized after using a centralized mixer? If you want to avoid a coin being tainted, it is better not to send the whole coins to an address, then to another address. Send it in different amount to different addresses up to five different times at different time interval. Like the example below, but making it more complex will make it better.

If you are not doing anything illegal you should not afraid (AFAIK) because if you do catch doing something immoral and illegal then you should worry, and i don't think that you should worry about BTT Community (if you are addressing to BTT) if not then same you should not worry about anyone unless you are complying with the \"Honesty is the best policy\". Plus who is going to know in any community that you have used mixers? i don't know if i can recommend you but i think it's a good opportunity for you to join Whirlwind mixer and shares your honest review with them (for reward). In this way, you will overcome your fear of joining the mixer because many have already used it and had shared their experience.",

Is it not possible that someone is just used to using the services of mixers for the benefits which they offer for just improved privacy and no other suspicious reason? It is not proper to me for people to think that any body found to be using a mixer is involved in suspicious activity, the person may just be mixing his coins just because they want to.",

I just worried for suspicious, because all source from mixer.So, all the coins coming from a particular mixing service ended up on a single address belonging to you, which you further want to send to a centralized exchange Binance. This situation is not great, I would say. First, you should never merge anonymized coins in a single transaction because this way, you are telling everyone observing the blockchain that these mixed UTXOs belong to the same person, which drastically decreases the anonymity set. You instead should be using the coin control feature of your wallet to send these coins one by one, but only to those services that don't require account registration and undergoing procedures of identity verification, never keep track of their users, and offer a different address for each payment. Centralized exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, and others, don't fall into this category and should be avoided at all costs, especially when it comes to spending anonymized coins. They may block your account for any suspicious activity, and they certainly don't want their customers to remain anonymous. Moreover, they may block your account whenever you make a withdrawal directly to a mixing service: again, they want full control over how their customers manage their money. In other words, you should avoid using centralized exchanges if your goal is to keep your financial affairs private.",
