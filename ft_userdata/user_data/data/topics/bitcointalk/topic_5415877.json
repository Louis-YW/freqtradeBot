They will absolutely know your identity (since they will receive it alongside your credit card payment) and will obviously know which bitcoin and addresses belong to you after they send you whatever you have bought. From there, it would be possible for them to track where your bitcoin then moves. The question then becomes whether or not they choose to do that or whether or not they share the information regarding your identity and bitcoin addresses with any third parties, such as blockchain analysis companies or your government.The person you are paying with bitcoin would be highly unlikely to be able to figure out your identity based only on the above transaction, though.There are two things you can do here to protect your privacy further and break the chain between your identity and your final payment. The first would be to buy bitcoin completely anonymously. This would usually mean over a peer-to-peer network such as Bisq or LocalCryptos, and paying with a non-traceable method such as cash or gift cards. From there, there is no link between your real identity and your bitcoin. The other option is to break the link between the transaction where you buy bitcoin with your credit card and any future transactions. This would be achieved by passing your bitcoin through a mixer or a coinjoin, meaning the bitcoin you end up with are in no way linked to the bitcoin you started with (which are linked to your identity via your credit card transaction). In this second case the company you bought bitcoin from would still know you bought bitcoin, but they would no longer be able to see where that bitcoin went or who you sent it to.",

If yes, then the above suggestion bisq and LocalCryptos are good options but the medium of paying also has to be private.There are other centralized and P2P platforms which promise to not disclose your information. But, whatever personal details you've shared with a 2nd party should be considered compromised, as they can be hacked and stolen, or the government through a court order forces them to reveal it.Even if they promise not to keep logs, you should still not trust them entirely.",

This is not anonymity (as they know who you are), and your privacy should never involve trust.Do you want to prevent companies from sharing your information with third party and authorities? the only way to be sure is to never give your personal data to them. Companies are forced by legislation and authorities to share your personal data with them, so you cannot trust them.My suggestion is that you buy bitcoin from anonymous sources (as suggested by o_e_l_e_o) if you want to be anonymous.But remember that sometimes it might be interesting to buy bitcoin in an exchange and complete the full KYC. Because it is safer to use an exchange for large amounts, and it is also good to put some bitcoin in your income tax reports if you have a lot of money invested in bitcoin.",

The most reliable way to do this is to trade peer-to-peer, as I said above. My preferred peer-to-peer platform is Bisq, but you can find others here: https://kycnot.me/Any centralized exchange, even those which say you can trade without completing KYC or otherwise handing over personal information, should be avoided. They can still gather and share information on you such as your IP address and wallet addresses, and they can simply lock your account and your coins and demand that you complete KYC.If you want to buy via credit card, then you will have to obfuscate your bitcoin after you have bought them if you want to de-link them from your identity. I would suggest either using ChipMixer to mix your coins, or JoinMarket to coinjoin them. The outcome of both techniques is essentially that you receive different bitcoin that are not traceable to your original bitcoin.",

Of course, in that case we should consider that we are very likely being recorded by surveillance cameras, but at least today it is easy to protect our privacy with a hat on our head and a mask on our face. @o_e_l_e_o, I'm just interested in something when it comes to Bisq and similar platforms when it comes to payment to one of the services/bank accounts after a person sells BTC or wants to buy it. I understand that all the data is saved locally on each client's disk, but do the clients see each other's data when they have a transaction - specifically if I sell Bitcoin and make a payment to my bank account, does the other party see my data?",

Thank you! <3When you say that you are buying Bitcoin with credit card theb definitely it is from an exchange so yes the exchanges may have your credit card details since you are using the regulated exchanges and if I am not wrong even exchange with no mandatory KYC requires KYC for credit card purchases so the anonymity decreases whenever you use the fiat to purchase bitcoin unless its from decentralized p2p mode payment.",

This would be the same with other means of exchange.In this scenario, your data would not be fully exposed, but only enough for the other party to be able to make a transaction, and you confirm on receipt of the funds.It's advisable to use a privacy-centered means of accepting fiat payment, to avoid disclosing personal details",

I understand that all the data is saved locally on each client's disk, but do the clients see each other's data when they have a transaction - specifically if I sell Bitcoin and make a payment to my bank account, does the other party see my data?This depends entirely on the method of transferring fiat you use and specifics of this method or your country's banking system. Bisq never handles anything to do with the fiat trade, so has no record of names, account numbers, or other details which could be used to identify you. So any information you do or do not share is done entirely via the fiat trading method you choose. As far as I am aware, if you make a wire transfer or bank transfer to another person then in most countries it will show at least a name and usually an account number to the other party. I think most online payment systems such as PayPal or Cash App also show at least a name or a phone number.",

Thank you! <3It is likely not possible to achieve total anonymity when paying with bitcoin, but in my opinion, the farther your transactions from the traditional financial system, the better anonymity you get. By traditional I mean transactions with digital currency such as the dollar, euro, and whatnot. Physical cash is an exception to the rule, but it is increasingly being removed from the fiat currency system and barely can be considered a reliable solution anymore, especially if we consider the fact you can't move it across the border anonymously. So, the only option that is left is using bitcoin, but here is the rub - before you can pay someone with bitcoin, you somehow need to obtain it first. How can you obtain bitcoin without touching the traditional financial system? The answer is you need to earn it either via mining or by offering your skills and goods in exchange for a desirable currency. Both these methods don't require providing any personal information, and, if done carefully and correctly, make your bitcoin more anonymous. The rest is straightforward: once you acquire anonymous bitcoin, you can safely pay your counterparty with bitcoin. Please note that, while anonymous bitcoin works fine for online transactions where your payee doesn't see your face, physical contact requires additional measures to protect your identity.",

Physical cash is the most reliable solution of them all (provided you live in a country which is only being subjected to moderate inflation rather than hyperinflation and people actually still want to hold your national fiat currency at all. Or you can easily access USD or some other currency.) It does not matter that you can't move it across borders - that is irrelevant for trading bitcoin peer to peer with others in your local area. Cash provides the only truly anonymous way to interact with the fiat banking system, as well as removing the risk of charge backs or similar disputes being opened which are the biggest risk when trading peer to peer. You can meet your trading party at a bank or an ATM, and either withdraw the fiat there and then or immediately deposit it once it has been handed over to completely eliminate any risks of counterfeit bills.",

Data brokers absolutely have records of IP addresses which are linked to real life identities. This can be via frequently logging in to named accounts via that IP, frequently visiting your own social media pages, being linked to your physical devices and other data from them such as geolocation, simply via data your ISP has shared, and so on. Even you use a VPN, if you use a bad one then your VPN IP address will also be linked to your real identity. Although an exchange might not have access to this, they will definitely be able to sell the pairing of an IP address and a bitcoin address to interested third parties who will be able to de-anonymize you with this information.",
