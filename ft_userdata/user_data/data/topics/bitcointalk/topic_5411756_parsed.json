There are only three guidelines, but you should follow all three.And the joke begins:QuoteGuideline 1: Gamble no more than 1% of household incomeDon't bet more than 1% of your household income before tax per month. For example, someone with a household income of $70,000 before tax should gamble no more than $58 per month.$58 per month LMAO! Okay, IIRC I advised people to bet a maximum of 10% of their income, but 1% is just too low. It won't even last one-hour playing penny slots in most cases. And look at this table:Even if you earn 6 figures, you can only bet <$100, less than @roycilik's weekly budget QuoteGuideline 2: Gamble no more than 4 days per monthWhile I think once a week is reasonable, four days a month is too harsh. I mean, if there are five Saturdays in a month, you still get only four playing sessions. IMO the limit should be twice a week.QuoteGuideline 3: Avoid regularly gambling at more than 2 types of gamesIMO it's useless advice. Even if a gambler plays many types of games, it won't matter as long as he knows the limit, guidelines 1 & 2.What do you think?",

      "body": "I have read some guidelines about the proper ways to gamble before, I am not surprised to see this type of guideline again. I remember when I read the guideline of a football predicting site which was soccervista, if I recall correctly, exactly to only gamble with 1% of your income  is included there too. It was too low for me, I became an addict but finally realized that the saying is true, it would help you have good gambling habit.But this would depend from individual to individual, I use 5% of my income to gamble, it can not be more, but there are sometimes I found myself not using more than 2%, this is because of good gambling habit that helps in making profit while gambling and I make profit than loss, unlike before. I prefer to bet on football matches, just ones in a week, and mainly on top leagues like EPL, La Liga Santander, Seria A, Bundesliga and Lique 1. They do play from Fridays to Monday and I am not betting more than 1 or 2 times weekly. Only what could make me bet more is during Champions League, and not often more because if I bet on Champions League, there is probability of the top clubs not to have matches, but I could go for lower matches at that times if I am really not busy.In my opinion, these are all good advices, if you know you can increased your betting amount percentage of your total income and if convenient for you, you can increase it, but using small amount makes it fun and entertaining. Gambling not more than 4 times monthly makes it convenient and give you a good gambling habit, this can be weekend when having fun around friends like in the bar while watching the live match that you bet on, or it can just be a casino while having the fun and not going beyond your limit. A good gambling guideline would also include avoiding regular gambling. You should fill your life not only with gambling but other things that can be recreation for yourself. Gambling is good if these guidelines are followed, and it is the exact opposite of gambling addiction.",

It won't even last one-hour playing penny slots in most cases.It seems absurd to you, but from the point of view of the one who gives these tips, everything is logical: playing for a small amount of money, a person will not attach importance to this and this will help to avoid addiction.Quote from: mu_enrico on August 30, 2022, 05:04:57 PMQuoteGuideline 2: Gamble no more than 4 days per monthWhile I think once a week is reasonable, four days a month is too harsh.

If you devote time to your wife, children, work, household chores, then 2 days a week for gambling is a lot.

      "body": "The guidelines are good on a broader sense when you think of it, but their detailed strategy on how to honor the guidelines like gambling with just 1% per month and just 4 times in a month seems unachievable to me. Say for instance, using same example of someone with a household income of $70k and supposed to use $58 which is 1% of it in a month to gamble say the 4 times or even lesser, It means the person will still have to further split the $58 into the number of times he is to gamble that month, gambling with such an amount seems like a joke.IMO, the summary of the guidelines to lower-risk gambling are;-Gamble with a fixed percent of your household income, an amount you can afford to loose.-Choose the number of times you will gamble in a month and be disciplined about it.",

But you can have family and still bet on your mobile phone or personal computer even without your wife and children knowing. It depends on how and where you are gambling.Even if you are not married, gambling in just 4 times monthly will be good, provided if you gamble with the amount you can lose and not think about or lead to depression, I mean the amount of money that is low to the extent that you can afford to lose it.",

They may not necessarily be the solution to a gambling addiction, but with known facts, it is little decisions that add up eventually. This is also the reason why only an estimated amount of income, schedule, preference is suitable, but up to a restricted amount, so as to control the urge which leads to excessive gambling.These guidelines could however be tweaked to suit ones taste, as I do on days as a London Derby, an El classico, Champions League Finals, and on other boxing and history making matches/bettings that happen only once. It will be difficult to control the urge to visit gambling sites on ones phone, seeing the ease at which smart devices with these apps either pre-installed or downloadable exists. Twice a week, 1% income, only 2 kinds of games to bet on, is a schedule I can keep.",

I think the main logic there is tightening the budget for your bankroll and that's the good that I can get from it. Although it will still depend on me and I have no metrics that I'm basing from my salary per month or per year. So it's like having a spare money at that very moment and it will be the one that I'll use as my bankroll.",

Are you suggesting spending 10% (half the mortgage payment) on gambling and considering it \"innocent entertainment that has nothing to do with addiction\"? I think that for ordinary people for whom gambling is entertainment along with many others and not a hardcore hobby, such spending is too much.",
