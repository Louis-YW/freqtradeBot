Sportsbet.io's FIFA World Cup 22 Prediction Pool Discussion thread4. FIFA World Cup 2022 Discussion Thread5. ⚽ FIFA World Cup 2022: Tournament Discussion Thread for Qatar 2022The thread by hilariousandco is different as it's for a pool but if we look at all other threads, all of them are almost the same though I wasn't lucky to check the last one as OP is in my ignore list.Are all these threads necessary? Are they really different from others? I guess having one thread would be great to reduce spam; though the board is full of spam.",

Everyone can concentrate on one thread for discussing the World Cup, but for thread like thread owned by hilariousandco, it can be excluded.But will that solve the problem? No, there are always problems especially regarding spam.",

It made me feel really guilty actually tbh!So I locked my old threads. Made new ones, self-moderated, actively deleted the spam on my new threads... obviously post farmers didn't like this and so they post on the non-self-moderated ones. Some users complained (haha) but you know what? I actually wrote to all the posters whose posts I deleted and offered explanations and support. Want to guess how many even responded? Spoiler: almost none. So, you know what, I don't lose sleep over them anymore.Anyone can be the judge, but I am pretty confident the self-moderated ones are of better quality than the non-moderated ones, and I'm absolutely okay if the ones I created seem less active, they no longer are a source for megaspam. 2 or 3 contributive, constructive, thoughtful posts from genuine users are better than 10 rehash posts from post farmers.",

It's mess to allow making 10 topics about same subject. Perfectly, I think that only one topic per competition should be allowed. If not to be so strict, there can be one common topic and one self-moderated topic. All other topics should be locked.

I stopped from posting in main megathreads for these leagues because it's pointless thing. Nobody won't read your post there and very soon it will go to previous page without getting any attention.
