It facilitates the use of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and distributed applications (DApps).Hedera's decentralized economy is powered by HBAR, the native and energy-efficient cryptocurrency.Hedera has a maximum supply of 50,000,000,000 HBAR while its circulating supply is 21,084,776,584 HBAR as per CoinMarketCap. Hedera (HBAR) can be traded on top cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, Huobi Global, Kucoin, Bittrex, Crypto.com, etc. HEDERA (HBAR) Price Prediction 2022 During the past few weeks, Hedera coin (HBAR) price ranged between $0.112 at the resistance2 level and $0.081 at the resistance1 level, and then touched the $0.055 support1 level. Irrespective of this sideways movement in the price of HBAR, we can deduce the following:1. Based on the previous price history, Hedera coin (HBAR) is expected to reverse at the $0.081 resistance1 level. HBAR could rise if investors have their way, reaching the $0.112 resistance2 level before reversing, due to the formation of a triple top. 2. A reversal at the resistance 1 level could result in further declines in price of HBAR upto the support1 level at $0.055 until a triple bottom is formed. This could lead to a bullish reversal.We anticipate a bullish long-term HBAR coin price prediction for 2022. We can expect HBAR to reach $0.3 this year.",
