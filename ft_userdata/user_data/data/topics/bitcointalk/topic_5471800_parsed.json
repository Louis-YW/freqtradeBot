      "body": "No need to be too technical and complex about what the benefits of Bitcoin's current increase are, certainly those who buy at prices below $20k will get more benefits that's all. But about Bitcoin being used as a payment method in many industries it does not depend on how high the Bitcoin increase is But it depends on how government regulations allow the adoption of Bitcoin in its territory. There will be no adoption if there are no official rules from the government.Remember that governments will not give full regulation when they only give commodity regulation. In countries like El Salvador that have fully adopted Bitcoin, there are many considerations that are made.They are doing business with Bitcoin and they are making a profit. But how does adoption work? It's a completely different set of regulations and not just because of the rise of Bitcoin.",

And having profit is having additional money that can be used in any kind of activity that is beneficial to the holders. Its either to reinvest, invest new things, new business, or any personal agendas. I don't think increasing bitcoin price can lead to more industry to use it as payment method. Remember it increases to 60k yet people and businesses does not mind at all, but only focus on their personal/company investments.",

Second, the rise in Bitcoin's value can position it as a substantial asset, which does increase the path for its broader adoption as a payment method. However, you got me lost! When talking about \"user-friendly\". An increase in Bitcoin price has nothing to do with being user-friendly.",

Since there is lots of good news going on, there's no reason for it to decrease its price. the only people who are badly affected by this event are those who are hostile against Bitcoin because no matter what propaganda they spread among the people, the fact that they are not making any progress really hurts them because no matter what they do, people still invest and buy some more bitcoins to hold for long term.",

That is at the top of the heap. Next, with the increase just like what we are experiencing right now, the mainstream media will take notice and so Bitcoin becomes more popular and possibly more and more will be buying their BTC from the many centralized exchanges we have around.",

All these have a potential benefits and positive contribution on our society, Let me have your opinion on how Bitcoin increase benefits you .True, it was design to be a payment system, but you have to understand that it has evolved as well. It all started with Mt. Gox, when we have trading exchanges, and so it become an asset. You can still used bitcoin as design though, as it is still borderless and most likely the industry of remittances could be one of those who benefited from it.As far as the price goes, since it become an asset already, so the old adage still applies, \"buy low, sell high\", and that's how we make profits. Or just simply accumulating it overtime and become a holder and then sell it during the bull run (which is to be expected in 2024-2025).",

More precisely, this will attract more investors or individuals and even institutions to use Bitcoin as a safe haven investment medium or to protect the value of assets such as gold. Perhaps most of the benefits of Bitcoin are investments, but it does not rule out the possibility that BTC can be a fast and cheap means of payment.",

Remeber all those dead altcoins which basically lost value and miners disappeared and the network stalled? Also when crypto has more money entering it creates more jobs in the field and can make it better overall. When crypto is in a bear market nobody is hiring. Exchanges are laying off people left and right. So there are many positives to having bitcoins and cryptos price increase compared to it staying the same or decreasing.",

It has been happening for a long time and when the price of Bitcoin rose, many of us sold our Bitcoin and took the profits. If you use Bitcoin as a long-term investment, you will see how much the value of your investment grows.But if it is for alternative payment methods, it will have to wait for government approval. And if more countries approve Bitcoin as a means of payment, that will provide support for Bitcoin to gain mass adoption in many countries.And before that happens on a large scale, you can invest in Bitcoin for the long term. And the biggest benefit that Bitcoin has provided to society is as a long-term investment.",

The reasons while investors invest during the decrease of bitcoin is because they are waiting for the price of Increase, a short term investors do make a profit if bitcoin price increases and people who invested in altcoins also benefits during the time bitcoin price goes up, because the increment of bitcoin  in the market  arises the altcoins, even altcoins you invested on, that has a potentials, its obvious that increase in bitcoin gives a support to increase in altcoins But the reason while people also invest in altcoins that have a potential is as same as someone who invested in bitcoin when the price is extremely low in the market...so people that invest when the market is been low have a target and I believe that their target is for bitcoin to rise so they will benefit from the increase of bitcoin. Even some people accumulate their bitcoin waiting for the time it will increase in the market so they will make a profit, some rich people who is into cryptocurrency investment turn to a multiple billionaire because of their investment in Bitcoin during when the price of bitcoin is low, and some do take the risk to invest a higher money knowing if the market changes to positive they will make multiple of their capital,  so it's to have a good mindset during bitcoin investment.",

I had to get some more money saved separately for future dumps, which I've successfully did, because at this stage even while we are all waiting for ETF approval it's possible that something bad can hit the market and cause major panic among investors again, it could be intentional or not, but I don't care about that.I believe that those who buy Bitcoin at a cheaper rate will get the best returns over all, so if you want Bitcoint to be beneficial to you it's better to buy at a lower price, now I am only buying with few dollars every week, because the price is a bit high now.The lower the price of Bitcoin the higher the money you must use to buy at first because it's an opportunity that wont last for long, and the higher the value has become you just have to keep using DCA strategy with few bucks.",

It’s obvious that bitcoin price increase will benefit many that have bought it at a lower price. It doesn’t matter if bitcoin main purpose was to serve as an alternative to traditional fiat currency, people have been able to take advantage of the volatile nature of bitcoin and turn it into an investment strategy.
