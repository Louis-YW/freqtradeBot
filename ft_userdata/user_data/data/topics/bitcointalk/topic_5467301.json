Also assuming that the fork happen at block 500000 (this is not correct I am just using it to explain).Any block mined after block 500000, the blockchain B will begin its own chain with its own protocol, although having the old blockchain in its history.",

      "body": "I'll try to simplify the things a bit... Let's take a step back into a simplified version that disregards many of the key aspects of bitcoin....I'm making a payment system between me an my friends, in order to do this, we have an excel-sheet, we each put $100 in a jar and we add 3 records into our excel-sheet: 1  friend1  $100  unspent  initial block reward  2  friend2  $100  unspent  initial block reward  3  friend3  $100  unspent  initial block reward I'm friend1, i now send $50 to friend2... The exelsheet looks like this: 1  friend1  $100  spent  initial block reward  2  friend2  $100  unspent  initial block reward  3  friend3  $100  unspent  initial block reward  4  friend3  $50  unspent  used line 1  5  friend1  $50  unspent  used line 1 Now friend3 uses line4 to send $25 to friend2 1  friend1  $100  spent  initial block reward  2  friend2  $100  unspent  initial block reward  3  friend3  $100  unspent  initial block reward  4  friend3  $50  spent  used line 1  5  friend1  $50  unspent  used line 1  6  friend3  $25  unspent  used line 4  7  friend4  $25  unspent  used line 4 After a while, we decide to implement a hard fork... We come together and say: from now on, we'll no longer use dollars as the payment amount... Starting from line 8, we'll switch to euro's (at an imaginary exchange rate of $1 = €1)... When i now send my $50 to friend2, the ledger will look like this: 1  friend1  $100  spent  initial block reward  2  friend2  $100  unspent  initial block reward  3  friend3  $100  unspent  initial block reward  4  friend3  $50  spent  used line 1  5  friend1  $50  spent  used line 1  6  friend3  $25  unspent  used line 4  7  friend4  $25  unspent  used line 4  8  friend2  €50  unspent  used line 5 However, friend3 does not want to follow our new rule.. He insists every amount has to be entered in dollars... We now have a hard fork: friend1, friend2 and friend3 agree on the first 7 lines... But only friend1 and friend2 agree on the transaction in line 8, friend3 only agrees on the first 7 lines, he rejects line 8 and he'll be able to add his own transaction on line 8, making this a hard fork... We'll continue with 2 versions of our document: one that uses euro from line 8 and higher, and one that has always and will always use dollars...If we kept working in dollars, but we decided to add a new extra worksheet in our excel document keeping track on metadata about our transactions, we could have created a soft fork: the people that wanted to use the extra sheet to add metadata and the people that did not want to use this extra sheet all agree on the rules about the first worksheet, so they can both keep adding their transactions in one document... It's only that some of the friends will use the second worksheet aswell...Offcourse, in the situation with 3 friends putting fiat money into a jar, this seems ridiculous, but in a situation with thousands of anonymous users and coinbase rewards, it does \"work\"... All users agree on the blockchain untill the height of the fork, and at this height, the two blockchains grow apart.Just FYI: this is not exactly how bitcoin works... It's just an (over)simplification about how hard forks and soft forks more or less work when mapped to an \"easyer\" problem.",

That might be a reason for the newbies as well as for older members to ignore them. I also don't really read many, even though I don't read the one under your post. I don't read it because I am here to read your post but If I have to read them intentionally then I would go to a single page where I can find them all. Which FYI is this:https://bitcointalk.org/adrotate.php?adinfoNow coming back to your question, the short answer is NO. After doing a Hard fork, the blockchain splits into two chains. One will become old and the other will become new. But it's not that the old chain will be gone and nothing can be added to it. Both can work simultaneously but there will be a difference of rules.",
