  "content": "I'm looking for a safe way to use Nostr and have the possibility to send and receive tips in sats.Apparently, Alby looks like the most popular solution. I'm currently in a limbo, because I want to download it but I don't trust it enough. The extension asks me permissions to communicate with other apps outside of the browser, which certainly seems not something a guy with Bitcoin Core on the same machine should do. Moreover, it seems that Alby developers have not been verified yet.Is anyone aware of the risks of this extension, or has pursued studies on its reliability and excluded the possibility of scams?",

To keep any amount of funds in a hot wallet is not a good idea, especially one on a machine that you are using for other things online.-Dave",

Does this mean \"I'm asking for trouble\"? To what extent?Generally, you should never need a browser extension to talk to your Bitcoin node, through RPC or anything. Why don't you simply run a client such as c-lightning or LND alongside your node?Quote from: HandcraftedBreads on March 01, 2023, 06:26:05 PMAlso, can bitcoin core run and work as a hot wallet in a machine that is not connected to the internet?No, unless you utilize PSBTs, which Core supports well.",

I suppose the best case would be to use a separate machine (online) with only bitcoin core.What do you think is the best solution for one-machine-only Joe?",

I think I misinterpreted it.No I mean you get a separate hardware wallet and connect it to core.Handy video for Cold Card: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc_TxlByxeYThere are a bunch of options out there for hardware wallets that was just the only video I had a link saved for.Figure out which HW wallet works for you.Different features appeal to different people.
