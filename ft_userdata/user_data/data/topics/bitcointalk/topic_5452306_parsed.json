You risk losing your coins will increase, so it is better to create a new wallet.dat, and send transactions to it.If you are concerned about your privacy, use one of the mixing services.",

      "body": "Rather than extract individual private keys as the posters above have suggested, the best thing to do is to recover your wallet via the seed phrase in some software such as Electrum or Ian Coleman, extract the master private key at your chosen derivation path, and then import that using a descriptor to Bitcoin Core in order to recreate the entire wallet.",
