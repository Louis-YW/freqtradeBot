Those who attend these events feel included in the community and their recognition will increase. We see some users who don't normally attract attention, thanks to these activities. Some users may try to manipulate this but overall this group is too small to matter when there are so many merits to distribute.

It's still a long way to go to a higher Rank.It's good that the OP created a very handy list. I am more than sure that in addition to the ones I have listed below, two or three more accounts are part of this farm. In addition, there is another account that has a high rank but is not the real owner.It was not me who discovered the wall with the same background, but someone who is apparently afraid to speak from his main account. And I think today he is with us . But the fact that the behavior of some accounts seems suspicious is true. I can tell that this farm betrays itself with its consistent behavior, which seems to be expected, and in the end, everyone who tries to be too cunning here will be exposed.

      "body": "Art contests or similar ones are for fun and people are more easily to drop merit on art works which are attractive, beautiful in their point of view. I don't say it is good or bad because if Art contest participants actually did those things, they spent time to think creatively (if not cheating) and create those stuffs so merit is well worthy for their creativeness and effort they put in.However, as said it is easily to be abused by abusers. I did not observe the Pumpkin contest too closely but I believe merit distributions to artists won't be much different than the 10th anniversary contest. Difference if there is, only comes from lack of participation and merit distribution from theymos.Top-100 merited-artists in the 10th anniversary art contest",
