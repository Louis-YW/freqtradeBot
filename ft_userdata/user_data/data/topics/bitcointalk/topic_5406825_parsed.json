I suggest you open a new topic in Scam Accusations and present all the facts, a screenshot of your conversation, tx link, etc... So you will help other members to recognize scammers, of course, if there was no intention to defraud, that will push him to give some answers.I don't know what amount it is, but my recommendation is that you always use the escrow service when you trade with unknown people.",

Also if it is proven that he was unavailable for justified reasons, even potential red tags will be removed.No one wants to destroy someone's reputation, but we have already seen various reasons why a scam happened. Even from members with a much stronger reputation.",

You need to be careful with them, or you tell us what really happen so that we will not be skeptical dealing with them in the future.",

If you want to attract the best hands for your job keep the payment with an escrow. This is because it will be difficult for unknown individuals to trust each. But the fund can be kept in the custody of a reputable member of the forum and payments will be made after the job description has been fully covered. A well-known reputable member @GazetaBitcoin is offering free escrow service and you can take advantage of it. You can contact him to get more information about using escrow services",
