Did I just hear you said having a mental dilemma in trying to figure out how to spend/use his own money? Did I?... Because please I'm sorry to ask this \"Did he steal the 4 BTC?\" or \" Did he by any chance win the 4 Btc by lottery?\" which one of them.. Because I'm more confident that anyone that could afford to save up to half a Bitcoin or probably one should have a very good reason for what he/she intends to do such money, as it's not an easy task, not to mention a whole 4 btc. Moreover, for a person to have 4 BTC (i.e over $146,000) in Bitcoin investment, such individual is likely to have double of such investment in real life, and as such your friend is in the best possible to make the right choice according to his current financial status.",

It is hard to believe that he just made that much without passing through some hard decisions or making some deliberate efforts to acquire that much. It should be easier for him to take decisions on what next to do with his hard-earned money.Today, 4 Bitcoin is around 130k dollars which is a huge money to either spend or invest. Such money are capable of causing distrust amongst people and so on, so I don't think he would be that close to you to disclose such to you.Again. It is his personal decision to make whether to continue to hold the money or to spend it. Better still, he can invest some and spend others. If I was in the situation to decide on what to do, if I am in dire need of money, I will sell some of the coins for my need and leave the rest, whether Bull Run or not.",

Unless he is a rich man who can buy Bitcoin at any price beforehand.And my advice, because it is still 20 years old, which in my opinion is still very young, it is better to continue holding it and also accumulating it. Because in the future the price of Bitcoin will be much higher and it also has many benefits that will make his life peaceful and calm with his new family.",

He may be given more than that if it really pumps and there is also another possibility if he the price goes up then he can sell them at a good price then.",

Maybe he is lying, which I am unable to understand because if a person earns 4 bitcoins, he doesn't know what to do with them or what the purpose of earning these bitcoins is. It makes me worried that if a person has this kind of ability that he's earning 4 bitcoins, and he doesn't know his way for purpose, it is doubtful. Because, as you see, OP's friend has earned 4 bitcoins but still doesn't know what to do next. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem realistic to me that a guy earns such a large amount of bitcoin at such a young age and doesn't know what to do with it. If he really earned 4 bitcoins despite being so young, then the OP should guide him so that he is not in a mental dilemma but should hold this bitcoin even more. Because Bitcoin halving is also coming, and it will be expected from the Bitcoin price that it might hit 150k, your friends can earn profit by selling this Bitcoin.",

But he should not sell without any investment plan.He doesn't even have to keep stacking bitcoins, there are other investments he can explore if he doesn't want to go all into Bitcoin. He can also steadily take out some from his income to live his life, without liquidating his principal investment.",

Iâ€™m not going to question the authenticity of this story, I believe everyone can put two and two together and come to their own conclusions. So you say your friend is in his early 20s and somehow has 4 bitcoins (approximately $148,765 today) in his possession. Thatâ€™s a lot of money but I think he is way to young to be thinking about retirement. Depending on where he resides and his lifestyle, there is a possibility he could lavish all the money in a few years. My advice would be for him to explore other ways to increase his income, he could start a business or invest in a startup. Heâ€™s already ahead of many of his peers, he should not lose his advantage trying to impress people on instagram.",
