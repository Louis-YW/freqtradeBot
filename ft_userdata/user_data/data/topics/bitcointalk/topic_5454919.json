For sure there will be some movies whom acted by famous actors that will hit the real idea of bitcoin and people will see its meaning. One thing to spread of bitcoin knowledge is through film so i am hoping there would be a high quality movie that will show the world how bitcoin works. This is good if some big actors or actress would play a role for this so viewers would actually watch it.",

These list are so many so it took a long time to gather these information so salute to the OP. I always find a series or movies mentioning Bitcoin so I think it is a good advertisement to Bitcoin as well like the series Euphoria. Since the girl (Kat) want to receive some payment anonymously so her fans used Bitcoin so she took advantage for it without revealing her identity.",

It won't be long we shall see those kind of movies that its story is solely related to Bitcoin. Some series I have see on netflix has those sc nes where BTC was somehow discussed though. The very recent I hve seen was the BEEF series which the main character lost money thru trading and hes pretty much  broke for the rest of it. Not a very fun stuff but a funny movie.The ones above are documentaries related to Bitcoin. The ones that I have watched was the 2nd. The end of money as we know it.  The Ross Ubricht Silk Road documentary was more interesting to me actually. Its also avaliable on youtube afaik.",

I've seen about two or three of them so far, and I think one of them is also available on Netflix. \"Trust No One\" isn't on the list, but it was a good movie. I've also watched \"Banking on Bitcoin\" which is a really interesting film.IMHO, movies related to Bitcoin are really good because they can help people learn about it through these documentaries and maybe even inspire them to start investing in Bitcoin and crypto. It's like promoting Bitcoin and crypto in general through movies which is great because I'm sure many people enjoy watching movies and would like to discover new things each time.",

Perhaps the most fascinating character from this documentary is a trader, whose face and voice are obscured, which brings more mystery to the movie. Among others, this trader also explain how he made his \"first barrel of gold\".",

I doubt that you're really surprised because bitcoin's been around for a decade and I don't think that content creators and filmmakers will pass up on bitcoin as a theme of their documentary or movie. You needn't worry about the distortion of information, there's a lot of smart people out there that can filter out the bad information about bitcoin.They're not movies OP, most of the titles that you've listed are documentaries and they're pretty different from a movie, it's just semantics though so who cares? Right? I recommend watching the Bitcoin Gospel, hard to watch if you are close minded because it talks about the negatives and suspicions that many detractors have pointed out over the years but all in all it's a good documentary. Accidentally watched that documentary while scrolling through my social media account.",

Filmmakers aim to take advantage of dramas, scandals, or hot events to make movies, and profit is what they aim for.
