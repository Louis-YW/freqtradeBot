  "content": "Hello,I would be very pleased if anyone can help me to find out if my broker is fooling me or he is honest. He was sending to me my withdrawal which should be a few $xK but I received just $50. He is claiming that the rest is cought in the 'wire' but the transaction was confirmed. Is it possible to accelerate it somehow.Thanky you!Transaction hash:                         554491c4960fed3cde81237c192f36c18ad6d5144c260c9886b6ff91d259295cExecuted:                                      23.02.2023    07:40 a.m.  - Brussels timeBrokers message:Dear xx,The fluctuation of the price of bitcoin has caused the withdrawals to be unstable, withdrawals Gateway was only able to dispense one payment of 50USD  to your bitcoin wallet, therefore before the full deposit transfer can be done fee (HTC) may be needed before the transaction can start on.This fee is required to be paid found by HIGH TRAFFIC LOAD due to busy network at the core of bitcoin, this fee of $ xx USD to continue confirmation can not be by pass, this fee must be deposited as soon as possible and your funds will be transferred completely in 30 seconds..  FUNDS DEPOSITED OF $xxx WILL BE  INCLUDED IN YOUR WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT  BECAUSE IT IS AN HTC CLEARANCE FEE AND  NO SECOND PARTY SHALL BE INVOLVED  (NO LOSS OF FUNDS).  PAYMENT DETAILS  WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT: $xxx USD  AMOUNT SENT: 50.00 USD  AMOUNT OUTSTANDING: USD $xxx  RECIPIENT'S BC PORTFOLIO ADDRESS: BLOCKED  HTC FEE REQUIRED: $xxx",

      "body": "Just look at your transaction. It's public, any block explorer can show it. One example is:https://mempool.space/tx/554491c4960fed3cde81237c192f36c18ad6d5144c260c9886b6ff91d259295cLook up for your address and you'll see what you've received. You'll see also that many other addresses have received coins. And the transaction has plenty of confirmations.So all that was sent was processed. Nothings \"caught in the wire\" or anything. And since it's confirmed there's nothing to accelerate.Conclusion: if anything is missing and the transaction on the block explorer shows for your address exactly what you've received, then it's the sender who didn't send the coins.Quote from: Lojze on February 27, 2023, 09:46:29 PMDear xx,The fluctuation of the price of bitcoin has caused the withdrawals to be unstable, withdrawals Gateway was only able to dispense one payment of 50USD  to your bitcoin wallet, therefore before the full deposit transfer can be done fee (HTC) may be needed before the transaction can start on.This fee is required to be paid found by HIGH TRAFFIC LOAD due to busy network at the core of bitcoin, this fee of $ xx USD to continue confirmation can not be by pass, this fee must be deposited as soon as possible and your funds will be transferred completely in 30 seconds..This is utter bullshit. If they would be honest they1. could have been sending all the money in the transaction already sent.2. could send the rest of the money paying maybe 1-2$ fee from those thousands you supposedly have there.But actually they use some oddly complicated words for a non-existing problem to fool you deposit more.This is how I see it. You can way for others' opinions too though.",

      "body": "Does it looks like a scam would you mind to share what the wallet address that you share with your broker?The transaction from that hash is already confirmed so you don't need to accelerate them and the current network is not congested, unlike yesterday.The way how he talks is the same as other scammers on telegram.Have you recently sent them for a fee?Be careful it is a scam attempt.",

Do not trust who sent you this and if you can I would withdraw the money but I guess judging by this message you have lost the initial Bitcoin you deposited. Can I ask which service this is?",
