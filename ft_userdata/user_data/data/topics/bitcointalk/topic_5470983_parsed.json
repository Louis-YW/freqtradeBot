You must be wondering what kind of jobs are they ?, They are...Cryptocurrency (Trading)Forex TradingContent Creation (blogging, video,etc)AnimationsProgrammingAs I see your post, I just remember this post wey I write before, e talk about how our Nija youth no longer dey wait for we government make person no go quench. This wan na truth. If we check now, all these online jobs dey pay more than even some government workers dey earn monthly and even yearly. Take for instance, our legendary members for here and equally other ranks dey earn cool cash just to dey active and discuss. And every week, you go receive better payment. If you calculate full member money guy, 160k per month, we never even talk of legendary members . With all these ones, we go notice say Bitcoin and other online opportunities don try for our body Wella. The thing na to find where you good put and gasp the opportunity. Our government no longer care, them no even get us for mind. Somepeople here for Bitcointalk dey use this money take feed their family, school and survive, some fit don even use am build self . Well for every thing we give God thanks.",

People need to think critically on what they can do to make money,  no matter how bad the economy is people are still making money and becoming rich every day without bitcoin.  Their is no doubt about bitcoin having much opportunity, depending on it so much for someone who does not have any other way of income is bad.during the covid 19 period when things was very hard some people were still making good money and became rich that time, even in this hard economy that people are complaining of the bad government and the hard economy some people are still doing well from nothing to something big.",

Some Invested in bitcoin but lack the understanding of what are their expectations after investment.2. Some dislike bitcoin naturally because they think it's a digital means of scamming others because of their past experience with online scams.3. Others took their bold step in taking another risk to trust bitcoin and Invested over years, they are now somewhere probably rejoicing over their first decision on taking a risk with an alternative digital currency which is bitcoin.Irrespective of whom we are, we still belong to either of these three categories, our determination for taking risk has more advantage if we are taking in consideration bitcoin and not other cryptocurrencies at first place, it may take time but we will surely get there.",
