We weighed up all the options, attempted various alternative solutions to keep the LocalCryptos vision alive, but in the end we made the decision to gradually end our servicesWhat could it be other than their main selling points e.g. no kyc, encrypted messages, etc.? which means if they were to introduce KYC/AML polices in their platform, it'd become the shell of its former self.",

I agree with the above, and suspect that external regulations are probably the main culprit here. But that is exactly the reason we need peer to peer exchanges in the first place!I'd be hopeful some of the team would take their expertise across to other similar platforms and continue to help grow the peer to peer ecosystem. A small part of me wonders if this is because many of the team members are doxxed as LocalEthereum was not set up privately in the first place. Perhaps they will all launch a new platform or join other platforms, but anonymously.Quote from: Potato Chips on October 23, 2022, 04:12:31 AMwhich means if they were to introduce KYC/AML polices in their platform, it'd become the shell of its former self.Yes. As much as I am disappointed to see them close, shutting down entirely is a preferable option to going the LocalBitcoins route and becoming yet another centralized exchange demanding KYC and spying on their users.",

But it is still of concern that the government can force no-KYC exchange to demand for KYC from all their customers, but this may not be the main reason. Whatever the main reason could be, many people will miss the exchange, even I will miss the fact that I do recommend the exchange among the few no-KYC exchanges that are existing because such exchanges are not many but very few. Also maybe they would come back as they imply of possible comeback, but in a way in may or may not be possible.",

While they claim success for the past 5 years (only 3 years as LocalCryptos, if I'm not mistaken), the past bearish months must have taken a heavy toll on their operation. Of course, as others have also felt, LocalCryptos must have also been facing a good amount of regulatory pressure. But I'm honestly wondering whether all these reasons provided are enough to willingly put an end to what's certainly a good cause. But if it's the health of the few individuals behind the operation, it's indeed a good reason. I'm now wondering whether those so-called Bitcoin and decentralization advocates who are rich and willing to shell out hundreds of millions to save the likes of Liquid, Voyager, BlockFi, and others, all inferior to LocalCryptos' vision, would also extend the same offer to save a worthy cause. But I certainly understand if the small team behind LocalCryptos would courteously refuse.",
