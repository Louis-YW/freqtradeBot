The Bitcoin tourists are those speculators that hang around Bitcoin, when the price are high. A lot of those people left the market, because a 70% dip in the price...signaled to them that Bitcoin is failing.  The long-term Bitcoin enthusiasts know better...and they see the DIP as a trigger to buy more bitcoins. They have seen the Bitcoin price dip like this before and then the recovery period to a new \"all time high\" price.... so they know it is the best time to buy, when the price dip with 70%",

      "body": "@cr1776. Do not make a mockery of them. Agreed that the tourists are those who want to make a quick buck but who ended being the buyers from the sellers who wanted to exit from the market hehehe. However, we should be thankful and also encourage to have more tourists next time because they are those happy buyers during the bubble before the bubble pop. Also, bitcoin cannot pump to a new all time high without tourists.",
