Don't miss the train!After seeing all the links you've shared on this topic, I think it's also not bad to never be a crypto project developer. Building a project is not easy, so if you are not ready for everything, you better never build it guys. See how people here think about your project, some say that the website your project has is a website that can be made by kid, I have to say yes about that too.There's nothing exciting about your project, and if you're asking me to be on a train with you, I'd rather skip that train and wait for it to crash and I'll be the one to see it.",

While they're launching, they're thinking of building their project to defeat the other existing ones. But, they're not focusing on what they can really offer to investors although it's all known that they're just meme coins and there's no use case for most of them.This will keep happening in the future when a new greater project emerges, they'll make new projects and their only focus is to be the \"next\" better project that are existing on that niche of projects, whether meme coins, Ai coins, others, etc.",

These type of projects has really become way to make quick money for the owners and do nothing in terms of development. Ask yourself one very genuine question: what type of utility this project will ever host? Do you really think we now need more crappy meme coins if they have no real use case except being a joke themselves? I think better stay away with duplicates. If there is urge to invest anyways then better invest in the real DOGE. At least it will keep you safe.",
