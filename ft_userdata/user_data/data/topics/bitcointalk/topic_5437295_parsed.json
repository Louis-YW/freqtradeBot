We are a Trusted Long-Term Crypto Merchants.It is great that you will buy regularly. As you are trying to pay via the payment method which is in India you should post on the local board of India. Another factor is that you told that you are trusted but where is the proof that you are trusted? In 7 months I could see only four posts of you where there is no trade. It means you are a newbie and as a newbie, you can't get a single dollar first from the community.",

For OP to be trusted he should start initiating business among their localities for those that are from same country to know about his reputation, maybe their trust rating may likely help him and also exposed him the more.

Straight out of Newbie mode right into Currency Exchange (PayPal, Liberty Reserve, Western Union) There is lot of trusted exchange where P2P service is available. Kucoin us best option so far for crypto exchange to recieve payment directly to any bank and Paytm. If you are trusted enough and doing regularly then look out these exchanges and apply for P2P merchant. You will get high number of seller theirs.",
