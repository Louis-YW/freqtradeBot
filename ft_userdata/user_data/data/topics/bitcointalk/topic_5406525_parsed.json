  "content": "Higher rank means good opportunities here in the forum, but why its so hard to rank up?Here's what I realized for almost 5 years here in the forum and still at a lower rank.1. You can't please everybody here - Even if you create a good topic, you can't expect everyone to appreciate your work and probably will receive little to none merit since we all have different standards and qualifications before we gave out merit.2. Being Inactive - Don't expect to rank up if you are not active especially on making good contents. I have my busy days and really not active but when I do have a task here, I always make sure to qualify for that but again, that's not enough.3. Limited Knowledge - You can't share what you don't have, and making good topics here requires a good knowledge especially topics about helping people or a guidelines.To cut this story short, if you really want to rank up and have a good reputation just do the opposite, stay active, learn more and expect nothing.These are my mistakes, and I hope you won't do the same so you can be more successful here. Right now, I'm only learning with my experience and hopefully I can give something more helpful in the future.",

Some people post on boards that don't get many Merits, and once in a while people quickly gain a few hundred Merits after they've been \"highlighted\" for that reason. In your case, I quickly checked your post history, and it reminded me of this:Quote from: hilariousandco in Signature Campaign Guidelines (2016)generally it is quite easy to spot a spammer posting only for payment. Spam can come in many forms, but a typical spammer's posts will often follow some sort of pattern which will be immediately obvious upon inspection and will usually consist of one or two sentences of rehashed opinion posted as fast as possible with the minimal amount of effort being put in. A quality/constructive poster will generally have no pattern to their posting history and will have posts ranging from one word to one sentence to several paragraphs and everything in between and this is what you should be aiming for. If you find yourself in a position where you are forcing yourself to reply to a thread due to your signature campaign then that's a pretty good indication that you're likely making unsubstantial posts.Example: post #89 (written by OP) in a topic:Quote from: Scripture on July 05, 2018, 12:45:59 AMSelling crypto today doesnt give you much profit and the only good thing you can do is to hold it for a while. Even holding is risky too because you dont even know when it will rise up again, how long does your patience take you and is the price goes high or even lower. All aspects of investments are risk, you cannot get rid of it.This is what I call a \"generic shitpost\". It's okay to read, but doesn't add anything. Anyone with half a brain knows this already.You now have 968 posts. Here's a challenge (which you're free to ignore):Go over your post historyIf a post doesn't add anything, delete itCreate links to your best posts in Report unmerited good posts to Merit SourceWhen you post there, please refer to this post (so I don't lose track if you follow up after a while)I'm not promising a lot of Merit, but I do promise I'll review your list (I can't get myself to read your 968 posts)",

One will normally need to dedicate a fair share of time reading here and there, contrasting, and in general, developing a certain edge or criteria that helps him to expose, query, criticize or whatever in a more meaningful manner. I recently encountered a given account that was \"very active\" on the forum. He managed to make over 44 in just over three hours, saying absolutely nothing of value. The case is obviously a serial spammer, but likely, if heâd spent those three hours reading through and cross-referencing information here and there, heâd be better positioned to make at least two or three meaningful posts within the same timeframe.Iâve been merited on 2.711 posts out of 10.133 posts. That means that 73,25% of my posts have not been merited. By that I mean that, even for accounts that do receive merits with a certain frequency, itâs seemingly more normal by far not to get merited than to get merited, something that I often sense is expected the other way around by many.",

That been said, don't create your content to pleased anyone, create them because you feel it's right to pass that information to the community.

Just been consistent can help you go a long way as you can also learn from the conversation you engage in. We have many intellectual members that don't have as much merits as others that can't stand toe to toe with them, if there was a contest of who knows it more in the industry so it isn't always about the knowledge.

The whole beauty of this challenge (in my opinion) is in overcoming difficulties (like being too lazy to write constructive posts) and reaching new levels (new ranks and merit marks - 700, 800, etc).1. - You don't have to try to please everyone. If you write well, there will always be those who will appreciate it. Try to be yourself.2. - If you don't show activity, then as a result you will get \"nothing\". This happens everywhere. On this forum as well.3. - So what's the problem? Expand your horizons and try new directions. This topic sounds like \"cry about the inability to increase the rank.\" I don't want to offend Scripture, but I see it that way. If your actions don't bring the desired result, then try to change something.You are very close to Full member, and this may well be achieved.

I think the best thing is that you should always expect nothing in return, yet you feel satisfied in contributing to the whole forum. It is like a real-life donation, you give everything but expect nothing in return. If you see someone returned the favor, then you will feel as if you did everything you could which is more satisfying.
