      "body": "I don't think that could ever be possible with the little knowledge I have of Bitcoin. There is no possibility that will ever make Bitcoin vanish into thin air; how will that even happen? This kind of imagination can only be possible on coins that are on a centralized system, where the team in charge can wake up any day and make away with all holders' coins. In the aspect of Bitcoin, it's only you and anyone else who has access to your wallet who could be able to move out your coins to a separate wallet. Even when that is done, the coins are not entirely gone because they can still be located on a different wallet. Unless the entire blockchain is shut down, which will only make coins available, the coins in your wallet won't disappear. In conclusion, I don't think there could ever be any possible scenario for Bitcoin to vanish out of a holder's wallet without a trace.",

Its already been created and stored away thay no one will ever access or controls it. But there are some bitcoin losses already or those stored in private key that arent accesible by the owners or forgotten their keys. But who knows the innovation changing maybe some genius might tapped a way for this umpossible assumption but I doubt it will be easy just like that.",

I think those who think so are completely wrong. But yes one thing is that if an exchange goes bankrupt or gets hacked then the dollars or bitcoins will disappear from there. Will disappear from the exchange but will be visible to other addresses taken. This kind of thing can happen in all coins other than Bitcoin like altcoin. The CEO of the coin can make it disappear if it wishes, this will only happen with the altcoin. Moreover, I think that no such incident will happen in the case of Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and a more total confirmations you have for your bitcoin transaction to that address with which you stores your bitcoin, a smaller risk to see it vanished (reverted by 51% attack).How many bitcoin confirmations is enough?Quote from: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch09.asciidocOne way to think about the blockchain is like layers in a geological formation, or glacier core sample. The surface layers might change with the seasons, or even be blown away before they have time to settle. But once you go a few inches deep, geological layers become more and more stable. By the time you look a few hundred feet down, you are looking at a snapshot of the past that has remained undisturbed for millions of years. In the blockchain, the most recent few blocks might be revised if there is a chain recalculation due to a fork. The top six blocks are like a few inches of topsoil. But once you go more deeply into the blockchain, beyond six blocks, blocks are less and less likely to change. After 100 blocks back, there is so much stability that the coinbase transaction—the transaction containing newly mined bitcoin—can be spent. A few thousand blocks back (a month) and the blockchain is settled history, for all practical purposes. While the protocol always allows a chain to be undone by a longer chain and while the possibility of any block being reversed always exists, the probability of such an event decreases as time passes until it becomes infinitesimal.Check with this free tool: https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-confirmation-risk-calculator/or that tool which is more accurate: https://web.archive.org/web/20181231045818/https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.htmlThe first tool does not count decimal number but the second tool does.",

But this is not happening because of technical flaws or vulnerabilities that some hacker used to steal \"all Bitcoins\", but because a lot of people do not understand the basics of proper storage and use of cryptocurrencies.The conclusion is more than clear, and that is that people are the weakest link in the chain, regardless of whether it is the reasons I have already mentioned, or the genetic tendency to destroy everything around them and ultimately themselves.",

Should anything have to go out of existence, it would occur by some progression which means, the signs and warnings would be there but, could have been ignored all along. Besides, we exists in various time zones and as such, while some adjustments to a system is being made, there will always be some persons taking part and note of these changes.Haven't said that, there is no surprises in cryptocurrency. If the bearish market don't come to be within a blink. It takes time to dip and then you would not the bulls pushing the market up again.If you look at what stunts that have been thrown to the bitcoin innovation, having faith in the system wont be such a difficult thing to do.

Have you forgotten how bitcoin works? There is no our bitcoin. In fact, bitcoin is not owned by anyone, but users get the right to own it (proof of ownership). Which means that bitcoin don't move anywhere at all (in transactions) and only information about the owner (wallet) is transmitted.I understand your concerns, but I don't think it's something to be bothered with.

There could be many scenarios too, that can vanish your BTC, like the recent trust wallet issue, faced by some members, that their assets are not reflected in their account. That could be some bug or whatever. Some said it's a close source so we should not trust this wallet (trust wallet). The point still remains the same that a centralized body can cause such type of event.Quote from: Rexlus on April 20, 2023, 10:27:33 AM Blockchain or DLT has a common explanation where it is calculated to solve double spending problem which represent a incomparable transaction that are solve through the computers in the network?According to my knowledge, double spending and the vanishing of BTC overnight are two different things, because double spending is impossible in the BTC blockchain, maybe you will find an example of Malleability vulnerability in the MT GOX exchange in 2014, some call it as Double spending attack, but that's was not a double spending attack. (Indirectly) but the Attacker did use a technique to alter the transaction IDs to make multiple requests. The point is double spending is an attack to use same BTC two times which is impossible so how can someone use it to vanish BTC overnight? ( please correct me if i interpret you concerns wrong).",

The Bitcoin technology doesn't have such flaws, unless some users are careless in handling their wallet private keys and secret phrase. If you mistakenly end up exposing your wallet's secret information to a third party or to the public, offcus you can wake up and find all your bitcoins are gone (zero balance). Bitcoin technology is not centralized; the program has just been set up in the way it's functioning, so apparently every Bitcoiner can't just wake up and see a zero balance.
