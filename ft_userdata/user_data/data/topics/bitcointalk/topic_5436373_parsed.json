  "content": "Hi All,I am getting private keys from decrypted wallets by searching the wallet.dat file with keyhunter for b'\\x01\\x30\\x82\\x01\\x13\\x02\\x01\\x01\\x04\\x20' bytes.But what I want to do is dump all encrypted private keys in the same way - search for some magic bytes and then move forward/backward and dump bytes with encrypted private key.They should be in ckey as I understand.How can I do that? What bytes to search for and which to dump?",
