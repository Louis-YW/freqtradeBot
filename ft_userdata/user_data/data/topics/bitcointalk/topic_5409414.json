LOL! I will still wait a little longer for the representative of this project to respond before I decide to create a Flag against them, also, I have contacted the Gila Studio developers and we will see what they have to say about the use of their intellectual property.Quote from: examplens on August 11, 2022, 11:30:43 AMIf he AthosMeta started the business with plagiarism, cannot expect any honourable work behind everything so, it should be marked and neg. tagged.Yes, it's all just a hype-word marketing full of terms like yield farming, staking, AI bot trading, Meta(verse), P2E gaming, NFT... Basically, everything they could think of is in there! I'll update this report soon with new information and additional red flags about their parent \"company\" Athos Meta Capital.",

You should look into these aspects before managing any bounty campaigns in the future, because if you make mistakes over and over again, it will take your reputation to a very bad level.",

Their website is almost identical to the template demo from Themeforest. They didn't even bother to change the images used in the demo, including client/partner logos in the footer. Considering that most of the content is plagiarized, they probably made the entire website in less than 15 minutes. This is not something you would expect from a company that claims to have more than 10 years of experience in the financial business and a massive capital available to invest in potential projects.
