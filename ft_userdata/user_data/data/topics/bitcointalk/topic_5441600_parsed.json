But using Google for two seconds brings up the official support page of BingX. You also find everything about exchange fees or other information concerning the exchange. That's why I don't understand why you use (and trust) third party websites when you can find all the information on the official channels/website of the exchange within a few seconds.Anyway, if you want to trade plenty of (shit)-coins, it is best to use a decentralized exchange of the respective network. Here you don't need a KYC and are on the safe side. For all FIAT transactions then it is best to use a reputable exchange like Kraken or Coinbase.",

      "body": "I've read and seen about the BingX exchange, they are more focused on Margin Trading, if I'm not mistaken, BingX is mostly used in Taiwan, their company is established in Hong Kong or what is more famous about them is often called Bingbon.After I browsed through a lot of information about BingX and I found something that set me back.For example: from the experience of someone trading on the BingX exchange, about KYC named: @Hojer.Quoteworst trading page even worse…worst trading page even worse support!!!support just answering in chinese / taiwan even when im from germany / speaking english in the chatdid the KYC process, even then so many errors and 3/3 guys from the support team tell me do KYC even i did it before and it got approvedAnother complaint I've seen from user @Matt.QuoteScammers - putting minumums to steal your moneyBingX app puts minimums for transferring and withdrawing money. I had 0.00089 ETH which is equivalent of 15$. There’s no way to get my money back from this platform as they put minimums ie 0.00089 is not convertible. I am not counting the high fees and recurring cuts for all transfers. (I’m a user from USA)Stay away from these burglars!What is certain is that wherever you trade with the Margin method, Spot is definitely a risk, not only on the BingX exchange, Now the decision is yours, if you want to use BingX exchange or not, more information is better for you to make your trading choice.",

The CoinEx supports more coins, but need KYC!I see that Bingx on review sites such as Trustpilot has more positive reviews than CoinEx with 4.2 ratings, but these may be shill reviews. I have not used these platforms before, so I cannot recommend something I have not tried, but why are these platforms without others? There are many of the most highly rated and trusted exchange platforms in the crypto arena; therefore, I advise you to do your research again and not deposit your money in a platform you do not know unless you confirm its credibility or test them for a small amount.",

I am sure you can find better alternatives than both CoinEx and BingX. If not, it would be a good idea to consider whether that is a cryptocurrency worth purchasing.",

You can find the full list of CEX here.",
