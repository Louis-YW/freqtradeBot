Mainly, we need to know that we are all responsible for our own decisions when we gamble because this we set our mindset that we are going to take full responsibility for our decisions if things go North or South. Having a mental section or public orientation is a good approach for the new gamblers to have direct them on the ethics of gambling and how every gamblers can help each other not to get too addicted to gambling. Getting addiction in gambling is a gradual steps and if we keep it as pace, we might not realize that we are already a gambling addict. This is  one of the problems many gamblers face not knowing they are already a gambling addict.",

You are in the gambling section, and you must understand that people here discuss gambling altogether. If gambling is too much for these newbies, they should seek help from a professional or someone they know personally and trust, and not from some random degenerates on the internet willingly discussing gambling and losing money daily. I'm all for responsible gambling and preventing people to become gambling addicts but I know that this isn't the right avenue for that.",

It is only people that don't take to advice that will become a victim to addition or people that see gambling as a means to make profit.Let me outline some for you.1. Only gamble with the amount that you can afford to lose2. Don't see gambling as a means of making profit but rather take gambling as a means of entertainment so that you don't end up running at big loss because you will always loss more than winning.3. Set a gamble budget for the week and once your budget has been exhausted, you wait for the next week gambling budget.4. Don't borrow money to gamble because you will not be able to double the money through gambling and the lender might get you arrested.5. Don't allow your emotions to control you when you are gambling so that you will not end up chasing your losses. Because chasing your loss will make you lose more and will also lead to addiction.6. Set a time limit for your gambling activities so that once the time is over, you stop gambling either you are winning or losing.All these information are being said here everyday and new gamblers should stick to them to avoid addiction.",

But I do not think that we need a separate board for this. A pinned topic however, would be more than sufficient, as someone in this topic already replied.A pinned topic could serve as an overview which is constantly being updated with information about the newest dangers and pitfalls. Although having said that, the only thing you really need in order to avoid the traps of gambling is human common sense and a little bit of discipline.",

Without good self-control and good money control, this gambling activity will always become an activity that results in huge losses. And without a strong mentality to accept defeat at the end of the gambling game, gambling will never be a fun activity, because in the end it will just be a matter of regret. Regret for having behaved carelessly which ultimately caused significant losses.And a person can become irresponsible for the gambling he does, this can happen because he does not have full control over the gambling he does, and what actually happens is the opposite, where he is the one who is controlled by the gambling. So he prioritizes and prioritizes his gambling activities above other interests and responsibilities.",

This is  one of the problems many gamblers face not knowing they are already a gambling addict. That's right, all decisions are only our own to manage about what decisions we will make and for the impact of the decision only we will feel it, people will not care about what you experience and also with what decisions you will make, so of course all responsibility is in your hands. Coming with the right mindset and direction along with a fairly awake mentality will keep you fine in your next gambling involvement, these basic things really have to be considered I think, because that will determine what your fate will be in the future. Honestly, these days I see more and more people getting into gambling addiction unconsciously, like you said everything goes gradually and their inability to realize some indications that could potentially lead to unwanted things makes them end up in the addiction zone. Basically some are aware and some are not, I think for anyone there is nothing wrong with doing a reset and evaluating their activities on gambling especially those who have been involved first, if indeed you find that there is a decline in your finances after knowing gambling then obviously changes must be made immediately.",

Also, a board that seeks to proffer solution for people battling euth one form of gambling related issue that affects the general wellbeing/performance of the gambler. Many people think only those who are addicted suffer most of these challenges,  no! That's not true. A person who is not addicted can suffer health problems as a result of over anxiety and maybe shock arising from a loss they incured, or from their inability to control their emotions.  This is a very critical issue which many people tend to overlook.",
