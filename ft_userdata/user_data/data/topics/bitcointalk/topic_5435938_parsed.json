I can only imagine how well their 'secure' element chip really is if they're batteries cant even withstand being pulled off more then a dozen times before becoming a paperweight.QuoteDescriptionI am contacting because I had bought ttthe pro keystone and then several of your tablets. An before I write out my review I would see if we can get this fixed directly. So after having this for roughly 7 montths with both AAA battery pack and rechargeable one my keystone pack has got to a point where if i even touch it after it powers on it will shut off. In order for me to even continue to use it would require me to solder on this battery pack which I really do not want. As a hobbyist I have bought several wallets claiming hardware or coldgap storage. An personally go through and audit both hardware and software for any thing that could lead to malicious intent or selling of information to third parties. Now I liked the keystone it was in my top 3 for choices however this hardware fault needs to be addressed. For what I paid I expected something relatively high quality. Right now my rooted iphone 5c that i purchased for 25 bucks is functioning better then this keystone.As of now I have just a paper weight with unattainable value stored inside of it. I’ll wait 30 days for a response and then base my article/review dependent on how we get my issue mitigated. Its been a pleasure I do look forward to hearing back as I am curious on how this is going to get resolved. Also this is a certainly due to faulty manufacturing others who I recommended this too are having similar issues.

It should be like #46578 with 5-6 digits.68847ActivitySummer23/Nov/22 2:14 AMHi,Sorry for the inconvenience!Due to the charging protocol, our battery does not support fast charging, it is recommended to use a charging head below 5V2A power, the charging cable needs to use typeC (2.0) or (3.0), and it must be a Type-A to Type-C cable, you cannot use a type-C to type-C charging cable.We can only accept 5V1A or 5V2A small chargers, high power chargers will not charge and may damage the rechargeable battery.Because the battery has overcharge protection, if the charger plug/charger default output voltage exceeds 7v, it will burn out the TVS tube on the battery board, resulting in the charging lamp not lighting up and can no longer be charged.In this case, I need you to confirm whether the output voltage of the charging plug exceeds the standard and suggest you replace the charging head with a standard one and try again. We are trying to optimize this issue. Would you kindly take a picture of the charger you are using so that we can have a better understanding of your issue? Please find the description text on the charger (like its voltage) and put that info in the picture. Thanks!When the machine starts charging, the charging indicator light is orange, it takes about 3 hours to fully charge, when the battery is full, the light will turn green. If the light does not turn green means the charging is not completed.Besides, due to the different brands/quality/materials of AAA batteries, it will lead to differences in the final standby time. AAA batteries may have unsteady voltage, is for the user's emergency use, range is relatively weak. We recommend using lithium batteries in preference.If you do need to use AAA batteries, we recommend the Panasonic Eneloop Rechargeable Battery.Are you unable to use the machine when using any of the battery compartments?Yours,SummerAutomatic response23/Nov/22 2:14 AMYour request status has changed to Waiting for customer.hidden@gmail.com31/Dec/22 12:39 PMI do not use fastcharging i’m very well aware of ohms law and voltage tthe issue is the poor quality in the connection of your magnetic connection if you would of actually read what I described as my issue you would of found this out rather than providing an automated response. . . The device itself is a faulty device and if i want to actually use this i’m going to have to solder lines to the device to connect to the battery. I know what I am talking about with this issue. Please re-read and tell me how we can get this rectified I will be writing my audit in 30 days.Automatic response31/Dec/22 12:39 PMYour request status has changed to Waiting for support.Esme Wang03/Jan/23 11:28 AMHi there,Sorry for the late response due to the New Year break.Would you mind providing some record of this issue so we can check it and process a proper solution?From the issue mentioned, it sounds like a detaching issue. And in the 3rd generation, we will make some changes to it and provide a more convenient charging way.We appreciate the review or any feedback about it to improve Keystone with your kind help.Regards,EsmeAutomatic response03/Jan/23 11:28 AMYour request status has changed to Waiting for customer.Automatic responseToday 8:30 AMYour request status has changed to Solved.Automation for JiraToday 8:30 AMhidden@gmail.com,Hi,We haven't heard back from you for 3 days, so we're automatically closing this support request for now.Please feel free to re-open or comment on this issue if you still need help!Best regards,Keystone Support Team",

      "body": "They are supposed to ask you to return this faulty product and replace the Keystone Pro wallet that you bought with another version 3 or get your money back because, through my reading of the conversation that took place between you and their customer service, they did not look at the poor manufacturing of the hardware wallet and their batteries, they only indicate that the issue you have is in the output voltage of the charger and the quality of the batteries and that they did not comply with the charging protocol of their wallet. Frankly, I am lucky because I wanted to buy this wallet several months ago, but I gave up on my idea because I found better alternatives. The price of Keystone Pro is $170, which is somewhat expensive compared to the poor quality of their manufacturing and the compatibility of their batteries as if you had just bought paperweight.",
