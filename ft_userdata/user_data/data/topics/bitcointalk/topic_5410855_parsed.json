  "content": "The $RMAI token is launched and supported by ROI Master Academy INC, a 100% decentralized ecosystem and committed team. The $RMAI token is initially based on the win-win concept where the ROIMA community and the development and operations team coexist in a successful environment. $RMAI was created to support and reward investors and owners of ROIMA INC. The CEO waived 100% of the funds raised in the pre-sale and said funds will be added to the liquidity of the RMAI/BNB pair. The deflationary system and the use cases in investment mode, scalability, compound interest, agriculture, mining and other programs support the $RMAI Tokenomics together with the great minds behind this wonderful project where the partners will be involved in the mechanics and the utilities.RMAI($RMAI) is a token that runs its operations on the BEP-20 network. This token had a maximum supply at the time it was created of 100 million (100,000,000), which at the time of writing this document 98.8 million (98,803,634) remain. The Owner renounced the contract, so the purchase-sale-transaction fees cannot be changed, nor mint more tokens. The owner delivered all the tokens to unicrypt under smart contracts with a scheduled unlock.Contract : 0x5416f06830C7826A2ee774c53a3589e707269AB3Purchase/sale transaction tax:To support the development of the ecosystem, for each of the purchase, sale and transactions between wallets will be charged a tax, which is distributed as follows:Automatic reflection/stacking to give rewards to holders, 2% each transaction.2% goes to marketing, to support $RMAI on youtube, instagram, twitter and other media, plus will largely be used for buybacks or liquidity as needed.With each transaction, 1% is burned, reducing the circulating supply and increasing scarcity.The default 0.25 tax of pancakeswap.Always use a slip tolerance of ~6% to ensure buying and selling activities go smoothly.The tokens that are unlocked in unicrypt go to the main wallets of the project. In each unlocking, the best way to use them for the benefit of the own RMAI token will be strategically analyzed. Among the main aspects to take into account will be:Add to liquidityLock againExternal payments (Marketing, Listing on Exchange, Development, etc)Enter the Nova Reward systemDays prior to the larger unlocks, the destination of the new unlocked tokens will be made public. Mision and visionWe all know that a token by itself is a meme token where the only ones potentially benefiting are the creators, and that is not the case with $RMAI. The $RMAI token coexists with the Roi Master Academy company and they share the same goal. ROIMA and $RMAI, one cannot speak of one without mentioning the other, both have the objective of offering small investors a real and different opportunity to obtain income, although known mechanisms are used, there are very particular characteristics within this ecosystem that make the difference with the rest of the investment market. Nova Reward: It is a new concept created by the CEO, whose basic principle is to benefit small investors with the $RMAI token for free through an investment strategy within the ROIMA program and uses an Oracle; that protects the economy; for token distribution. This ROIMA & $RMAI union will have a positive impact that will revolutionize the way of obtaining income through the win-win concept and the use of the token in different modalities such as staking, Play to earn, nova reward and governance token. This will make many investors interested in this incredible and real way to generate income.https://t.me/+UG36iluvFh9lNDAxhttps://rmai.iohttps://roi-master-academy-inc.gitbook.io/rmai-whitepaper/https://coinmarketcap.com/es/currencies/roima-inc-token/https://www.coingecko.com/es/monedas/roima-inchttps://twitter.com/TokenRmaihttps://www.youtube.com/c/RoimAcademyhttps://discord.gg/zZuv6P8y59https://www.coinscope.co/coin/rmai/audithttps://www.coinscope.co/coin/rmai/kyc",
