  "content": "As a new investor I am very curious to know in which wallet my bitcoins will be safe. I am holding on to some bitcoins I bought earlier. and I was interested in buying more bitcoins later today I bought some bitcoins again with some of my money. I bought 0.0068 bitcoins from Binance exchange long ago and held them. and today again bought 0.00559 bitcoins from Xt exchange. I currently have all the money I have invested in Bitcoin. I believe that investing in Bitcoin will bring me profits in the future. Right now I have bitcoins (BTC0.0068+0.00559)=0.01239. I think if I hold Bitcoin for long term I will definitely be able to make good profit. Because I believe Bitcoin will reach $100k.  And then my wallet balance will show (0.01239×$100000)=$1239 I hope. But I don't feel very comfortable keeping my money in exchange. So I want advice from seniors whether hardware wallet is better or software wallet. But if I want to buy a hardware wallet I will need money.but right now I don't have any money to buy hardware. So I suggest using a software wallet.  However, I have no idea which wallet to use will provide the most security. So tell me a bit about what is a strong and security complete wallet?",

It is most important to backup your seed phrase. I will advice you to use electrum cold storage. You do not necessarily need watch-only wallet for it but you can have it to watch over your wallet using a device. After you set up a paper wallet on the cold storage device, you can delete it which makes it a paper wallet, or you can leave it on a cold storage device if you can spare your device for it and use it as airgapped walllet. Which means you can go for paper wallet or wallet on airgapped device. Airgapped devices are devices that their WiFi and Bluetooth components are removed from just computer with newly reinstalled OS, making use of the device at the time for wallet creation, making sure it has no connection to the internet.",

If you buy a hardware wallet, you will have to spend about $80-100. The question arises, is it worth spending a third of the amount just to keep it safe? It seems to me that it would be better if at this stage we limit ourselves to the software wallet. Just take care to make this wallet secure by taking all necessary precautions.But if you plan to gradually increase the deposit, then you can think about the hardware wallet. Also, the argument in this favor will be that your 0.01239BTC at a rate of $100k will be $1200. Then the game may be worth the candle.",

Personally, I believe a private key generated on a secure offline computer is the gold standard. Whereas, a hardware wallet is more suited to those that need to access their Bitcoin regularly, and don't want to think too much about security issues that could arise from that. However, I'd probably be much more confident hiding my seed than my hardware wallet, since physical access to anything generally allows more sophisticated, and out of the box thinking attacks, I usually consider physical access possible to be compromised despite no documented attacks. A seed can be reasonably secured, and potentially be as complex as you need it to be.",

A software wallet, you technically only need to save the seed, and generally you'll be warned to secure that pretty well. I'm not talking about a software wallet connected to the internet, I'm talking from the point of view where you want to generate an address, and just receive Bitcoin to that address. Since, with a hardware wallet you have to purchase it from a vendor, hopefully the original manufacturer, there's a element of risk of third party vendor having physical access to the device, and therefore altering the hardware wallet, with a wallet that you download, verify, and then keep in a offline environment you don't have these risks. Hence, why I went on, and said about being more confident in securing a seed than a hardware wallet. Although, I could've probably been a little more clear in that. So, if I wanted to just generate a seed, and basically have a offline wallet, I'd probably not even need the offline wallet, copy the addresses, save the seed, and focus on securing that seed. Even, if you are going to be keeping the wallet offline, as long as its secure in the first place, it's no less secure than a hardware wallet technically. However, when regular access is needed, and therefore becomes a online wallet, a hardware wallet makes sense due to the reasons you mentioned. However, for private key generation or a offline wallet, a hardware wallet is definitely more expensive, and potentially overkill if it's going to remain a offline wallet. If you intend to use it regularly, and therefore online then yeah I'd absolutely agree that software wallets then have more attack vectors. It seems like the OP was talking about holding Bitcoin, hence the reason I believe a offline wallet should be fine, and technically could potentially have less chance of being compromised in a physical attack, since there's various ways of securing it, whereas a lot of people tend to think hardware wallets are invulnerable even physically, and buy them from third party vendors quite often. The key thing is; if you want a offline wallet, that you are holding Bitcoin on; offline wallet generated via verified software. If you want to regularly use it, and therefore online; hardware wallet. The added risk to a hardware wallets depends on how you got it, and how you secure it. Those are the additional risks, with the latter also being true for offline generated wallets. Worth noting, while the vulnerability was patched, I wouldn't doubt that we'll see similar attacks, but there's also less secure hardware wallets than a Trezor. Trezor are pretty decent hardware wallets compared to some out there. So, my line of thought was due to third party vendor issues or an attacker gaining physical access it could potentially have more risks. Although, I'll admit I didn't really explain that all too well. However, the chances of someone doing that, and having a zero day exploit? Probably, rather slim. Although, worth mentioning since you can avoid the risk of that by not using it at all. What I will say; for the vast majority of users, a hardware wallet is probably going to be the most secure, especially for new users. Again, I should've probably mentioned that, but thought there was enough users saying that . theoretically probably wasn't the right word. Needed to be something like if a offline wallet is generated under perfect circumstances, e.g airgap etc, then it technically can be more secure than a hardware wallet if it remains offline, or the seed is backed up, and then the wallet is deleted from the computer. I don't know, a lot of people will think physical tampering of a hardware wallet before it arrives to you, is so incredibly unlikely it probably shouldn't be worried about it too much, especially if it's bought from the official store. However, not everyone has that privilege since they don't always deliver worldwide. One thing for sure, is that is a risk that you don't have with a offline wallet that you generated. However, you still have to keep your seed secure, and obviously your hardware wallet due to physical attacks potentially being an attack vector.",

There's been arguments about Intel, and AMD having various things in the past. For example, the ME engine, and AMD's equivalent. So, yeah this is probably a risk also. There's ways around the privacy issues with hardware wallets, but yeah most people won't have those provisions in place, and will be giving their home address. I do believe a lot of places these days refuse to send to PO boxes too, which obviously restricts what you can do to try, and keep your privacy intact.
