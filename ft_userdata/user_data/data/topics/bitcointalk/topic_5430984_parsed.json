  "content": "LET them crash all i dont care but futures traders need money.I see the leverage options are lower now exchangers take down high leverages.We see not so much money in futures trading both ways long and shorts are slow moving and less volatility.Year Ago we use to get like Nice profits from futures trading.But they need to fund extra futures traders they need to start USDT USDC REPO Facility asap or direct 401k or goverment Fed funding binance futures.They need to Act now i Will collect to people and send request to Biden administrator he give a lot aid to ukraine so Even If he gives just little bit like few hundred mil of dollars can help a lot and shiba doge can pmp more hard.They have to start seriously funding traders becouse traders dont have other skills becouse it took alot time to learn trading Even the futures trading tools and instruments.so traders dont have other ways to make incomeSo If neither trump or Biden dont Act now then Putin should becouse russia are oil rich or we can offer this option to emirates or maybe china.We gona have like a lot unemployed traders so all of them Are going to be broke.If there Will be no liquity to be provided to traders there will be riots becouse traders have nothing to lose.Also the binance is slow about innovation traders told to binance many times to make traders funds airdrop and insurance and many others things.I hope cooler heads Will step in and take Lead now.No matter what but they have to do something and i stand for traders.And it's not big money what we need Even the 500k daily aid for insurance and support liquity can help us to earn more money Once futures trader always the trader !",
