      "body": "to first know how it can drop dramatically, you need to also look into why it doesnt..basic economics.. if the most efficient mining cost on the planet was say $60k.. no one can get bitcoin for less, so no one would want to sell bitcoin for less as that is then a loss..so with the speculation above $60k shows people right now hare happy to pay ~$100k on the public markets. if the speculation/demand dried up people would give up selling coin to the $60k mark and the speculation would begin again to raise the priceat this moment the pacific islands (japan, hawaii and such) have high electric cost thus high mining cost ($350k/btc) so they ar very happy to market speculate and buy coin at just $100k(3.5x discount, so very happy), thus support the buy pressure..the cheapest mining cost on the planet is ~$60k and thus sets the bottom support level.. and everyone else has varying cost/value sentiments in the middle, and so that is why there is a large spread in the speculative window of possible volatility at any given time.. (this season the price can swing between $60k-$350k, (but is steadily playing around the $100k mark right now))so then you can ask why would the price want to or need to drop to the bottomthe reason: market correction after a sudden pump/rise/spikethen you can ask how could we drop the most efficient mining cost or make it so even miners would sell at a loss to break the bottom and go lower quicklythe reasons..the code bugs out and makes bitcoin break its economicsthe mining cost of hardware or electric gets cheaper by some other efficiency reasonthe hashrate drops via less miners, where it becomes cheaper to mine for the remaining miners due to less competitionthere is scenarios where by all the miners that are mining at a cost of $60k-$90k would drop off from mining when the market goes down. this means the remaining miners at a previous $60k cost get more sats per block so they are then averaging like $30k per coin cost which can then allow for the market to fall to $30k.. but this would require the market speculation to dry up where the amount of buyer are not trying to support and raise the price, but instead are selling in fear and dropping the price..now here is a thing about the \"bottom\" being well supported and how its not easy to just drop the bottom..many asic farms dont pay bills per month. instead they buy electric unit contracts that cover 1-2years of constant power. so there is no point in switching hardware off. so they have a fixed cost over 1-2 years so they end up supporting a minimum hashpower baseline of competition.. bitcoin code would need to severely and long term/permanently break to cause the mass asic farms to switch off and cause the step down of the \"bottom\" to cause significant price drop..all you need to know is (as said) while no bug is breaking bitcoin, this season the market can swing between $60k-$350k so expect that when it gets near the premium there is then more room for a larger correction back down to value (the higher it rises the bigger the fall)whilst there is no bug breaking bitcoin. periodically/seasonally the speculative value-premium window will move up. whereby for instance as of summer and winter the $60k minimum is no longer $60k but a higher number. and the $350k possible premium is no longer $350k but even higher...but..if there was a bug or something significant happening to the underlying mining cost which can impact the speculative window of value-premium to drop. then the market could significantly drop",

      "body": "This is my personal opinion, the rise or fall of a coin whether Bitcoin or any coin is a common thing, in essence every time there is a buyer there must be a seller, this triggers an increase or decrease in price, if you ask ‘how can Bitcoin drop dramatically’? of course this cannot escape the bad news that happened, so the holder decided to sell because of fear, but if you are really an investor who wants to buy Bitcoin in the long term, you don't need to worry about that because the potential for future Bitcoin increases, we can see from the amount of good news circulating today, before deciding to buy you have to believe in what you are buying, if necessary do basic research so that your confidence is getting stronger.",

And precisely in this cycle it does not seem that there is going to be as much to worry about as in the previous ones.

It is when you sell during a price drop and you bought higher than that price that you will be in loss, but if you don't sell a dime, you are not in loss. The odd of bitcoin price going up overtime is higher than the price going down. This means that it's easy for bitcoin to reach $1m, than going to zero.",

I feel that your question is coated in fear and anxiety which is something you should not allow to thrive else you might miss the opportunity of owning bitcoin. For your information, the price of bitcoin does not continue in one direction only, it fluctuates but even if it drops, it will always recover. This is the reason why you should not be afraid of buying bitcoin whenever you have the opporunity because it has proven to be a reliable investment over the years.",

I wouldn't even call it \"Early adoption\" stage. we're not even there yet. once BTC has the backing of the UNITED STATES of AMERICA for the first time, this will ignite an arms race to acquire as many BTC as possible as quickly as possible. I hope Trump, or the federal government doesn't actually buy any more BTC. just hold the Silk Road coins. then, let the STATES acquire with their own budgets. this will finally demonstrate the fiscal/monetary competencies between blue and red states. at the same time, we will see other nation states purchase BTC....as well as institutions.  BTC halving will no longer have a material impact to price since obviously most coins are already mined. prices will be dictated purely by supply and demand. and in the short term (2025), we will see some wild swings with whales selling, other whales buying, but prices will normalize at a much higher level than it is today. I dont know if this is $150k, $250k, $1M, or $5M, but it will be very high very soon. we will see some volatility like all asset classes do, but it won't be +/- 10% daily swings, nor will it be +/- 50% annual swings. we will grow exponentially the next few years, and perhaps a small step function graph in halving years, but in-between, I see consistent and stable upwards movement",
