If you have only $1,000, you won't make a lot of profit, because Bitcoin won't increase in value by 100 times. Investing $1,000 is worth it, but it won't change your life. But doubling or trippling a larger sum like $50,000 or $100,000 is a good investing move.As for earning, if you're earning more money with BTC than with fiat doing the same job, then go for Bitcoin jobs. Otherwise work for fiat and buy Bitcoin with your earnings.",

Sometimes government rise the development and adoption of bitcoin because is under their custody, so bitcoin should be considered or seen as currency but only that differentiate bitcoin with traditional currency is because traditional currency is centralized currency that is dependable by government of particular nation, so that is the difference between bitcoin and fiat currency, in other way round bitcoin is an asset and its use for investment that yield positively in its transaction or investment depending the category you venture in bitcoin investment.",

Seeing it as a source of income depends on the work you’re doing and being paid in BTC. Only some crypto related companies will pay their workers in BTC today since the risk involved in crypto trading is limiting its full adoption by all yet. It’s okay to work and be paid in bitcoin, it enhance its adoption in some ways too.Also, investing in bitcoin still depends on the money you’re putting into it and how much you stand to earn in the long run. To reduce the risk of loss, having an investment plan will give you a better guide in the market. Investment could be in the form of trading or holding. To reduce the risk of loss being caused by the volatility of the market, its advisable to just buy and hold your BTC for the long time to reap your profit later. This is advisable for newbies and those that have no prior knowledge on trading bitcoin.",

If you are talking about trading bitcoin as a job,then I think that you shouldn't put all your hope in it, because trading will likely bring your loss since it is similar to gamble. Therefore, it is better that you have a job before seeing bitcoin as a part time job. Even if you have invested in bitcoin and you are waiting to make profit from it in the long run, you must still have money that you need for feeding and emergency needs if not you will sell off your bitcoin for some important needs. If you are talking about your earnings in bitcoin I think you can only see few jobs that pays with bitcoin. The only sure place that pays with bitcoin is this forum when you take part in signature campaigns. Also the amount which you have put into bitcoin investment determines the profit that you will make in the long run that is why it is advisable to use DCA methods where you can keep on accumulating more bitcoin to your investment portfolio, so that in four years time,you must have accumulated a significant amount.",

Secondly, you can also perceive bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Most countries suffer from inflation making their currency lose purchasing power. Bitcoin has shown over the years to be a good hedge to handle inflation. Bitcoin can be used as an investment where you buy and hodl for a long time until the piece appreciates. You can decide to sell and take your profit from your investment. One of the ways to reduce the risk of investing in bitcoin is to adopt the DCA strategy. It is the process of buying bitcoin in small and equal bits over a period of time. It is better than buying a large amount irregularly. One of the benefits of DCA is that it helps to spread risk making it difficult to lose abysmally. Don't base your decision to invest on other people's forecasts or predictions. Do your own research so that your conviction to invest will be based on personal knowledge and understanding.",

You can't be a newbie and jump into the decision of immediately making bitcoin as source of income cause that will mean you trading which is a very risky aspect of bitcoin with it's volatility which will suggest that for a newbie a long time investment plan of buying and holding is the best that can guarantee you profit. For any person that wants to make bitcoin  source of income be it part-time or full, you have to first learn trading and this would demand seriousness and psychological build up too cause trading isn't for the weak.",

Only you’re a day traders can say they earn a living from trading bitcoin, if you’re a person hodling for long term, your strategy is not income but profit. Day trading is not for everyone, only those who can bear the loss of making such risky trades can be successful in trading. It’s far safer to hodl till the price hits ATH.",

Well, the correlation between the Bitcoin market and other energy asset classes is obvious. Why? Recently, when economic uncertainties, such as wars, global trade, the increasingly uncertain prospects for the global economy have made the demand for energy asset classes decline. At the same time, the demand for Bitcoin is increasing in response to the actions of investors seeking to hedge against the risks and uncertainties in today's energy markets. So, I think these two important points are included in one unit from your question, is Bitcoin a source of income or an investment plan.One more thing, if we look at the history that has existed, from BTC journey to its inception until now, Bitcoin can be seen as an asset that helps avoid risk and is one of the top choices for now, especially for investors who want to be safe and minimize risk. also maintain their returns in case of unexpected negative surprises in the market.",
