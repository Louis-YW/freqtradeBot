  "content": "First of it's good y'all know that here no one is in competition with another. Don't get my topic wrong.I'll give an instance, when getting into this forum I met a coursemate and he told me quite a lot about this forum and really I've come to realize many great things he said and as well the dangers of not sticking to the rules he briefed me about. Afterwards he gave me the link and I registered. Congratulations to me I am a member of Bitcoin talk forum. I thought it would be so merry all times but I was wrong I seemed to have quickly forgot the things he told me about the forum and I though started with a right foot but missed it along the way but trust menwe have guys watching your every move here if you wanna be a pain in the ass they'll bash you to reasoning well again and I got corrected I'm sure so far I observe rules accordingly.Something about my coursemate intrigued me and I wanted to know his username on here. But he refused to tell me, for long I've wondered why ? \"Does it really matter?\" And by and by I see why it's better he didn't tell me. I am growing knowing that he's grown overtime I don't have any form of unnecessary competition with him...it makes me seek his advice and help when I'm in need...I don't have to be jealous whatsoever...and I in a way feel I'm alone and that makes me want to grow and someday if I have the opportunity to bring in anyone I'd love to monitor the person's growth from a distance but not to meddle in the person's business as to bring him or her down in any form if I happen to even know his or her username on here.Just as seeds are planted in the same land but different locations if a seed is looking for an encouragement inside the soil before it grows that means it will never sprout they all are hidden deep in the soil without any knowledge of another around yet they sprout and just before you know it they'll see each other at the top when they've become trees. So grow up by learning here don't wait to monitor another person's growth by asking for username of the member or whatever before you can grow. If you know anyone here you should look away from the person and build yourself in knowledge. This is very paramount.Summarily,  being anonymous:-is good and helps everyone grow well by taking down any form of unnecessary competition-it reduces external fight or confrontation (if you're known the people close to you would want to confront you if you maybe replied negatively to their post )-it also ensures safety of every member in the forum in the outside world.-it creates equal opportunity for growth in the forum(this is the major benefit as slated in the topic) This is my humble thought after many weeks of observation. You can contribute and let me know what's your take on this. I'd be reading your replies to learn more too. If you have negative response please kindly put it in a nice way if possible that I can learn please.Quote Thank you for the responses I've noted the addition from you guys and I too have learned quite a lot from my post through your insightful replies.",

      "body": "Anonymity can be described in manyfolds. When it's related to the nature of Bitcoin technology in it's self, being anonymous was one of the best practices that allowes the market to thrive since you cannot identify the owner of the next address in your node. You just basically send the transaction to the provider of the address which you should have known in the outside world. Another advantage that the Anonymity in Bitcoin technology has was and still the fact that the contemporary political powers are finding it very difficult to identify the brains behind the technology, therefore, it is difficult to arrest something that's close to nothing - since you don't know them and cannot identify either. Generally I can say that anonymity has provided a level playing field for the growth and development of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, however, anonymity doesn't necessarily eliminates competition, especially in the face of digital currency marketplace.",

      "body": "A good piece you've got here op and a big ups to you for finding your way to the forum and I'm hoping to see you thrive and reach greater ranks here. Well in the case of anonymity, I'd say it's a choice. According to this  link, one of the questions raised was \"your reason for being anonymous, a precautionary measure or?\".. I feel your friend chose to be anonymous for so many reasons and maybe, just a wee bit invested in not being monitored by you like you mentioned.Anonymity grants you the rights to be anybody in the forum and if you check, some spammers and scammers use that to their advantage to scam and litter the place but that just shows how they are and the umbrella of anonymity can't cover that.Another thing anonymity grants you is the ability to be authentic and original without having to fear about any negative repercussions.",

Most of people will not care about anonymity when they are online but I understand if your friend actually care about it and his practice is truly helpful to protect his anonymity.QuoteAnd by and by I see why it's better he didn't tell me.

      "body": "The main purpose of the forum is to discuss bitcoin and the crypto space a large. And one of the merits of bitcoin is that it promotes privacy. The forum is a good place to learn how to practice to live a private life. That is why you are not expected to expose any personal information to register or participate in the discussion. I am aware that we have local boards where members relate in the form and sometimes meet physically but it is better to remain anonymous. Quote from: Good_Doctor on September 18, 2023, 04:43:09 AM This is very paramount.Summarily,  being anonymous:-is good and helps everyone grow well by taking down any form of unnecessary competitionUnhealthy competition is unnecessary because it could breed envy. But we have to note that there is no need to compare your account with someone else since we don't have the same level of knowledge or experience. The bottom line is that we shouldn't take a simple community too seriously. Quote-it reduces external fight or confrontation (if you're known the people close to you would want to confront you if you maybe replied negatively to their post )-it also ensures safety of every member in the forum in the outside world.-it creates equal opportunity for growth in the forum(this is the major benefit as slated in the topic)Some persons can be offended by a simple discussion in the forum and can take it personally. But I have not heard of any case of confrontation outside the forum due to replies and this should not be the case. Forum matters should be treated within the forum this is why we have an option to PM members to discuss issues. As is said before, we should not take the forum too seriously. But I got your message cleanly, to avoid unnecessary drama, it is better to remain anonymous.",

      "body": "You make a compelling case for avoiding pointless competition. Everyone involved in bitcoin and blockchain should work together to grow and share what they know.Anonymity does offer a setting in which people can express their ideas without having to worry of their outside identities. This distance makes it possible for a more real conversation based on the content rather than the person who posted it.But a word of warning: privacy can keep people from getting into fights with other people, but it can also make it easier for people to do bad things without getting caught. It has two sides. Its important to keep respectful dialogue in a place thats for learning.Your views are smart and give me a new way to look at things. It is very important to make sure that personal opinions or fights never get in the way of learning.",

      "body": "Anonymity can be done or used in a different perspective. These days people use anonymity  for cyber crimes while others use it to prevent cyber attack. However,  what you've listed counts but anonymity can come from different perspectives  depending on the level of adoption  and usage you can be anonymous  By not providing any information about yourself on a profileBy camouflage or pretending to be someone else ( still illegal)But when looking deeper we tend to hide ips, cover tracks, ghosting e.t.cGenerally in the world of crypto specifically Bitcoin people tend to go anonymous  doing transactions  and performing other activities. Like I said the perspective of your anonymity depends  on the level of adoption and what you are willing to use it for.Quote from: iBaba on September 18, 2023, 05:15:15 AMGenerally I can say that anonymity has provided a level playing field for the growth and development of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, however, anonymity doesn't necessarily eliminates competition, especially in the face of digital currency marketplace.Well it might not completely eliminate  but it helps in one way or the other as everyone remains unknown.",

This makes every user free from the risk of being exposed to the public as you know, not all country accept Bitcoin and no one would want to get into trouble with the higher authorities.Now as regards being anonymous on the forum, I do think it's a good idea.a lot of user has different reason about this though.but for the persons I have invited, I don't think I have given them my username. I only showed them how the forum works.There's nothing to compete against here on Bitcointalk, we all want to learn more about Bitcoin and maybe get to the highest rank of which is the legendary member.",

Many immediately arrive at the wrong conclusions by mere looking at faces or other identities without going through the issues they are presented with. Anonymity helps others work with people they would normally not work with in real life due to biases or pride And being anonymous benefits certain kinds of people more and could make them work better without being bothered by people constantly starring while gossiping/thinking about them instead of being very focused on their works or what matters. . Cryptocurrency space seems like a perfect place for such people as it also enables them to be hidden, focused on work, blindly execute justice and do their work without being bias towards any particular coworker, like a friend or love one. Typical workplaces are not suitable for independent minded and reserved people who likely value anonymity more.  They want to be hidden in solitary space without being bothered by unnecessary distraction/noise.  It gives them great sense of relief to be hidden in public.",
