One person even asked me if I owned a Bitcoin(which I've answered him ).I see it is kind of risk. When you wear a T-shirt with Bitcoin logo on it, you are saying with other people like I am a Bitcoin investor, I have bitcoin.The question you received from that person is like a warning for you. You can become a target of bad people so if you don't want to have that risk, don't do something like this again.Known physical Bitcoin attacks",

Some people in my country still think that bitcoin owners are rich young people because they hear the price of 1 btc reaches tens of thousands of dollars without knowing that we can only have 0.0005 btc in our wallet. Then of course this will become the center of public attention and believe me it will be very uncomfortable when people who don't learn about bitcoin ask you how to get 1 bitcoin quickly.I prefer to promote bitcoin in other ways. For example, by telling my friends that bitcoin is a good investment asset and I have also collected several bitcoin dollars.",

In your case similar thing is present and a lot of members suggested that wearing Bitcoin clothes in public is not good because some bad people will target you and my give harm you or steal your Bitcoin or valuable things and this is true but has anyone tried to see that other side of picture. Well, I don't think that someone will identify that and that is a positive message to the public. Yes, you read the right thing, we know a lot of people did not know even in 2023 because of the fewer advertisements of Bitcoin, and wearing Bitcoin clothes will spread Bitcoin to larger people when someone looking at your shirt and sees the logo of Bitcoin they will surely check it on Google once they reach to their house.",
