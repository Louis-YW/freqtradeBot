It is when they later know that gambling can not give them the expected earning,  they may decide to stay or quit gambling. The secondary reason is the reason they decided to stay if not addicted.",

Moreover, nowadays gambling platforms are increasingly easy to access, with just a few dollars now they can make deposits and play various games directly from their devices.",

      "body": "There are many underlying reasons why people first decide to go into gambling. Then as time goes on that curiosity or the boredom and loneliness they wished to kill by gambling soon turn into an ever consuming desire to win money and this becomes the driving Force for them. It is not gender-specific but relates to all genders. But when it comes to addiction I feel that there are more women who are closet gamblers that are struggling with gambling addiction but don't know how to seek for help because of people will say. This is where more work needs to be done to help more women speak up so their addiction can be easily addressed.",

For other countries then it's different again.It may also be that they initially want to be a fun entertainment at gambling when there is boredom at home, but that makes them unable to be sure of winning because here the loss will be greater than winning, I never encourage women to gamble and even prohibit it, but it is for my own family, but this cannot be different in countries where gambling is legal.",

This has eventually turn into frequent trips or long session in gambling. Loneliness must be one. I have lived with my aunt for more than a year and their neighbors told me, she wasn't a gambler at all until her husband sailed to the sea for years. The husband occasionally calls her but that's just it. After hearing so many tales about what sailors do when they dock at a port, they do stuff like take a girl to their cabin.I think that really got into her and so she tried entertaining herself in some resorts and found friends who are gamblers. Yep, she is well-known in nearby casinos.",

Obviously, you just answered your own question. Well, they are that talkative when they're with peers so probably just want something to tell what's happening in their lives while gambling but here in my area, women treat it as men do.",

This has eventually turn into frequent trips or long session in gambling. I have seen ladies that do betting fun and ambition and that is drive by their love for sports, they love to drag opponents when it comes to debate and the most fun of it is when they show off their bets anytime they win. To be honest, I think women are more dedicated and mind controlled when it comes to gambling, they know how to play(the few I have seen on tittok and podcasts) and when they lose, you wouldn't hear pim from them or get angry, that is how gambling is meant to be and when they play casino games, they don't bother about the outcome because girls are feminine and feminine love games.I'm not sure but I think I haven't seen women that is gambling addicted, mostly it's the men that always turn out to be gambling addicted or maybe that is because of nature of men to look for money anywhere there is but I think women loves money more, they should be the ones that is addicted but always turned out to be the opposite of what the guys do in gambling.",

But you forgot to add “the desire to get rich by pressing one magic slot machine button.”\"What is the drive that makes women go into gambling?\" - probably the same as men, no? Why is this division of gamblers into men and women even necessary?For the casino, everyone is equal. For the casino, it doesn’t matter who the money is drawn from, whether it’s a man or a woman.",

There are many reasons for someone who decides to get involved in gambling whether men or women they certainly have their own goals and reasons and of course there are a variety of differences.Some people may enter gambling especially women because they want to find satisfaction by gambling or even with the aim of gambling as the main means of venting their emotions or venting their mistakes regarding several things that have happened.If we do research by directly asking female gamblers for their reasons for gambling almost all of the answers will be to have fun and seek entertainment but apart from these reasons there are actually other things that they may be reluctant to mention.",

This has eventually turn into frequent trips or long session in gambling. Your illustration might be relative. The main reason why the poor gamble is not for fun but for money.  So I can conclude that most financially stable women who gamble do that for fun and not necessarily for money. But I can certainly say that most women in poor nations gamble because they are seeking alternative means of income. A poor woman is seeking for means to feed and wouldn't consider spending money in casinos just for fun. The majority of the women I know who gambled learned it either from male partners or male relatives. And they are motivated to stake when they see people winning games.",
