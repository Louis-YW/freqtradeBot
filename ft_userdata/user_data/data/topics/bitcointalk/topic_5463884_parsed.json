You can do with Ignore and you also can Undo with Unignore under a username. It is an esiest way.Alternatively, you can go to the Ingore User page and add that username manually.Code:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1806262;sa=ignprefsThis feature has its disadvantagesIgnore helps you to ingore posts of the ignored user but if that user's posts quoted by other users, you will see those ignored user's posts.Don't click on that username and check his post history, you will see posts of that users. Ingore does not work at post history page.11 years ago, the forum has this weird highlight.Quote from: theymos on March 12, 2012, 07:49:12 AMCurrent rules are:- 0.35% of very-established users ignore you: no public highlight, but a range on your posts that only you can see- 0.5% of very-established users ignore you: light highlight- 1% of very-established users ignore you: medium highlight- 1.5% of very-established users ignore you: dark highlightYou're very established if:- You have 100+ hours of online time- You have 100+ posts- You registered 30+ days agoThere are ~1414 very-established users right now.The change only shows up in the default theme.Unfortunately it was removed by theymos. Could you bring it back theymos, please. By a chance like future April fools.Quote from: theymos on March 12, 2012, 07:45:24 AMOK, I added an indication of how ignored someone is (by very-established users) without revealing the exact count. We'll see how it goes. I might remove it later.",

Yes, it is possible to put members on ignore list. If you don't like the posts of a user then you have option to ignore that user, but I don't think that ignoring a use is necessary because sometimes such users can create helpful posts that you may miss if you put them on ignore list. In my ignore list there isn't even a single user, and I don't think that there ever will be someone in my ignore list.If you want to know that how to put someone in your ignore list then read the reply of @OmegaStarScream and @Cantsay because both of them shared the way to do that. I hope you got your answer and it would be nice if you can lock this thread because you'll won't get more information about the topic and there will be non-useful replies if you don't lock the post.",

Yes you can and it is very easy to do. just click the ignore button from the left corner of under every profile avatar. And if you put someone in your ignore list it will be completely private and your ignore list will only be visible to you and no one else will be able to see it. So you can feel free to put anyone on your ignore list. ¬†For this you will not have any problem You can keep as many users as you want in your ignore list There is no limitation for ignore list",

Nobody that is above ignored in the forum, you can put any person or user you like for ignored list, because I believe that ignored list is the main place you can put someone for you not to read everything it have written, so I believe that very well concerning that, so therefore when you click ignored column the person's post or comment can not be seen by you any longer, so I believe that many people have given you instance or circled description were to click to ignored people. What I notice is tye reason while people do like to put some people in the blacklist that, maybe they don't comprehend the person way of writing, so therefore they ignored them.",
