  "content": "Hi everyone! These users - DireWolfM14/n0nce/Chahan/Maasdamer/logfiles, using their authority, unreasonably call me a scammer. I haven't committed any scam though. They call me a scammer and trying to present in front of everyone a scammer by throwing red and yellow flags at me after I created a topic in the exchange thread. Here is a link to this topic - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406561.0In this thread, I, like many other users, create topics, they want to exchange their long-delisted tokens for any of the convenient coins. In my topic, I offered to exchange my UST tokens for USDT or other coins, just like other users do in their topics. I wonder why exchanging an unknown BTCX token is not a scam? - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406374.0It token costs next to nothing, and my UST token is still traded on many exchanges. Information about the price of the UST token is available. And where is the scam?I ask everyone who is not indifferent to the situation to press the button \"Oppose\" -https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3009",

You should just both stop using this board for your personal quarrel and lock this thread already. You can settle this via PM or ignore each other.I saw how other users in the exchange thread offer to exchange their tokens that are not listed anywhere for USDT. I didn’t create the first topic about fraud, it was he who started it, I see him for the first time and we are unfamiliar",

I created a topic and am looking for a loan, when the lender asks if I have collateral, I honestly answer that I don’t have any collateral, only 100 UST (US Terra), NOT $100 (US Dollar), but no one wants to take them. Accordingly, if I have no collateral and no one takes 100 UST (US Terra) as collateral, and NOT $100 (US Dollar), this means that I have no collateral. Everyone knows the price of the UST token, this is not classified information. Reading in other topics in the lending thread, some users are also looking for a loan, they are asked if you can give some kind of collateral? They also honestly answer that there is no collateral, but they could give 5-10$ that remained in the wallet. Now tell me where is the scam?",
