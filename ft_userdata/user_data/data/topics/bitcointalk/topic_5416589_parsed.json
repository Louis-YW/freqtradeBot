Their team is from canada and vetted and has had the most active github in crypto already several times with millions of lines of code. They got some seed money by venture capital firms but are also vetted by Kucoin. Yet their market cap is under $5m still. Which even for a bear is extremely low.  I got financially independent with Chainlink in the 2018 Bear market because Chainlink still did great and I got it very cheap. Now I see the same opportunity with Modefi. Modefi is under $5m market cap, and chainlink is at $4bn. If Modefi goes only to $0,5bn some day, that is already x100.   How could you ever make x100 with Chainlink?",

Thats why you can see they just do coding (millions of lines of codes) and they dont need people to buy this token they just want to be much better than Chainlink and revolutionize crypto. Each newbie can say that it wasn't their token but the truth is that they are only shilling it but don't worry as some as still going to check it and if it's true that its a better version of chainlink then chances are that this coin will be successful someday.Social media manager has nothing to do with coding. They can code all they want but they can also hire social media manager at the same time to post an update about their project or to simply spread their name around the web. They don't force people to invest on them? How humble they are but how can they beat chainlink that way? When I think the number of investors is an indication of how strong the project is.",

It can be x100 but can also disappear after a sleep because with such low transaction volume it is no different from shitcoins. If I had to choose between modefi and chainlink, I would choose chainlink, I'd rather get less profit but I'm safe in return. Modefi is a new project and I really don't see anything too outstanding for me to take risks with it. You know, new projects are often very risky and the risk is higher when we are in a downtrend.",

I think a better investment is DeFi, which is set to replace traditional banking and so I'm going to invest in MAXX finance. Also, if you really want LINK without buying it then consider getting a crypto cash back card that has rewards in LINK, like Coinbase or Blockfi. This way every time you spend you get some LINK back, which will eventually be worth more than what you actually bought with cash, so the cards kind of pay themselves off over time.",

Bitcoin is the number and pioneering coin that all who doubt its capacity will surely fail.But those listed above?
