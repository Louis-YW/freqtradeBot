Bitcoin price was over $30000 or even $40000 during Luna and UST crash, that was when bitcoin crashed to $17600 before it increased to $25000 and decreased to $18000 like that like repeatedly. It was around $21000 before the FTX implosion that crashed it below $15600.",

It's likely that it will pass $17K and will even be very close to $18K, as I'm hesitant to say more than that right now. This is caused by the slow movement of Bitcoin prices in the market for higher levels so I only believe in the price range of $ 17K - $ 18K in the near future. What do you think about @OP ?",

My prediction is that if bitcoin can recover, then chances of bitcoin hitting the 18k$ before falling again. According to my predictions for Q1, I think we are going to have another red quarter, and I think we'll bottom out this bear season in Q1 of 2023.",

This might take bitcoin price towards 30k or so.",

No buyers mean no demand, no demands mean no price hike. I'd rather stick with that kind of expectation than be mad about rushing the value to go up. It will happen but I just don't feel it yet. There's no big player trying to buy loads of Bitcoin now. Maybe they are waiting for another big dump.",

Due to this many investors instead of holding their coins, sold it. Now as there were more sell orders then buy orders, this lead Bitcoins to go down in the prices. If we see the last week, then Bitcoins really tried hard to get out of the price segment by breaking the resistance, but still it was not at all good to be honest. Now everyone is just holding the coins and hoping for some positive signs. January is the time when BTC needs to prove his capabilities. Letâ€™s hope for the best.",

Since then, the price of bitcoin has been fluctuating between $17k and below for months, and it hasn't touched $20k yet. Because of no positive news yet in the crypto market of recent that can trigger the bitcoin price, am speculating that the price of bitcoin will hang around between $16k and $17k throughout the end of January.",

The price can fall but it will always bounce back so you still earn no matter what.If there is only one thing that I can't agree with you for now then that is my prediction about this January is negative because the price of BTC is still the same. You know when it is positive if it started the first week even with some minor recoveries but no that didn't happen. Reaching $17k isn't that hard because it's only $1k away from the current price but $20k rather although it is possible since we already get there before.",
