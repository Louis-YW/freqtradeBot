We are recovering and now there are green graphs again pooping up on the screens so it's long term profit margin associated with bitcoin and if you understand it's technical working and know the importance of decentralisation then you know bitcoin is the financial freedom you can get for future.At this time the bitcoin market cap is $472.5 Billion dollars after the dump also but real estate market is old age and have well established buisness line but in recent year trends you would see people have preferred bitcoin investment more due to returns associated with them and use as payment mode also.The big institutions are taking part in accepting bitcoin and we have LN channels for fast confirmation with increased capacity each time of bitcoin so it's definitely worth investing in it.But if i would advise you then avoiding altcoins is good because we see lot of deviations in the top-10 and most of them are pump dump scheme coins giving you nothing but only scamming you of your funds.So sticking with bitcoin is best option but if you plan to hold only for long term as we might see another bull run soon and we are heading towards next halving.",

Don’t get me wrong but I think it’s this type of presentations about Crypto-currency that get non-crypto enthusiast to have a wrong start. Are you looking for ways to cash out yes their a tons of opportunities outside Crypto-currency for that, this should not be the main idea to making you a crypto enthusiast, people has gone sick investing and losing in the wrong coin because they thought it’s all rosey here. Make a real presentation about Crypto-currency it’s advantages over traditional processes and also the gains of investing and the agony of not investing wisely.",

Well, in general, this is exactly so, but with some reservations. Intermediaries will appear one way or another at the stage of converting btc to $$$. And at this moment, \"cheapness\" will acquire some noticeable cost. You can, of course, look for an exchange of face to face, but where is the guarantee that this will not end in a robbery at the time of the transaction. So, all the same, for some actions it is better to have intermediaries that are trusted, well-known and with a reliable reputation that do not require excessive identification and verification.Quote from: Cuda911 on August 11, 2022, 12:52:25 PMBTC goes up to 69,000$ what more can it do?

After all, it has already gone from $0 to ~$70.000 in a little over 10 years. I don't think that further growth will be as rapid, but it will still please bitcoin holders. 700k $, which Pmalek spoke about above, would be too good, but in a very, very distant future, it is also quite realistic. Not in the next 10 or 20 years, but much later.",

A serious dog should be able to bit immediately it senses danger, rather than barking to scare the danger. A dog that bits without barking is a wicked dog, it should be able to bark in order to alert his owners before bitting. Anyone bitten by dog should die, and if anyone survives dog big, it means that the dog is not from Canidae (dogs) family. A dog is not supposed to bit his best friend (man).This is exactly the case of bitcoin. While many says it won't reach an ATH of about $70k again, now I am seeing another dumb argument that if it reaches $70k, it means that btc is dead Well, I am no longer bothered because bitcoin has passed this stage of baseless speculations. Some people are into bitcoin because of the security, some because of liberty, perhaps some kind of privacy, others because of price movement. And then, there is no day that everyone would lose interest spontaneously to collapse bitcoin. Remember, as you are praying for bull to make profits, some are praying for bear to buy and buy while some will never sell whether it is bear or bull. You see? Bitcoin is not joking, it's staying for long.",

As a decentralized currency, bitcoin is still in the early stages of becoming the choice of most people in the future in daily transactions. We expect higher price potential and volatility, but if more adoption occurs then we expect better stability.OP, There is always time to buy bitcoin as long as you are sure you want to own and buy it. Hold or day trading is an option you may or may not agree to, but basically you can buy bitcoin at any time as they are traded 24 hours for 7 days on local and international exchanges. We can not always expect high prices that bring big profits for traders or investors, sometimes we can also think of the network and its function as a means of payment.",
