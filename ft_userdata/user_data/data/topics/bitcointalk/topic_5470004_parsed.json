From their conversation it was obvious that they were a circle of close three friends that gamble together.After all I finished with my bet headed home and was asking myself what could the colleague act that way avoiding his close friends they all gambling together and just because luck shines on him first he decides to create a distance and class.

When you put expectations on people all you will get from them disappointments so i have learned to live on my own and not expect much from people. True, in the matter of human identity and how people really are we can test using money, as you say \"money can reveal the human identity\" honestly I really agree with this statement, which is already quite a lot of people who prove this including I have also tried it on several friends around me, And well besides that, a large enough victory in gambling can also answer about how people are, when they win they will like to hide and avoid you, and when they lose they like to continue to follow you, I have proven it where one of my friends avoids and I don't know what caused it and then I heard from one of my other friends that he just hit a big jackpot.I honestly don't know how to deal with things like this, because it involves the personality and nature of each individual, but well don't take them too seriously, just let them go if they don't harm you and also certainly don't expect anything. If they have a good awareness and sense of solidarity then they will also definitely give you a little of their winnings, but if not then let it go as long as it doesn't harm you even though you are actually very kind to that person or like to help them. The most painful disappointment is when you expect people.",

I have come across situations in my life more than once when you expect a friend to do something that he will not do, and then it came as a complete surprise to me when it came to money. After this experience, I stopped believing in trusting relationships between people. There is even an expression that you cannot build a business with friends or relatives because you will definitely quarrel. You also cannot lend money. Many people think that these are just words until they encounter it.",

He could really just start saying he has plans for the money he won and buy drinks for the 2 as a way of saying it's all he could share.",

This is why it is commonly said that, you never know who your brother, sister or friend is until he or she have made some good amount of money.I have heard or read a story of two friends who put money together to bet on one game, the game won and the total amount of money they won was amounting to over 200 million in their local currency, that is a very huge amount of money, but unfortunately, one of the two friends, packed his things and absconded with the bet ticket while the other was asleep.This is to tell you how wicked a man can be to his fellow men. Never trust anybody, no matter how good they seem to be, for they might just be hiding their true self in order to please you.",

Actually, it's a security measure gamblers should adopt, even regards family and relatives. After a big win, lots of people will start approaching with interest on your prize and on what you can proportionate them in material matters.We can't judge if those bald men were close friends to the winner gambler and how their relationship was. Maybe the winner has his personal reasons to get distance from them and wants privacy to enjoy his prize, what should be understood and respected, in every cases. People around should stop paying attention to friends' lives and focus on thriving their own.",

There are certain reasons for judging friends who win at gambling and avoid us.Example:* I have a friend who gambled and he won, after winning his cell phone was not active, he couldn't contact him and he avoided not seeing us for three days.But on the fourth day he called and wanted to meet with us, then we met and asked what happened, why are you avoiding and not communicating with us.He answered: I'm not avoiding and running away from you, it's just that I don't want anyone else to know that I won gambling, except you who know, but now it's safe so we drink and eat.Maybe the person you saw had their own reasons for that, maybe we should think positively, unless the person who won the gambling really avoided the friend who talked to them for a month or two, maybe you have to ask why and what happened.",

Maybe there's a backstory about that, I am not siding to the gambler but maybe he has been betrayed or they don't want for his friend to ask for little money or even to lend some money who knows right.

They are his friends so he knows them more than we do. He might feel insecure because of the amount of money he now controls. There are friends that I will avoid if I win big. We have seen situations where friends organize the kidnapping or robbing of their pal all because of money. When it comes to the issue of money, you can not trust anybody. It is important to regulate your movement when you have some amount in your account. It could also be because he feels that they might become parasites so he needs to avoid them.  Some friends will seize this opportunity to beg or take a loan from you until they finish the money. It can also be that thier friend feels that they are no longer in his class. Be as it may, it is not good to abandon good old friends.",

It can also be that thier friend feels that they are no longer in his class. Be as it may, it is not good to abandon good old friends. You have stated two good reasons which can be connected. He can first avoid them for them not to be parasite. Some friends can because of the stinginess of their friend that won big, kidnap him to collect money because he is stingy. But if we also still think about it, the friend can avoid them but that does not mean they can not still kidnap him. I think more towards the parasite direction. What I will also say is that friends know themselves more than other people, I will not conclude in something like this also.",

Actually things like this happen frequently but it doesn't make sense. But use money to test people's behavior if you want to learn more about them. It Simply demonstrates that the guy is not a true friend. Why will you stop hanging out with your friend's now that you are wealthier than them? Perhaps he thing his friends will put all their financial problems on him, but if he is careless and ends up spending  the money carelessly, he will return to the friend's he avoiding when he was wealthy. Allow someone to be wealthy if you truly want to get a sense of their true character. Not everyone you call a friend is actually a friend, some are simply acting like one because they are getting something out of you, but once they have money, you'll be able to see what they're really like.",

He wants to stay low because he doesn't want many people to know about his winning.

He would be thinking that his colleagues would ask him for money and he doesn't want to give them any.3. He might be busy enjoying his reward elsewhere.",
