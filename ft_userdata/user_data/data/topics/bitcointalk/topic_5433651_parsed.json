      "body": "IMO and JUST IMOThe manager is responsible for the payments for the work done for the participants. So if someone was owed $50 they get the $50. This should come out of the campaign managers pocket.If the company paying for it wants to pay the people to keep a good image out there that is up to them.The rest of the funds is a semi private thing between the company and the manager. If they want to go after them legally or just take the loss or whatever is not really any of our business.If they WANT they can post about it and discuss it here in public, but there is no reason to. Once the participants get paid, it's no longer our concern.-Dave",

      "body": "When I 1st started managing I had used an escr9w by the name of masterP. He did a great job for a month or so and I thought he had a decent reputation. Needless to say he ended up scamming a few users. I'm not sure the total amount he stole but there was 7-8 btc stolen from me IIRC. I had taken my proof to the companies and most of them ate the loss. I felt terrible and paid out nearly 2btc from my pocket at the time even though many were saying it was not my responsibility.  That caused me to start holding funds for campaigns myself. Now getting to your question, should managers be held responsible? Depends on the situation IMO. This person has managed a few btc paying campaigns I believe but mainly manages bounties.In most cases the manager is going to be responsible,  but if said manager can show proof they were hacked(and I mean absolute fucking proof) then there may be some leniency but they'd still have to repay the company somehow. If an actual escrow was used, then yes. This is not an escrow, this is a manager golding the funds. Escrow is defined as a 3rd party. What happens is going to be based off of how the community feels about julerz and the situation and whether they believe his/her story.",

Main idea of a third party in a deal is in that. If a third party doesn't guarantee the coordinated payment than why is it needed?So all that is definitely about trust: leaving a feedback basing on how the one treats escrowed money is a correct usage of forum's trust system.

First, it is his service and he is paid for it.  Second, unless parties agrees that escrow shouldn't held responsible for any losses of the fund, escrow bear 100% responsibility if things like hacks happened. Just like what happened in julerz12 case. Being a bounty manager and at the same time escrow should held him liable for any losses.  Although I don't think that he hacked the fund himself, he must bear the responsibility of paying back the escrowed money which I think he is promising to do, taking responsibility of the incident.",

But that doesn't stop him from being held responsible for what happen, and in your own case too. It's good you are accepting responsibility for your negligence in handling the campaign funds entrusted in you custody based on trust but at this point, the trust has been betrayed by what happened. But what ever ways, you try to reach an agreement with the company team on repayment plans,  because that is the honourable thing toe do right now in this situation.",

If anything, he has several times admitted that he fucked up by being too relaxed on his wallet security while at the same time he has offered to sell off his bike to raise cash for the repayment of the debts he has incurred on this. I hope he doesn't get tagged by some until this situation is resolved. His account and the bounty he manages here are his only sources of income, according to his confession. Getting his account tagged will destroy it and keep him out of business. That will be double jeopardy.",

A fatal error when you use a hot wallet as an escrow fund store and your carelessness does not install additional antivirus. I feel it will be related to malware infiltrating and stealing your hot wallet access password.Hot Wallet will never be safe if you don't think about additional protection, you really have to learn from the mistakes that are happening now to be more concerned with security.The users of this forum are smart people, so you won't get red paint as long as you can be responsible and solve these problems to restore your reputation.

If you are going to escrow a deal then you need to have enough money in reserve to cover the escrowed amount and repay the affected party in case things go wrong.A camapain manager doesn't necessary need to escrow the campaign funds. He can hire someone else for that job.",
