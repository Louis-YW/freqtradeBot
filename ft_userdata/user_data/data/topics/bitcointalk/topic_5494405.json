That is a perfect name it can be called. Not time chain because time can not chain together.

RBF is double spending that people use to increase the fee or to cancel a transaction. Because car can lead to accident, should that be the reason we should not use car?",

I do get your point and I suppose timechain could be an alternative name however after many year sof using blockchain are we really to change it now?The general public have not yet even fully understood what a blockchain actually is and now we want to change it already.",

I would care less if the name is change but for others, I mean those who are yet to understand bitcoin concepts, if a name change is done like the author in the article proposes, there will be mass misunderstanding and confusion since the term blockchain is what we all know and is already well understood.

Now you keep making threads that you don't like the term \"blockchain\", LOL. But I have a question, in the end what can you do to change what you don't like? How can you get people to stop thinking of bitcoin as not a cryptocurrency, how can you get people to stop calling blockchain and instead the \"timechain\" concept that you mentioned? If we can't change anything then what's the point of this discussion? I have an idea, why don't you take your idea to the developers or wherever you think can change what you don't like?",

Well, that's if anyone supports you at all because what you proved there was just out of point. Now is \"timechain\" again believing you know it better. Aside from the fact that the word itself is odd, it's more of a conspiracy theory when it is blocks we fill and build in the cryptocurrency world.
