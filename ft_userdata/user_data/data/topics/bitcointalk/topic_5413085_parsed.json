The SKU models have become well-known due to a Vietnamese shop also. Merchants are not only reserving RTX 40 series to fill their 'next-gen' inventory, but they are also aggressively displaying the new series on their websites. The RTX 4090 GAMING OC is priced at 4270 AUD (2915 USD), just a placeholder. Probably similar to what we see before each high-end GPU introduction.https://www.guru3d.com/news-story/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-gpus-are-listing-at-some-online-stores,3.htmlOfficial sales were promised in October 2022RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 are rumored to be unveiled on September 20https://www.championat.com/cybersport/news-4812809-nvidia-tizerit-pokaz-rtx-4080-i-rtx-4090-na-20-sentyabrya.html?https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-beyond-gtc-22-special-broadcast/",

EVGA for me is (was) the best partner of Nvidia.I had some EVGAs and all of them are great gpus, without any problemsIt was the first in my country to offer 3 year warranty, even if we need to send to US after the first year, but at least we had 2 more years of warranty, and the warranty always worked.It's a shame for Nvidia to lose this kind of partner, the situation in Nvidia is not good at the moment, this is not their first loss.I wish EVGA goes to AMD in a near future, but as they said, they are leaving GPUs, maybe they will focus on another stuff they already produces, like PSU, Motherboards, mice and keyboards etc",
