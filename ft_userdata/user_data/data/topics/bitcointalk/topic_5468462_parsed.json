  "content": "The lawyers representing out of luck Terraform Labs and it's CEO, Do Kwon, in the ongoing cae with the SEC have insisted against the extradition request made by the securities and exchange commission regulator. They submitted a petition yesterday that is asking the court to refuse the SEC request and insist it is impossible to have Do Kwon moved to US for further questioning over his involvement in the crash of the Terra ecosystem on October 13 since he is being held at  Montenegro with \"no scheduled release or extradition date\". These lawyers further countered the SEC alternative request to seek for a preclusion order which will prevent Do Kwon from filing a motion on summary judgment as they believe such a request will affect the Court's individual Rules of Practice.It is worth noting that even Do Kwon's home country of South Korea are also seeking an extradition order to probe the co founder of Terraform Labs over the collapse of the Terra crypto project; an incidence which saw $40bn being wiped from the crypto market.This brings me to wonder what people see in these half baked projects that make them invest so much? Is that they don't make their research before hand?I know Daniel Shin is co founder but it looks like it's Do Kwon that has the lion share of the court battles. Or am I wrong here?https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-kicks-against-secs-extradition-request/",

      "body": "His legal team are playing balls but they cannot save him. Based on how popular terra luna and UST were and the number of lives that were wrecked as a result of the crash, I'm not surprised that SEC is requesting for an extradition of Do Kwon to the United States. US is always interested in high profile cases like this and at some point I'm certain the Montenegrin authorities will not be able to stand the pressure but to have him released to the either the United States or South Korean government for trial but I'd prefer the US.

Furthermore, what's the point of research if you don't understand the basics, and the fact is that this idea was doomed from the start. As for extradition, I would definitely like that scammer to end up in the US because he will receive a much more appropriate punishment there than in South Korea. Now the only question is how much the US wants that criminal, that is, what counter-favor will the Montenegrins demand for his extradition.",

I guess I was too lazy to check if a thread related to Do Kwon has already been created and I didn't intentionally mean to spam. I'd just lock this one up. Thanks for pointing it out, tho.",
