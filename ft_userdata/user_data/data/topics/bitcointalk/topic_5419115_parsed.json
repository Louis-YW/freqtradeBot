  "content": "The Danger of Covid 19 VaccineI Put the color in red because of what the Covid 19 vaccine did to a pregnant girl in my residence today. A girl of 17 or there about, was pregnant for about 3 months but the pregnancy was not shown, and yesterday afternoon she went to the hospital and took the Covid 19 vaccine and she came back home. In the night been the 31 of October. 2022. The vaccine began to work in the body system. And she died in the night against the 1st day of November. Now some people are saying that the nurse who injected the vaccine is the one killed because she (the nurse) even asked the girl and she denied that she not pregnant but I said, since the nurse saw a pregnancy sign from the girl's stomach she would tested pregnancy test on the girl before injecting the vaccine. While others are saying that she , the girl killed herself. Please share this information to Bitcointalk women: pregnant women should not take the Covid 19 vaccine.",

In fact, pregnant women are advised to get the vaccine because they have a high risk of complications if they are infected. But it is also important to state that medical issues are treated individually, which is why it is important to give medical personnel comprehensive updates about your health before the administration of drugs or any vaccine.  I am suspecting that the teenage girl was carrying out a secret abortion through crude self-drug administration. It might be she was taking some local or over-the-counter abortion pills and that led to the complication and her untimely death. This is the case in most developing nations where teenage pregnancy is seen as a taboo and sometimes these teenagers are disgraced, discriminated and sometimes banished.",

Covid vaccination is safe for everything, yes it has several minor side effects but not life taking. Something might have happened to that girl , another reason for his death. May be something with hospital environment or any other reason.",

I’m wondering what research you’ve done to ultimately conclude about the covid vaccines being bad for pregnant women after loads of medical health experts have certified it okay for pregnant women. I doubt you’re a medical health expert and I don’t think you should fault the covid vaccines outright for the death of the girl and you definitely shouldn’t spread untruths about the vaccines being bad for pregnant women. An autopsy would bring to light the cause of her death.",

Check this out.\"You Murderous Hypocrites\":Quote from: https://www.zerohedge.com/political/you-murderous-hypocrites-outrage-ensues-after-atlantic-suggests-amnesty-pandemicThe Atlantic has come under fire for suggesting that all the terrible pandemic-era decisions over lockdowns, school closures, masking, and punishing an entire class of people who questioned the efficacy and wisdom of taking a rushed, experimental vaccine - for a virus with a 99% survival rate in most, should all be water under the bridge.\"We need to forgive one another for what we did and said when we were in the dark about COVID,\" writes Brown Professor Emily Oster - a huge lockdown proponent, who now pleads from mercy from the once-shunned.\"Let's acknowledge that we made complicated choices in the face of deep uncertainty, and then try to work together to build back and move forward,\" she continues.----------Except, they weren't “in the dark” about Covid.  There were numerous sources pointing out the actual science that ran contrary to the mandate claims, and they were deliberately silenced by a vast media campaign.  Evidence suggests that media platforms worked in tandem with Big Tech, the CDC and the Biden Administration.  It was not a simple matter of overreaction, there was collusion to remove all counter-information.  Nice try, Emily....",

Instead of concluding an autopsy should be carried out on her body to know the actual cause of death. That may have been as a result of many other reasons, maybe the nurse on duty do not actually know her job and maybe administered an over dose, or maybe it was another waxing she was giving and not COVID vaccine too. It is also possible that the nurse on duty did everything correctly, knows her job but the vaccine she administered  unknowingly to her was a copy, a fake. There could be many reasons, an autopsy will reveal more.",

Although I don't know the situation in your own country.I don't disagree. It baffles me that people are still taking COVID vaccines despite the evidence that you still get COVID anyways, and some evidence that vaccinated people can get infected at elevated rates due to antibody dependent enhancement. I'll repost this article on ADE that describes it - https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03207-0 Given that we're more than two years out, nearly everybody has already gotten the disease, to which point natural immunity will do its job. Taking the vax + having natural immunity is pointless - no upside, just potential adverse effects from the vaccine. There are still the \"Covidiots\" that choose to take a booster every 6 months and continue masking -- it's best that these people just self isolate for the rest of their lives if they're going to take that much precaution. Consider it to be a branch of nosophobia.",
