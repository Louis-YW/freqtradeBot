  "content": "Bola A Tinubu is the Chairman of Ecowas and Nigeria President. He said he attended Chicago State University completing a two year program. He claimed he graduated from CSU in 1979.   Nigerians are saying he did not go to any university and he cannot be their president.When approach  to validate this man claim and share his academic record the university took a defensive stance, they countered that the provision of such details is irrelevant especially in the context of a foreign country's electoral matters. Such a stance raises questions about the transparency and veracity of the individual's claims.His opponent in the last election is demanding the statement of his result from Chicago State University and has approach the district of Illinois court. The reluctance of Chicago State University to provide any tangible records or evidence of their student raises eyebrows. It instigates deeper queries regarding the identity of the individual who claims to be Bola A Tinubu and his actual academic history.Bola A Tinubu presented two different result from CSU claiming that the staff of the school made mistake in the graduation date, signatory and logo. Why will a state university issue two different results at different times? Search for clarity continues as this situation serves as a stark reminder of transparency and due diligence in all matters especially those involving identities.Has CSU Stands firm for truth and clarity?Note: The year book for 1979 graduates from Chicago State University has vanished from their site.",

The case is closed.@TwitchySeal, you shouldn't blame OP or any Nigerian that didn't accept the prove because we have seen it in the past here in Nigeria,where politicians forge certificates and claim that they attended one school or the other abroad which ends up to be fake,and that is why you can see that investigation is still going on,since we are humans and can be corrupt,when it comes to huge sum of money because everybody have their price.Tinubu election victory is something that we didn't know how it happened, because majority of voters didn't vote for him,only INEC was the people that claimed he was the winner of the election. So the opposition party Candidate is still digging out evidence to prove the court that he isn't the right winner and other stuffs like that.",

He claimed he graduated from CSU in 1979.   Nigerians are saying he did not go to any university and he cannot be their president.Your claim that Nigerians don't want Tinubu because he didn't go to the university is not true because the minimum academic qualification for a president in Nigeria is a First School Leaving Certificate and he has the Senior Secondary School Certificate which is higher than the minimum qualification. Nigerians are not happy with the President because the election was rigged and he has many skeletons in his cupboard. There concerns about his state of origin, age, school certificates, drug cases, abetting murder, etc. Nobody knows his parents and nobody knows him in school. And he claims that all of his classmates are dead which is impossible in Nigeria. Even former president Buhari who is 80 years has classmates and Tinubu who is just 71 is saying he has no classmates. He is either lying about his age or he didn't go to school.QuoteThe reluctance of Chicago State University to provide any tangible records or evidence of their student raises eyebrows.

Why will a state university issue two different results at different times? Several Nigerians have approached the Chicago State University to confirm if the President truly graduated from the University and they have also affirmed that he was their student and graduated with honors. It is only the university that can confirm that he was their student and they have confirmed. You have to accept the fact and move on until it is proven otherwise. Cases like this can be used by powerful nations to control developing nations. There is speculation that those results were fake but a powerful nation wants to use this opportunity to protect him and gain his loyalty. This news is baseless because they are mere rumors and speculations without facts.",

He doesn't have his records straight and that is why Nigerians don't believe him to be the better choice. We all know that the election was rigged and they know that the constitution allows for swearing in despite adjudication and now they have used the judiciary to get judgement for themselves. The Nigerian constitution need to be amended not to allow for swearing in new government until whatever legal adjudication on the election was through.",

I feel like it's unnecessary. Nigeria is historically one of the African countries with the earliest and most formidable democracies in the world. Like an institution, Nigeria has constitutions and code of conducts that guides it's political and institutional processes amongst others. If the president was able to pass through the electoral process with the simple majority and inaugurated by the Chief Judge of the Federation, I think that's enough of credibility to work with.According to the Chapter VI, Part I, Section 131 of the Nigerian Constitution, a person is qualified for election to the position of president if:1. They are a citizen of Nigeria by birth;2. They have attained the age of 35 years (40 before 2018);3. They are a member of a political party and are sponsored by that political party;4. They have been educated up to at least School Certificate level or its equivalent. This School Certificate level includes the first school leaving certificate which is otherwise known as the High School, in the USA system. If that's the case, whether or not the president had a Chicago University is not pressing and not a prerequisite for becoming the president of Nigeria..Similarly, the standing requirement of the ECOWAS to be it's Chairman is to be a sitting/incumbent President of any of the West African countries. So, in a nutshell, I feel like it's unnecessary and non-topical to discuss the subject matter today and here.",

You should also be aware that when he contested as Governor of Lagos sate the primary school he filled the old boys of that school said they don't know any Bola A Tinubu. The Old boys ask the principal to find out the year he graduated, this step made their re-union as old boys impossible as nobody could verify that he was their classmate.",

Tinubu would have just submitted a First School Leaving Certificate and everything will be fine but he submitted a perceived fake bachelor's degree.  So that case is not about his academic qualification but a case of forgery. Your president claims he is 71 years old but his biological daughter is above 60 years old. If he was not convicted for drug dealing in the US why did he forfeit thousands of dollars? Hope you remember the EndSars protest when innocent protesters were massacred even when they were holding the national flag and singing the national anthem. Do you know that the electronic billboard that served as lightning for the protesters where switched off to enable the soldiers and police to carry out the killings of these protesters? That billboard was owned by Loadtsad Promomedia Limited, solely owned by Seyi Tinubu the son of the President. Can you vouch that Tinubu won the election? This election was one of the worst elections in the history of Africa. My brother iBaba Niger state has one of the best governors from my evaluation but Nigeria has one of the worst presidents.",
