      "body": "There's a reason why 80 to 90% of altcoin traders and investors lose money. You won't even know which token will be profitable at all so asking which one of them will give you the best ROI is just absurd and purely speculative. Yes you can use the fundamentals as a possible basis but who really gives a shit? Everyone will just sell them for stable coin or fiat when the bear market hits.",

      "body": "If I had to choose between two evils, I would choose Epic Cash because it is closer to the support price from which it started its ascent in 2021. Theta still has room to fall, so buying Theta, in terms of best ROI, doesn't look profitable right now. That's if you think in terms of best ROI by the end of 2022. Looking at the longer term, I would definitely choose Theta Token, as its concept is fresher and more tuned to the current market realities.",

Epic cash was a garbage token that has low volume and how can it could be compared with theta token. EPIC cash needs to be listed on the major exchange sites at least like coinbase or kraken to make it looks good. I personally think that if you are also aware about this now. The difference between the volume was saying a lot about the chance to recover. Theta can recover easily since it was on the binance exchange site but what about epic cash? This garbage token has no chance to recover.",
