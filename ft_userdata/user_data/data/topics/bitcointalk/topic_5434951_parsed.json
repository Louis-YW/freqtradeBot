      "body": "Short answer: Probably not.Loner answer: It comes down to a number of factors. Once you buy the miner and panels and some form of backup to keep it running at night and when the local power is off and the cost of the internet and so on then you may eventually get past the base RoI and start making some profit. So long as the equipment has no issues, there are no taxes & local regulations that may force a longer time to get to profit and so on.Add in the fact the difficulty keeps going up and the price may be up or down and you get a long drawn out amount of math that may not be accurate in a week when the price and difficulty change.-Dave",

      "body": "In the case of running two Antminers S19 Pro, you can build up an array from let's say something like mainstream Longi 450W panels, for example - 20 of them for a total of 9 kWp and an 8 kW inverter. That should be enough to power them during the day and to trickle charge a battery of 40 kWh so you have something you can run off during the night.Panels, inverter, installation, and wiring would be around 10-12k$, and battery anywhere from 10-15k$ to 30-40k$, depending on if you're going to build it yourself or use something off the shelves.It's a pretty substantial investment, it all depends if you're going long-term, 5+ years, at least in the case of the solar system, but five years is nothing in their world because they can last up to 20 to 30 years easily, so it all boils down to how you look at it, if the math fits to what's your use case for them",

      "body": "One would need very powerful and genuine equipment, especially the batteries, to keep the miners running day and night. When the batteries get juiced up, it takes time to charge up and get back to full potential, so there should be more than enough backup (this is why some people use solar energy as just backup)Also remember that if it's rainy season or if the weather is mostly cloudy, the batteries won't fully charge, so relying only on solar energy becomes hectic.On top of that, Most solar equipment from China is substandard, from Batteries to the panels, inverters and charge controllers, so with continuous usage be sure that some of the equipment will need to be constantly maintained and even replaced. I personally discovered that the battery life span is 3â€“5 years (yeah, the one from China)Long answer short, this is a very costly venture and ROI may take a very long time.",

      "body": "The first question would be, were in Nigeria? Â Cause if you're Port-Harcourt you're looking at an annual PVOUT of 1250kwh, if you're in Katsina it goes up to 1750 kwh.That's the kWh production for 1kw of installed solar panels on average.Add the costs, put at least a 30% margin on the power capacity for the solar panels compared to the miner consumption so you can actually mine without peak hours, and add all the costs as I have no clue how much those will cost imported with transport and taxes and install there if there are any government subsidies or anything like this and draw the line. Going a bit to the extreme, you spend $1000 for 1Kw system, giving you 1250kwh a year, which would allow you miner to run 15 days, earning you 100$. You get them cheaper and you're in a better location, you spend $500 (highly doubt it) for $140 a year.Not including the miner itself in the above!",

      "body": "Mining with solar energy is a promising idea in theory, as it would allow for a sustainable and renewable source of energy to power mining operations. However, in practice there are several challenges that need to be overcome for it to be a viable option.One of the main challenges is that mining operations often require a large amount of energy, and solar power alone may not be able to provide enough energy to sustain the operation. Additionally, mining operations are often located in remote areas where access to sunlight may be limited, making it difficult to rely on solar power as a primary energy source.Another challenge is that mining equipment and machinery is often not designed to be powered by solar energy, so retrofitting existing equipment to use solar power can be difficult and costly.Despite these challenges, some mining companies have started to explore the use of solar energy as a supplement to traditional energy sources, and there is ongoing research into developing more efficient and cost-effective solar technologies that could be used in mining operations.In short, mining with solar energy is possible, but it is still facing many challenges and it is not yet a widely adopted solution.",

Solar potential is not as simple, for example, Canada has more potential for solar than Germany or England, and Mongolia than India! Check, just latitude is not enough for comparison !https://globalsolaratlas.info/mapQuote from: CryptounityCUT on January 19, 2023, 07:08:08 AMAnother challenge is that mining equipment and machinery is often not designed to be powered by solar energy, so retrofitting existing equipment to use solar power can be difficult and costly.There is such a thing as retrofitting miners to use a different kind of energy, it's electricity and you need an inverter even for your home appliances as you need to convert the direct current generated by your panels. Miners don't need any adjustment!Quote from: CryptounityCUT on January 19, 2023, 07:08:08 AMOne of the main challenges is that mining operations often require a large amount of energy, and solar power alone may not be able to provide enough energy to sustain the operation. A single solar panel can't indeed provide too much energy but the same is for a powerplant that will burn just 1 kg of coal.A solar farm that generates 1Gwh will power the same amount of miners as a 1Gwh output from a nuclear plant or hydro plant, let's not get into things like what weights more, a kilo of iron or a kilo of pillows.",

      "body": "In my opinion, solar mining is not a big task and can be set up easily if someone wants but I feel that it will not be of much use because of the fact that its setup cost is really high and also we can't predict that if there will enough sun exposure on any particular day or bad weather, we won't be able to mine with full potential if we only rely on solar power as we only be 12 hours or less uptime on the pool due to the fact that we can only mine when there is Sun. So to wrap it up I would say for hobby it is doable on small scale, but personally I won't use it as my primary source of energy for mining. Also for the Nigeria part would say it would be better to keep them running in china, by some friends or contacts you may know, it would be better as they would run there 24*7 = earning more, and you can compensate the person who is running for you them abroad, this way import taxes and shipping costs can be avoided.",

But, if you enjoy doing it, want to learn how to do it and understand the process then there is no reason not to do it.The OP asked a question, will it be profitable. The answer is really probably not. The question was not if they should do it or not.Back in the early 2000s over a few years a neighbor of my parents rebuilt a 1980s Ferrari 308. For the cost of parts and the 1000s of hours of labor he really could have gotten a part time job stocking shelves at minim wage at the local supermarket and BOUGHT a fully restored one AND had more money and free time. But he would not have had nearly as much fun. He sold it at a loss based on money and time invested and went out and started doing another one......-Dave",

Adding solar to the mix just increases the time for your ROI.Cheapest method is no batteries Let it stop at night (or grid tie inverter, use the network as battery). Of course, that means at least twice longer waiting for ROI (unless bitcoin market price enters a bull cycle).The S19 is like 3500W so yeah 4000W in panels for each is about right.I think you would need to sacrifice half your budget for the solar setup, so if you had for two S19, now you have for 1 + solar.Well at least the sun isn't going to rise your bill, not sure about connecting it with a grid tie, maybe its illegal or unfeasible in Nigeria.I'd say its a long term investment. There isn't much to maintain if you skip batteries, clean the panels once per year with a hose or something. They can easily last a couple of decades and even after that they are like 80% efficient so not worthless either.Batteries degrade like every 3 years or so, so... I don't like them and they are expensive and heavy and you would need too many of them to keep things running at night, really not worth it.",

It also disappears completely during the night).All these factors make it difficult to accurately calculate the number of solar panels needed, as well as the rest of the other equipment such as batteries, inverters, and others.After all, this profit varies according to the difficulty of mining and the price of bitcoin during different times of the year because it is also variable.So it is very difficult to answer this question accurately.",
