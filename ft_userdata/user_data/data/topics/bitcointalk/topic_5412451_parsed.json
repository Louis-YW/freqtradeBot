  "content": "Actually, I am very interested in mining but in my country mining and Cryptocurrency are completely illegal. I know that if mining is done secretly then there is no way for the administration to know about it. But I am thinking that the extra bill due to mining will come to my meter which is unusual for a residential meter in our country. If they come to inquire about it, then maybe I can get into trouble. So my main point is that I want to set up a mining rig using batteries and inverters and solar panels. Which runs through the battery, and the battery is charged through the solar panel, and sometimes I charge through my electricity, so maybe my meter bill will come to low.Now the real thing is what can be the minimum setup to start at the first stage of mining and how much watts of electricity will cost it?",

      "body": "Yes, that's possible depending on what miner and solar setup you have make sure your solar setup can provide enough power that can run a single ASIC miner. I'm sure you will spend a lot to build a solar just to run a single ASIC miner because it requires high wattage but if the budget is not your problem then you can build 10,000w solar panels and mine without worrying about the electricity bill. 10k watts build I think can run a single s9 and s19 pro unit it will run 24 hours depending on the weather condition and the quality you harvest from the solar.",

You might want to mine Monero, another cryptocurrency that can be mined on any computer, then converting it to Bitcoin using services such as fixedfloat, or to your local currency using localmonero (which might be dangerous if crypto is banned in your country).You can search on your search engine of choice about how to mine Monero with p2pool, a decentralized mining pool, and then start mining.",

It mustn't be mining since as you have said is very illegal in your country. You will spend a lot trying to start and a lot more certainly in trying to keep it a secret. If you must continue with your decision and don't mind the consequences, moving to the outskirts of town, a more secluded environment can be a good option to start with.",
