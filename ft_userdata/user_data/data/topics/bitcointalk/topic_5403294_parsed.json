  "content": "Recently I was reading one of the famous books called \" Rich Dad and Poor Dad\". This quote just changed my thoughts and reduces my depression. Like many others, I myself also made a huge loss in this recent BTC crash. When I first came to the crypto world I start with only a laptop. This was all I have and I made a good amount of money because of the last bull season. But because of poor money management and lack of experience, I took a big amount of loss too. I do make some losses but the lesson learned is priceless.1. Money management is very important. It is better to have some plan than no plan.2. Opportunity will come again and again so do not FOMO.3. Anything could go to zero no matter how big the project is(Luna disaster).Now I know how cash circulates into the crypto markets. I know fundamentals are the most important part of a project. I again could do mistakes in the next bull season but I will be more mature than to handle the situation. I do take some losses but the lesson it gave me would save a hell lot of money in the future.",

      "body": "Your story makes me think you got into trading altcoins, which is very risky.I don't know what you got out of Rich Dad and Poor Dad, but basically what that book says is that rich people invest for cash flow, giving a lot of importance to real estate investment. The author has great confidence in bitcoin, but I would never lend it out for cash flow, as it means giving up your private keys for a small extra percentage of return. Too much risk for too little return.Personally, I don't play with altcoins. You seem to be keen to keep playing with them, good luck.",

Although there are some losses in time due to over-optimism, overall what I have gained from this market is as well. It's something that I really appreciate. The lesson that I feel to remember after many years in the market is that let's keep things simple and see the reality more than the problems surrounding it. We can benefit or take risks through the process of exaggerating with each trend, but don't let it dictate the psychology of how the market behaves, and the worst part is that big losses make it difficult for us to overcome.",

But I actually don't mind this kind of loss. This isn't permanent, after all. I know very well that this will pass. I am a hundred percent sure that the good times will be back sooner or later. So I'm not at all depressed or disappointed or whatever. Some are saying that in times like this we're led back to the fundamentals and the technology and away from the price. But, to be honest, even if we focus on the price right now, there's really not a big problem. My optimism is not at all lessened. Even if Bitcoin falls all the way to $1,000, I'm sure it is still nearer to $100,000 than 0.",

It is better to have some plan than no plan.On a lighter mood, there is nobody with no plan, to put it in a more proper English, there is nobody out there without a plan, we all have plans, we either plan to succeed or plan to fail, not having a plan at all is (like we all know) a plan to fail which is still a plan no matter how its looked at  .To add to all you said, succeeding requires good planning, and also sticking consistently to it while being patient, having patience is same as having a good plan because without patience, one will still end up having several plans that is not working, Making good money in crypto requires good planning, strategic investment plans as well as good patience, most people are always  in a hurry to make money that in their haste, they end up loosing the one they already have and they come back to blame people or the market for their misfortune whereas its their laziness\\lack of proper planning as well as research that is the real fault or cause of their problem.",

You didn't make readers know the kind of losses that you took as a result of the bear market, if you traded crypto or you are a hodler. I think hodlers lost more in the bear, not lost actually but reduced value of hodling because the value will rise again (if the hodling is on). Hodlers don't need to panic and sell if they want to regain their value but a trader can lose all you have in bear. So which part got you drained?Most users here are going through the bear incase no one is alone. If you don't sell at the right time then you face the bear.",

I know I can not relate this book to crypto but there is some advice that can be followed in every part of our life. I mentioned that book name because that title is from there and which I think is very true. This quote influences my thinking about life and makes my thoughts more positive. Not only that there is some other quote from that book that changes my thoughts too. Like this one\" Those who try to avoid failure avoided success too.\"  Many times I didn't do some work because of fear of failure which later proved beneficial. I knew these quotes before that failure is the step toward success but it didn't shake my mind that much till I read that again in that book. Lessons can experience can be learned from anywhere and reprogrammed in other circumstances. So I do not mind gaining knowledge no matter what it is about.",
