  "content": "Maybe Not Possible For Governments To Get Off Fiat?? Thinking that with the USA dollar as the main reserve currency, That would make it very hard for other countries to get off the USA dollar and other fiat systems if they wanted to.Such as moving to a money system that has more limited supply.More less to drop a fiat system altogether for the international business aspect for that countries exports and imports.There would be or could be in my opinion consequences such as a possible war break out with in some case the USA before.Now with China taking over some countries. If those countries dropped the Yuan for business, there would be serious consequences coming down from that,For example I am in Canada. If our country here stopped the USA dollar altogether for the trade transaction between USA and Canada there be serious consequences, even if my country Canada the government dropped the Canadian dollar or any fiat system in the country and moved to a new system, like BTC or some non fiat money system on the national system. There would be very serious sequences coming back from other governments in other countries.Would this be a case of intimidation from more dominate countries that is preventing other governments from wanting to change the financial system?Thoughts?",

USD is currently the most popular for international trades, it has previously been GBP and in the future it could be a new currency, possible from an Asian country. A nation cannot be intimidated into using the dollar. In global trade, countries depend on each other for goods and services.Bitcoin does not play a part in this politics; for one it does not need fiat to be abandoned and can work along side it, it also does not need government recognition for it to be put to practical use globally.",

Every country wants its currency to become dominant in the global banking and trading sectors. The US will not want the Chinese Yaun to overtake the dollar so it will do all within its power to ensure the Dollar remains number one even if it will take diplomacy, threats, intimidation, and to extreme war.But it will be stupid for any nation to ditch the dollars without necessary preparation and planning. It will be suicidal for any nation that depends solely on imports from the US or rely on income from export from the nation to consider abandoning the dollar. Before such policy will be announced there should be a gradual diversification and restructuring of the nation's economy so that it could be able to withstand any economic sanctions or embargoes that might be placed by the US because of the ditching of the dollars. It has been assumed in some quarters that Russia prepared for this invasion which was why their economy is to a large extent sanction-proof.",

Fiat money has been the backbone of the international economies for centuries now and it's deeply ingrained in our financial system and a way of life. However with this rise of crypto like Bitcoin, some governments and financials institutions are exploring the possibility of this huge transition from using fiat, as far as I know, El salvador did such a good starting by accepting Bitcoin as a local currency and I hope we will see many countries in the future accept it too.",

It was created to be a second choice option that works without any third party, the central banks and finance officials have to regulate whatever currency that is in use in any country, what would happen if BTC is their main currency, they can't regulate it, or print and issue it, how do they ensure it circulates in the country, would the government go into mining?Quote from: worldtraveller321 on April 16, 2023, 04:05:55 PMMore less to drop a fiat system altogether for the international business aspect for that countries exports and imports.If the USD stops being the world's reserve currency, its replacement cannot be BTC, how do governments make BTC their reserve currency and use it for international trade, it is volatile and decentralized.

They have no other means of exchange but through that unless they all agree that they can receive trades through gold or silver. But then, in today's modern world, most of these countries are starting to think who should be at the top and who should still be at the top and that's being decided now.

This is wrong because bitcoin is only here to act as an alternative for fiat currency. So if your country Canada makes it a legal tender that doesn’t stops them from using other currencies like the US Dollar to do transactions with other countries that do not allow the use of bitcoin.The Saudi government is currently working on accepting gold as a means of payment for their international transactions also countries like China Russia and fellow BrICs have also agreed on using yuan currency for their transactions but this doesn’t stops them from using the Dollar currency. It simply means they are looking at way where they would limit the supremacy of the dollar and also the political influence of the US.",

Sure, the US dollar's reserve currency dominance poses a major roadblock for nations itching to ditch fiat. The potential fallout, like trade wars and geopolitical strife, can be pretty scary, to say the least.However, as our world shrinks and globalization intensifies, the call for a united financial system will grow louder. Like you pointed out, we're closing in, and a worldwide currency feels inevitable down the line. This shift won't be smooth sailing, with significant roadblocks on the way. But armed with thorough planning, cooperation, and a dose of adaptability, we can strive for a financial future that's transparent, safe, and fair to all.Though the thought of abandoning fiat may make you break a sweat, let's grab the opportunity to shape a superior tomorrow. United in our efforts, we can nurture a world that's just, sustainable, and flourishing for everyone.",

There's even a recent interview with an analyst Lynette Zang, you can google it, who said that the banking crisis was created to scare people and make them eager to accept CBDCs. That's what it's all about. Of course it would be difficult for governments to drop fiat completely, but CBDCs are fiat, just much easier to create, track and control.Just add 2 and 2. For a long time they've been reducing fiat payments. In the EU a couple years ago you were able to make 20k EUR bank transfers and cash payments without any problems. Nowadays, you can't make cash transactions over 10k EUR, you have daily ATM withdrawal limits (usually 250 EUR) and there's a 1lk EUR limit on crypto payments. There's also 1k EUR limit on no KYC exchanges in the EU.All of it has been done in the last 2 years. Ask yourselves why they're doing it so fast. What's their problem? The answer is World Economic Forum is pushing for CBDC and countries like France, Sweden, Netherlands, Canada and many more are happy to comply ASAP, which is why in Sweden you have extreme limits on cash payments in Sweden right now.",

(only slightly from PoV of users)these CBDC will still obey countries financial policies. so dont expect anything very different here. its just fiat2.0 with less central currency reserve measured in 1 super currency..but instead of US IMF controlling them all.. the BIS will be the main forex exchange for multiple countries currencies to pair against each other without reliance on the dollar as the exclusive/expressive value indicator of eachofcourse due to the population dominance (billion+ pop per country) china, india, africa and south america will all challenge each other as the next gen super power, so await for that to play out a decade after they form their partnerships to escape the IMF via moving trades to the BISbut in the end its still going to be countries having their own currencies. but as CBDC instead of current system",

This is because governments need centralized currency to maintain control over the financial system, whether it is in the form of digital or paper money. Without centralized currency, decentralized forms of currency could potentially overtake the existing power structure. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that a world without fiat currency is unlikely, even though many of us appreciate the benefits of decentralized options such as Bitcoin.",
