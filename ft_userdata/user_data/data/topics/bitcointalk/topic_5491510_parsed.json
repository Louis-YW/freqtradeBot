Those Ideas you have named are pretty good too and think you should start with something light in the learn and earn inorder encourage them more.  And you can Also focus on the security part of this space .",

They can also be exposed to cyber security and how to dictate phishing and scams. Maybe after they have learned the basics of Bitcoin, they can be introduced to the economics of the coin. They can be taught how to make some profit from trading or hodling Bitcoin. You could make the class student-centered by asking students to do their own research and come up with areas of Bitcoin they are interested in learning. Such topics could serve as part of the course outline and teaching content.",

Some might just be interested in trying to get rich and we all know just having the basics can earn them that. While others might be interested in using it as a means of storing their money and you don’t need to go far with this one’s you will just have to teach them how to buy bitcoin, understand the terminologies, setting up their own wallet or possibly their own personal nodes. You can check this thread by Fillippone on how to teach an average joe about bitcoin. I will personally add this James loop resources among other resources listed above as it encompasses what you were looking for.

You can't expect someone to develop and build their own blockchain for a maximum of $10 as a reward for learning the process no matter what programming language they are going to use. It's a lengthy process and someone who is in the learning process can't go that far.A learn-and-earn program should consist of concepts and ideas that are very basic but are important for someone to know when they get into this industry such as how they can create and use a non-custodial wallet, how they can double-spend a transaction, how the blockchain works, etc. Such concepts will make them understand Bitcoin and its network more closely because they would research and study if there is some incentive attached to the process.",

LN is different and has its own niche services, functions, model.. dont try confusing people that LN is bitcoin. (same goes for other subnetworks that also peg/wrap and emulate bitcoin)(same goes for custodian services)its also like CEX database, which is not bitcoin either. teach people about #not-your-key-not-your-coinother networks other systems dont have the same security model as the bitcoin blockchain. dont confuse people with foolish idea's that other systems are bitcoin or better then bitcoinmaybe you need to spend some time learning more about what bitcoin is before making posts about being \"bitcoin focused\" but then deviate within same post to mention other networks. i assume your game play is to offer small awards for learning your versions of how you see things. and later hope people then pay you back somehow. like maybe you offer them portfolio fund management services or something?!",

Most of the new users often go with hot wallets, and when someone else gets access to their device then they get hacked and consider Bitcoin and crypto as scam. It's far better to educate such newbies about the cold and hot wallets so they could safely store their Bitcoin without any worries.Another important thing I suggest you is to teach your group embers about custodial and personal wallets. Most of the new users keep their Bitcoin in custodial wallets and that's not a safe approach for holding Bitcoin. It's better to educate your group members about personal wallets so they can be the true owner of the Bitcoin that they have bought.",

Feel free to share your ideas here. Hi Little Mouse. Also include safe asset storage for those who want to learn.For me, wallets as storage are mandatory knowledge that must be well mastered by Bitcoin and crypto users in general because knowing a broad understanding of wallets really helps users secure their assets after they know other basics which you think are more important.They should be able to differentiate the advantages and disadvantages of using software, hardware and other wallets.They also need to know the advantages and disadvantages of using open source and closed source wallets.This is intended to avoid using an exchange to store assets for months.I think knowledge about wallets as a place to store assets is number 1 to be taught after explaining what Bitcoin is, how Bitcoin works and after explaining what crypto is.",

Another important thing is to make them clear about how Bitcoin works and how volatile it is as well. So when they were perfectly informed, they would take the right decision at the right time and not regret it at all. Teach them about using centralised exchanges also; it's very important to choose the perfect exchange and let them know how exchanges often scam and freeze accounts. Overall, we need to make sure all the funds are safe.",
