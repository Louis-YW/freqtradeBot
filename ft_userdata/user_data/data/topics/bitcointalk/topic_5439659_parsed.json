By the time i wrote this its already 32 hours and i haven't received the TxID and Transaction Keys. He claimed that he already checked his wallet and again he claimed that he already sent the money and its already on my wallet. 2He said he willing to share the TxID and Transaction Keys to some trusted member to check it but he never send me the TxID and Transaction Keys. 3(presumably)Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3410716Reference Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436425Amount (presumably)Scammed: $90Payment Method: XMRProof of Payment: I'm the recipient PM/Chat Logs: Discord Chat Logs: https://pastebin.com/yPuXVmcRScreenshots:https://imgur.com/GgXt22nhttps://imgur.com/gMLAspUhttps://imgur.com/XiUOaSEhttps://imgur.com/3vJWWOnhttps://imgur.com/l0Cfxixhttps://imgur.com/jH7cctchttps://imgur.com/Bp7ki6ehttps://imgur.com/bqPNmQvhttps://imgur.com/1NJnPwJhttps://imgur.com/2j14YrPhttps://imgur.com/1SM86Vxhttps://imgur.com/rrrT0ONhttps://imgur.com/4qbAdjthttps://imgur.com/XBvYVwxhttps://imgur.com/Y7VIt2Ehttps://imgur.com/Th3uzwbhttps://imgur.com/RYg8lOLhttps://imgur.com/VzYjYijhttps://imgur.com/CEgfB68https://imgur.com/C8ENvFthttps://imgur.com/gBnPifRhttps://imgur.com/FnacrZfLink to all 23 screenshoots in one album: https://imgur.com/a/kKSWwVJAdditional Notes: 1:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436291.msg61747448#msg617474482:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436291.msg61750857#msg617508573:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436291.msg61750857#msg61750857 and https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436291.msg61751340#msg61751340",

The correct TX ID2. The secret transaction key (tx key) from your walletThese details do not reveal your identity or the source of the payment in any way. It just proves that recipient received money. So, let's put the privacy concerns to rest and focus on getting the payment proven. Screenshots or any other forms of evidence that can be easily manipulated or altered are irrelevant in this case.",

Well, not even clue. Perhaps, nobody cares.

      "body": "Congrats for opening this thread, OP! You should have done this for a while now, but better later than never.Now let's see... As dkbiy98 already emphasized,Quote from: dkbit98 on February 13, 2023, 04:48:26 PMIf he didn't send the payment like promised until 25th January than he broke a deal againNext step now is to open another flag against the scammer and use this topic as reference link. Perhaps you are afraid that he won't pay you anymore if you open the flag, but you were already in this situation since you made the deal with the scammer. Perhaps you still hoped for a while, but it was useless. If you are really afraid that he won't send you the money anymore if you open a flag then better think that he was not going to pay anything since you pointed the finger at him in the other thread. In any case, the truth is that he was not going to pay you since Jan 23rd, when you provided him the materials.Quote from: c0ldbrewz on February 13, 2023, 03:53:15 AMhis financial department will send the money on 25th January.Do you actually believe this? What financial department? And what financial department would not have 90$? Even the financial department of a Mom & Pop's store would have this kind of money. In any case, if you actually believed there is a real financial department, of a real company, how was this department going to pay you XMR, huh? Companies work with fiat, not with Monero. I really hope you never bit the scheme with the \"financial department\". Let's think even more far: suppose that department would work with XMR. How can a company take money out of its treasury without an invoice? I believe you haven't issued him any invoice, have you? Lol. I said that since the beginning: this scammer is eating the dirt from under his fingernails and is here for pilfering. If you sell your shoes you have enough money to buy him together with his entire family consisting in 15 brothers and sisters, all Gypsies, his parents, his four grandparents, all living in a 20 square meters one room dirty apartment from a hood full with paupers and unemployed. Like pajeets, as TMAN used to say. Do you know what a pajeet is? A smelly dirty curry drinking hairy Indian that poos in the Loo. Except that this scammer is Gypsy and poos in the Danube.Quote from: c0ldbrewz on February 13, 2023, 03:53:15 AMSaxydev claimed he already sent the payment on 3rd FebruaryIn the other topic you first said he promised you the payment on Jan 25th, right? Then he delayed to Feb 3rd. Now is Feb 13th. Do you think he'll take you out tomorrow, on Valentine's Day, buy you a meal and pay you the 90$? I believe not, so we get back to this:Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on February 12, 2023, 12:09:07 PMQuote from: c0ldbrewz on February 11, 2023, 07:15:51 PMFor now the best option for me is just waiting [...]it should be no more than 30-60minslets wait and see.Quote from: c0ldbrewz on February 11, 2023, 07:45:46 PM5-10 hours then, okayQuote from: c0ldbrewz on February 12, 2023, 08:49:06 AMHe insist [...]he will send me [...]let's wait and see.Do you see the pattern here?And now he saysQuote from: saxydev on February 13, 2023, 06:19:26 AMGoing to sleep, brb 48-72 hrs\"Brb 48-72 hours\"?!? What kind of \"brb\" is that? In what part of the world \"be right back\" means 48-72 hours? So it's not a \"bbl\" (be back later), but a \"brb\"! I wonder what \"bbl\" means for him, if \"brb\" means 72 hours. And who sleeps \"28-72 hours\"? This guy should be an example for all women from around the world, with a new definition of \"I'll be ready in 5 minutes\". When a woman says this it usually takes from 10 to 60 minutes, lol. But he is going to \"be right back\" in 72 hours. I short nap of 28-72 hours. All good.Are all these enough reason for you, OP, to open a flag? Furthermore: even if he would pay you right now, the flag should still stand, for violating the contract you had! The payment does not make him clean, as a burglar is not exempted from jail if he pays back the victims what he stole from their house. The payment is only a form of accepting the guilt.Quote from: saxydev on February 13, 2023, 04:32:05 AMtake it. you know the resources I pulled to get the key?Ooooooooooooooo tell us! What resources did you have to pull? Did you have to carry mill stones? Did you have to run 50 km? Did you have to climb up to 100th floor of a building without elevator? Or what resources are we talking about here? I act like you made a herculean effort.",

Except, that TX mentioned earlier is probably not related to this case since the information in screenshots, particularly the block number and timestamp, doesn't match up. \"saxydev\" claims that the transaction was confirmed in block 2813799 (mined about 10 days ago), and the mentioned TX is part of block 2820718 from a few days ago.Quote from: holydarkness on February 13, 2023, 04:30:46 PMIf I am, then I'll ask saxydev, do I fall under that criteria?

Would you PM me that TX private key which will allows all of us to see the truth behind this case?Given that saxydev is already caught in a web of his own lies, I highly doubt he will send you any proof. Nonetheless, remain wary of his words, as he may try to weasel his way out once more.Quote from: holydarkness on February 13, 2023, 04:30:46 PMAnd to any other members, as I am aware that screenshot can be edited, but suppose saxydev kept his words and provide me with the TX private key so that I can confirm that the payment is indeed sent --or didn't sent-- would the screenshot provided by me enough as an evidence? I can assure you all that I won't bother editing the screenshots --aside from cropping and obscuring anything that can be used to identify me-- as whatever shown wouldn't benefits or detrimental to me.Sure, we can do that. If he gives you the transaction details and you confirm that it's legit, I'll adjust my trust rating based on your word (no need for a screenshot). However, as I have repeatedly pointed out, the transaction details don't reveal any information about the sender, but only the address of the recipient and the amount sent, so there is absolutely no reason not to share this information publicly in terms of privacy. So, there is no material difference between sharing a screenshot of a transaction receipt and a link to a transaction receipt, except that the latter provides verifiable evidence while the former does not.",

Except, that TX mentioned earlier is probably not related to this case since the information in screenshots, particularly the block number and timestamp, doesn't match up. \"saxydev\" claims that the transaction was confirmed in block 2813799 (mined about 10 days ago), and the mentioned TX is part of block 2820718 from a few days ago.I see. But let's suppose we insist on using that TxID as it's what admitted by saxydev to be the valid TxID, and thus, the complete web address as I wrote above, will entering both entries --the address and the TX private key-- brings us a \"false positive\", i.e. it will says xxx amount of XMR --equals to 90$-- was indeed sent to OP's address while saxydev actually never send it? Or will it says something like, \"invalid data, transaction not found\"?If what'll happen is the latter, then the result itself is conclusive enough that saxydev has never send the payment and brings us to the end of this case.",

We inferred this from the screenshots provided by c0ldbrewz. (Which are most likely fabricated to mislead the recipient.)You can never get a \"false positive\" result. Either he will give a valid TX ID and TX secret key that will validate the transaction, or you will get an error message such as \"the transaction cannot be decrypted,\" depending on the tool used.",
