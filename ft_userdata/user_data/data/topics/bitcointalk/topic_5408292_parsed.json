I often experienced blockchains in-betweens taking way longer than 10 minutes say 30 minutes or 25 minutes.Why was that? Isn't every blockchain supposed to be 10minutes(even when there is no transction at all).Thank you.",

      "body": "Mining is going trough a series of block headers really, really fast while changing small bits of data inside these headers each time.The header gets hashes with the sha256d algorithm.If the miner finds a sha256d hash of his header that is under the current target, he has \"solved\" a block.The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks to make sure the AVERAGE time between 2 blocks is 10 minutes. So, in reality, every ~2 ish weeks, the netwerk changes the difficulty to make sure the average stays close to 10 minutes (a rising difficulty decreases the target, making it harder to solve a block, increasing the average time... and vice versa).So, basically, there is no rule to make sure the time between 2 blocks is 10 minutes. The network just looks at the last 2 weeks (every 2 weeks) and changes how hard it is to solve a block, so that the average time between two blocks is 10 minutes... It does not care if at one point it took 2 hours to solve a block, as long as the average time is 10 minutes the diff doesn't change.Do realise that by this mechanism, in times of months and months of ever increasing hashrate, the average time between 2 blocks will probably be a little less than 10 minutes (since the diff is only adjusted once every 2016 blocks), and in times of ever decreasing hashrate, the average time between 2 blocks will probably a little more than 10 minutes over those months.",

It's also possible that it takes more than an hour until a miner finds the solution.",

The difficulty of these task is then adjusted every 2016 blocks.Quote from: Jason Brendon on August 01, 2022, 07:19:22 AMwith such powerful hash rate, will it be used to brute force against our private keys?

I guess the answer is no. but since the power of hashrate increases, all private keys will be brute forced. I certainly don't mean now or anything close.There are two reasons why not:The astronomically huge amount of computation required to break a private key is still many orders of magnitude above the amount of computation that the Bitcoin network can perform.  (See below for a brief description of how much computation would actually be required in various scenarios.)“ASIC” stands for ‘Application-Specific Integrated Circuit’.  “Application-Specific” means just that:  The ASICs used for Bitcoin mining have the mining algorithm baked into the hardware.  They cannot be repurposed for anything else.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on August 01, 2022, 07:26:10 AMQuote from: Jason Brendon on August 01, 2022, 07:19:22 AMwith such powerful hash rate, will it be used to brute force against our private keys? I guess the answer is no.That's not possible. Each private key provides 128 bits of entropy.That is flatly incorrect.  A secp256k1 private key has slightly less than 256 bits of entropy.  But that is irrelevant:Most public keys needed to spend funds are not publicly revealed.  For P2PKH and P2WPKH addresses that have not been reused, all that is publicly known is a 160-bit hash of the public key—not the public key itself.  Thus, for those, the search space for bruteforce is 2160.When a public key is known, an attacker would use an ECDLP solver, not bruteforce.  Bitcoin’s public-key security level is 128 bits, even though the private keys themselves are 256-bit numbers (slightly restricted within that range).  No attacker would use brute force.Asking questions is good; giving bad answers is bad.  People need to stop tossing out nonsense that is like the blind leading the blind.Quote from: Jason Brendon on August 01, 2022, 07:19:22 AMBut one day.. with quantum computer..Quote from: un_rank on August 01, 2022, 07:34:16 AMIf quantum computers can break that encryption, then bitcoin would be one of many systems affected, since it is currently more secure than others.Maybe there would be a security update when that situation is at hand.A quantum computer could solve the ECDLP using Shor’s Algorithm.Bitcoin’s public keys are used for digital signatures, not encryption.Quote from: Charles-Tim on August 01, 2022, 09:12:30 AMThat is why mining difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks. It is like that because if more miners join the network, the mining hashrate increases, and this will lead to transactions getting confirmed more below 10 minutes. But if miners stop their miners from working and are not mining, the hashrate will reduce and transactions will be getting confirmed more above 10 minutes.Hashrate variance usually has much less effect on what users observe than the variance that is statistically expected on the exponential distribution.I suggest that you reread my post immediately prior to yours, and stop fixating on the 10-minute number.  The 10-minute number is relevant to difficulty retargeting, over an average of 2016 blocks.  It is not a useful predictor of what users actually want to know:  “When will my transaction confirm?”Quote from: hosseinimr93 on August 01, 2022, 09:33:35 AMQuote from: OcTradism on August 01, 2022, 09:28:03 AMAverage bock time is 10 minutes but it can be longer or shorter depends on hashrate, waiting transaction in mempool and fee rate of waiting transactions.The block time has nothing to do what's going on in the mempool.

There is no direct correlation between the transactions in the mempool and the average block time. It would be entirely possible for the average block time to be 12 minutes with an empty mempool resulting in every transaction getting in to the next block and getting fairly rapidly confirmed, and equally it would be entirely possible for the average block time to be 8 minutes with a packed mempool and the majority of transactions waiting several hours to be confirmed.Quote from: Charles-Tim on August 01, 2022, 09:12:30 AMWhich means that transaction confirmation can take less than 10 minutes or more than 10 minutes, but will be almost 10 minutes on average if the average of the total transactions are calculated.This is not accurate either. If the mempool is full, then the average transaction time absolutely won't be 10 minutes. The average block time might be 10 minutes, but if ~2,000 transactions from a pool of 100,000 are included in each block, then the average confirmation time will be much longer than 10 minutes.",

Nevertheless..So, the private key in BTC has a maximum of 256 bits of entropy. No matter how complex the entropy I am putting in in the first place, it will end up producing me a root key with 256 bits(even if I was initially putting in HEX in 1000-bit entropy or 10000 bit). Because in the end, after SHA256, it becomes 256bits..So, my question is:Will there be two different input producing the same hash result? (hypothetically, a 200-bit input entropy produces the same hash result of 20000bit...)Maybe that's a stupid question to ask..",

(hypothetically, a 200-bit input entropy produces the same hash result of 20000bit...)If you are generating private keys by using SHA256 on different inputs, then yes. Indeed, there will be many more than two inputs which will result in the same output.For SHA256, you must append to the end of your input the length of that input expressed as a 64 bit number. This places an upper bound on the length of the input, which will be 264 - 1 bits. For reference, this means that any data up to approximately 2 exabytes (2 million terabytes) in size could be used as in input to SHA256, if you had the hardware capable of processing it. Given this, and given that we know that SHA256 will always produce a 256 bit output, then it is easy to see that there will be many billions of inputs which must map to the same output.There are no known collisions for SHA256, however. If you manage to find two different inputs which hash to the same output, then there is a 0.27634251 BTC bounty you can claim as a reward:REWARD offered for hash collisions for SHA1, SHA256, RIPEMD160 and otherhttps://mempool.space/address/35Snmmy3uhaer2gTboc81ayCip4m9DT4ko",

      "body": "for the private->public key question:though public key results in a 256bit number that then hash to a 160bit addressyes there can be collisions where 2 different 256bit public keys can result in the same 160bit address. though the odds are massively unlikely because there are more possible public keys than humanly able to count even with fast computers and thousands of years to do it by passing the project down to your descendantsas for the entropy at the private key side, the private key has actually alot less entropy, where most people are limited to this lower range due to the feature they chose as their method of storing/creating/having a private key. take most wallets that use the 12 word 'seed'that word seed translates to a binary length of under 132bit into a public keymeaning all users of seeds generate a private key of entropy that is not 256bit input but a number within a 132bit rangeto explain in more detaileach word represents 11bits. 12 words= 128bitsa calculation of that total seed then adds on a checksum of 4bits to get to 132bit however the 4bit checksum is not random, its a result of the 128bit. meaning if 2 people chose the same 128bit of words they all would get the same 4 bit result. thus the 4bits do not add any extra 'entropy'meaning actual entropy of seeds of users that use seeds is 128bit(340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) possible different keypairs within a much larger set of possible keypairsthough this number is still huge to be deemed collision safe",
