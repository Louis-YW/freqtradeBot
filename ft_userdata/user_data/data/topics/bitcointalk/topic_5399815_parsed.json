Because the topic suggests that you are trying to promote your project?I've read your terms of service and need a lot of updating as they are general but overall: - How do you withdraw, is it by lightning or when the user reaches a certain amount? - The site does not contain https://, so how will you ensure the privacy of customers? - What is the policy for use with cookies?",

      "body": "Literally, you are promoting your site. However, it seems to look like PTC sites. I am wondering still people have enough time to spend on the PTC site? And I am curious what do you mean by partner? I believe you need huge marketing to make active your site and make awareness. A couple of your competitors exist on the market. So you have to struggle at all.",
