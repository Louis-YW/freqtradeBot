  "content": "Since I recently  received a phishing PM, I thought I'd condense what I learned from other members into a very simple guide.What is phishing?Phishing is any kind of attempt to trick you into doing something that you believe is safe, when in fact, it isn't. In the context of keeping your Bitcointalk account safe, phishing is when someone tries to trick you into revealing your password to them.How does phishing work?Typically, it works by misleading you into clicking on a link that takes you to a login page that looks legitimate, but isn't. If you type your password into such a page, expect your account to be \"hacked\". If you realize your mistake in time and act quickly you may be able to reset your password before any damage is done.What can I do about it?If you receive a PM from a new/unknown member, be extra careful. Check their posting history first to gauge what kind of user they are.As a rule, you should never click on unsolicited links. Instead of trying to decide whether a link is safe or not you can avoid any risk by simply ignoring it.If you can't ignore it, then make sure to examine it closely. Bitcointalk has a feature that makes internal links (to boards, posts, etc.) have a green hover color. If the color of the link changes to green when you hover over it, then it's probably safe. Try hovering on this link to see if it turns green.The other type of link is an external one (pointing to elsewhere on the Internet, not Bitcointalk) which won't turn green when you hover over it. You can check if this type of link is safe by hovering over it and then looking at the lower-left corner of your browser to make sure that you know where the link will take you. Try hovering on this link to see if you can tell where you'll be taken.Don't expect a proper phishing link to be easy to spot, however, because there are various techniques (involving BBCode and Unicode) that can make a bad link look like a more-or-less normal URL, so always make sure to carefully inspect the link before clicking it.This topic, about so-called \"homograph\" phishing attacks, is well worth reading.What does a real phishing attempt look like?Like this:Notice how the link is blue when it should be green (because it's an internal link and I'm hovering over it). Also, notice the weird underlining that stops short of extending all the way to the left.Anything else I should know?It's a good precaution to learn how to sign messages and then \"stake\" your bitcoin address here.That way, if your account gets hacked, you'll be able to prove that you are the rightful owner and reset the credentials.",

Users should stake their address and make sure to keep the passphrase to that wallet secured even if they aren't still using that wallet or have deleted it for want of space.

Some can be a form of email message saying that your account like for example bank account is being locked and needs you to verify your information to avoid it. Banks will never ask for your private information via email, if you think it's legit then it would be better to go to their physical branch near your place.Enabling multiple layer of security like 2fa will also help your account to be more secure. If you accidently click on a phishing link, the hacker can't easily access your account as it needs a verification from your device or email first.",
