The attraction for Institutional miners is simple: Dirt cheap rates and no equipment to buy. The same applies to Marathon (MARA).Now as to popularity of Antpoo - no idea. Yes they too have Institutional contracts and with their US operations can offer them rates on-par with Foundry and MARA. I'm certain that a large part of their hashrate are Institutional customers.

Kind of raises questions about the barrier of entry for mining being too low for those with large amounts of money to spend, but lack fundamental knowledge of how Bitcoin works.Another thought, miners also like predictable earnings, and this what larger pools can offer, yes the earning share is smaller due the number of participants in the pool but the predictability is the key. If I were to invest in hardware I would need to have some reassurance of expected earnings to at least to a some degree. Larger pools are more likely to mine block than smaller pools and hence the reward is sure even if its smaller. This is unfortunate behavior as it does not aid into decentralization. Smaller/new poolsÂ  need to issue incentives as already mentioned above. Eg. OCEAN now have zero fee for all miners. Whether it will help I'm not sure. OCEAN so far in dec 2023 found only two blocks: 819489 819242. The good thing is that there is a larger share for any participant however, as mentioned is seems unpredictable.",

An attack on the network would plummet the value of Bitcoin. If this was the intent of a government entity, they would have to coordinate with other governments to also take control of large pools within their jurisdictions.What I do see as a problem is the ability to censor transactions, or prioritize transactions by building the coming block in specific ways. This is an opaque process that does not have any accountability, and not really any consequence. There is also high chances that government entities have such transactions in mind they would like prioritized or censored.Ocean pool is looking to solve this, I think they will be successful.",
