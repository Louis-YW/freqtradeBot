But I'm also not sure if Satoshi will come back next year because he's been hiding for years and we don't know who he is either.",

Claiming to be Satoshi is another statement that is false because Satoshi has an account on the forum so if you post to claim his identity then that is a criminal act.",

So all of this what you are saying is at best an educated guess, at worst just a random guess.",

Because their is something i understand via prediction of the increment of cryptocurrency and decrement of cryptocurrency, from my perspective. Bullrun is been determined by the determinant of the demands that enters the market. But right now the market is still moving slowing, which their is every tendency that it can fall back",

Op had this to say sometime ago:Quote from: BitcoinMoses on May 12, 2022, 06:49:29 PMYou are saying Satoshi Nakamoto is one of the great mind. But you need to know, that Satoshi Nakamoto is my Pseudonym. Theymos is also my pseudonym. When I am Satoshi Nakamoto, how can I am trying to steal my own pseudonym ?  You need to understand something that you are making a bad comment. You suppose to ask me sign a message from the Genesis BTC address; instead you are insulting me. I am the the same man who created this very Forum where you are insaulting me. It is your ignorance. I won't get angry to you because, unconsciously you are a devoted follower of my Japanese Pseudonym but you hate my Jewish Pseudonym. You are anti Semitic. I think you love eating too much Sushi with my stolen Bitcoin. Please make your comment civil and that is good for you and me and every one.

If you don't sure about the movement of the market price you can buy Bitcoin in a DCA way, this is a safe idea if you're afraid to be trapped in the bear market.  IMO, it seems there's no sign yet of the bull market and it could be next year still Bitcoin struggling to resist the price. Speaking of the best time to buy Bitcoin, IMO, anytime you can buy as long as you never sell under the price where you purchase.",

As the market is unpredictable, it is not a good idea to make an assertion without having any evidence to support it. If you believe that 2023 will be the bull run then you better focus on accumulating bitcoin now, otherwise you will not benefit if the market really goes up in 2023.Why did you mention that Satoshi will be back next year, he has decided to remain anonymous and not to come back to us so don't drag him into the market anymore, bitcoin goes up or down depending on supply and demand, world economic factors. He is not the one to decide the price of bitcoin.",

Nice to meet you Lord Bitcoin Moses. Now can you confirm your claim ?  If you are real Satoshi then Please stand up and come forward and sign the message. Dr Wright said in a YouTube that there is people beside him who can prove that he is not Faketoshi but Satoshi. Now the real point is Extra Ordinary Claim requires an extraordinary evidence. Why Satoshi real Satodhi need other people's help to prove his identity ? If he is genuine inventor of Bitcoin and the Blockchain then he can sign a message with the Genesis Block Address. Any way, whoever is Satoshi the real one but not Faketoshi must be able to send some coin to my Charity Address. Any way, this is a word of evidence for the real Satoshi.
