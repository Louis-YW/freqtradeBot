  "content": "This news: MicroStrategy CEO Integrates Bitcoin Lightning Network to Corporate Email has been trending throughout today and maybe tomorrow. I was not sure how it is done so I went ahead and did a Google search and as usual Google gave results that did not make any sense. It is possible that I might not be entering the right keyword.That is when I realized why not search the forum. I found some pretty interesting threads and one of them was about the  lightningaddress.com. I did visit the website and found that there are three options.I understood that Self-Hosted is the way to get my desired result. What I want to know is there a simple way to get what I want. As I am not someone with such technical understanding. Is there any other platform that can help me with my requirement in a simple way?EDIT: I am looking to get an address like  xyz@gmail.com or xyz@mydomain.com",

I am aware that we can get selected domain names with our own alias. The question still remains the same how can I get an address like - xyz@gmail.com",

I would need some time to understand it.Check the second part of this article that came out yesterday[1].I haven't tried this myself, but apparently, you should be able to use alby to achieve what you want. You will still need to buy your own server and domain, but you won't have to install or run anything.[1] https://decrypt.co/137557/how-michael-saylor-create-bitcoin-lightning-email-address",
