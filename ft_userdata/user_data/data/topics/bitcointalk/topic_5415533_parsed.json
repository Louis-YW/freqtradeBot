Some of them use this service for the promotion of their app and some for such fraudulent. But after some reports google will remove it. I checked and i couldn't see it. Perhaps its already removed from the store. But there is a sobit app but there isn't 5 stars.",

You might want to bring forth a few details of exactly what happened as well as posting the evidence that you have. The best effect on investigating sobit would be if you posted this thread in scam accusations sub-forum here on Bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0The people on that board might be able to help you out or you might find a few comrades who have had the same experience as you with the SoBit Bitcoin wallet.Personally, I would not trust any Bitcoin or Altcoin wallet which does not have the full approval of Bitcointalk. I would also do my own research (at least on google search) whether or not someone distrusts said wallet.",

It was we who are very responsible of doing the research and at least seeing the reviews. In fact, you have seen the 1-star review and for me, it is quite doubtful about it and never I think it was reliable. Because if you bother to think about it, definitely you will never fall into this scam/fake wallet. And if you also hear about Electrum wallet, you never see yourself in the google play store looking for a Bitcoin wallet as it was indeed a trusted wallet already.",

Before downloading and using any wallet, we should at least find out first because there are many websites that review bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

You should provide an image of the application, link to the app, those who use android can report it to google so that they can quickly remove it to avoid others being trapped.",
