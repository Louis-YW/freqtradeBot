  "content": "I know it's a really stupid question but I was just curious. Is it really possible to choose your own seed words. I know it has various security holes and it is not advisable but I wanted to know if it's possible. If possible I would have used my loved ones names cause even if we forget things like we usually do we don't forget the people we love. Words have to be in correct order I'm aware of it. I know seed words aren't just random words. They contain certain words from BIP39 word list (2048 words) and they hold a meaning. They are used to convert into binary seeds. The last seed word generates a checksum which validates the data.Just imagine in term of randomness or uniqueness what if we used multiply language or names. Because there are more than 7,100 language spoken in this world and there are 195 country. So if we think of it, in every culture, area, city, country, people use different language different names and the names doesn't have to be meaningful like my username. How much randomness would it create! Not everyone can speak multiply language nor everyone have a good memory in remembering words. People tend to forget. But when I think of it it fills me with nothing but curiosity. That's all I wanted to say.Article about the topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/rh2ip0/is_it_possible_to_pick_and_choose_the_wallet_seed/?rdt=58245I don't know if this topic already exists or not but I just though of posting it anyway.

      "body": "Yes, it is possible. No, you shouldn't do it.Picking your own words from the BIP39 word list is bad enough. It's been endlessly proven that humans are not random and whatever sequence of words you pick will not be random. There is the issue of the checksum in the last word, but that is fairly easily solved simply by calculating the checksum and picking an appropriately matching word.Picking specific words which have a meaning for you, such as the names of family members, is a monumentally stupid idea. This is really no different to a brainwallet, except instead of using the words or phrase to generate a single address you use them to generate the master private key for an HD wallet. Again, it is easily done, just really dumb. Anyone who knows you likely knows the names of your family members, and anyone who doesn't can probably get that information in <5 minutes from your social media profiles.Quote from: DYING_S0UL on August 03, 2023, 12:24:53 PMHow much randomness would it create!It doesn't matter. Bitcoin private keys provide 128 bits of security, which matches the amount of security provided by a properly generated 12 word seed phrase. It does not matter if you used a seed phrase with 5000 truly random words providing tens of thousands of bits of entropy - your resulting private keys would still have 128 bits of security.Seed phrases are not meant to be remembered, and so picking something memorable is pointless. Generate a random seed phrase properly and write it down on paper.",

This will be optional as you could also select the automated selected seed phrase. Answer to you query is mainly covered by last member's reply but i have a suggestion for you which is: you should not select your loved ones names as seed phrase because they can easily be guessed only if the attacker know you personally otherwise it will be hard for them.You just don't have tot attach your personal life with crypto life and i think you are good to use your loved ones names but still you should atleast add two or one words other than them.Another advice is: i read a topic here where someone used only one words as the whole seed phrase. So don't do that.",

But for what you want, a repo, in its infancy, is available for it where you can translate some preliminary word lists (not up to 2048 yet) Â to a local language. It has its rules, like removal of diacritics words, such that any word with any dots or squiggles attached to it should be written without them (every word in English character set). Also the words should be levenshtein conscious. Atleast levenshtein distance should be more than 1; words with Levenshtein distance of 3 is perfect. On the contrary, Being aware of the calculation and formulas used in generating seeds; mnemonics, checksums, length of the mnemonic sentece in words. You should know that it's secure enough over choosing words from your brain.",

You can import a seed phrase created with an unknown word list and it will still be able to both verify the version bits are correct and generate the corresponding wallet. This is because the checksum is not dependent on decoding the final word to its relevant bits as it is with BIP39 (where you do need to know the word list), but because Electrum seed phrases are simply normalized and hashed to obtain the version bits.For example, here's a seed phrase I just created using the first few lines from the whitepaper as wordlist:Code:financial directly but be would benefits sent without of would directly version solution prevent main trusted going required trusted purely spending required electronic main partyBut even without telling your copy of Electrum the wordlist I used, you can still import that seed phrase and reach the following address:Code:bc1qy6fl5725jum967lca3k8qpu6z9vacx367fypv3",

That is also one of the reasons that 12 words phrases are used, they are easier to write down while providing sufficient entropy.Think of how many song lyrics you could comfortably sing word-for-word some years back, try them now and check the accuracy level. Even if you could sing the song perfectly after several years, that is only for how long your delicate brain is working efficiently, if any accident or trauma affects the brain you probably will lose access to that memory.
