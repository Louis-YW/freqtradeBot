But this is not the end of NFTs Well, the main point is about Bitcoin. I agree with you. If we look at the one-year chart of Bitcoin, we see that we were in a better position last year, and if someone bought Bitcoin last year, he's lost a part of his money today.In my opinion, this market is not suitable for 1-2 year holding!There are 2 ways:1: Daily trading2: Holding (at least 4-5 years)",

And surely it will take time in such situation because of FOMO that always happened every time when there's a changes in the market..",

You have no basis on even speculate on that. I personally believe that BTC has seen the bottom but it doesn't mean it won't be visiting there again. And most alts and nfts will follow.",

It was obvious that at some point it would just overflow. There is a chance that it will still rise, but in my opinion the NFT market is already saturated and this could be the beginning of its end.",

If you're into it and still holding one, you need to make your own research if that NFT you own has active developers.Because in the BAYC, I'm starting to see that they're into continuous development and all of those BAYC NFT holders are testing a game that's made for them, I have no idea if it's an NFT p2e game.",

But for the NFTs, I don't think it was appropriate to attach it to the Bitcoin price movements because it is not connected. Bitcoin is the dominant cryptocurrency in the market and is commonly used by traders and investors so it's inappropriate to attach it to the collectibles theme like NFTs, Anyway, I believe that Bitcoin can influence the top ranking Altcoins price movements in the market but for NFTs, I don't think so.",
