There is no obligation there.[/quote]Their one edge that says that the Satan you know is better than the angel you don't know, Hhampuz managed the campaign before CryptopreneurBrainboss, and brainboss managed the campaign less than one year and it has been honest with lightlord starting from the time he managed the campaign.majority of us in higher signature campaign start from 777coins and bitvest because it was one of highest populated hiring participants during the time CryptopreneurBrainboss managed the campaign, so many people can attest to it, if I'm saying a sugar coated phrase or rendering verbal information to qualify brainboss  \"NO\" I'm saying this because during the day's of my membership, I was one of the participants managed by brainboss and its managerial act was conducive to me. So that is I recommend him to lightlord as his previous manager.Quote from: BenCodie on October 16, 2023, 08:33:42 PMGood luck with your new campaign lightlord. I did some reading about you while people were calling for bitvest and 777's threads to be locked, I hope that you are healthy and well, or at least healthier and better than before.I believe that before lightlord come up of relaunching his campaign he most be healthier than the way he was before, I don't know if what makes him to go on break that takes almost one year is because of illness,  but I'm happy that he later return in bitcointalk to continue his business Quote from: lightlord on October 16, 2023, 08:40:59 PMI'll keep this thread open another 24 hours or so and/or into the announcement of the campaign begins, assuming everything goes according to plan.Lightlord it will be nice for you to launch the campaign and the announcement with your preferable manager, so that everything will be under the custody of the manager so that participants will lookup to the manager in every information that concerns bitcointalk community.",
