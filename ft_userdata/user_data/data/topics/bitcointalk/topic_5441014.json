      "body": "Any major headline would surely have an impact on the market price. Big companies, like Tesla, PayPal or Microsoft accepting Bitcoin as a payment option is definitely a big news and would sway trader sentiment positively, increasing the price.This does not mean Big companies can constantly impact the price or influence how it moves up or down. Elon Musk tried to test the extent of influence he has and eventually lost a significant amount of relevance.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on February 23, 2023, 05:59:02 PMAre there other factors that influence the prices of cryptocurrency? Let's discuss!Demand and supply are the main market factors. They in turn are affected by other secondary factors, such as;• Major headlines.• A breach or hack.• Halving event.• World economies.",

Let's discuss!Somehow you seem to come with a lot of topics you could have been researching a little, throw some words and \"let's discuss\". This is not OK. You should put more effort in this, now you just look desperate for meeting a post quota.Elon Musk's behavior is known. Many no longer care about his announcements and the effects (many of them short-lived) his actions have on the price.It's not IRA, it's IRS you wanted to tell about. And I think that SEC also keeps an eye on him.And Bitcoin price... there are too many things that can affect it (some for longer term, some for shorter term): various announcements (like you said about Musk), various actions (institutional buys/sales), hacks, bankruptcies, new businesses opening, halving, ASIC chips/mining gears releases, war (let's not forget it), pandemic, recession... even the stimulus checks the Americans have received did affect the price.",

Things like:-A man found his old private keys with 1000 bitcoins on it.-Faketoshi just win another lawsuit.-Musk decide to invest $1B in cryptos.-Ukraine is accepting bitcoin as donations.That's what I call \"Hot News\", and that's what really moves the markets, when FTX scandal hit the news we see how the prize start crashing until it hit $16.5k, so, the best way to predict the next move on cryptos is to read the news paper all the mornings.",

Here we need to understand, whoever the influencer or whatever the positive news, the market can be influenced to some margin. Beyond that it is the users who drives the market.The prime objective of the bitcoin development is to support the financial transactions cross border without limitation and eliminating the third party. In reality the same have got transition as an investment and on different other purpose. When the objective for which this has been developed is fulfilled we'll experience the real market variations than the influencers impact.",

What affects the price are the rules of supply and demand, any imbalance in those rules directly affects the price, news related to companies may affect supply and demand, but this happens because of the nature of this news and not the impact of companies.Companies can influence through investments, which again means a change in the rules of supply and demand.",

And we know that he has his narrative behind so I guess he has no longer that influential to us.As for the factors that influence the price positively, definitely some good news to come, like let's say big companies like Amazon accepting it as means of payment. Or the US CPI data, which is a good hedge not just for crypto but for any other traditional financial markets. If the CPI data shows higher, then we all affected negatively. But when the numbers shows that inflation is cooling down, then the price might go and increase.",

When Elon Musk announced in July last year that Telsa had sold almost 75% of its bitcoin holding, the market was affected slightly. But the price of bitcoin recovered after a few days.Bitcoin is gradually becoming immune and independent from these manipulative forces. Currently,y people are becoming more enlightened about bitcoin and they don't care about most of these global business owners that hardly keep promises and can be used as manipulative tools by the government.",

Social media is the first place that provides a lot of information from negative and positive information, so social media is a platform that is currently very influential for crypto, but not only crypto, all platforms will also be affected. When some influential figures or people who have a lot of followers follow up on the coins they like, of course, it will be a trigger for the coin to rise and will affect crypto prices significantly, but it will not last long. However, some social media users who have a lot of followers also need to be aware, there are some of them who only think about profit by inviting their followers to buy and enter certain crypto projects, even though these projects cannot be trusted and eventually scam. Perhaps Elon Musk can be an example that he was very influential in the recent rise of DOGE. When he makes a status about DOGE on twitter, then DOGE will immediately pump and after that dump. like pump and dump practice. But not everyone who has money will be influential, only people who are considered important in crypto can make such things.

Let's discuss!CEOs have more affect on Bitcoin price than businesses per se. If it weren't Elon Musk's crazy character and tweets, announcements alone that Tesla or x company accepts bitcoin wouldn't have a significant impact. By the way, crypto is part of our daily life, it's part of this world and it's pretty massive. But the the problem is that it gets affected easily. For example, if not so well known exchange in any country gets hacked or something similar happens, it can affect the whole crypto industry and the result can be brutal, it's very sensitive.At the moment, it can be affected by:1. Very famous and influential people, like Elon Musk2. By governments3. By inability of exchanges to securely store assets. At the moment the only exchange that can seriously affect bitcoin's price is Binance.4. By scam projects, I mean something as big as Bitconnect.5. By bitcoin mixers and I mean, for example if Chipmixer scams all the people or it gets seized or something bad happens, it will definitely affect the price cause I assume it's volume is pretty big.6. By purposefully and intensely giving it a bad reputation in mass media.",

But still, in this case, businesses will always look to the government for more information about how the government is doing with crypto. And if the law from the government says that crypto cannot be used as legal tender, businesses can't do anything either.
