Keystore wallet is Bip39 compatible so yes it is possible. Quote from: lyw123 on September 28, 2023, 01:27:17 AM       If I set a passphrase and my hardware wallet broke one day.

What should I do?This is not true because the hardware wallet doesn’t hold your bitcoin but rather it is stored on blockchain. The wallet only holds the keys or seed phrase. Once it gets damage you can recover the wallet back using another wallet even if it is a different brand provided that the brand is compatible to the one that generated the recovery seeds. If you set a passphrase then you need it too when recovering the wallet and if it is forgotten then such wallet cannot be recovered even with the seed phrase available",

I ask 3-4 different AI models (chatGPT3.5, Google PaLM, Baidu Wenxin Yiyu...), they all tell me No.      I bought a lot of hardware wallets (4 Trezor, 3 Ledger, 2 SafePal, 1 imToken, 1 Keystone) and did a lot of research. After reading some posts on this site, I feel very sad because the truth is I wasted a lot of money. If I can choose again, 2 Trezor One and 2 Keystone would be enough. Using Trezor and Keystone with passphrases to generate a 2-of-2 multi-signature wallet through the electrum software. And using Trezor and Keystone with the same two mnemonic phrases, but different passphrases, for storing altcoins.       Additionally, securely storing 3 or more different mnemonic phrases using my complex method is burdensome for me. Two mnemonic phrases with four different passphrases are just right for me.",

The word different algorithm is the compatibility we are all saying, if it is different then you can use it interchangeably. But most of these wallets use the same compatibility. QuoteUsing Trezor and Keystone with passphrases to generate a 2-of-2 multi-signature wallet through the electrum software. And using Trezor and Keystone with the same two mnemonic phrases, but different passphrases, for storing altcoins. The best form of multi signature is the one have higher number of keys that created to the number of keys to sign a transaction, example is a 2 of 3 set up or its likes. This way when one wallet key or phrase is lost you don’t lose the entire set up in a 2 of 2 set up.

When setting up a new hardware wallet, be sure to safely store your BIP39 Seedphrase, optionnaly you passphrase (if set up) and the derivation path (if you use a custom one).Then you will be able to enjoy multiple hardware wallet from multiple vendors. Even at the same time to get rid of a possible hardware failure.",

This way when one wallet key or phrase is lost you don’t lose the entire set up in a 2 of 2 set up. That's a good idea.

This is a bold idea. I'm not sure if it's secure enough. I've been using a complex method to record three sets of mnemonic phrases. It takes a lot of time to manually encode and verify them. If using a new passphrase alone is secure enough, then I won't need to generate new mnemonic phrases in the future.QuoteMost of the hardware wallet manufacturers are compliant with BIP32/BIP39 protocols.

I will try it out once I receive it. The majority of my BTC is stored in a multi-signature wallet. The main reason for buying Keystone is to store altcoins, like USDC and DAI. I wouldn't consider putting BTC in a single-signature Keystone.",
