But if you need to have your coin in a non custodial wallet such as \"Trust wallet\", you need above $20 to cover both transfer feesQuoteif you start with $30 and eventually the market goes up to a little increase of $32 can not be compared with someone who started same time with you, at the rate $100. No, you are very wrong on this, because the price of Bitcoin always increase or decrease by percentage \"%\", which means that the profit or lose you could get will be base on your investment capital. That is for example,If Mr A invest $1000 in Bitcoin and Mr B invest $100 in Bitcoin too, same time, same date, and the price of Bitcoin eventually rose by 5%, that means, 5% of $1000 = $50 (and that's the profit Mr A will be having, i.e $1050 in total)While,5% of $100 = $5 (and that's the profit Mr B will be having, i.e $105And that how it works, et cetera. QuoteSo also when the market is down to some extent, the person with $30 may likely loss more because of the money is small. Blockchain has the minimum amount one can invest if am not mistaken but if your amount is too small may be difficult to make easy progress.What do you think about my advised to him?No, both person who invested huge and small amount of money will always loss or gain base on the same percentage at every moment, but the only difference is that the higher your capital, the more profit you may stand to get.That is, if for example If you invest $100,000 and the price of Bitcoin then increase by 10% after a week, that means you should have made a profit of 10% of $100,000 = $10,000 And same with if you may have invested $10,000 and the price of Bitcoin increase by 10%, that means you should have made a profit of 10% of $10,000 = $1000",

And they will later use that 300$ gain to invest back into Bitcoin, I have a friend that does these swings between altcoins, and he has used this trick to accumulate a handful number of Bitcoin so far. This is not investment advice for anyone because altcoins are riskier than Bitcoin.",

Therefore, it is best to start with a reasonable amount of money that you can afford to lose, or even if you started with small amount, it will help if you keep accumulating with small small amount of money in aim of making good profit.

Bitcoin's price being high does not mean investors with lower purchasing power cannot get some. For a start $30 is not a bad value at all, the person is can use that amount to test out the little technical features, trading, wallets and backups, transactions on-chain... What you are starting with does not determine the outcome if they plan to invest more eventually.Quote from: Godlovesyou on April 19, 2023, 06:15:09 AMif you start with $30 and eventually the market goes up to a little increase of $32 can not be compared with someone who started same time with you, at the rate $100. Someone who started with $100 can also not be compared with someone who started with $1,000 or $1,000,000. This does not mean those with lower purchasing power should not get into bitcoin. A 100% increase would double their $30 to $60, a better deal than letting inflation gnaw at it if left in fiat.Quote from: Godlovesyou on April 19, 2023, 06:15:09 AMSo also when the market is down to some extent, the person with $30 may likely loss more because of the money is small. Blockchain has the minimum amount one can invest if am not mistaken but if your amount is too small may be difficult to make easy progress.You either gain or loss in percentages. 10% of $100 varies from that of $1,000, they are gaining or losing according to their investment.- Jay -",

Cryptocurrency is risky and also rewards a trader who open good entries on the market. Starting with $30 is probably he's standard and we should always invest what we can afford to lose, not the other way round. Invest what will drained us once Bitcoin goes against our plans, we start lamenting and look for someone that will helped is probably not the right path. $30 bucks can grow into a big account, only if traded wisely, target the specific time Bitcoin do the pump run and invest in it, $30 can flip to $100 within few days or even more.",

See this as a mid / long term investment and if you take that approach, you don't have to deal with volatility. See it as a storage of value. Buy and save it. Buy and save it over and over again. You can do that with apps like Peach or Relai. For instance, instead of putting 50 bucks aside on your bank account, you can make monthly investments with Relai, for instance for those 50 bucks. It will bring you more happiness in the future than hassling now with buying and selling every other day!",

Realistically he could see that 30 dollars become 300 dollars within a couple of years. Maybe even less, depending on how well the market is doing and what kind of adoption rate Bitcoin is experiencing.Either way, not investing in Bitcoin is definitely a lost opportunity, from my perspective. 30 Dollars definitely is not below the minimum amount you can invest.",

      "body": "Yes, that is correct. The amount that someone invests in Bitcoin will affect their potential returns. If someone invests a small amount, such as $30, the potential returns will be limited by the small initial investment. This is because the percentage gains or losses on a small investment are smaller than on a larger investment.Additionally, the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and the value of Bitcoin can fluctuate greatly over short periods of time. When the market is down, the value of the investment will decrease, and the investor may experience a loss. It is important for investors to understand the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrency and to only invest what they can afford to lose.Finally, it is always recommended to do proper research and seek professional financial advice before making any investment decisions.",
