  "content": "Hello  everyone. Thought I should share my success story to build more confident minds.It has not been easy for learn so many thing here since I left because of the situations I have facing. But have been doing a lot of offline reading since I even forgot some letters to my password , but remembered it later though.I have been a crypto(BTC) lover ever since I got to find out about it the hard way, which was through fake mining like the ones that we do on your mobile phones. At first some friends of mine who had no idea about bitcoin or who taught they had proper knowledge first introduce me into what I thought was real bitcoin mining being that I was very naive. I thought I was going to gain lots of bitcoin by just simply mining with my phone which was not possible as I later found out here in forum that to earn bitcoin through mining you actually need to get heavy machines which can costly a lot of money and I have wanting to start or have my own bitcoin saving but the availability of funds was like hell since am living in a country where only the rich gets richer and corruption is everywhere.I recently just quit my work as sales boy in the village which i have saved some funds which I can use to start my farm work which I intend on using the profit to buy bitcoin and save it.Patience was really a key to this my success of having a 80$ bitcoin portfolio because I had to get money the only way I know how in this my village which was through hard farming and I am very knowledge in cucumber and potato farming and it doesn't require a whole year before it starts yielding fruits@3months precisely. so I started the farming process few months back with the little income saved and am here to announced that I have successfully sold part of my produced and gather the funds to purchase some bitcoin worth of 80$( would added image but don't know how). So please am sharing this my story to help boost the faith of most new people like me who wants to buy bitcoin too and hodl for long to actually gather good profit, that you can also do it if you are determine and patient enough. I would like to buy more bitcoin but I will have to move to the city and get a steady job so I can save up part of the salary in bitcoin. Bitcoin is really the way forward and also the future currency and glad to be part of it.  I really thank God for my cousin who showed me this Wonder forum.And please my typing skills are not too good so forgive any error I make.",

You can be a Bitcoiner, Bitcoin maximalist but you can say no with altcoins and other cryptocurrencies if you think they are scam projects.Quotesince I got to find out about it the hard way, which was through fake mining like the ones that we do on your mobile phones.It can be real or fake or phishing. You can mine some coins with your laptop, desktop, mobile phones but they are shitcoins.Is it worth to use your device and put it at physical damage for shitcoins? It does not worth the cost you will have to pay at the end but the worst risk is phishing, malwares can make your devices infected. People behind the scene can steal many things on your device and it is a very big risk.",

      "body": "Normally I am skeptical with this kind of stories, which are often invented or seek to gain merit. In your case, although it is something I can't verify, you sound sincere to me.I would tell you not to obsess and to see Bitcoin as part of an overall wealth building plan. First keep an emergency cash fund of 3 to 6 months of expenses, make sure you have all your payments covered with your income (food, shelter, clothes, transportation) and then invest in Bitcoin the money you won't need for years.",

      "body": "If you check the forum clearly you will understand that everyone here has (had) their success stories from one way or the other, have also come across some post were people share all it takes for them but at the later ending we noticed those stories were merely a cooked and organized stories just to earn some cheap merits. However, I love cucumbers is good for me and usually consumed it to freely help flush my system while making use of the restroom, I don't know of others.Then to your investment, you should look for a trusted and reliable wallet to hold your investment probably a self custodian wallet where you have access to your funds and have the private keys controlled by you, not leaving them in exchange because you don't have right access to your funds or exchange might decides to shutdown unannounced probably a hack might occur were it may lead to lost of funds, at then all your investment are gone knowing how hard you went through to accumulates those money to invest in bitcoin.",
