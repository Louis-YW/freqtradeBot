If you want merit and quote notifications, you can use the Telegram notification not.I will not advice you to use the Telegram bot for replies notifications because the bot will notify you of each person posts, even if you are not checking the replies. This can be annoying at times. For notification of replies under topic, scroll to the right side of the thread, at the upper or lower part, you will see notify which is beside reply that you click on if you want to reply to a topic, enable the notification there. If you have the email as active email notification on your device, you will be notified. The reason I like it is because once you do not click on it to check the reply again, you will not be notified again until you continue to check the reply.",

This is because no one is winning to recommend or push for a change, rather everyone is suggesting a third party bot to do the notifications. What are the possible reasons of not having the kind of notification recommended by OP. Will it lag the software or the software will not be compatible or is theymos avoid anything that will lead to hack of the forum?Personally, I do have much problems with the notification since I always use the last replied option and click on \"new\", it will take me to my own last reply and from there I trace down.",

I may update it later this week.It requires very little resource to run(if your machine can run python and is connected to the internet then it will work).
