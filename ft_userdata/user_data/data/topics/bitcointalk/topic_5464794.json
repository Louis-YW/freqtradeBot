Hehe. I mean sometimes such mistakes happen. hehe. I think that's the riddle here we have to find the name of the project by ourself then compare it with other platform. Let's make a plan we will find the project then I will sell the BTC at lower rates then you could show my company to there Unknown company so we could get a better deal. Deal!. eheh just kidding.",

This is his first post in the forum however so we have no clue which one is he talking about. Not interested in criticizing but will just want to check the truth. I am interested to know the name because I wouldn't ask for the highest value when buying. Of course, everyone wants to just buy at the lowest price possible.",

Seriously? I have not met a single trader/investor who has this problem in 2023. Its not 2015 mate. Arbitrators deal with price equalization and they race each other for cents, if somewhere the price deviates by more than 0.5%, it means that something is wrong with the platform, maybe withdrawals/deposits are not working temporarily, maybe something else, but I mean that what you advertise has zero value. it is much better to use proven exchanges with high liquidity. The leaders of the industry, because usually everything takes place here and then the effect of the war of buyers and sellers is transferred to smaller crypto exchanges by market makers and arbitrage traders.",
