If it is a money from loan, risk is bigger. You will have pressure from loan expiration, loan repayment and loan interest. You sometimes will not be able to control when you close your positions. If loan expiration comes and you don't have good plan, you will have to exit your positions with loss even you don't want to close them.Bitcoin halving is big event in cryptocurrency market but it does not bring profit to all investors and can not help all projects grow in value. Altcoin projects must be built up by altcoin developers and it has nothing related to Bitcoin halving.",

If we talk about day trading they are completely useless. But you can also do medium-term trading. Buy now to sell in a year and a half or so. Assuming that the behaviour of the price of bitcoin through the cycles is repeated in this one you will make a good profit, although probably nowhere near a profit like the first cycles.",

While I wasn't very active in day trading, I decided to be a long-term investor who buys and sells at the right time. However, for point 3, this is only done when I am researching a particular project and have a goal of what I am looking for, so there is a percentage that can be allocated on the condition that I have to enter as an initial investor who can easily make profits more quickly.",

You go outside and you see people looking at the bitcoin price on TradingView. Your Uber driver is trading and driving at the same time. You got people selling their homes to buy bitcoin. It means it’s time to Sell. It works almost every time at predicting a top.Predicting the bottom is when bitcoin doesn’t move and everyone thinks it’s dead, like right now actually. Usually this means it bottomed and should rally from here on out.",

Those two are good to start buying and selling but you need to analyze to know when to buy and sell. Without an analysis and only acting based on the news, you can get the wrong time to buy and sell and you will not get a profit.You can search for all the news, but if you do not analyze the market, you will not find when the time is coming to buy or sell.

That year, not only did Bitcoin perform well, but altcoins also saw remarkable price increases. So, my strategy has been simple: follow the trend until it shows signs of breaking.",

Because I will only sell something when I see a profit and the amount of profit is exactly what I want, whether that is when I trade or when I invest for a certain period of time in several assets. But for the criteria you outlined, it's not too bad if someone wants to follow it, but it will be more complicated because it will take additional time to keep getting updates consistently so you don't sell at the wrong moment.",

Bitcoin halving's effect is certainly going to make the price higher for BTC and majority of the crypto market and that's why it's always the best time to sell on that time.2. Just like during the covid and war of Russia and Ukraine, those were factors that have probably also made a huge demand for BTC.3. Simply the demand has increased over time.",

Not all traders can  align fine with this. For anyone that doesn't have a lucrative source of income that can maintain his overall needs setting a selling target and falling back to DCA when target is not met can be hampered as the trader may be forced to sell even when the target hasn't been met especially when there's profits already made. So if anyone chooses this type of strategy he should be sure to have other strong income source other than cryptocurrency.",

Sustained participation and growth of investors.Therefore, I make a continuous effort to stay updated with all the news to track numbers 2 and 3 consistently.This is a very strong indicator to trade which could be a buy or sell signal depending on the direction of investment. If investors are throwing in more money then it is expected to cause a bull rally or volatility which means if you buy at that time as a spot trader you are likely to make profit. This is same if investors are pulling out there money you expect price to crash also. So this is a good sign to take a market decision but always don't throw in all you have in the market at a time because of a conviction you have because price might change.",

Like the current adoption of the ETFs, and many governments towards BTC. If that's the case then you have mentioned some good factors. As one of the main factors is Bitcoin halving. Because when I was a newbie I did not know about halving and sometimes I think if I had been aware of BTC halving at that time (2018) I would definitely have bought some BTC. I have shared my story a lot of times, but here is the short version, that I came to know about BTC in 2018 but came to know about this forum in 2021. Well, the factors on which I mostly keep an eye are BTC halving and the fundamental analysis. As in fundamental Analysis, your 2nd point comes. In which we keep an eye on the world economy and how new companies and adoptions and news are affecting the market and how we can use it for our own benefit. Other than these 3 factors, I think technical analysis is also necessary but I honestly don't do TA as I am a holder and do DCA and that's why I don't really spend time on TA.",

This is also what makes it so dangerous, in my opinion, to assume a start of the bull with the coming halving (probably in April 2024). Everyone assumes that the halving will usher in the next run, but there is absolutely no guarantee of that, certainly not the shortage of supply of \"new\" Bitcoin through mining. However, you can already see \"well-known\" crypto-influencers promising viewers the blue of heaven and arguing that it was the same in the past. Three cycles, where the halving has actually heralded the bull, do not allow for a guarantee for the future.",
