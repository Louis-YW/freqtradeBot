Is there a place that I can go to to set this on my profile? I mean confirmation before ignoring an user.Did you use your account on mobile regularly? It's more possible to mistakenly Ignore a user if you are on mobile than on laptop or computer.The confirmation message for Ignore a user is not too necessary. It is very simple to click on UnIgnore and it is done. Because you know about users you don't want to Ignore, you can UnIgnore them manually and easily.Quote from: Cantsay on August 03, 2023, 11:09:10 AMI have experienced it before.

You only can do it with your Ignore list by adding that username into your Ignore list or by clicking on Ignore. The former is no way to be done by mistake and you don't know about it. The latter can come from mistake when you are on mobile.

It is difficult to write posts using the phone, and all things are inconvenient, so it would not be strange if you pressed the ignore button by mistake and there is no warning message after clicking the ignore button.you can go to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=YOUR-ID;sa=ignprefsyou will find a table, delete the accounts you don't want to ignore.",

In fact I experienced the same thing in my early year in the forum, almost 3 users in the Nigeria local board were in my ignore list and I didn't do such a thing, at that time I didn't even know what was ignore list was all about, I didn't even know how ignore someone. I wanted to create a thread as you did but I delete the users and forgot about it. And after twice of such appearance it stopped. So for now I am not seeing it again.

I do this frequently and I'm just surprised that sometimes some thread is grayed despite I don't ignore someone here.

I don't think is something you must go to your profile to set.

I also have 0 members in my ignore list because I believe that ignoring users isn't a good practice and it would really make us more ignorant to ignore those whose opinions we don't like. If we can't ignore such humans in real like then we should not ignore them on forum also.",
