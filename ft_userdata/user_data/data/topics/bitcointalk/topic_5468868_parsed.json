So i never paid him for it, and he accused me of theft and i just said forget it he already banned my paypal account on my business i'm not even going to fight it. The next thing is everyone elses funds were returned with the exception of the one person who had just a slightly lower thread view count then me.Now to business we will be meeting in person either at your office or mine if you don't mind the travel. As for an OTC desk the only one i knew was bitcoin-otc.com and they're not to active anymore. So if their is a new one please fill me in on it.",

USD can be frozen in any bank account in minutes by authorities. Bitcoin is where the rich will eventually put their money to avoid divorce settlement, estate tax, wealth tax, etc..
