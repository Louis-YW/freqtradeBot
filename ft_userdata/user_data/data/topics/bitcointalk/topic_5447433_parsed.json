For your question, well this is a bitcoin forum where privacy matters and prioritized so asking personal information here of someone else is useless.

I don't live in a country where you can pay the police to get someone arrested, but I've heard it's a common thing in some countries. The way they put Tate brothers in jail speaks for itself.",

You really have not Stated what her offence was even if it is known by others how about those who have no idea what is going on so as to assist you if the needs be. I think you should try present something tangible  as always so that the people who come across this post would see and know what your claims are all about before they advise or help you out. I am afraid no one would really give you that attention as it is reasons being that you have no facts to present OP.",
