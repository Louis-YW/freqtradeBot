  "content": "Monero's official Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) wallet was drained of 2675.73 XMR and their team still is still unable to find a root cause.There is an ongoing discussion in their official Github repository:https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/916 [CCS Wallet Incident #916]The community suggests it happened due to bad operational and informational security practices of the team that had access to the wallet. QuoteTimeline:April 12, 2020: New CCS wallet is created by fluffypony (on a dedicated wallet laptop, a Purism Librem 14, running Qubes) and the seed shared with Luigi, half via the Wire app, and half via GPG-encrypted email -- fluffypony and Luigi are the only parties with known access to the CCS seed.2020-2023: (Luigi's side) a single use Ubuntu system is set up to run a Monero node and CCS wallet; the hot wallet is on a Windows 10 Pro desktop where it has been since 2017; Luigi makes payments from the hot wallet and tops it up from the CCS Wallet (via SSH), occasionally as needed.August 3, 2021: shortly after fluffypony's arrest, most of the CCS wallet was swept by Luigi to the hot wallet as a short-term measure pending more information about the nature of the arrest(a few weeks/months later) fluffypony's arrest is determined not crypto-related; reverted to previous behavior of large CCS balance, small hot wallet balanceMay 10, 2023: last transfer was made by Luigi from CCS wallet to hot walletSeptember 1 11:58pm - September 2 12:07am, 2023: CCS wallet was swept in 9 transactions, IDs: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(wallet was then empty)September 2023: donations come in for Lovera CCS (the only proposal that was in Funding Required)September 28, 2023: Luigi logs into CCS wallet to top up hot wallet, finding (after syncing from May 10th as expected) a balance of ~4.6 XMR, representing September donations for Lovera; no additional transfers occurred after September 2September 28, 2023 (a few hours later): Luigi has call with binaryFate on what has been discovered; General Fund is confirmed to be intact. Shortly after, Luigi, binaryFate, and fluffypony have a call discussing the situation.September 28 - now: Core Team discusses internally; Luigi and fluffypony forensic efforts -- unfortunately, to date, no evidence of breach has been identifiedOpen questions:How do we achieve CCS continuity for existing contributors? Core team is in favor of covering existing liabilities from the General Fund.How do we structure the CCS going forward?How did the breach occur?",

This is Monero wallet developer question, not wallet users.I don't think it doesn't necessarily mean that OP posted this to find the one who drained the wallet or whatever but it just rings the bell to the XMR holders and from that posted details Monero's team is becoming questionable and also investors losing their trust on the coin as well.",
