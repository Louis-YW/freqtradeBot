You can see that in the chart that the price action is so choppy and has a long wicks. That's why I prefer to choose trading pair in crypto that have low volatility, such as the top 10 highest marketcap. But don't jump directly in the market and trade, you must also do a back test of your strat each of them everytime you trade because they don't have the price action.",

      "body": "IMO, when it comes to trading cryptocurrency pairs, I usually consider these important factors such as liquidity, market volatility, and individual project fundamentals.  Because I believe many traders focus on major pairs like BTC/USD, ETH/USD, or BTC/ETH as they tend to have higher liquidity and trading volume, making them more stable and predictable.  So these pairs are also widely available on various exchanges.Quote from: logfiles on May 26, 2023, 11:40:12 PMI don't have any specific coin I trade, especially on futures. I mostly look for the trading pairs that are most trending or top percentage increase/loss in the last 24 hours for my trading strategy.It's risky but I like it because this strategy will earn profit in a short period of time.One of my friends said, \"You can ride the wave of momentum and make a profit on it\", which is he is also liked to trade a trending pair and he didn't care if that was pump and dump as long as monitor your positions closely.  Because this was my advice, keeping an eye on trends and monitoring percentage changes can be a viable strategy if executed with discipline and careful analysis.  The last thing is, there should be a stop-loss what ever strategy it is.",

You will find that most of us invested in dogecoin for nothing but some tweets on Twitter, or that he made some profits and thought he was a skilled trader.If you invest carefully, you will find that you do not diversify your investments, but rather diversify your risks, and it is a short-term investment policy, while the long-term investment will be for Bitcoin only.",

However you can also choose ETH as the closest competitor which has a sizeable market cap and is now in the second position, but I prefer to suggest you to do a separate analysis before choosing the best one to trade.Some people don't mind the risk every time they try to choose an altcoin in the short term and some even choose the shitcoin they trade, the concept even though this is discouraged many people still choose it. In essence, before making a decision you need to study how much you are prepared to lose.",

      "body": "When trading, you have to consider leverage. Assuming you are using BTCUSDT futures to trade,  going not more than 3x margin ratio is better. But if you are using altcoins, going not more than 1x instead is better.The problem with altcoins is that you have to look for better ones. I have used some before which are good, and some are bad because they are most volatile. Example of good ones are litecoin, dash and qtum. There are other better ones like neo, doge, sand, gala, and some others. But there are some altcoins that are very volatile which I will not advice any trader to use for trading. Bitcoin is good for trading, but if you are also looking for altcoins, check the volatility for days to weeks or even to a month or two and make sure the altcoins are not very volatile at all. If going for more or most volatile coins, that is the beginning of gambling and also the beginning of failure.",

The value of coins can rise even higher, but miners have a rule to keep 10-20 percent of the coins if the price goes up. And if you sell 80% of the coins, then you will have a profit.",

Choosing a fair is based on the liquidity for that specific pool. Traders usually choose better liquidity no matter what is the pair since that will give a less price impact on trading. Currencies with less liquidity typically die so make sure only trade a token with high liquidity to avoid being burned by huge capital. Liquidity dictates everything about the price. The existence of DEX makes the importance of liquidity highlighted since DEX shows the detailed percentage of the liquidity pool unlike CEX that has no data with their liquidity.",
