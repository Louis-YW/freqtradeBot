  "content": "Hi all,maybe my project is dead on arrival because I just haven't seen some obstacles I should have seen... but anyway...Background: We are building electric motorbikes (with, of course, a limited Bitcoin-edition: 21 motorbikes, sold in 21 countries - more to come soon.). These motorbikes need a charger. Furthermore, we are building battery charging/changing-stations. The plan is to include Bitcoin mining, so basically mining by charging:- Charging/Changing stations: You put your battery out of the bike, take a new one and insert it into the bike. So the empty battery is being charged and can be used by someone else later. The stations are solar powered, and excessive power is used for Bitcoin mining. In these stations, a SIM-router is implemented as well as several smaller miners (tbd which one). The proceedings go into a wallet. All six months, the proceedings (minus the costs) will be distributed to the owners of the bikes. So the more you drive, the more you will get. - Home charging station: These are solar powered, again, excessive energy is being used for mining Bitcoin. The stations is yours, however, not the mining part. Again, proceedings go into the shared wallet and will be distributed according to your percentage. This way, you can relax and if we will have a better mining gear, it will be replaced for free.However:; Is there any source which would be able to still deliver Gekko's Pod-Miners and Gekko's USB-Stick Miners?Or is there any newer product in the pipeline of any producer?Thanks for your opinion and advise.",

      "body": "The Apollo BTC from FutureBit is probably the best miner for you:You can buy it from the manufacturer: https://www.futurebit.ioNot sure how much power you can generate, but you can tune the Apollo to require less than 100W of power, and still get a reasonable hashing rate of around 1-2TH/s.It's small and compact, and it comes with everything you need (fan, and power supply)There are also the Compac F which are great USB sticks and require very little power (12W for about 300GH/s), but they're very expensive compared to the Apollo (per TH/s) and also you need to buy fans and special USB hubs that provide at least 2.4A per port, etc.Any other miner is either too old and produces way too few hashes, or they require thousands of Watts to operate (plus they're extremely loud).",
