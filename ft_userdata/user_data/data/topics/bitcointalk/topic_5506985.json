  "content": "Is Bitcoin Market Price Stucked?Let's quickly take a recap on how the market performance have been since the beginning of this month, by going through the chart, there are many factors to discover on whether if the market is Stucked or not, but considering the previous days in the month of August, Bitcoin fear and greed index have increased perpetually from 26 to 39 which also signifies for more potential investors to increase in numbers.Base on the chart, the resistance against the bullish will be a difficult task to overcome from the range of $60,000 down to $62,000 and we can see more on how it has overcome the bearish trend from $58,000 to above $60,000.Let's further look into the liquidation of the bitcoin market and see what may result of the market sentiment is overcome and we experience bear or  bullish trend that surpassed the range of $60k to $62k  Bitcoin Liquidation Heatmaphttps://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-stuckWe can also compare the monthly return on Bitcoin asset investments from the table below. Bitcoin Monthly Returns https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-stuckA significant difference between now and the start of the month shows how bitcoin averages from 1.98% in returns with 36.5 billion 24hours trading volume.I will conclude by saying these:1. Make your decision fast by investing on bitcoin because we are going more bullish if the resistance is overcome.2. Still hodl your investment now if you're doubting of the market season and want to sell.",

I don't see price is stucked in August and boring time is good preparation to get rid of impatient investors, speculators before a massive squeeze will happen to clean up the market more, before a soar appearance.Bitcoin still has 3 months in 2024 and nearly a complete year of 2025 for its bullish time in this market cycle. Don't let a single boring month to make you disappointed and sale off your bitcoin.",

I would wait a while because price has been stagnant in the 58k - 60k level and unless it drops below 55k USD I would not buy and only if it crosses the last all-time-high, I would sell.Holding at this level might get frustrating for some, just wait it out and focus on other asset classes if you are getting feisty.

      "body": "Its August, this is the worst month for volatility for stocks and bitcoin. Sure there was that Japanese carry trade implosion which happened earlier but its generally rare. Usually markets are very slow in the Summer months. For stocks did you hear the term \"Sell in May and go away\", its because the markets typically go nowhere in these months and August is the worst.There will be action but you need to wait until late September and November will be a crazy month with the election. And in general, November typically is a huge volatile month by looking at the chart above. So you need to be patient and just dont watch the markets at the moment.",

Once their positives surrounding the case of recession or inflation I think the demand for bitcoin will surge up and that way we will easily break resistance level and gear up for massive pump but with the negativity surrounding this economic factors I think it will be to get inflows to break it. More so this period of the year is usually the bearish period most especially the month of September which I think we will still see more of a ranging or consolidating market than a pump or dump but after then I expect the last quarter of the year to be bullish",

This is not the time to be impatient.Don't you think that waiting for further dips might be a bad decision when you judge from how fast price recovers whenever it dips below 58k? I feel the bulls are very much active in the market and that the bigger move might just happen anytime because we have a lot of news that can initiate it such as the US elections. When market behave this way, it is usually followed by a major breakout that will send price far away from that zone. If such a breakout happen now, there are possibilities it will be to the upside because we are the end of the year where price usually move higher.",

The difference of long term and short term charts reveals different challenges of investors and traders or speculators.With investors, their jobs are simpler, by only focusing on fundamentals and how to execute their investment, what strategy to us (DCA is recommended), and how to store and keep their bitcoin safely (in open source, non custodial wallets, not in CEX's account).In contrast, traders or speculators will be more affected by news, fud, short term changes in the market and if careless, they will be liquidated too. Trading can help people to get either profit more quickly than investing or loss quickly too. Oppositely investment can help investors to get profit very solidly and sustainably with time. They don't have to feel up and down with news, fuds and market liquidations.The Bitcoin yearly candles chart is very simple.",

      "body": "Most people don't see bitcoin as something they trade short term to make profit. They see it as a long term investment. Which means since price hasn't been able to break $70 and set a new ATH for a very long time, in a way people can refer to that as bitcoin being stuck. Some may look at the $73k ATH on March this year but we could go even further back to the $69k ATH back on November 2021. So you can see how long that period of \"being stuck\" really is!But that's OK too. That's how bitcoin has always performed. To break the previous ATH at $20k it took from 2017 until 2020 (about 2 years).The important thing is that adoption is rising, even if the market doesn't reflect it at times due to the nature of it.",
