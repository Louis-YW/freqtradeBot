Dollar strengthened yesterday against euro and pound,which attracts the investors to invest in other assets. Is there a way out of this problem and who is most involved?Just speculating here, but I think this has to do with the revaluing of the SDR basket. The US is trying to get a higher weight in the currency basket when it is repegged later this year. They obstensively want to decrease inflation but .5% rate hikes aren't going to do that and raising interest rates too far will mean that the US will not be able to pay its debts. Frankly, I am a crypto investor. I cannot control what covid restrictions are imposed, or the rate of inflation, I can only control my personally life and finances and plan around what is happening around me. I hold dollars, not because I want to as an investment but because I need a certain amount of funds in case of emergency. The rest of my money is in staking cryptos that provide high returns, like MAXX with 80% APY or NEAR with 13% APY, that I believe I will be able to live off of during the next bull cycle. I keep my investments simple and safe so that if something happens to me then my family will be able to withdraw and sell my assets. I'm good at planning and that has kept my head above the water in this bear market.",

Though in my own case, the reward is the platform native token which is on cronos. Its Ferroprotocol, a stableswap with an APR of 546%(as at yesterday evening 12th July 2022). It had got some good interface. And the price is not dumping. There is also Biswap with a good token with a good price and doesn't dump",

I don't quite understand what do you mean of the most involved person, I think everyone are involved in this situation, but it depends on the activity they did that make the inflation happen, I guess it's like a human nature and can't be solved.",

I met some forum posts with graphs showing bitcoin's behavior in periods of increased inflation, and the graphs there did not look positive. In periods of rising inflation, on the contrary, people try to get rid of bitcoin.",

I just heard in the news today that we can expect that the prices for gas will triple within the next months. If that is really true then i think this has a huge impact on a lot of people. I don't know how it is in other countries but here in germany a lot of people are heating with gas and therefore a lot of people have to pay probably a few thousand euros more per year which is a huge amount.I would guess though that we will see the prices of cryptos falling even more because of that, because if money is really short then i don't think that people will use it to invest into crypto or any other financial assets or products. We will see.",

I don't think there is one currently, obviously not even crypto because we are in a bear market and it might take some time for it to recover. And you can't just put your money in the bank, no way that your money will earn interest with the inflation that we are seeing. So there is no way out of this, all we have to do is wait it out till everything settles down in the next couple of years.",

Though crypto offers a lot of ways to beat inflation, this is a good thing if you know how to trade effectively and with Bitcoin you can have more just make sure you do the right thing. US economy is on a big risk, if they are not able to control it most probably this bear market will last longer.",

When we look at this picture from a broad perspective, there are serious economic crises in all countries around the world. Even for large investors, there are troublesome situations. In this period, I see cryptocurrencies as the exit door. I think it will be a big profit return, at least for countries with euro and dollar currencies. However, citizens of countries whose currency is not the dollar or the euro expect serious difficulties in purchasing cryptocurrencies. In the long run, all the citizens of the world are facing great difficulties and poverty in my opinion.",

With Bitcoin, there’s still no guarantee that it can be good since it looks like they are following the stocks trend, and we are still down for some reason. The only way out of this problem is to have a plan regarding finances, US should anticipate and create more solution better for them to lessen their expenses and stop printing too much money.",
