But I know you keep trying. Just like with the Rolex guy.Actually, my reviews are perfectly legit as you can see at the site I sent you. I also had over 250k in volume at localcryptos.com, not that you would be interested in that, having a reasonable discussion is not why you're here. I only deal with people when escrow is involved, if the other party does not want to use escrow then I get the money first. You have negative feedback's because you are a bad person who has been trying to scam people for a while now, even sending messages to them directly.virginorange, the first guy to reply to this thread did a trade of over 1,500 EUR with me.Good luck with your hate campaign against random people on the internet.",
