So if you are looking to promote any project here,  then you should go straight to the point and involve any third-party review site in it.",

If only 1 to 10 reviews discuss this, it's possible that these users have unknowingly violated the ToS on Kraken.Jordan Bajic: https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/653b904b72bbbf91c23f3f72Toanui Llaona: https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6530d07d56df24271b3ce273Currently Kraken is one of the many old exchanges that still exist today, if there's a problem in their background, of course it will be exposed and reported in mainstream media related to crypto. So, it looks like it's just a misunderstanding, maybe as soon as possible they will get the best solution for both parties (Customers and Kraken).",

Trustpilot ratings could be true or paid and that's why always add a grain of salt when reading it there. Based on the experience, that's how you should at those ratings. But that's it, there can be good experiences and bad ones per se for most exchanges that we use even at the most known ones like Binance.This is the good thing about this market that we've got a lot set of choices when we're having troubles or worries about using one of them. We can switch from a to b any moment that we want to. Do you have trouble using them or did they lock your funds? If you have seen that happen to others, it's worrying honestly and you don't want it to happen to you. So before it potentially happens to you, what you have to do is to just leave them and look for a better one that might be more trustworthy for you.",

Or better still,  the reviewer may be a sponsored one and have gotten paid to make such a revision for the exchange at this time and for sure that is the one bad side of Trustpilot because most of the review doesn't reflect the real situation of things in reality.",

Now I will say that when reading those Trustpilot ratings they did seem a bit odd to me, because they were a bit similar in their tone, the language they use, and in how vigorously they demanded that people stop using the platform. So it would make sense if those are bots or shills. On the other hand, some of them do provide transactions IDs upon request by the Kraken team who responds there, so it would seem that those are legit customers.

If you were asking about how good kraken is and i have ever used it previous years but i had stopped to use it since there were better exchange sites that much more friendly users. So far so good and i never encounter any problems with kraken but the i remember that day the platform's UI was not friendly enough for me. That's why i have decided to left from there. Those who said bad in the trust pilot may be fake reviews. I don't even take latest update regarding the how friendly kraken UI this time but the exchange site is always doing regular improvements. This platform was also rarely being linked to the bad behaviors by the club behind the product. Krakan is one of trusted exchange site that is still ever exist since a long time ago. It was showing the commitment owned by kraken to build a good exchange site for its users.",

You should note that it would be so easy to manipulate Trustpilot as it is not requiring some kind of KYC or verification is what is written can be true or not. One can easily destroy a reputation in there for free. Now, am not saying that we should not be listening to bad reviews but what I mean is we should also be doing some critical analysis and balance things out because in the end the best and credible experience and testimony is the one coming from you.",

I'm not just talking about the crypto space, but other online shops and so on.Although it is not an exchange that I use regularly, I know that CEX is always in the top tier in the crypto field. I'm not sure what the OP is concerned about seeing some of the negative feedback about it, but it seems to me that the same negative feedback has appeared in other CEX cases. Just know that the quality of service cannot satisfy everyone and sometimes there are still some cases where users feel uncomfortable. You depend on an assessment tool that you are aware of as the only way to learn about any business. But not only with crypto, but in many other fields I can mention some criteria:- about products and services- brands- teams- business activities- partner- financial reports,... And almost all of them information cannot be compiled from one source but must be searched for. So don't overuse the rating of a certain tool, trustpilot is only a very small part for people to know about the company or business, never consider it as everything.",

I don't know much about Trustpilot I can't say for sure the authenticity of those reviews, Kraken exchange might be a centralized exchange that many people might not like but those reviews are rubbish and ridiculous, get your facts on your own.You can check on this general review and things you need to know about the exchange, in addition, you can check the forum especially the scam board for more threads about Kraken to see if there has been complaint about the exchange. Don't forget to deposit a little amount to test the exchange services, putting all you have with them will put you in more risk since you don't know much about the exchange. Good luck.",

From what i gathered, from the start they have put a lot of effort in security. And if i remember correctly Cobie (crypto cobain) had an account there and spoke highly of them.And since you talk about trustpilot, you need to put things in context, as you should know that you can't trust trustpilot reviews, because people get paid for fudding and shilling there.But let's pretend that trust pilot is reliable for a moment. and Kraken seem to have bad reviews (2.5 stars) Let's compare that to other trust pilot exchange reviews:Kraken 2.5 *Bitfinex 3.1 *Bybit 2.4 *Binance 2.1 *Crypto.com 1.9 *Kucoin 1.6 *Coinbase 1.5 *Poloniex 1.2 *And i am not going to read all the \"they stole my money\" posts because every exchange has those, and sure that there are some less mainstream exchanges with fake volume that still has paid higher rankings.

Most users must have upload their feedback so if theres a negative one then take it as it is. But being surrounded by bots who knows if thats a real statement or what.

Kraken is one the centralized casino that working closely along the regulators which means they don’t do something silly that will jeopardize their relation with regulators. They even allow regulators to look on the KYC submitted to them that show how completely centralized they are.This exchange is an open book to regulators as legit crypto business. Binance is more shady than them. But this kind of openness is discouraged by crypto community because it’s too centralized.",
