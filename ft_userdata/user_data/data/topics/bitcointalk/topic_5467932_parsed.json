      "body": "Sorry for telling you the obvious, but we can't understand much from the text. - Do you want to download the blockchain? If yes, then just spin up a Bitcoin client like Bitcoin Core and let it finish syncing. Import wallets in the process, if you have any.- Do you have a txt file with the private keys? Good, then you can import them in a light client and spend your coins there.- Do you have debug.log in the application directory? That can definitely help us understand your problems with Bitcoin Core, if any.",

Check your software is working correctly. Making sure your private key is stored/backed up you can try uninstalling and installing Bitcoin Core again. Likely Electrum will be simpler for you to use.",

If no miner, no hashrate, that shorter or shortest chain will be a dead one.Many scam forks die with time.How many Bitcoin forks are there?",
