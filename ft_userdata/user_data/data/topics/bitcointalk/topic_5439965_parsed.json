That's less onerous than a previous Senate position that would have required companies to seek a license.The text agreed on by the special legislative committee is due to be approved by the Senate on Feb. 16 and the National Assembly on Feb. 28.\"__A very interesting trend is AML.If the CUS procedure is almost everywhere, then in a few years AML will also be mandatory. And many hodlers will have problems. And some businessmen will have to sell coins on the shadow market and legalize new coins.",

I don't know where he got this.Basically, it's just an adaptation to European Union law regarding economy, health, labour, transport and agriculture.You know what I mean, the stuff that makes all countries to have the same laws, quotas, etc...It does talk a bit about crypto companies but it's just to say their website-services-infrastructure have to be \"secure\" enough.Like if they weren't already doing it...Adding, the fees must not be hidden and clearly listed; and warning people crypto is a high risk investment.The points are the same for any company outside the crypto industry. Including insurrances, banks,...tltr: nothing to be afraid. It's rather a good point for citizens",

BTC and the world of cryptos will perhaps be a little more credible in the eyes of the general population after some regulations, it is sad but I have the feeling that it is not evitable, even in our interest as BTC holder.People will always have the possibility to do P2P, or to go through ATMs to buy their cryptos. The same goes for reselling, even if you stay legal, there are easy ways to get away with not paying taxes in the European Union. In France for example, the rules regarding taxes for small holders and traders have just been relaxed in January 2023, so it's not all bad news. You will find super easily some nice places to pay your taxes for cryptos profits in EU, between 0 and 10Â %.",

For example, in my country I would have to file taxes every week when I get paid from my signature campaign because it is considered other income and must be declared upon receipt within a few days. Not only do I not want to spend time on it every week, I also do not want to finance corrupt politicians from the prime minister down to the lowest levels with more money than I already do.What someone will do with the Bitcoin that I will send them in a transaction is completely irrelevant to me, because if we look at things that way, we all have coins that are tainted in one way or another. This is a completely wrong way of thinking, and the whole thing you emphasize in this thread has nothing to do with what the article is about - if you don't believe me, read what a man who lives in France wrote.",

However, none of the digital asset service providers (VASPs) had ever gone through the full registration process.The amendment introduced a more \"lenient\" licensing regime as opposed to the Senate's extremely stringent requirements. Recall that in December, lawmakers proposed requiring all contractors in the VASP category to be fully licensed by October of this year.Currently, crypto companies prefer to register with the French Financial Market Supervision Commission (AMF) instead of obtaining a license. Currently, there are 60 companies on this list.All in all, it won't be long now. Everything will be resolved today. We are waiting!",

Business as usual.Basically, the new law some politicians wanted was almost impossible to get because it requires companies to have insurance, which is almost impossible for a crypto company. Instead the Senators agreed on a 'stronger' PSAN licence'.When I say 'stronger', it's not so strong compared to the basic PSAN licence:- an effective security and internal control system- an internal policy for the prevention, detection, management and communication of conflicts of interest;- clear and non-misleading communication with their clients;- publication of their fees, etc.There are over 60 companies with the PSAN licence and surely most of them already apply such directives.
