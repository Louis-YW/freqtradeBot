Young entrepreneurs should try to learn from failed businesses and guide themselves with successful businesses.Starting a small business is incredibly difficult and I cannot remember the statistic, but something ridiculously high like 9 out of 10 businesses will fail in the first couple years. It really requires a whole other level of commitment and multitasking ability. Depending on which business you choose, it can require learning all kinds of different and varied abilities. You might have to be the idea developer, the product manufacturer, the art designer, the accountant, the marketing manager and all sorts of other parts. Most people are also starting on a rather limited budget, or quickly use up their starting capital and end up losing a lot of money. Even if you are successful, things like burnout through overwork can easily creep up on you.",

      "body": "Building a business is not as easy as one might think. because in addition to being good at following ongoing trends, as business people we must be able to create trends that lead to our business. because following the trend sometimes won't last long. because the competition will be very tight. but creating a trend is a brilliant innovation in marketing. as before we know a small toy company such as toy cars and gansing. if we look at them, they seem to follow the trend among children who like to watch anime films about car racing fights. So does it last long? in fact not. but if we look deeper and more carefully, it turns out that the company has already designed the toy cars. and before being sold in the market, the company creates a trend first. by adopting an anime film and then the company helped the film to become famous and watched by many children. after the kids started liking the movie and fantasizing about owning the same thing as the main character in the movie. then that's when the toy company sells free toys that have been prepared for a long time in the market. and it is true that it immediately sells in the market.and after a dim trend. then the company did the same with different toys and different movies. Following trends and creating trends is difficult. but if it works. then the profit will be very much. Many toy companies do this.Some of the following tips should also be done in building a business, namely:- Make and have a really mature plan.- have creative ideas and fresh innovations.- Can Follow Market Developments (be it following a trend or building a trend)- study competitors.- build good connections with many circles and companies as well as with customers.- provide the best and friendly service to consumers and also to business partners.- learn the desires of consumers.- and maintain the welfare of workers or employees. so that they give the best hard work to the company and not on the basis of compulsion.actually there are many other tips. but in general the tips above are enough. So far we have seen many business companies go bankrupt due to not being able to keep up with market developments, market trends and not according to consumer wishes/consumer needs. this is something to be aware of.",

Yes it is, businesses doesnt have everything thats why on being an owner then you should be that attentive and adaptive on the same time.If there were lacking then you should immediately add up because if people would find out that it doesnt really have that kind of feature and find out something else then they would really simply skip and leave out.Its true that people would always be looking or go after for the best.Building up a business doesnt automatically means success.There's always been a risk and this is why you would be trying out to avoid as much as you could and trying out to give out the best service that you could really able to do so.",

I donâ€™t need to spell it out that when there isnâ€™t peace and stability, business will definitely not thrive. You would also need power to run your business. And Nigeria presently canâ€™t generate enough for its personal useGovernment policies in my opinion is the greatest hindrance of them all as a government could put in place policies and when a new government is elected, the old policies are thrown out and new policies are put in place that businesses would have to follow. Government interference also plays a key role in the demise of businesses",

Unless you have millions to burn and can keep on adjusting the scales until you start making some profit. But then it wouldn't qualify as a small-scale biz.This is what amazon did in India. They had billions to burn and seized a major chunk of E-commerce market while parallelly figuring out a revenue model that works.",

At such times it is very difficult to maintain a business. it is not surprising that as a result of an economic crisis, many shops and companies were able to close, even factories that had been around for a long time had closed because they were unable to pay employee salaries due to the products produced there had been a decline in interest in the market so that they were not selling well.There are many factors that can make a business fail. both internal and external factors.usually to maintain a business when we have many employees and at the same time income decreases. then the reduction of employees is the solution. despite the fact that the effectiveness is still 50:50 but it can minimize expenses. reduction of employees and reduction of production if it is a factory.and today the global economic conditions are really worrying so that it is increasingly difficult for small businesses to survive.",

Unfavorable government policies and external factors like the war in Ukraine are silently killing businesses in my country. Due to inflation and reduction in government revenue, the government is over-taxing businesses, making them collapse. There are also businesses that have been witchhunt by the government because they supported or are supporting the opposition political party. Such businesses suffer and sometimes collapse because of the perceived political affiliation of their owners.In my lifetime, I have heard about or witnessed conflict or wars in different countries but the global effect of the war in Ukraine has given me a clear glimpse of the interconnection and interdependence of the world economies. The increase in the cost of oil and gas, power, and other agricultural products due to the war in Ukraine has led to the death of many small and medium-scale businesses.",

And in 2020 the Government of Lagos State in Nigeria stopped the Gokada from working citing insecurity. A claim which made no sense. Even though, the company has now diversified into Logistics and Food Delivery, their ride hailing plan was the best because the company came with a very good initiative, where you can track their bikes to know where they are and where they are going. They are well registered. You can even track the bike from your phone, but the government cancelled it without a good explanation.",

They forget to plan some contingency measures that can happen on their business in the future like if a typhoon or the pandemic last year which ruined many businesses.I don't think this is absolutely true as most new business entrepreneurs are planning way ahead on their business endeavors and most of them have a roadmap to follow through. Also, newbie entrepreneurs know how hard to handle a business before even starting one as they will need to against huge companies. I guess most new businesses fail to run in the long run due to not being able to follow up with the roadmap as well as compromising any delays that could happen on the roadmap planned. Another main reason why small businesses fail is that huge companies overwhelm them and they cannot keep up with the other big businesses' pricing, marketing, and services.",

In business there are always ups and downs, therefore business can't run in one direction. For example, only targeting one particular consumer, if in it there are 2 or 3 target markets it might be much more stable. In today's digital era, businesses face big corporate competitors. As a business person, it is very important to pay attention to digital trends, because then adjusting to what the digital market needs can be fulfilled. One of them is digital marketing, this is clearly important in reaching market elements. Utilizing a video marketing platform as a means to highlight the products we have. Not only that, nowadays the use of smartphones is a must for young and old alike. That way we can direct them to a platform that we build to make it easier for them to explore what items they are looking for and need. Build a website to be accessible to every element or rather by building an online store. Give them the best 24-hour service, and evaluate each customer to provide as objective an assessment as possible so that our business continues to be updated according to consumer desires.",
