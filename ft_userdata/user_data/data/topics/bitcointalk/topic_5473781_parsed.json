Or you can just ignore his posts, PM and probably reports his PM again as unsolicited. I havenâ€™t read about a laid down punishment for this act just account buying it is frowned upon and the punishment to the offender lies on your own hands.

What happened to making good posts and contributing to the forum? Well I doubt there'd be a need for that if we all begged our way through to where we are now, right?Â Well if you ask me I'd suggest you let the matter slide, try to observe if such will repeat itself again, because if you report the account and it gets banned or tagged, who knows how many alts the user has. I wonder if there's a way to know when such useless PMs are being sent so that you can easily delete before reading. Maybe this is where attaching a title to your PM comes in handy.",

Just some recommendations, for those thinking about asking for merit, nothing for those who receive the requests. Furthermore, I think that this type of request should not lead to any type of punishment. There are worse things than asking for merits.There are users who like to be asked for merits, they even create topics for these requests. Others prefer not to be bothered about this matter.Therefore, ignoring these requests may be the best solution. But if they really become bothersome, then there are already valid arguments for reporting - not for the request, but for bothering.",

I think its because people don't want their alt accounts found out.Â  Funny you should bring that up; ever since I announced that I'm no longer including the gambling section in my post history review offer, I've been getting way fewer requests--and the reason I'm excluding posts there is because I strongly suspected I was doing reviews for a bunch of alt accounts even though I don't have enough proof to connect them.OP, if I got a PM just asking for merits without having to look at the member's posts I might report the PM to the mods depending on my mood (which has been as sour as a rotten lemon as of late).Â  But if I were to take the high road, I'd just put that member's PMs on ignore and be done with it.Â  If he's PMing you, he's probably PMing other members and somebody's likely to report him anyway.Â  Looks like merits are becoming more popular than they seem to have been for the past year or so.Â  I was beginning to wonder why members weren't as obsessed with ranking up like they always were.",

As far as can be seen from the answers in this topic, the majority have not done anything or will not do anything, and this only encourages those who want to get the merits the easy way.Of course, there are also users who have publicly offered to send them requests in which they then check the post history of a user and assign merit to the posts they consider worthy of it.
