  "content": "So the nation Kenya has thought it wise for sometime now to infuse 'coding' as a subject in its basic primary, secondary schools curriculum. It is in a bid to facilitate development in the nation as technology and innovation recounts majorly as the future of mankind. Since 2022 this initiative started, it has shown remarkable improvement in the thinking, team relationship and problem solving skills of these kids in general. Coming down to our country, which is supposedly the giant of Africa, I am yet to see such huge idea incorporated in the primary, secondary schools mostly as unemployment and cost of living is in wake.  No doubt technology is advancing rapidly and the major one, is that of Blockchain, cryptocurrencies and Web3. Other than the government looking for how to tax crypto currency and prevent the youths or unemployed from seeking opportunities therein for their betterment, such an idea of teaching the younger kids in schools should be the priority to grow wealth in the nation within coming years. We need our economy improved and subjects that bother on entrepreneurship, Blockchain, coding, cryptocurrencies, Web3 should be made a common denominator in all schools curriculum. The incoming administration should endeavour to take a cue from the country Kenya and start introducing wealth related subjects like coding, Blockchain, Web3 into all schools curriculum, so as to reduce the hardship and poverty standard of its citizenry in the nearest future. This is how the leaders of tomorrow should become.Any thoughts?For more read about how Kenya has done this, visit the link:https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.africanews.com/amp/2023/04/26/coding-classes-for-children-in-nairobis-kibera-district/",

But if only our the new governments can review the school curriculum, add new trends such as \"Blockchain, Crypto, A.I & Tech\", fund it and supervise it to the fullest, then it will be a welcome development to our future leaders of tomorrow.",

After all we have seen it's not what one ends up studying in many cases, that they get to make a career out of. Why not catch them young with the right technical knowledge that would make them earn for themselves and contribute from a young age to society instead of constituting nuisance and indulging in vices and crimes.I just hope this access is granted to anyone willing to sponsor such a change across all facets in this current administration.",

For me I personal feel this is also going to be a continuation of the last government as it all one same ruling party.",

Na true talk you yan so my brother, because exposure na one important thing wey dey help people grow and make an environment better, and as eh don be like this, I see say na only the governments get both the funds of bringing & implementing good better updates wey dey help the youths of other developing nations do well economically to our own nation. Because just imagine how eh for us currently wey dey this forum now, only had it been former ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo never brought G.S.M to our country far back in 2001, because I dey sure say non of us for dey this forum by now.  So eh go really make sense if this new administration fit do better than the past by creating more job opportunities both physically and digitally.",

Ajekuta Steel Company in Kogi would been one the best company in Africa to produce iron in the continent but the national leaders just abandoned the project. In the recent days I have discovered that primary school teachers are using internet devices to teach our children. A small pamphlet look like device that has all the subjects. That is the full curriculum is installed in the device. So in the nearest future things might be okay in that aspect of life.",

And the new president promised the youths of Nigeria during his campaign that he will make Blockchain, BTC, cryptocurrencies and other digital business available for the youths to have access to them easily in the country. I don't have any negative doubt for this new administration because our president Bola Ahmed Tinubu is a someone that value the progress of our nation which he will surely do what will make others countries to see Nigeria as the true giant of African.",
