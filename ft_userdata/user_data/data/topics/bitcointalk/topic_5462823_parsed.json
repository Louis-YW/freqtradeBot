  "content": "Hello there,I don't know how exactly to phrase it, nor do I know if what I say is accurate; it's just how I see it. Binance has been frequently indirectly promoting newly launched tokens on their platform, either by airdropping them, by completing quizzes, through pre-sales, or by farming them through their Launchpad. What are your thoughts on this? Could we claim that it's some sort of manipulation since a large number of these tokens that are listed through one of the previously mentioned ways are pumped the moment they are launched in the market and start being traded? I don't have many examples right now because I've stopped tracking how many new tokens are being added on a weekly basis, but for instance, Binance is now offering to farm CyberConnect and SEI, which I'm also farming myself. There's no information about their price, nor can they be traded on the platform yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're hyped the moment they're launched.What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe that it's a kind of manipulation and/or some sort of reward for Binance for promoting newly created tokens?",

This is not a manipulation though since they are the exchanges and its their job to list crypto so they can offer it to the public. This is cryptomarket and we cannot blame Binance for listing a new token and then later on, the price will dump because its driven by the demand and supply and not because of Binance itself.",

If they can make money out of this tokens by doing the promotions that you have said, then it's up to us whether to fall for their trick or not.Again, they have been accused of manipulation in the past, but CZ can put it as something that we can't do anything about it for now as they are the top exchanges, admit it or not.",

Though I don’t see manipulation with regards to its price movement, the market of Binance is huge that’s why the target of many good projects are to be listed on Binance. The airdrop, launchpad or whatever kind of strategy with Binance is part of their agreement for sure since Binance can’t do that alone.",

However, doesn't this resemble a pump-and-dump scheme? One of the coins I tried participating in during one of their launches was Alice. It was pumped the second it was officially launched for trading, but died down shortly after when the hype slowly decreased, and now it's barely surpassing $0.90. Certainly, Binance isn't to blame for people trying to take advantage of these hypes, but to me, it looks like a poor and short-term way to promote and manipulate random tokens.",

Binance is a business entity and has to be making good profits all the time otherwise it would stop and file for bankruptcy. What it is doing is promotion and in our commercialized world promotions are found everywhere including the crypto industry. In case, a project promoted under the Binance platform can go down under then the responsibility is with the people behind the project and we can then ask Binance to vet well next time. I don't equate promoting to manipulation because right now we should be intelligent enough and maybe even experienced enough to determine which of the crypto assets - new or old - we should be supporting for and also make some profits from.",

In the world today, people use their influence to get what they want. Binance is simply ising their influence to get these projects to launch on their platform. The projects get their token value fairly priced in (or should I say pumped) and binance takes plenty of that liquidity. Win-win situation. Can it be regarded as manipulation? I'm not entirely sure (i'm not a legal or psychology expert) but it looks more like a partnership vs manipulation.",

I remember that this is what happened with Shiba Inu coin. This currency is not much different from any other cryptocurrency other than that it has been promoted in a Good way, and I think they paid Binance for that or got a good percentage of it.In terms of listing any cryptocurrency on Binance, developers pay for the inclusion of that currency, and then Binance makes great gains from listing, not to mention deals that may happen under the table.",

Do you believe that it's a kind of manipulation and/or some sort of reward for Binance for promoting newly created tokens?Most often, those promotions are not only for newly created tokens but also for already existing tokens that are finally coming to list on Binance. There was a time some years ago that I was moderating a project telegram group. That project submitted a listing proposal to Binance Exchange about twice, and it got rejected because they were unable to meet all the requirements of Binance Exchange before they could list the token. I know that Binance Exchange has several characteristics they consider in a project before they can actually agree to promote and list it, and before any project is promoted by Binance, they might have met the requirement. With that, I don't think Binance just manipulates the price of those new or old coins, but rather, with the approach of their airdrop, farming, and louchpad, they only make the coin really known by many people, and after it's finally listed, the price usually shoots up before it begins to correct because of the great number of people that are rushing to buy the token. Perhaps Binance gets paid for the service they offer, so after receiving payment, they make sure that the project gets wide exposure.",

I think binance promoting them is somehow the support they give to the project or a promotion for their own platform.

Good impact what Binance rule regulation about 5 minutes pause time for selling coins above x10 from pre sale price, arkham is the first rule adopted by Binance with selling price x10 from pre sale but what possibility with new launcpool and there are not pre sale price. Usually all new coins when listing on Binance has potential growing up more than x10 exactly with Lauchpad coins with much profitable. Have weakness with Binance on launcpad reward allocation due investor have much money automatically have bigger reward coins allocation from launchpad or launchpool. I believe with Binance is top trusted exchange without manipulative when listing new coins, probably have with failed coins when listing on Binance but is not totally fault from Binance.",
