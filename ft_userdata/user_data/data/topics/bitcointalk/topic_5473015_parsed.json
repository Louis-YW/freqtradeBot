There is currently no price prediction of this token.How do you bring up both of those two different bolded sentence parts in one paragraph? Don't you see that you are contradicting yourself? The HYPES token simply a pump and dump token and once it starts dumping, it will be endless until there is no more volume, delisted from the platforms and completely dead.I mean, look at the chart of this token... you really think it's going to miraculously resurrect?",

There is currently no price prediction for this token.Buddy, it's not wise to recommend anyone an asset to trade with to anyone, there are a lot of such coins and tokens with better or worse tokenomics but their overall potential is zero. supply can not be considered as the only point to consider a token/coin tradeable.To ensure safety better to study the project its vision their potential, and then study its fundamentals after making these necessary prerequisites you should analyze the community's strengths and sentiments, after all this you are ready to go.",

Anyone who wants to think about this should make sure that this currency will be listed in HTX before making any decision",
