I have a few bank accounts & they all provide internet banking services so I can see my balances & what I’m spending on easily with my phone or computer if I choose.I actually have notifications that pop up on my phone when I buy something. Also using Apple Pay is quite easy to follow my spending trail also.",

      "body": "I'm quite surprised by the question. OP, do you just spend money without limits? I just thought that it is normal for us to have a specific weekly or monthly budget allocated for our regular expenses like food, house bills, and maybe tuition fees for your kids if you have them. I have a monthly budget that is not that tight but not that big because I valued regular savings as a very very important part of my regular income. Especially now that bitcoin and crypto, in general, will be heading into a bull run sometime next year. I have my goals and I am hoping for another life-changing gain in the next crypto bull run.",
