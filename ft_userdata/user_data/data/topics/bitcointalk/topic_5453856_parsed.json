I have recently joined a similar review campaign and they are paying bitcoins. You should do something similar. I mean you can give people some deposit bonus and similar crap but then you would force people to deposit money and nobody will do that probably. You are not going to attract any decent members that way. If you want to get quality reviews, you need to pay.",

Freespin is not really liked because the results are uncertain even though it is given in big amounts but members here will prefer money with a definite value, so in my opinion, only prizes in the form of Bitcoins will be very attractive to the best reviewers from this forum.",

What could be a juicer reward but Bitcoin as a reward, many casinos have launched this kind of campaign and they proved that it works so you'll just follow their lead, you should hire a manager who will pick participants because they know who they are going to pick and since you're only picking 15 participants I'm sure you can get the best reviewers for your campaign.It's good that you launch this kind of campaign so gamblers will have ideas of what to expect from your casinos through these reviews.",

You can make this cash deposit on our Megapari account so that we can use it already for writing the content of our review. Make sure to choose only natural gambler users so that you can be assured that the review is genuine and not a bullshit generic comment by just visiting your website without actual experience with it. Cash drop or Free bet on sportsbook without minimum odds requirements is fine rewards for me.Count me in if you are already looking for participants and make sure to create a formal review campaign thread on services or game and rounds section depending on the rewards that you want to give.",

But in case you do not want it, I might like it being in my Megapri wallet or in a form of free spins (at least around ~$0.2. $0.4 will be better ). Bonus feature would also suffice as reward (e.g., bonus feature on Sweet Bonanza). Question. Is this the thread where you also want to get the participants? If so, can you count me in? If not, then I'll be looking forward for that review campaign thread.Good luck!",

In addition, if you want to announce it in Economy>Marketplace, I think this is the way to go, because bounties, prizes, bonuses... paid in altcoins should go in the alternative cryptocurrencies section.Rewards ranged from 60$ to 95$ per review (bonus included), which is a good price to me.Anyway, if you're thinking in creating a good campaign here in bitcointalk, let me recommend that you hire a good campaign manager like Trofo, who very professionally managed the aforementioned.",

Other alternative scenario can be by having review contest where the best reviewers will share the prizepool. Here is an example: - Top 3-5 reviewers will get a share of 50-70% from the prizepool (can be equally or based on position 1st 2nd 3rd etc). - Other reviewers will get a share from the remaining prizepool but it should be limited to specific number of valid reviewers. With this kind of contest, participants will try their best to review your site and I think that you will get better feedback with such review contest. Just my 2 cents.",

I would very much appreciate it if the rewards you tend to accept to give out be in bitcoin. As you can see from other response and replies, all tarries and are in tandem with the opinion of rewarding participants in bitcoin. So therefore, it would be nice you adopt and enact it immediately so that all would be ok with it. Looking forward to seeing you accept the proposal of accepting bitcoin as rewards for the review campaign.",

I think it would be better for both sides if the reward will be the platform's token in order for players to make use of it in the site and for gambling site ofcourse since the rewards will be somewhat returned to them than to just be taken away such as if the payment is in usd or btc based. If it would be in form of btc as a regular payment, then expect non gamblers would also participate just for the reward and that may conflict the reliability of the reviews 'coz it will just be a constructed review and not experienced based review in the viewpoint of a gambler.",

We can get the tokens developed and released by the casinos we're going to review for but ehh, I'd much rather get some sort of free spins or something of the sort instead of those, coins from new casinos are a sort of \"investment\" in reality and as a gambler, I don't really think I'd appreciate that. I'd honestly put a cash reward, whether in Bitcoin or a flat amount of fiat in the casino account as the top option, the next would be probably some bonus perks if you're going to do reviews rarely, like permanent ones, or if you're doing this regularly, then yea bonus free spins would probably be the only option by then.",

However, it might be worth considering a combination of different incentives. By offering a range of bonuses like free spins, or even VIP perks, you can provide a comprehensive incentive package. This approach would showcase the casino's appreciation for reviewers and its commitment to establishing a mutually beneficial relationship.In addition, it would be useful to establish clear guidelines and criteria for the reviews, ensuring the quality of the feedback received. By doing so, you can effectively reward participants while also gaining valuable insights to enhance your casino offerings. Given the existence of several review campaigns for different casinos on this forum, it would be beneficial for you to analyze and learn from their approaches. Understanding what has worked well in those campaigns can help you design a successful review campaign that meets the expectations of participants and yields valuable feedback for your casino.",
