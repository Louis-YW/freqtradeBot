You can also help the network with validating transactions. But take note that even if you don't use bitcoin core, there are still many wallets that give you full control over your fund and you don't have to keep your bitcoin on exchanges.",

Not a bad idea but the security and protection of your wallet always depend on us how you protect your device from any attack or how secured your device is.A device without protection and not secured is still vulnerable to any attacks unless you installed it on Ubuntu OS or run it offline.Do you have a full node? On what OS you installed Bitcoin Core?",

Not at all.  Bitcoin Core is the wallet which is  closely integrated with bitcoin node and the use of it is good for  your privacy as there is no need to communicate with third party servers to get wallet balance or send transaction, your node does those things  itself. Moreover, if you have 8333 port open your node extends a little bit the bandwidth of bitcoin network thus reducing the network latency.",

Although i expect it always get update as long as Bitcoin is alive.For anyone wondering that may be unaware: Running the node pruned[1] is always an option though - it decreases the size of the blockchain considerably. The downside of this is that, as the name implies, you won't be holding a complete copy of the blockchain and you won't be able to scan older addresses.[1]https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#configuration-tuning",

Some are more secure than others, but every wallet in existence (and indeed, every electronic device) has possible attack vectors.I would also point out that Bitcoin Core is not a particularly secure wallet when used as a hot wallet. It is like any other hot wallet - it is only secure as the machine which is running it. If it is being ran on a machine which is used daily to browse the internet, download files, stream media, etc., then it is in a very risky environment and could easily be exposed to malware.Running a node is necessary for the security of being able to independently verify all the blockchain data, but it is not sufficient to protect your coins. For any significant amount of coins then you ideally want them on an airgapped wallet, with a watch only wallet linked to your copy of Bitcoin Core.",

But if you forget the password, you can't recovery it.Only the initial versions of Bitcoin Core have Satoshi code in it. Since then, it has been completely rewritten multiple times, but there are always the PGP keys from the Bitcoin Core organization developers which can be used to verify the release downloads, and each release is built by multiple people to ensure there is no security bug or hidden malware inside it.",

But for someone who seeks integrity for their data then their only choice is to connect their own node to their own server which pushes with no other option other than downloading entire blockchain data so they never have to rely on trusted/third party servers.",
