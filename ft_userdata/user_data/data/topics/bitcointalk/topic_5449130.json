Quote from: Dave1 on April 17, 2023, 09:10:56 AMAnd probably we can lay all arguments against bitcoin mining being harmful to the environment.This is not what I also support because if there is no bitcoin, people are using electricity, big industries are using electricity and emitting carbon and global warming causing gases to the environment. But what is important is how they are producing electricity.",

Any discussions about Bitcoin mining impact need to be backed with high quality research instead of anecdotes or random Internet articles.But to me the bottom line is that Bitcoin consumes a small fraction of total electricity generation, and electricity generation is responsible for a small fraction of carbon emissions. That makes Bitcoin mining a rather small climate change offender when compared to other industries.",
