These coingeek people where do they come from?? earth to coingeek!LOL, the authors really doesn't understand how and why a project should be listed on popular exchanges. And it help them a lot to get where the price they want because listing on exchanges like Binance will bring new investors to them thus pushing the price to significant levels.QuoteI say this because some of the most popular coins and tokens from an investment, speculation, or even utility (think coins and tokens used for games) perspective were not listed on big-name exchanges but still experienced demand that led to exponential increases in value and application use.I might tend to agree, but look BSV is touted to be the real one right? it's not like its another utility or token or altcoins. It's supposedly the vision of Satoshi and yet you are not going to put in on popular exchange and believed that people will simply invest on them? I don't think so.",

They're not going to go back on there. So that's the difference.
