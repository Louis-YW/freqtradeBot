Basically what it means is that there's your regular card setup with 4 fights (I mostly see this in boxing) and at least one has some big name that attracts a ton of public. For instance, Mayweather's last exhibiton fight has over 4 million views in japan:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq0BSRFM9PwNone of these fights are sanctioned, there's no official scoring or winner. So my question is: How is it even possible to place bets on such fights if no official winner is announced? I would bet on Floyd winning every single one of these but then again, how does this even work if no scoring is done?Floyd is fighting again some huge UK Youtuber \"Deji\" in a couple of weeks, I would place bets but I don't want to end up scammed given the grey area of this whole exhibiton fights thing.",

Plus if the odds maker gets carried away the bets would most likely just get voided or canceled since there's no determined winner.Then again I don't think it's worth betting on an exhibition match knowing the odds would be one-sided compared to an official boxing match where they compete at a much tighter level.",

      "body": "Definitely, there is no judges in Floyd's recent fight with a Japanese fighter, and so bookies open up whether he will win or lose that fight simply as that. And so far he has knock out his opponent if he is fighting in Japan but maybe holding up when facing others.That's why I usually don't bet on this kind of exhibitions fight because it's either rigged or setup. Floyd will not allow himself to get beaten in exhibition, so for sure, he will continue to win unless Pacquiao is next and the fight could ended in a draw.",

      "body": "There must be a winner in whatever form it may take. Certainly, there must be a winner declared in the end. It might just be a winner without having to prove his points per round or why he came out as one, but I suppose it's enough for the gambling odds to be settled. Anyway, if you are seeing a whole lot of gray areas in this whole exhibition saga in boxing, then you can avoid it altogether. To be honest, this kind of matches aren't only exhibition fights. The Pauls are into professional bouts. This exhibition virus has already crept into the professional scene for quite a while.",

I'd honestly avoid it if you can, especially if you're seeing the gray areas yourself. If ever I'd think sportsbooks would only put out odds on the match results itself, who won and who lost, and even then I'd doubt they'd actually add it since, well, most exhibition matches have very big skill gaps between the competitors.",

And so if Mayweather is like 1.0x-1.1 favorite, then there is no value in that kind of bet.So it's better to stir away and smart boxer fans know that this is just for pure entertainment, nothing more and money making for boxers like Floyd Mayweather or the Paul brothers.",

If it's goes to distance, there's no one will win, lose or draw. But each exhibition match are vary one by one since it depends on the both party who create and agree with their rules. While in amateur or professional fights there's an official judges and there's a winner, loser or draw depends on the score.If you want to bet on boxing exhibition match, I don't think bet on Mayweather is profitable since he will become a huge favorited. You need to consider bet Jake Paul vs Anderson Silva, IMO Jake Paul will win even though he's an underdog.",

You need to watch previous exhibition matches first or get some information online to know if what the judges are looking for so that you won't think that you have been scammed by a bookie.",
