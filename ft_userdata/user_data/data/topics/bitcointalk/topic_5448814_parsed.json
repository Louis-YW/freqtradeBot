      "body": "If you are three, you can make it 2-of-3 multisig setup. If it is 3-of-3 multisig and one of you has no access to his seed phrase again, that means the coins is lost because the three of you needs to sign the transaction generated on the 3-of-3 multisig wallet, unlike 2-of-3 that requires just two among you three to sign any transaction generated.If you are 3, having 2-of-3 multisig, you will need your seed phrase and the other two master public keys (from the other two persons) to setup the wallet again during importation. But just 2 person that have the multisig wallet setup can use it to spend.So if anyone among you lose his seed phrase in 2-of-3 multisig, inform the other two persons. Setup new 2-of-3 multisig wallet and move the bitcoin to the new wallet. That won't be possible with 3-of-3 as the 3 of you need to sign the transaction before broadcasting it for recovery.I hope you understand this with other multisig wallet setup.",

Better a 2-of-3.Are you just asking hypothetically, OP? At the individual level a 2-of-3 already provides a lot of security, I don't know if for very high net worth individuals or at the corporate level it would make sense to have more.",

In the first place, you should arrange/plan the multi sig with the assumption that one or a few people in the multisig might die or becomes disabled to the point that he/she wouldn't be able to sign a transaction.You should almost never be doing X of X multisig, but instead X-n of X, as some sort of insurance for potential unfortunate circumstances.",

You can be able to disable or bypass Trustedcoin signing or keys in which you can use your other key which is the second one with you to sign a transaction as two keys are needed. No second person as a business or family with you not to talk of the third person which the OP is referring to.Because Electrum 2FA (or even lightning network) have multisig setup functionality does not mean we should refer to them as a multisig wallet.",

Now we are talking about Bitcoin, it is gone forever if one of the 3 is dead, there is no making this right than to give up. This type of plan should be carefully think about before proceeding, ask questions about what will happen if one of us is down, have a backup plan just in case.",
