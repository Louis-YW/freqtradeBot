  "content": "No bloviated preface like I'd normally write here.I've reached a certain point in my life where my need for cash to live on far outweighs my need for new bicycle parts, underwear, haircuts, toilet paper, and collectible HW wallets.  Regarding that last one, I am trying to sell off some of my puny collection on eBay but they have a knack for locating sellers' orifices, finding spots for new ones, and then violating all of them until you're left with dust--which the government then taxes, but that's another story.So I have this Coldcard Genesis Edition:And the member I got it from will recognize it instantly, and to him I apologize.  Is there any interest in one of these?  I know I could hold an auction, but I'm reluctant to because I've never done one.I've also got a few 2022 Ballet Lunar New Year cards and was wondering the same thing:Any input (not of the eBay variety if you know what I mean) would be greatly appreciated.  You guys know this stuff like walking encyclopedias, and I feel like a palsied dollar store novel.",

Lets bot forget Alitin and also Microsoul as well.  The pain for Coldkey is too fresh at the moment but given time they will increase in value for sure.   I still have all my cards and will keep them as part of my collection as painful of a memory that they are regardless..",

I appreciate that bit of advice--on the rare occasion I make a post or thread in this section, I feel like a total noob since I have it on ignore.  Why?  Because reading threads about crypto collectibles and looking at pics of all of the awesome stuff everyone's either collecting or selling makes me want to buy, buy, buy.  And right now I not only don't have enough extra money for HW wallets and such, I actually have to sell some of what I have out of necessity.  Anyway, because I don't follow the section I didn't know those two members provided that service.  However, I imagine the auctions you said they're coordinating are for expensive items and what I've got is cheap by comparison.Here's a very strange thing that's happened since I started this thread:There are a grand total of two members of this forum that I've exchanged written letters with; one is a real pen pal, and the other is a regular in the Collectibles section that I've exchanged letters with a few times, but infrequently.  After I created this thread, I sold two of the Ballet cards to a person who lives three miles away from one of the members I mentioned, and another two cards to a person who lives on an island, away from the continental United States, and about 60 miles from the other member.  I thought that was a really, really weird coincidence.",

I havent met anyone that is a bigger asshole than myself at least lolOh, I know this section has amazing people in it--and there's a lot of passion for bitcoin/crypto collectibles and for cryptocurrency in general that comes through loud and clear.  One of my first interactions a long time ago was with Lesbian Cow, and they were a lot nicer to me than I expected (though I forget why we had the occasion to chat via PM in the first place).  I don't avoid this section because I'm averse to the personalities but because if I spent much time here I'd be wanting to buy constantly.  I've got collectors' blood flowing through my veins.Minerjones was also extremely generous to me when I asked him about capsules for the copper Zepher memorial rounds.  I think I asked him a question about the diameter not being standard and if a nickel-sized capsule would be appropriate, and he just sent me a bunch of them and wouldn't accept payment or a tip.  That's class, and I've been browsing Bitcoin Penny periodically ever since.And thanks for the offer to assist with selling the Coldkey, I appreciate it.",

That does explain why they sold so quickly--and the referral was much appreciated, by the way--but unless I'm missing something obvious, it doesn't explain how the buyer was so close to my pen pal.  You're not the pen pal, nor was the second buyer who lives only a few miles away.  I'm obviously not going to name names, but I wonder if they know each other.Quote from: krogothmanhattan on August 11, 2023, 07:46:45 PM  Nice price you got on Ebay for $110....Perhaps the market there is not so aware of the issue with Coldkey at all.  Again I think these cards will go up in price in time....we are still bruising from the beating we got from Coldkey in this forum sectionThe Coldkey wasn't sold on eBay but to a member here who was very generous with the offer he made.  I know the card represents a line around the block of black eyes, but the history behind them will be something that'll be looked back on and pondered at some point in the future.  I wish I wasn't forced to sell mine, but alas I need a roof over my head.",
