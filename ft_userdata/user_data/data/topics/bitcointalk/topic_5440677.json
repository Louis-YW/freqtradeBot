We have a 280kwatt solar array which fuels a big piece of our mine.It nets about 55kwatts 24/7/365 the mine uses about 110 kwatts 24/7/365thus we are 50% solar powered.Do you have any special fees for us as a green miner?We could reduce the mine and just go solar which would mean 55 kwatts 24/7/365 as solar.we could do all 30 watts a th or less btc miners.What are your incentives to be 100% green solar vs 50% solar vs 0% green solar55 kwatts all solar would cap us at about 1.65-2.50 ph",
