There's nothing totally original or innovative about Binance smart chain. It's just another centralized and highly manipulated project CZ and Binance thought they could create so that they sway people from using Bitcoin and other truly decentralized networks and enable them to monopolize the whole crypto industry in the name of \"cheap fees\" and \"faster transactions\"The same applies to BUSD. The time will come when everything comes to light.",

They send me mails each week to verify my identity to get some bonus, bsc chain is full of scams/rug pulls,  their idos - binance must have printed millions in those projects. I would even consider cz to be reason of ftx's fall (just to avoid misunderstanding, I ain't supporting ftx at all), ftx was competition to binance hence cz did what he did.",

I am a trader and one day people will know how heavily manipulated BNB is and all the pointless copycat chains. ~snip~I can't say anything else that would make more sense than what you wrote, because such things have already been proven in the last ten years, but there are millions of naive people to whom you can sell anything, as long as it is nicely packaged. The recent statements made by CZ regarding how CEX are safer than non-custodial wallets in the sense that most will lose their coins if they keep them themselves is just a confirmation of the direction their game is going.I have never invested in a stable coin or token in my life because I consider it completely wrong and risky, and in just a few months Kwon+Bankman cost their clients over $100 billion, almost 1/3 of all mined BTC if we were to take into account the market cap. It is stupid to even ask the question of whether the lesson has been learned, because we know the answer to that question...",

Binance has stand the test of time and to let you know, you can not just shake them much as they have a strong base in which they rely on. Binance has built a niche for itself and so therefore has always  been a threat to others. At all cost, they are fighting to see binance go down. I am not a fan of centralised exchanges but to be frank, CEX has really played a good role in Crypto accessibility in the world and binance which happens to be the biggest CEX has played a major role too.",

If they are still around in 10 years without major hacks/problems then we can talk about it.Quote from: Broadanbig on January 07, 2023, 02:17:53 PM Binance has built a niche for itself and so therefore has always  been a threat to others.And what is that niche, because Binance meddles in almost everything crypto related.
