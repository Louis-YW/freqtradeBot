Scammers using this technique will keep coming up with more fake websites so crypto users should be more careful.",

If they could use it for good cause then everyone could benefit from it.After they build the website they spend a lot of effort to reach that website to crypto users using social media. The way they use their time for bad purposes, if they use that time for something good, it would be beneficial for the crypto community. Crypto users who have no idea about Merge can trust such websites to secure their funds. And once scammers get access to that user's wallet, they can steal the entire fund. Scammers know there are a lot of new crypto users who can be scammed, so they spend money on creating such websites.",

Nowadays, it is not complicated or expensive to make a website like this, especially since such people do not hesitate to steal code and design from others, and advertising can be quite cheap if the scammer uses social networks personally, or hires someone who does it professionally and he does not charge dearly for his service.If we look at the Services board, you can see that exactly such advertising is offered, and after all, various databases of crypto users are available online - the Ledger database alone had over 1 million publicly exposed e-mails.What we can do is warn others and report the site as deceptive, and the easiest way is through the browser: Help -> Report deceptive siteThe more reports, the sooner the website will be blocked in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera...)",

Its so easy for someone to create all over again and used different trend news for scamming. Is there a way to strict the creation of such website or impose maybe a KYC before they are allowed to do one or at least ask for a credentials where the users info could be recorded in any case they are trying to do a scam, authority can bust them out.",

If you see a domain name with double or tripple letter, it is an suspicious signal of a phishing site. Most people don't pay attention to that unfortunately. They should, but they don't. There is also the language barrier that is a problem. Those not familiar with English wouldn't know that \"cap\", as in \"market capitalization\", isn't spelled with a double \"p\". And the brain sees what the brain wants to see if you don't have much knowledge about scams and phishing. If you check the top left corner of the image in OP, they have added the official logo of CoinMarketCap and that's what the victims will see when they access the site.",

What is a bigger problem for me is that such websites are not blocked at the same speed (or at all) when they are reported for phishing via google safe browsing. This way of protecting potential victims used to be quite effective.",

People who know about such scams/phishing in crypto market will never click on unknown links. This website has been created by scammers in such a way that if you don't look carefully at the url, you will not be able to understand that it is a fake website. So newbies need to be smarter so that they don't become easy prey.",
