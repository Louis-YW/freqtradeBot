  "content": "We are trying to find new innovative ways to use blockchain technology. Etalon is one of the more widespread ways of blockchain use but with a bonus of real world \"handy\" usability with our Providers. We also found a way to integrate blockchain technology in our software, Nano, utilizing the innate security of blockchain data.Etalon as a concept has been in development since the start of 2019, and went through a rapid development cycle. Our goal was to create a token with real-world use cases.Unfortunately, most cryptocurrency projects do not realise that the promotion of blockchain technology should not consist of creating more and more cryptocurrencies. In most cases, this only leads to worthless currencies.Translating blockchain technology into real life situations is a problem that we need to tackle with the necessary creativity. Payment as a function is a good thing, but it is not enough; the blockchain is a mathematical model designed to solve an uncertain problem. We approach the authentication possibilities hidden in the model in a different way. We built an API that can identify who has Etalon in their wallet, and to this API we bind external functions that are already planned, such as giving a discount or later account identification without an email address. These are things that a single user encounters every day, that many people use, that are necessary for the average person.If we can introduce this technology in these areas, we can make people better understand the importance of blockchain technology.What is Etalon and What are the Roles of the Etalon Tokens?Etalon is a revolutionary blockchain project that aims to build secure, accessible, and privacy-focused global information sharing systems. The project focuses on developing cutting-edge technologies and ecosystems that can provide modern solutions to the challenges of the 21st century, while keeping user privacy and freedom in mind.The Etalon token (ETAL) is a utility token that plays a crucial role in the Etalon ecosystem. The token is designed to incentivize the use of the Etalon platform and to reward users who hold and use the token. ETAL token holders can enjoy various benefits and discounts when they use the platform’s services.ETALON Token Overview    Token Name: Etalon Coin    Token Symbol: ETAL    Total Supply: 5,000,000    Initial Circulating Supply: 4,750,000What are the utilities of the Etalon Tokens?The ETAL token has several utilities that make it a valuable asset for users.Discounts for users through Etalon’s Provider EcosystemETAL token holders can enjoy discounts ranging from 1% to 100% when they use the services of Etalon’s partners, known as Providers. Providers are businesses that are connected to the Etalon ecosystem and offer discounts to ETAL holders in exchange for exposure to a growing community of users.Participating in Governance of the Etalon EcosystemETAL token holders can participate in the governance of the Etalon ecosystem by voting on proposals and decisions that affect the project’s future. ETAL holders can use their tokens to vote on critical issues, such as upgrades, new features, and community initiatives.Etalon Tokens AllocationThe ETAL tokens are distributed as follows:    10% for the team and advisors    10% for the development fund    5% for the community and partnerships    75% for public saleFor more information about Etalon, please visit:Official website: https://etalon.cash/White paper: https://etalon.cash/assets/pdf/Etalon_Whitepaper_English_230409.pdfTwitter: https://twitter.com/EtalonCashTelegram : https://t.me/EtalonTokenYoutube : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNyp_q-yHmJ0sUTtlJZQ0Jw",
