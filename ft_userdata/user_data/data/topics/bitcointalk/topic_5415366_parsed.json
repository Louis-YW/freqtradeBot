Had you done so then you would know that Cyber.Bet already has quite a bad reputation. It would have taken you 2 seconds to google the words \"cyber.bet\" and \"scam\". The first search result would have yielded bitcointalk and it would have linked to the scam reputation it has built for itself on this forum.I see such topics and things almost everday on the gambling subforum and 99% of it could have been avoided with a simple 5 minute research on the online gambling casino in question. Next time DYOR. I doubt they will give you the money. Best to move on.",

I think you should move this topic on Scam Accusation board since it's more appropriate there, will report this to the mods if you don't know how to move it.",

This happened in May this year. Fortunately, we have documented screenshots before the information disappeared on Aff. the panel of Cyber.betI do not read the TOS of the scam casino and I also do not know if they have or do not have the right not to pay the commission in case someone closes the account, but something I can not understand Is the following: to what I see you have a Review site and this casino has already complained since 2020, so how did you not see that they have already had complaints since 2020? Do you constitute analyze with some frequency each casino listed on your site? Because it seems that you didn't have this problem of not being paid commission, the casino would still be listed on your site and you would consider them as a good casino and meanwhile more people would be stolen by themAnother question that in a way does not have much to do with this problem but I want to take the question:Why do I only saw cloudbet in your casino and there are no other good casinos that are here on the forum?",

So your method Is kind of strange.",

      "body": "What casino are we talking about exactly? The Cyber.Bet announcement thread leads to a non-existing site. This one: https://cyber-bet.net/. But there is also https://cyber.bet/en/. I am not sure if that is a new domain or if they are completely unassociated platforms. Quote from: Krypto-Oddsen on September 29, 2022, 04:04:38 PMAnother issue is that it is an incredible shame that many credible online casino reviewers, without mentioning the names, still market this crypto casino. A little responsibility and benevolence must be shown. Credibility is hard to find if you are getting paid to post reviews. Not just in the crypto casino sphere but in general. There are even worse casinos than Cyber.bet, but they pay loads of money for marketing, and even run signature campaigns on this forum. Review sites post nice things about those who pay them. That's just the way it is. Quote from: Slow death on September 29, 2022, 07:09:25 PMI do not read the TOS of the scam casino and I also do not know if they have or do not have the right not to pay the commission in case someone closes the account... The TOS would indeed be a good place to start. @Krypto-Oddsen did you study them properly to see if they have a rule that allows them to cancel your commission earnings if players are self-blocked?",

Therefore, our number one rule is always applicable: When the casino does not work with its partners, what about its own players?It's hard to trust a review site where the criteria is based on your relationship with the casino as their affiliate rather than the actual player experiences. I think the saddest part about the whole situation is the fact that you have no problem promoting some shady casinos that hardly have any positive reviews and are preying on the naive and inexperienced players that fall for their tout ads and end up losing money, yet you turn your back on them when it comes to your affiliate scheme and your commission. Don't you think that's the epitome of hypocrisy? How unprofessional can you be? While I don't know what the situation is with Cyber.bet, if I recall correctly, you were perfectly happy promoting scam sites like 1XBET, 1xBit, and 888starz, and you only reluctantly removed them in response to community pressure. It seems like you still have the same mentality even now, and you don't really care whether or not the players are cheated or ripped off.",

      "body": "Happy Monday everyone.We think this forum post of ours went completely off track, so we choose to remove the forum, even though our case is not resolved.It becomes too much of an attack, even when our intention was to warn. Because the number one rule is when the admin in the casino doesn't work with their partners, what about players?What do we know about casinos operating unethically, scam, badly etc.? Remember that 9/10 online casinos have some kind of problem with their players. You can't go one by one without including them in your review. Even Bet365, William Hill and other giants have some kind of problem with their players, as you can read on Trustpilot and other sites. Then there will be absolutely no casinos to review. Of course, we do research, but everything depends on the degree of severity that we together in the team assess in each individual case.But we have seen, for example, that 1xbet, 888starz and 1xslots were among the most brutal casinos that had a very bad reputation on this forum and other gambling discussion forums. So we removed them from our review.The fact that we provide *the little extra service* to the player who should have challenges with the casino is a coincidence. When someone contacts us by e-mail, we do not ignore them and try to find a solution by contacting manager at the casino and explaining the situation. It goes without saying about customer service. This is, for example, how Askgamblers and Casino.guru and other big review giants work!?That certain forum users write: *If you had received the commission, you would not have given this warning*We think we have hit the wrong target group in this forum, as we are primarily Norway including Scandinavia and western countries, and choose to leave this forum.Thank you for taking the time to reply.BrAnders Digital Content Producer -  Krypto-Oddsen.com",
