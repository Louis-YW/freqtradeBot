  "content": "I re-started using the Bitcoin core wallet after few years.While I'm learning the new descriptors, and try to figure them out against the old school private keys, sent few coins from one old imported address to a new Bech32m taproot address.The transaction is not even in the mempool, if I try to search it in a block explorer it looks like it doesn't even exist.The address was fully rescan and the wallet is synced to the blockchain, so what is going on?Here the transaction ID: b7007ef7cf8f9cb180231755a5bb7f2fbab122c7abe7d20cd345641718c730c0Thanks",
