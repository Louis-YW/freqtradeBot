Bitcoin can easily reach that price if Million is worth 100$ later on due to inflation. Bitcoin value will continue to increase when fiat decrease since its not value is not based on fiat but on its scarce supply.Bitcoin might reach above that projected price in future because fiat is already suffering huge value especially USD. Probably we might use different currency as global currency standards when shit happened on US economy that is now looming.",

Bitcoin moved from $1,000 to the ATH ($69,00) which amount to a 6,000% increase. If we look at the increase from $30,000 to $1M it will have to increase at percentage of 3,000%. This mathematical looks realistic but there are certain factors that drives the increase of bitcoin like efficiency of mining, government policies, and many more.",

But it took a long time for bitcoin to go through that so I wouldn't be holding on to that thought that it will reach a million plus that would probably be unsustainable to the market because there's going to be a lot of people who owns a lot of bitcoins that will suddenly sell their hoard. One step at a time, 100k is what we should look forward to first before that million dollar dream.",

A lot of decade would it take which is my estimate. There's no guarantee when it will reach but for sure it will take decades.",

If I can predict correctly and with certainty that bitcoin can hit $1 million, I will sell my house and all my possessions and put all my money into bitcoin, and then I will become rich. No one can predict what will happen in the future and bitcoin is no exception, mate. But we are in a bitcoin forum, and most people are invested in bitcoin and have a strong belief in it. So the answer that you will get will definitely be \"yes.\" And I also predict and expect bitcoin to hit 1 million or if it can be higher than that, because the higher the price, the more profit we have.",

Bitcoin is a genius idea with an excellent implementation that is going to shine in the coming years when everything will be validated on blockchains.Due to its scarcity, it will touch $1M one day. Not sure which year or if we will still be alive to see it but it's not something that isn't possible.If someone is telling you they know when it will touch $1M, they are literally joking. Do not take clowns from Social Media seriously.Also, $1m from the current price is a 3500% gain which has been achieved in the past. So in short, yes, it's literally possible for Bitcoin to reach $1M however $180k this bull run is inevitable.Let's see if this post ages well or not in the upcoming future.",

Bitcoin is a great option for people to preserve & grow wealth, history shows that.As time goes on & bitcoin proves itself over & over again more people will flow to it. $1,000,000 per coin is possible this decade.",

Which is why I have to say that it is just matter of time and nothing more. I know that people are doubting at this moment but that doesn't mean that it will not be possible, this is something that will happen eventually so we just have to wait for it to happen. I believe that people are worrying about the future and sometimes it drops and that is why when it drops people starts to feel like they are going to lose all their money and that it makes them sell so when it drops, people fear and sell and it drops even more. Which is why I think that we should be hopeful about the future because if we do not lose our confidence about it then we are going to be feeling fine if we do that.",

This means there is inflation which will keep the bitcoin at a better price, but the same doesn't drive bitcoin towards a new ath or 1m+ in price. Whether the financial situation is good or bad around is not at all an issue, the market of bitcoin is all about the demand to the supply. How this gets varied will reflect on the price of bitcoin.",
