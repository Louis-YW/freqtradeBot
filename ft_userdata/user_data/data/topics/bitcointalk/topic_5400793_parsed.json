  "content": "I just found something that might be of interest to some people here.It's a new NFC card with some kind of microchip inside that holds a private key and a public key in the card itself.QuoteThe embedded chip creates and holds a unique and uncopyable private key within the card itself, making it one of the most secure ways to store crypto. It's the Swiss Key Card: https://swisskey.io/products/btc-swiss-key-cardIn theory they say that you have to use it with their (unpublished yet) app, but I reckon it could be usable as a generic NFC card for lightning payments with LNURL-withdraw for example.",
