  "content": "First of all If I'm posting this in the wrong place I apologize I'm not someone who posts on forums much just read a lot. I did not see any reviews or info on this site anywhere online so I'm making one to let people know my experience and have something to go off of about this site.Â Â  Â  I joined this site off an email I got with a $100 free chip, the bonus had only a 20x wagering requirement and I got lucky and managed to clear it and have Â above the maximum withdrawal amount left when I reached the play through and it went to $100 which was the max withdrawal. I contacted support and asked about what I needed to do to cash out my winnings and they gave me an email to send an ID and ID selfie photo to which is pretty standard. They also said that i only had to do this one time and after that withdrawals would be instant. I sent the docs and i then asked live support how long it takes for approval and they said it would take 3-5 days but it was actually approved it in like 24 hours or less than that if I'm not mistaken which I thought was awesome since this normally does take 3-5 days. Things went downhill from here tho and I went from being very pleased to very annoyed. In the email approving my docs it said that I could now contact there \"award winning\" (they have to be a brand new casino don't know how they would've already won awards) customer support team to finalize any withdrawal request. I had been having some problems with the site being partially in a different language due to my browser and I couldn't find the withdrawal area until this time but i started using chrome instead of safari and found the withdrawal area and requested a Ltc withdrawal of $100. (I didn't notice yet Â but it does clearly say that withdrawals take 48hrs, I did not see that and was going off of support telling me it would be instant in our chat about verification so I'm still expecting a quick withdrawal at this time.) Next I contacted support and let them know my account has been verified now and they said to contact them to finalize my withdrawal request, and they informed me that i had to make a verification deposit of $10 minimum (no prior mention of this anywhere and I didn't see it in the T&C's when I skimmed it but it may be in there), and that if not made in 7 days all winnings would be forfeited, I asked if I would be able to withdraw my verification deposit with my $100 winnings which In my experience at other casinos in this situation u can do and was told \"No you can play with it\". Seems wierd but I made the deposit and then let support know and asked to finalize my withdrawal and this is when they told me it takes 48 hours and i was pretty mad but even tho an agent told me different it was a mistake and there terms and all do clearly state this. I explained that I had been told it would be instant and tried to get them to make an exception or at least explain why they took this long as crypto transfers are fast and they were unhelpful and just kept stating the terms, one person told me that it was a higher management decision that all withdrawals must waIt 48hrs. This is in hopes u cancel the withdrawal before the 48hrs Â and lose your money which is a common method used by online casinos usually the more shady ones as it's a dirty trick IMO. However since I won on a free chip It has a maximum withdrawal amount that I've reached so in my case there's no incentive for me to cancel since i couldn't win anymore. So I wait the 48 hours, support said the would start processing my withdrawal soon as the 48 was up and i check it and nothings changed the status is still the same as it was when I requested it and support is unhelpful as usual and now tells me that withdrawals are automated and there's nothing they can do, previously the banking department that verified my ID told me I could contact support to finalize my withdrawal and another support agent told me they would process my request as soon as the 48hours had past, indicating that there withdrawals are not automatic.Â Â  Â It's been a few hours since the 48hr window has passed,So I'm expecting this to be a scam and they never payout, however I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt with this review and being entirely truthful and transparent and not claiming they are scamming me as of now and will be updating this daily or as anything changes with my withdrawal request. If they do payout, I would still not recommend playing here due to slow withdrawals and poor quality unhelpful service agents, unless they improve on that there are just so many way better casino options.UPDATE: after I sent them screenshots of this post and told them I would be posting more reviews and a screenshot of google search for bonusblitz.com reviews with the first result being this negative review and also filing a dispute with CDS an independent customer dispute and mediation service that they have listed on there page and continuously messaging support and the banking email address I have asking for answers they finally paid my withdrawal however I did still have to make the $10 \"verification\" deposit that I was not allowed to withdraw back with the $100 I won, so really I won $90 from a free chip and having to make that deposit you can't withdraw is not in there terms and conditions that would be a required deposit that must be wagered before withdrawal not verification deposit. Nothing about a deposit is in the T&C's period that I remember seeing. I'm quite confident that had I not been a pest to them that my withdrawal would not have been paid for several more days if at all as they did not even change the status of the withdrawal for about 60 hours then suddenly paid when I engaged extreme bitching mode ðŸ˜‚ lol. Â  Â  Â  BOTTOM LINE: Casino did pay out in the end on a free chip win so i commend them for that fact but I shouldn't have had to force there hand so to speak there terms states they can hold a withdrawal for up to 48 hours and they well exceeded that, I will note they did verify my documents very fast compared to other casinos. I wouldn't recommend playing here but if you deposit here and withdraw you will likely be paid but prepared to wait for a few days for a crypto transfer that can be done in minutes, and be prepared for worthless support from there \"award winning\" support team. I would reccomend playing there free chip like I did but for deposits you'll be much happier with sites like bcgame stake duckdice etc.",

      "body": "So sorry about your experience OP. I checked and I do not think this casino is recognized here not to talk of being registered here also. It is always advised to do a proper research on casinos to know more about what people are saying about them. Checking reviews about them would give a better hint of their stand in the gambling industry but it is unfortunate you did not do all these things before getting involved with them. Â I think this casino is one of those random scam casino out there looking for who to scam of their hard earned resources. They just succeeded in stealing your details through kyc without you getting any results if your request for withdrawal.Lastly, you should try upload your proof of having a deal with them ie maybe your dashboard balance, chats Â message you had with their customer service so that Â people reading would know if truly such a thing happened because without a proof nobody would take this post of yours serious and convincing. They would assume you are one of those out there paid to tarnish the reputation of casinos. So if you want to pass across information to the people here, I think you just need to do as I have advised so that members would take note of this casino in other not to fall victim of their tricks.Nevertheless, you did good by revealing this to the platform to know about the activities of this casino.",

I made research on the site https://bonusblitz.com/ and what I saw is not trustworthy. A legit casino will not ask customers to register before anything. Nothing is on the first page of site except the sign up page. Legit casino company allow people to see their designs on the first page to attract gamblers before even registration. These are the kind of casinos that doesn't allow people (gamblers) to withdraw their money at the end of the games. All these proceedures listed by the op is not necessary to withdraw fund from a reputable company. Op not all the attractive bonuses are good but some are are good and not all. So be careful with your dealings.",

Casino's, especially new casinos, cannot give $100 to everyone for signing up and not have terms that need followed. They'd be bankrupt in week 1. Bottom line, you got lucky to complete the terms of the deal. Then you had to jump through some hoops but got free money. Overall i'd say do a better job dealing with it. Otherwise deposit to a reputable casino and skip the hoop jumping.",

You are better off looking for casinos on this forum instead of still looking for casinos from out there or from review sites from other people. Or you can read reviews from @efialtis and @gamblingbro, who have experience finding casino sites that we can not trust.This is a lesson for all of us. Not all casinos that provide large bonuses will allow us to withdraw the winning money we get without complying with the terms and conditions of the casino. And we also have to be careful not to deposit an amount we can't afford just because of the big bonus. There are still many casinos that can give us satisfaction instead of choosing a casino like that.",

What if the withdrawal was not successful? I can't take this risk though because of the experience I had with a local casino that gave me a bonus. After I wagered all the bonus and won some bets, I was asked to deposit before I could withdraw, and immediately my deposit dropped, meaning all my bonus and winnings were gone, leaving just the deposit.Â So at some point, if not that you decided never to give up even with their unhelpful response from the support, you would not have gotten the withdrawal at the time you got it.",
