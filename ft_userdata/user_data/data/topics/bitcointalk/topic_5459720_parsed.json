  "content": "Cypherock X1 is a new kind of hardware wallet that never stores the master seed as a whole anywhere permanently eliminating most of the attack vectors associated with the current hardware wallets. Cypherock comes with 5 hardware components - 1 X1 Vault and 4 X1 Cards. The X1 Vault is the main computational device used to perform transaction signing and verification. It comes with a screen, 5-way joystick and connects through USB-C. The X1 Cards are Smartcards and communicate with the X1 Vault through encrypted NFC. Each of the 5 components store the 5 Shamir Shares individually. In order to construct back the master seed, you need the X1 Vault and any one of the X1 Card along with the PIN if set (2-of-5 Shamir's Secret Sharing).https://imgur.com/a/HnYMQ7XProduct FeaturesIt is BIP39 compliant wallet. Unlike other wallets, there is no need for the user to write the 24 recovery words or the seed phrase anywhere. Although there is still an option on the device to view the seed phrase through the device + card + PIN (if set)No Single Point of Failure in private key storage as the private keys are never stored permanently in a single place giving it 10x more security than other hardware wallets.Most of the hardware wallets today only allow the user to store one seed phrase per hardware. Cypherock X1 allows the user to store upto 4 different wallet seed phrases on a single Cypherock X1. Generate new wallets or use any of these 4 slots to backup your existing hardware and software wallets, thereby using the Cypherock X1 also as a seed phrase backup manager. You can protect each with a different PIN for each seed phrase. I have discussed about this use-case on this thread - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5457147.0.It is going to support a non-KYC inheritance service that will allow your assets to be recoverable by your loved ones without Cypherock ever in a position to compromise user's assets. More on this soon!There is inherent protection against loss. As along as you have access to 2 out of the 5 components (either 2 X1 Cards, or 1 X1 Card and the X1 Vault), your assets are accessible. You can lose upto 3 components at the same time and still be sure that your assets are recoverable.It is the most trust minimal wallet compared to the rest of the options today. Unlike the other popular wallets where the user needs to trust the manufacturer that they will not push a malicious software update. With Cypherock X1, there is an additional protection against this problem since the X1 Cards once shipped cannot be updated by us. Hence even if there is a malicious software update hypothetically, it could only compromise the device but never the cards.Security1. It is open-source - https://github.com/cypherock.2. It is audited by Keylabs that have found vulnerabilities in Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets before - https://cypherock.com/keylabs.3. X1 Cards have EAL 6+ certified secure elements. You can set a PIN protection on top of them individually.4. X1 Vault have a dual chip architecture and uses ATECC608A secure element, the same secure chip used by Coldcard.5. It is one of the few hardware wallets with a reproducible builds as verified by WalletScrutiny - https://walletscrutiny.com/hardware/cypherockx1.Website - https://cypherock.comThis is in continuation to the thread - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5429275.0. The OP of the thread has left the company.Thanks @dkbit98 for supporting this.",

This is one of the biggest disadvantages of SSS over multi-sig, which (when used properly) truly has no single point of failure.It means no single point of failure in private key storage. The only point of failure comes when the user is actually transacting with the X1 Vault and the card. Even in that case, the private key only exists in the temporary memory during transaction signing and the private key as a whole never touches the permanent storage. Also in most multisig wallet cases, if a single user is operating it, whether we like it or not, the user is using 2 wallets at the same time at the same place which defeats the purpose of multisig. And again, we are trying to build the best possible wallet for securing a single seed. You are free to use Cypherock X1 as part of a multisig wallet setup as well. Rather than comparing us with multisig wallets, a fair comparison is actually other hardware wallets.QuoteHow?

Bear in mind I am an average user who is unable to manually extract data from NFC cards, unable to clone and compile github repos, and so on. How do I recover my coins?We are building an open source Android and IOS apps that will do this. Here is a sample prototype for the same. Regardless, if you have the X1 Vault, you can always view the seed phrase with the help of another card. Also, we have answered this question on our FAQ page - https://cypherock.com/faqQuoteYou or an attacker doesn't need to be able to compromise the cards. I have to use the device to recreate my seed phrase in order to sign transactions. Compromising the device is sufficient to compromise my wallets.Never did we say that this was enough. Compromising the device to steal the assets is not enough since the user will still need to use the cards along with the device atleast once. The PIN protection on the card is separately enforced on the card itself and the card have end-to-end encrypted session-based communication with the device. Which means, it also authenticates the device during communication.By no means this is perfect but we think it adds a barrier against an insider attack. Additionally, we are open source and the firmware builds have been verified by Wallet Scrutiny - https://walletscrutiny.com/hardware/cypherockx1/",

You can lose upto 3 hardware components and still be fine since you can recover the assets from device + card or 2 cards. So no, you don't lose your coins if you lose 2 cards. Answering along the similar lines as I answered before, the only point of failure comes when you are actually transacting with the X1 Vault and the card.

Not sure what the concerns are then. Also, I personally don't get the point of rallying against wireless connectivity. A hardware wallet is built keeping a threat model in mind. Atleast for Cypherock X1, we assume your PC and its communication medium with the wallet both are compromised and still the hacker should not be able to compromise the assets until you physically authorize a particular transaction. QuoteCan I extract wallet seed from the X1 Vault?No. The wallet seed is never permanently stored on the X1 Vault.QuoteDoes this mean that it is similar to Ledger Recovery but is non-KYC?

Our implementation is open source and we hope it gets adopted and standardized further. When we started building Cypherock X1, we looked into Trezor's implementation of Shamir backups but concluded that any implementation that is going to scale, needs to be BIP39 compatible to be adopted. Hence we had to develop our own implementation.Though I don't think the lack of standardization is going to result in single point of failure. The code is always open source and BIP39 compatibility makes your seed interoperable with other wallets.Regardless, you can always pair it with Multisig to standardize your key custody if that helps.",

Updated the original post with the correct statement.QuoteA multi-sig option at least has the option to use the wallets at different times in different places. SSS does not.I agree. Though in our product, we can make some changes to enable sharing of the Shamir shares remotely from different places securely which solves the different places problem. Though it does not solve the different times problem, you can always couple the product with a multisig setup if you want that for yourself. Additionally, since with Cypherock X1 you don't need to maintain a seed phrase backup separately, it makes it easier for new users to create their multisig setups.QuoteA noble cause, but you should at least be honest in your marketing and not make factually incorrect statements to appeal to users who don't know any better.I don't think I made any factually incorrect statement apart from the nuanced take on the single point of failure.

Hence, a single point of failure.As clarified above, the single point of failure is in the context of seed storage. If the hacker attacks any other hardware wallet physically, your assets could be compromised. But not with Cypherock X1, since the hacker will also need to physically find another card, compromise its security and only then he may be able to access the complete seed to compromise the assets.Even in your example, the card authenticates whether it is communicating with a genuine device. If you have not already, I would recommend you to read the audit report to understand the security threat model of Cypherock X1 - https://cypherock.com/keylabsQuoteThe lack of standardization is a real problem with all SSS schemes. If your codebase disappears, there is a real risk users are unable to recover their coins. To be safe the user needs to personally download and store copies of your codebase, which is a significant hurdle for most average users. As I said even if the codebase disappears, you can always view the BIP39 seed phrase and back it up separately if you think this is a risk for you on a personal level. You can argue the same risk for any other open source hardware wallet.",
