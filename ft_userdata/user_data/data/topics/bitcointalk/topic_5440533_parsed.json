  "content": "Hello everyone,We have recently noticed a persistent and ongoing attempt to distort our announcement here . We would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to a few crucial points.Quote from the announcement: \"we have decided to stop participating in any topic on this Scam Accusations board going forward.\"As clearly stated above, the decision solely concerns the Scam Accusations board. We arrived at this decision due to the behaviors of certain individuals who appear to be particularly obsessed with us and are frequently active on that board. With that being said, we are still actively monitoring issues posted on other boards of this forum.In fact, there was an issue we recently noticed on the Gambling board and had discussed with our CS team. Over the weekend we were unable to reply to the post. When we were about to reply to it today, we found that it had been moved to the Scam Accusations board. This means that we can no longer provide a reply, which we feel sorry to see.Best regards,TrustDice Team",
