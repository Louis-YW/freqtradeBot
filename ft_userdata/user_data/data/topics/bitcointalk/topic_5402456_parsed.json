  "content": "In partnership with NuID, The Kii Foundation is launching Kii, the identity utility token at the root of the Nu Identity Ecosystem and identity-optimized KiiChain. Kii purchasers will get access to the ecosystem, where individuals own and control their online identity without trusting services with their private information.Kii will be used to pay the cost of credential registration on a public blockchain & pay for use of NulD's existing trustless authentication solution: the first of many services in the Nu Identity Ecosystem. Future identity use cases within the Nu Identity Ecosystem include but are not limited to: KYC and identity verification, certificate and credential issuance, digitized assets, education credentials, decentralized data storage, and peer-to-peer identity services.The public sale of Kii token will take place later this month on LATOKEN ($0.30 public sale price). Pre-sale is available now for $0.15.Kii will be issued as an ERC20 token, but will migrate to the identity-optimized KiiChain in the near future. US residents and those in other Excluded Jurisdictions are excluded from participating.White Paper: https://docsend.com/view/mngdpbq3y8gncw7kHow to Purchase & IEO Details: https://kiichain.org One Pager: https://docsend.com/view/fyk6q72umzugj6vqNuID: https://nuid.io/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/_NuID Kii Foundation Telegram: https://t.me/+qgQofhNKdMgxNzQ5 NuID Telegram: https://t.me/+o4ZS8SwBlbk5OTUx",
