  "content": "As a Blockchain Wizard, I'm convinced: Bitcoin is magic internet money. Bitcoin might be not really money – but it's internet money. And it's not just internet money, it's magic internet money. We can attribute a lot of characteristics to Bitcoin but we really need to realize at some point, how magical Bitcoin is as an internet money. Bitcoin has a magical history, where it’s even unknown, who developed it. It's already very magical because probably, we will never know, who Satoshi Nakamoto really is. But for sure, he was a really good coder, who inventecd Bitcoin. And Bitcoin doesn't really exist, it's just code and we can \"see\" it in our wallet, we can't touch it like real cash, because it's only 0 or 1 (or hashs). But still, we can own it, when we own our private key, where we can access it in Bitcoin's Blockchain, what's really magical and we can even send it to someone else in a completely different country to a different address, what’s even more magical. A Blockchain is a very magical invention because such a product is still very new and unknown for many people. Bitcoin is magic internet money because it can't be faked as well and Bitcoin follows defined rules. For example, Bitcoin's limited supply of 21 millions of BTC and how all Bitcoins are mined during several cycles until 2140, still more than 100 years away, when all Bitcoins will be mined. So, Bitcoin is not only magic internet money, it’s also scarce internet money. What's even better: everyone can join us.",

Compared to cash, Bitcoin is very unreal, we can't see it, because it is not an object, like cash. Cash is accepted everywhere while Bitcoin is only a very small internet placeBitcoin has much space to grow because it is still early for Bitcoin. For example, Amazon still hasn't accepted Bitcoin. Bitcoin IS magic internet money. Bitcoin is like dark universe existence objects. But being digital has also many disadvantages, like hacks, where we can hear from every day. Or if we send it to a wrong address or we have lost our private key. Cash is more easey. But your comparison is a very good comparison, of courseQuote from: robelneo on October 29, 2023, 03:42:22 PM            It is a great way to describe Bitcoin. Many adjectives are suited.",

Well, that's indeed a little magical. Of all the desirable traits of a hard and sound money, no single fiat currency has met them. Bitcoin came and offered durability, divisibility, scarcity, transparency, fungibility, being a store of value, and other characteristics of an ideal money. That seems magical as well.

Well, when will banks be happy, when the Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates so that Depository Institutions have to keep reserves in the form of cash or deposits in Federal Reserve Banks, but Ironically, Bitcoin has the unique ability to eliminate this need and until now it may not have existed a central entity that controls Bitcoin, including monetary policy and interest rates.This is another reason why many people see Bitcoin as an alternative and also a payment system, a global payment system so the need for banks will be reduced but despite this, banks also have another role in the global financial system.",

But it depends on each country.But we should not use the word magic for Bitcoin because we are afraid that people will think that by having Bitcoin, they can get rich quickly in an instant. But if people buy Bitcoin and keep it for a few years, they can make a profit from investing in Bitcoin.But unfortunately, until now, there are still many people who don't know much about Bitcoin and don't want to start investing in Bitcoin.

I read a little about the long history before bitcoin was born and discovered a new conception of a decentralized financial system as the antithesis of centralized fiat money.Bitcoin initially had a cheap price and over time it became more expensive. It didn't just happen, many things happened to bitcoin, many rejections and bans on bitcoin, all of these were obstacles that bitcoin faced until bitcoin finally became as popular as it is now. Bitcoin is both a currency and an asset, it is loved for the concept of freedom it brings. We can own bitcoins individually and no one can freeze our bitcoins as long as we keep them in our own wallets, not on an exchange.Bitcoin is a breakthrough, an idea, and freedom. Bitcoin was born with hard work and challenges, so Bitcoin runs normally and there is no magic except the great concept that exists in Bitcoin",

What interest me the most is the trust and belief people have for such a digital money that you cant feel or touch, its really amazing. Although the feeling that Bitcoin is magical gives the belief that it will always going to make people rich which is not true at all times. Bitcoin can get as high and as well as very low. What should be considered is the fact that, when the knowledge of it is applied either by investing and the idea of holding it for some decade can give hope of a better future if you do not sell when the price gives you a little profit or panic sell when the price drops because it is volatile.",
