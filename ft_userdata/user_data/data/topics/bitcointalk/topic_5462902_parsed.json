  "content": "To complete the final belt that was vacated by Inoue.It will be Emmanuel Rodriguez- vs Melvin Lopez for the IBF belt. So they are the number 2 and number 3 contender. Unfortunately, I thought that Filipino Reymart Gaballo was in the mix as well, but he was rank number 4 in the rankings.Hopefully though, whoever wins this fight, will give a crack at Gaballo first before going in another unification fight with other champion.Lopez is almost 6:1 underdog is this fight.https://www.premierboxingchampions.com/emmanuel-rodriguez-vs-melvin-lopez",

And most likely he has the experience that's why the odds is on his favor against a relatively unknown Lopez in bantamweight.",

If he can win this fight, perhaps if Donaire does not retire, we might see another Donaire fight as the challenger. Rodriguez is a skilled boxer; unfortunately, he doesn't possess the power of a strong boxer, so that's the weakness I see in him. However, against Lopez, I think it will be an easy fight for him.QuoteLopez is almost 6:1 underdog is this fight.Bookies knows the real chance.",

Inoue is an exception; he lost to the beast. Therefore, I still believe that Rodriguez can reclaim his championship, especially now that Inoue has moved up in weight.Additionally, there's a reason why Lopez is the heavy underdog, even though he has more wins than Rodriguez. Furthermore, Lopez is not a significant threat, with a low KO rate of only 19 out of 29 fights. This suggests that the more technical boxer will likely win here.",

It's better if they will put Reymart Gaballo, a former champion himself and also coming from a win. And it just shows how this body is ranking their players and it's obvious there is somewhere wrong and could be that there is corruption as we have said in the major governing bodies of boxing. Nevertheless for Gaballo to be in the mix again, he has proven himself after winning in the Philippines if I'm not mistaken. So he has the right to wait for the winning of this fight and then challenge the champion.",

It's possible that some boxers have moved up in weight to avoid facing Inoue, leaving those who aren't as popular or exciting to watch. In my opinion, the current champions in this division are not even close to Inoue or Casimero in terms of skills. I understand why some might feel frustrated that an unknown boxer has been given a chance at a championship fight.",

Lopez though his records is very weird, and it a sense we can call his previous opponents as taxi cab drivers. And mostly you fight those kind of boxers to pad your records and this is what happen to Lopez. But IBF recognizes his winning streak more than former champion Reymart Gaballo that's why he was above in the rankings. And that's why he is a huge underdog here and most likely we will see Rodriguez vs Gaballo next.",

With that win, he regain the belt that he has lost to Inoue several years back in the WBSS tournament. So it's time for him to fight Gaballo next and defeat him in the rematch. If we will remember, Reymart won a controversial SD win against Rodriguez to win the interim WBC belt then he lost to then Nonito Donaire for all Filipino showdown. Let's hope a showdown with Gaballo is next for Rodriguez.",
