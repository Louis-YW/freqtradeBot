I noticed that you locked your thread while I was about to copy the link to where you can purchase copper membership.Before I forget, welcome to Bitcointalk. I was trying to create an account in your site when I noticed the “promo code” section and I thought maybe you could create one for bitcointalkers, so that those that are going to your site through your Ann thread here in Bitcointalk can get some bonuses, it will also increase the number of people that will register through this forum. It’s just a suggestion tho.",

      "body": "Welcome to the forum guys. It’s good to see you guys already have developed various instruments for your casino. You have tailored Website, mobile site, android and iOS mobile app too!! That itself shows lot of work up in the background. It seems your jurisdiction is curacao and I am wondering most of the casinos are actually from that region itself. Not sure why is that so but it seems they are very crypto friendly and gambling friendly. Good for us as we get to see new casino all the time. The last casino that I welcomed had ABC bonus but after looking at your bonus of 150% plus free spins I am getting attracted to yours more now. Good strategy. However, trust building is the one process that is priority always. Hope so you make one of the best in the list on this forum soon. :-)",

Thank you, we were working on that and now we have done just that. welcome to the forum, you have just found a large community of crypto gambling enthusiasts. i understand you are a licensed casino already. but one thing that crypto gamblers may be hesitant is your kyc policy. a lot of reputable casinos found here have their kyc requirements as well. however, if you are just a small time player, they don't strictly require to undergo such requirement.may i ask if you are strictly implementing kyc protocol even if the player is strictly using cryptocurrencies only?",

Prohibited Uses6.1. Jurisdictions. Users located in or residents of Curacao, Aruba, Costa Rica, Bonaire, France, Saba, Netherlands, Statia, USA, and St Martin (the ”Prohibited Jurisdictions”) are not allowed to use the Service. To avoid doubt, current restrictions on playing for real money from Prohibited Jurisdictions refer equally to citizens and residents of other countries while located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction. Any try to bypass the restrictions on play by any users located in a Restricted Jurisdiction, or Prohibited Jurisdiction is considered a breach of this Agreement. A try at bypassing includes, but is not limited to, providing richy.casino with wrong or misleading data concerning your place of residence or location and manipulating the information used by richy.casino to verify your location.Source: https://richy.casino/uk/terms_of_serviceThen it does mean that using up VPN is a no go but if you are really that pushy then its up to your choice but dont get yourself caught.",

Also, what's the reason for blacklisting certain countries if you allow people from these countries as long as they use VPN? Wouldn't it be easier for you not to restrict them at all?You could add a list of countries that are allowed in, because I'm not allowed (UK) and I could try it out with VPN, but I'd have to choose a country first. Making a list of restricted countries would make things easier for people who want to visit your site.",

Unlike the most common case I experienced where I cant access the casinos because my ISP blocks them, but richy casino is different since I believe they are the one that blocks the IP from my country. I do not use VPN as well since months ago, so I think the only thing I can say here is good luck to richy casino.",
