Obviously if you refer to the rules, trading like this is prohibited because someone will not bother buying weapons through bitcointalk if the use of weapons in their country is legal. This implies that, either the buyer or the seller or both are in a restricted area for the unauthorized use of weapons, so I guess transactions like this are prohibited on forum.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on October 09, 2022, 01:38:08 PMAfter all, gun ownership is banned or require permit on most country.Of course.
