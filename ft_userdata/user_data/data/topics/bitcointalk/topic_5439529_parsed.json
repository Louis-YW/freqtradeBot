Telegram accounts can be deleted and more important thing is that telegram messages can be deleted. So, o one should rely on telegram discussion. Also at the same time, there are a lot of users who appear in the guise of others.",

I took a look at it, it was a text wall a bout 23 Bitcoins being \"blocked\" or something, I did not read it entirely.I'd recommend to lock this thread, since serves no purpose.",

But there he claims that he saved all the records, although he did not present anything, I do not know if there will be a denouement of this story, maybe he is gathering his thoughts, if not, then the OP should block the thread.",

I have never seen any redacted posts. So I don't know why OP has deleted this post. OP must not conceal information by deleting the thread. It might create a harmful impact on other users.",
