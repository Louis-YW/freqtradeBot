The other reason is if you broadcast a fake transaction it will be dropped or maybe except you have your own node or something like that and it is added through the back door.

So even if you send a transaction like 0.00001 containing even the fee and the mempool gets way less congested theoretically, it can be spend. The only way to get it dropped is by double spending with a higher fee or the it so dropped after 14 days due to low transaction fee",

You cannot compromise an entire network and even if you run your own node, you can't possibly convince another node to think that it is valid.Quote from: homosapienstrader on July 18, 2023, 04:21:34 PMIs it possible create a fake transaction from a BTC address to another without paying any fee and also without this transaction gets ever confirmed?I will explain the point.for exemple I have a BTC wallet with 0.00001 BTC and I just want to send 0.00001 to another wallet in order to this wallet just see the incoming transfer but I want it to get rejected by blockchain, like a fake node input on blockchain, is it possible?No and no. If you were to pay zero fees, you would probably violate the minimum relay fee requirement of Bitcoin nodes and that would mean that your transaction wouldn't be accepted and relayed by other nodes. If your transaction gets relayed by nodes around the network, then there is a chance that it would get confirmed. A transaction that can't be confirmed would probably not be relayed by other nodes.There is no such thing as a \"fake node input\".",

If you attempt to broadcast a transaction with zero fee or a fee below the dynamic lower limit set by individual node's mempool settings, then nodes will simply not relay that transaction. Repeatedly try to do this, and nodes will simply blacklist your IP and ignore you.Quote from: DaveF on July 19, 2023, 11:21:18 AMYou can send with a 1 sat / vb fee which will probably never get confirmed at this point.You can't really, at the moment. Given that the vast majority of nodes run with default settings, anything below around 2.9 sats/vbyte at the moment will simply not be relayed, let alone confirmed. You could of course manually connect to a specific node which has increased its mempool limits, but then your transaction will just sit in the mempool of that one node and not go anywhere, which obviously achieves very little.",

      "body": "There's a big difference between the implementation of limits in the node software and the actual consensus rules.If you'd change the constants defining the dust limit and minimum fee in bitcoin core's sourcecode (iirc, they're defined in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/policy/policy.h) and compile the sourcecode, then get enough people to run your node's \"implementation\", you'd be able to create a 0 fee transaction with a 1 sat input and a 1 sat output and relay it to anybody running the binary you compiled without breaking any consensus rules (if i'm not mistaking). This is not a fake tx tough, it's just a transaction spending one unspent output with a value of 1 sat and creating an output with a value of one sat... At least, if you can find a one sat unspent output to spend (it won't be easy and it'll probably require running a patched wallet and maybe even the need to pay of a mining pool). Needless to say, the odds of such a transaction ending up in a block are very (very) close to 0.The \"problem\" is that most people won't run your binary, they'll run the default binary which has a default value for the dust limit and minimum transaction fee... This means that anybody not running your binary will simply reject the transaction, eventough it's not breaking any consensus rules. They won't put the tx in their mempool due to the fact they no longer relay 0 fee transactions and they reject transactions with an output under the dust limit. So, you cannot use this method to scam anybody without putting in more effort than it's worth.",

I just did a check since I am taking one of my LN nodes offline. I saw the tx in my wallet. I then did a RBF to get it confirmed.Probably would have dropped / disappeared within minutes.Either way it's still the same point. Sending with 3 sat / vb will show up and probably never get confirmed.Or, you could also send with a low fee and then send another TX out from there with a low fee and then RBF the parent TX.No matter what it's still sketchy for the OP to ask.-Dave",

While the chances are slim, they are non-zero and there are tons of factor at play here; extent of transaction propagation, amount of fee increment (if it violates minimum increase in feesor not), mining pool policy, etc. I don't think there are any implementations of software which wouldn't recognize opt-in RBF given that it has been introduced for years now.",

It's true that Sportsbet instantly credits your account long before the transaction gets confirmed, but you can't scam them. If you bet and win, you will never get your money until the original transaction gets confirmed. If you cancelled it, it's obvious that it never will. You are kind of scamming the bookie because you lost and they didn't receive the money (you played for free), but they didn't lose anything.
