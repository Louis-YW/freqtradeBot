  "content": "Hi,I'm trying to tap into the wisdom of more experienced miners.Mining with a small device - a USB-stick or a Pod-Miner - the payouts over time are very small, and it may take an eternity to reach the threshold for the payout.So I'd like to \"pool\" some micro-miners:All rewards go to one address. Once or twice a year, the rewards are being paid out and then sent to the participants of the micro-mining via the Lightning network.However, this would require that I can get from the pool detailed statistics for every single miner to see, for example, how many shares were submitted.Does anybody know of a pool which would supply this data?",

Currently working on a solar-powerd e-bike charger which is mining once the bike is charged. So in my area alone, there are several hundreds e-bikes. If hundreds would use the device and mine toward one pool, I think it could make a difference  Big \"if\", though ....",

But the odds really are that you will never find a block and never get any payouts. So although good as a project it's never going to get you any money.-Dave",

So although good as a project it's never going to get you any money.-DaveI agree that PPLNS most probably would be a waste of time and energy Braiins wouldn't be too bad, however, I haven't figured out how to get detailed information about individual miner's activities. One solution would be to produce logs for cgminer and send them to me all couple of months, but this seems to be too much work unless I invest a lot of time for writing an analyzer tool.Solo pool is not an option. If someone has one of the solar minerchargers, he should get an incentive. A lottery ticket is imho not the right way to go...Never worked with Luxor pool before, testing it out and they have a nice API.At the end of the day: Yes, there will be some Sats per user. But the idea is that a minercharger can further help to decentralise. Using a gekko-pod, for example, produces about 1.7 Th/s, which is some cents per day. And more people will get into Bitcoin - which would be the nicest side-effect ever.Just an example: My tractor's alternator broke down. Instead of trying to organize a new one, I charge the battery now through a solar panel which I use as a roof. Once the battery is charged, the \"tractor\" starts mining. In a typical summer, this produces about 100'000 Sats.  Not a lot, I know. But it is like an alternative form of staking sats",
