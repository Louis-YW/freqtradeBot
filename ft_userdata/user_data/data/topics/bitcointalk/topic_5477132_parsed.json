Looks like they've got some good tech going where they are aiming at really decentralizing mining unlike the current scenario in which we've seen miners can get compromised into censoring transactions. OCEAN is an effort by Jack Dorsey (CEO of Twitter) and has the likes of Luke Dash-Jr collaborating with the project. If anyone has any news about this please let me know if there is going to be some sort of an IPO or something.",

But  it's very early days for OCEAN and they are still growing. Things do look very hopeful but I doubt they'd even be considering the possibilities of going public at the moment. Although anyone can ask the pool's team directly on their IRC. Having a public pool as a listed company would certainly be interesting.But for now the best way to earn from OCEAN is to mine there",

Be sure to make a lot of popcorn for the read...Big pools imposing block lists that government decided upon based on arbitrary criteria without asking their miners is deeply unethical. Miners CHOOSING to opt out of accepting transactions that utilize a bug in Bitcoin to upload trash data in bitcoins Blockchain for cheap is not comparable. This is actually quite dangerous as a false equivalency. Miners are free to chose what transactions they confirm and oftentimes have put profit over actual bitcoin's wellbeing. I can't see why some people buy into propaganda. Big mining pools would rather leave the status quo as is and keep profiting off this bug. And you are here taking their side against the good Samaritan's that are actually not after unethical profits and just want to improve Bitcoin.",

      "body": "You call it a 'bug'. Why?Ever since BTC genesis block, data that is NOT a tx has been allowed. Satoshi himself did it several times. Ref https://medium.com/kaleidoscope-xcp/the-early-evolution-of-art-on-the-blockchain-part-1-d52d1454e34b  The only difference these days is that for some unfathomable reasons there are now folks willing to pay huge fees to put their 'art' into the blockchain.As an active miner since Feb 2014 I am fine with ordinals. Being a miner and with blocks now often having fees that are very often over 1BTC sometimes 2-3BTC it is a profitability godsend. Come the 1/2ing next year they will almost be required to be profitable.Do remember that if a miner chooses to use their own (censored) block template they are in essence solo mining as no one else is working on that exact same template. Only difference is that: a. Ocean will still split the reward with others in their pool and, b. I get the feeling that any miner using Ocean will NOT have the choice of censoring the tx's presented to them by the Ocean servers as ordinal tx's are already stripped from the work sent to them.Personally I choose to mine at a pool that does not EVER censor tx's - namely, Kano's pool",

Is it a viable investment strategy to bank on something that's likely to be removed from the next update bircoin's software will receive? Probably not. Investors already consider Bitcoin volatile, but to bank on an unintended feature based on exploits is too much for any type of investor that would care of a public company.",

Very, very unlikely, there is a huge difference between censoring and banning something on protocol level, an example of something you can't do on the blockchain is spend bitcoin you don't own, or construct and add a block that does not meet diff target, or mine a block that is 100mb large, doing anything of that would be rejected by the protocol and would/could result in a fork.As far as ordis go, IF the upgrade does not lead to something that makes including them result in the same things mentioned above -- not going to work.Luke's proposed update is just a boolean that you set to true or false to \"filter\" Ordis, I bet you most pools won't opt-in, most other nodes just won't care, a few might do, because blocks that contain them will still be valid.",

      "body": "Luke's proposed update isn't that much related to inscriptions utilizing an exploit to get unlimited data into transactions. Luke has patched Knots Bitcoin client to include further filtering, but core is likely to be patching the unlimited data exploit though OP codes independently of that. It's important to make a distinction between the two but also important to understand that neither is an outright ban. We are not talking about a hard or soft fork here. Changing these parameters is merely a recommendation. A miner with a forked client could mine whatever they want in terms of data size included in their transactions. Although they'd surely need some peers accepting this in order to have their newly mined block propagated and validated by others too.",
