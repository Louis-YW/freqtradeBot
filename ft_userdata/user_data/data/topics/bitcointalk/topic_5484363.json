      "body": "That's very good because you are already interested in investing in Bitcoin, maybe this is your best decision this year. But first I want to say that investing in Bitcoin has potential, but it also has the risk that at any time the price of Bitcoin could decline, if you can't afford this risk, you should postpone investing in Bitcoin until you can accept the risk. However, if you are ready for this risk, you can invest your money and start your journey in Bitcoin investment.And talking about your savings, I suggest that you don't need to invest your savings in Bitcoin, because after all you need cash if you experience difficulties. Only invest cold hard cash in Bitcoin, whether you allocate some of your salary or other money. Hopefully my advice can help you.",

Now having interest to invest in this bitcoin I want to invest here. Should I invest my savings in Bitcoin? Maybe it's a good decision for you that you already know about bitcoin investment and are interested in investing in bitcoin. Since you said that you are a part time teacher in a private college you deposit the amount you get from there at the end of the month and with that money you want to invest Bitcoin. Yes you can invest if you want but you will invest bitcoins in such a way that you don't have to sell the investment if you need money while investing.You might want to invest in Bitcoin with a small amount of money which is the DCA method. This way you can invest bitcoins at your convenience and deposit any amount of bitcoins whenever you want. But you have heard from said friends that they have profited by investing in Bitcoin. Yes if you invest big amount in bitcoin then maybe you can get more profit in few months but If you start investing in Bitcoin with a small amount of money, you have to make this investment for a long time otherwise you cannot expect your desired profit. No one can expect good profit if Bitcoin investment is not done patiently for a long time.",

Bitcoin is not a quick rich platform as many think that once you invest be on Bitcoin you become rich overnight, Bitcoin can make you rich no doubt about it ,but you need be patient with your investment in the platform because quick withdraw after investment can't make you that rich. Secondly you really need something that can sustain your daily financial need when investing on Bitcoin to avoid the attraction of quick withdrawal. Don't make any decisions that will affect your living because it will make you not to hold the investment, using your life savings is not quite advice, the best is to divide the savings and put some in bitcoin why the other one should be in a business you will see daily income to enable handle basic need inorder to avoid selling your Bitcoin at the wrong time .",

Don't know whether you are new to investing in bitcoin or not, but anyone who wants to get involved in investing is the right choice because you know that bitcoin is one of our biggest dreams to buy it. Regarding the issue of whether you should buy bitcoin with the amount of money in your savings, in my opinion it is not necessary because you have other needs to support life with your family. Create an investment percentage and adjust it to your savings and income because we never know when we will need cash for urgent needs.If you already believe Bitcoin is one of the best investments then invest responsibly with an amount you can afford to lose. Use a long-term concept to store the bitcoins you have because I am sure that when the ATH arrives you will see the big profits that bitcoin can provide. The most important thing is don't panic and remain calm in any condition because that's how we can make a profit.",

If you have savings, divide that into some for bank and some for buying crypto.It is possible to buy crypto every month or in bulk when the price drops, both of them actually averages out, but since you are from a developing country and already struggling with earnings, the second option might seem better.Selling should also be a part of the cycling of bitcoin, dont forget that.OP is from Bangladesh and their posts are made just to get merits, no offense but this type of mentality of making threads and posting them for review to merit sources should be improved, you are not here just to get merits by writing stories, there are better ways to work on that.
