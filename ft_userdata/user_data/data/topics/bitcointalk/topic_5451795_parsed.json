  "content": "It is really expensive so do you ever run the AC on hot days? When it comes to running the AC, I was taught by the best, my dad would say it was too expensive. And it is very true because it can get pricey to run electricity, instead. I was taught to open all windows throughout the day to ventilate the air in your home.  I also make plenty of ice to enjoy my cup of water or lemonade ice chilled. I also try to have plenty of water bottles stored in my freezer so that when I get thirsty my water will be refreshing. I also take advantage of the free air that they have running at the mall and it’s a great way to not run your AC home and cool off. Afterward Ill head over to the gym where they also have the AC running all day and go swimming for 2 hours. In the evening when I get home, I run my fans and the AC by the time I go sleep to stay cool at night and be able to get some rest. I make sure to program the AC to run only for 4 hours max. So take advantage of places like gyms, libraries, malls, grocery stores, and movie theaters.",

      "body": "If you wish to be more conservative with electricity, you could use some sort of \"ice fan\" that blows cool air (with moisture) once there is ice or cool water or both inside it. The fan is pretty cheap and consumes way less electricity. You could always use your fridge to cool or freeze the water you wish to put inside the fan. Once the fan is turned on it blows cool air, due to the ice or cool water inside it. You can check out this video to watch a device that works in similar manner: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Llm2EKl7iucT",

      "body": "It depends on your location, if you're living on a condo style apartment then it's best to just open the windows and you get fresh air so you save the bills. Also, another factor is the cost of electricity from your city. If they're expensive, then it'd definitely be expensive.If your house or apartment is single detached, you only have your front side to have window because the sides are going to be fire walls. Having said that, when the climate is too hot and humid, you have no choice but on it. I guess electricity bills are better to pay if they're quite expensive to ease the climate than to go with the medical bills.",

This consideration only occur on private usage, online me because of mush bill I run this when I need it most when I feel stufy .",

      "body": "Central air AC, run it 24/7 as much as the thermostat says it has to run. Thermostat compensates uses temperature and humidity, I keep it around 72 Fahrenheit to save on electricity. Total electric bill 100-150 USD. Average size apartment kind of thing, old standard wood frame construction, could have better insulation. My central AC is pretty efficient, my insulation is pretty bad though. Didn't have the money for a newer AC but had to get it anyway when the old one broke because the old refrigerant became illegal and the same thing will happen in a few years again and then the old refrigerant will run out. The new more efficient unit's air handler (indoor part) is ridiculously big.",

When I was using AC frequently I noticed that it became a part of me and if I don stay in an AC environment, I feel uncomfortable. So I decided to adjust by only using fan instead and also fan reduces the cost of electricity bill compeard to AC. AC is good but not good for too long in the body system. here is disadvantages of too much use of AC",

If the temperature inside your home is too high the temperature your thermostat is set to is too high, or the outside temperature is too high the run time will increase. I use this twice in the afternoon and at night. First I set it to the lowest temperature because that cools the room faster. In 3 to 4 minutes your whole room gets cold.",

But after moving from country to country, AC became a luxury, and I realized how expensive it can be.I've been searching for DIY ways to stay cool in the summer, so I appreciate these tips. I'll definitely give them a try.",
