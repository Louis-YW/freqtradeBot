As far as i know if monero has been exist even longer in the market compared with tornado or something like that but the problem is regulators can do nothing against monero.

I remember that a company claimed able to crack down monero's tech but it has not even proven. I think monero is quite safe.",

This topic has been discussed for years now and nothing has changed since then because as you said, the SEC can't do anything about it. Monero is perfect for hiding your transactions and crypto assets and also other privacy coins like it and they cannot just simply remove it or put some heavy regulations against it because it's not that simple and the evidence for that is until now, they haven't made any progress on shutting it down.",

I believe even if it will delist in a major crypto exchange especially the centralized one, Monero still survive but hopefully not without any DeX replacement. Anyway if you are really afraid of the uncertain future of Monero then why not look for other alternatives there are plenty of cryptos, not just the privacy coins. just saying!",

      "body": "Isn't quite new to hear SEC is upsetting many investors due to their strict crypto regulation that brought some projects into a big question. They have XRP and now Monero (XMR) - it was about to think that the government is in the urge to regulate crypto projects because of many scam incidents and it was occurring and increasing. I'd see this having a negative impact on Monero and surely price decline but still believe this never makes this project die, I'd still see a surviving sentiment despite the current issue. This is how it turns out that privacy coins are more prone to strict regulations.",

But honestly, you can just stay with Monero. If you solely believe that Monero will be big someday, stay on it. I know it worries you about these crackdowns. IMO, someday they're going to calm down and have a bit of understanding about the concepts of privacy coins. They'll understand it soon what's the importance of it and the government can do nothing of taking all of it down specially the big ones like Monero.",

Do you think Monero might also get wiped?I believe you are missing a point here, it looks like you are trying to play catch-a-mole about the privacy coins. Monero, as far as I concern is decentralized and has a strong community, it's not like it has a single point of failure. Consider Ethereum, which their node can't even run over the Tor network. And one last question, did you consider privacy coin as an investment or by the utility?",

It is also not a big suprise that privacy coins are pretty high on the list of things that governments and federal banks want to be regulated or even banned because in the end they want to control the cashflow or at least know when and where the money is going.That topic is not new though and i think that even if a ban on privacy coins will happen, then they won't be dead, there will always be a need for privacy coins like Monero, Dash and so on.",
