  "content": "Hello everyone. I wanted to try Bitspincasino but i think they scammed me. I deposited 100 USD and i wanna play some slot games. When i try to buy freespin i got an error message. It was saying “Max limit reached” and i can’t buy freespins. And i wanted to try withdraw my balance and they rejected due to no withdraw option without 3x wager. I talked with the live support they said you must wager 3x. And i said okey. I wagered 3x but they dont give my money back. Withdraw status is always pending. What should i do?",

Because there’s nothing to do here to help you recover your funds since that casino is not active nor reputable in the forum. Your money fate is in the hands of the casino itself. Also you should read the ToS before you deposit since that x3 wagering requirements is a bit cruel just for AML purpose.  Just keep asking the help of the support or use Askgambler or Casinoguru to file a complaint against them hoping that they will answer.",

What should i do?It is better to post all your proof and evidence you know the drill here when posting in the scam section, this is to strengthen your case, and it is better to take out the question mark if you think that did nothing wrong and you expect the withdrawal to be processed.Checking on Askgambler they have a good rating of 7.93. And some of the complaints are resolved based on their website BitSpinCasino ComplaintsYou can file a complaint against Bitspincasino hereHaving trouble with a casino? We’re here to help!I think they will be alerted by this post they have a good rating to be wasted for just $100.",

He claims that he did that as well but now his withdrawal is still pending.Quote from: Husires on October 29, 2023, 03:58:53 PMIt's a strange request to be forced to use the service for an account.I am not sure I understand what you wanted to say with this.

      "body": "IMHO, usually casinos don't just allow you to deposit and just withdraw the entire amount because that could flag your account as related to money laundering or so. If they're telling you to wager three times and then you just did if it's not requiring an amount. How much did you wager with that three times? regardless of result, you're able to fill that requirement and they should allow you to do that. If they still don't allow you to withdraw having that requirements followed, then that's where the red flag should start. How long you've been waiting for that withdrawal? Didn't they say anything that they're reviewing your account for the withdrawal? Because if they reason out another one like you should wager with this 'xx' amount, well that's another tricky requirement to suck your $100.",

I didn't know the part where they use casinos like a mixer to clean dirty money, I just thought that they just withdraw and then just deposit it as if they've played, didn't know they have to play it everytime they deposit to launder.",

Thank you for the recommendation, Rikafip!  @OP Happy you got your funds or else, I would have contacted the group. Even though this is not directly related to the \"problem\", be told that Bitspin will cease operations soon (they did not give an exact date yet but informed us about shutting down the brand).",
