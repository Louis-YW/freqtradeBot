  "content": "Google released its yearly list of top searches in 2022 and I was surprised that in more than one country people are still trying to figure out What is NFT? The craze about NFTs has not faded away and still after so many ups and downs in the cryptocurrency market this year the value of NFT's steady and rising. Below is a small list of countries, where NFTs were searched in 2022India - 3rdNigeria - 3rdCanada - 5th rank and also trending under How to create NFT?Ireland - 5th rankMexico - 6th rank trending under technology.Chile - 7th rankThis list is bigger than what I was able to compile as I have not checked every country due to the language barrier. My point here is that people are still trying to figure out about NFT and hopefully this trend might continue in 2023. What do you guys think?",

      "body": "I would say it is not as big as it used to be. Just because people googled what it is, doesn't mean they got in, look at how the NFT's are doing and you will see that not only the top ones dropped (but the market dropped so that’s normal) but the lower ones are totally gone, not just dropped or crashed in price but literally gone.I remember prices of axies going to 300+ dollar levels, now you could get like for a few bucks, just doesn't make sense for example, you would make zero profit from them too, that’s the trouble. All in all, it is just not looking good, which means no matter how much people google it, the prices are crashing very very hard, more than what bitcoin dropped, some gone 99%+ and some did 90%+ it’s really terrible.",

What do you guys think?   We should expect the number to keep on increasing due to the fact that many people are now venturing into the crypto space.And NFT is quite confusing for these newbies because most of them still have the idea that NFT are same as the images we have stored in our computer or mobile phone and that they don't even need to purchase because they think they can just copy it same way we do to online image and then that will make them NFTs owner. Aside from that you can see that NFTs are now been implemented into some video games where gamers can play to earn some. So to avoid those kinds of misconception newbies and even some with its knowledge still continue searching for better explanation, and that also increases Google's stat.",

Because i believe that money follows money and rich countries might be ahead when we talk about new protocols and tech search. I remember seeing poor countries in top of the list when ico was in the top and started to drop. So i would like to see if there's some overlooked indicators that could mark the start of bear run. I think i am making comparison charts later with google trends API on ICOs, DEXes, and perhaps on some coins before they mooned vs countries searching them.",

What do you guys think?  Yes, people from different countries are trying to discover NFT and get to know it and how to get it, and this indicates that WEB3 may increase widely in the coming years. I see that what prompted people to search for NFT in search engines is the partnerships that Binance has with famous players around The world like Cristiano and Messi, which made football fans feel curious about the virtual world and how to acquire NFTs for these players, and this, in my opinion, will help increase the popularity of NFTs and people’s involvement in the world of crypto and WEB3, so yes, the year 2023 will have a lot of people interested in buying NFTs in auctions and in the platforms and in the virtual games, add to that there are a lot of projects this year based on WEb3 and promoting their NFTs so this is a good indication that this industry will grow day by day.",

I do not have that feeling that it will be trending again. It is like one of those ICO to IEO trends back in the days before almost all of it turned out to be scam. Same goes for NFTs where many rug pulls happened. My classmates back in college even had a tracker bot in their Discord server for price tracker of certain coins and they just did not push through and just went below a quarter per whatever NFTs they were into though I am pretty sure it was a NFT inside a game web app that they used to play like in early 2022.So yeah, I am not sure but I highly doubt that the trend will come back nor continue.",
