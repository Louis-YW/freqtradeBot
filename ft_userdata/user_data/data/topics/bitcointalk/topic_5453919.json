Transactions with high fee rate proceeded by exchanges won't be easily dropped off mempool. Exchanges can re-broadcast those transactions for their users and users will receive their coins after waiting a while.I really don't think if you open a support ticket to complain about your stuck transaction, an exchange will support you immediately by using CPFP option or even with RBF. If they support you, they will have to support others and it will cause overload on their Support team.",

Thanks though.And still, of what significant difference will it make, with the mempool accepting a fee rate of 60sat/byte as its lowest rate and then your having to pick th next sequence within your given fee range to be 70sat/byte. A difference of 10sats don't mean that much. That's just a few cents still and won't have much effect on your transfered funds but would certainly have an effect on the placing of the initiated transaction. Am aware your speculation as used here is an assumption for a practical scenario and better understanding (@ 60sat/byte and 70 sat/byte).In the end, it recalling makes less difference having to to edit and type from your keyboard or keypad and just adjust within  a ranging system.",
