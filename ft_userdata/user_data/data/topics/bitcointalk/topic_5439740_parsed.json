  "content": "Bitcoin can help all nations: El Salvador able to pay back an $800M bond because investment in BTC brought money to the country. El Salvador has completed payments of its $800 million outstanding bond following concerns that it could default due to its decision of making Bitcoin a legal tender. Regardless, the country still owes $367 million plus interest on an $800 million bond due to mature in 2025. Despite all of these progress made by the El Salvador government in their decision to invest in and adopt bitcoin as a legal tender in there country, still the international monetary fund can help but keep making discouraging warning statements to make El Salvador to make a U-turn in their financial policy on bitcoin.IMF issues another warning to El Salvador on its Bitcoin decisions:The country has been very certain about its decision to integrate Bitcoin into its financial sector. However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) keeps issuing warnings. After a recent visit of IMF staff in the country, they observed that the Bitcoin risk to the country has not materialized yet. This is said to be due to its limited use of the decentralized asset.  https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/bitcoin-can-help-all-nations-el-salvador-able-to-pay-back-an-800m-bond-because-investment-in-btc-brought-money-to-the-country/IMF is an international financial organization of which I believe are only driven to render financial assistance to nations whose economic policies  are in alignment with theirs, and its no news that the IMF as an organization is not unconnected to centralized authority system.  Whereas bitcoin is a decentralized currency of which it's operational pattern doesn't conform to central government influence and interference, and so I wonder, could it be due to these factors that the IMF in bent on giving out warnings to the El Salvador government against their acceptance of bitcoin into their financial sector and heavily investing on it but rather doing so under the pretext of supposed risk that El Salvador decision might pose to it's economy?",

More or less if a Central Bank is against it, its good IMF/WB are made by people from central banks all over the world.Central Banks reason of existence is to aid Banks in case of bankruns.Bankruns are only possible because of fractional reserve.Not even 10% of the fiat money in the world exists, this scheme works because people are not withdrawing at the same time...And with their wealth they influenced lawmakers over the 20th century to build robustness to it.Said lawmakers also got input from economists of this system, that needs trash money to \"incentive\" people to get in debt...This is why they fear deflation so much, non garbage money puts all of this at risk.People saving to buy, instead of getting in debt to buy breaks this.With Bitcoin, we don't need Banks, Central Banks, or a World Bank/IMF. We don't need exchanges either, its all about a circular economy where you pay in bitcoin and get paid in bitcoin. Just think of the implications, you will become free from the State and those financial institutions.Banks and exchanges can still exist but should be relegated for some legacy use and always optional, not mandatory how they made it today where they made it impossible for you to function in society without them. Bitcoin is restoring your freedom, you used to have some with fiat cash, but unfortunately the value of fiat cash can be destroyed by some decree overnight.Do you understand the value of Bitcoin yet? You should...",

I believe the issue of high volatility is one of the major reason why IMF is issuing warnings to El Salvador.  For IMF, investing in a high volatile asset is a red flag since IMF believe that the Bitcoin market can crash anytime and will incur losses to El Salvador's economy.We know that IMF is a strong believer of centralized financial institution, so Bitcoin being decentralized is one negative point for IMF.Bitcoin if taken seriously and with right regulation can surely help one country.  It has been discussed and stated that Bitcoin can bring new jobs, potential business venture and start-ups that can give a country profit.",

It will be a big risk for the sitting President like Bukele to believed on Bitcoin itself. That's why the IMF had issued warnings but El Salvador stood firm on Bitcoin and if this news is true then another good example how it can help a poor nation generation money to pay off it's debt although there will be skeptics here for sure.",

They are saying this because they know that El Salvador is going to be a great nation in the future. And they don't want any nation to be a great nation and have the financial freedom because they have chained all the nations to themselves and loan them financially. The problem we are facing in Nigeria is causing by IMF. IMF knows that they can't control bitcoin so the only way to stop El Salvador is to stop them using bitcoin which El Salvador will not agree for that.",

The tourism industry have boomed which was at the low bottom due to the pandemic. Something around 35% growth in the tourism industry have taken place which is really good. More infrastructure plans have been planned out of the bitcoin bonds and things haven't touched the reality. Possibly it takes time and begins when the market turns to be strongly bullish.",

The truth is much different than what most people think, so I will just quote @stompix post in the hope that it will help someone to understand who paid what and where the money came from.Quote from: stompix on January 26, 2023, 05:46:54 PMAnd not a word on the $450m they took in a loan with Central American Bank for Economic Integration and the other $100m they took from the Inter-American Development Bank to pay $604 million in bond maturity.But yeah, let's talk about 800 paid in full when in reality it's just $604 million paid with the help of getting 550 million in loans!And from 800 we're down to 54!Man, Bukele is playing everyone for fools just with some tweets, all it has to do is post the BTC sign and everyone stops questioning any of his statements. When was the last time somebody asked this guy to prove they actually bought those coins and they do have them? Fairly normal to ask Binance to do so, but god forbids we're asking the idol to show proof of any of his claims!Don't trust, verify my ass!~snip~",
