Or is it that we don't want to admit to it after all?20 Conspiracy theories that turned out to be truehttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-07-04-20-conspiracy-theories-turned-out-to-be-true.htmlEditor’s Note: Stop the presses! The fat lady is about to sing. For the first time in the history of this publication, we are going to post a story from… wait for it… MSN. Granted, it wasn’t written by them. They pulled the story from some publication that I can’t actually source since the story doesn’t appear to be on their site, but that’s not important.(Article republished from DiscernReport.com)Thankfully, I didn’t have to go to MSN to get this list put together. Principia Scientific International did the honors, so I’ll link to them instead of to a corporate media site. Here’s their post…In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, leaked classified documents that revealed the extent of the U.S. government’s surveillance programs.The documents showed that the NSA was collecting phone records of millions of Americans and spying on foreign governments and individuals. Snowden’s revelations sparked a global debate about government surveillance and privacy rights.This wasn’t the first or last conspiracy theory that was revealed to be true in the end. Operation MockingbirdThe CIA’s covert operation to control the media by planting stories and manipulating the news was exposed in the 1970s.    Why Gold Is Such An Effective Weapon Against The Government’s Monetary SchemesThe Lavon AffairIn 1954, Israeli agents planted bombs in US and UK targets in Egypt to frame Muslim Brotherhood militants and damage US-Egyptian relations. The operation became known as the Lavon affair after the Israeli defense minister, Pinhas Lavon, who was forced to resign.CIA AssassinationsThe CIA was involved in multiple assassinations of foreign leaders, including Patrice Lumumba of Congo and Salvador Allende of Chile.COINTELPROThe FBI’s Counterintelligence Program was aimed at disrupting and discrediting political organizations in the US. It included illegal surveillance, infiltration, and harassment of civil rights leaders and anti-war activists.The Tuskegee Syphilis ExperimentFrom 1932 to 1972, the US Public Health Service conducted an unethical medical experiment on African American men with syphilis, without their knowledge or consent. ...",

Code-named \"Vault 7\" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.The first full part of the series, \"Year Zero\", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized \"zero day\" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\"Year Zero\" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of \"zero day\" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force — its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities.By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other \"weaponized\" malware. Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its \"own NSA\" with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike.Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that \"There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of \"Year Zero\" goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective.\"Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the \"Year Zero\" disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed, disarmed and published.Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in \"Year Zero\" for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in \"Vault 7\" part one (“Year Zero”) already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks.U.S. media, being as worthless as they are, covered very little of Vault 7 publications. I speculate the intel agencies explicitly told them not to cover such matters in great detail. Of course, the social media companies in 2020 were in constant contact with the FBI, so it would not be outlandish to think the government communicates with the executives in the MSM to keep them away from certain damaging stories.Also see the release of \"Scribbles\" - https://wikileaks.org/vault7/releases/#Scribbles CIA made sure whistleblowers would be punished.",

Bitcoin has provided some kind of release from the government being able to monitor your money, that is one major reason why they do not like it and have not fully supported it since when it was created.",

Kennedy Jr challenged the hosts to prove him wrong when they suggested that he continually spreads conspiracy theories.Reason editor at large Nick Gillespie told RFK Jr \"One of the critiques of your candidacy or even your public profile is that you traffic routinely in conspiracies and that kind of conspiracist mindset where almost everything that we take for granted is bad.\"\"So it's, you know, the Covid vaccines, you know, not only don't work, but they're more dangerous than Covid itself,\" Gillespie continued, going on to reel off a list of 'conspiracies' that RFK has endorsed.5G and Wi-Fi are controlling, you know, controlling our mind. The government, you know, aspects of the government that are supposed to be in favor of trying to help people, actually hurting them. AIDS is not, you know, primarily caused by HIV or HIV is not involved in AIDS. Atrazine is changing frog sexuality and by implication, human sexuality. Your cousin is not, your cousin Michael Skakel is not guilty of the murder of Martha Moxley that he was found guilty of.You know, the 2004 election in Ohio was stolen. It kind of goes on and on. Do you how do you answer people who say, you know, like this is the sign of somebody whose thinking is fundamentally conspiracy-minded rather than kind of dealing with brute reality? You know, that is difficult and, you know, and terrible, but is not what you seem to be making of it.However, when Kennedy asked Gillespie to \"show me where I get it wrong,\"  and offered to go through each example point by point, the host didn't seem too keen.\"You did something that is very unfair. Which is, you made a series of characterizations of my beliefs that you read in the newspapers. Many of which are just wrong,\" Kennedy stated....",
