You can resolve it in PM or with this thread - but if you really want to get the tag removed, then prepare your own defense.But how can you make a rebuttal if your case is really valid as has been proven here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452661.msg62242194#msg62242194",

Given these circumstances, it's challenging for you to provide a convincing justification that could clear your name.",

So yeah, you can forget about milking bitcointalk with this account ever again, unless joining some scammy signature campaign that doesn't care about reputation of its participants.",

But I will give you the answer to you question, the only way to get rid of a negative feedback is to ask the person who gave you the feedback to change/remove it, I doubt you will be able to get JG to review the feedback on your account if you don’t have new evidence that will support your case.",

I am not as strict or as stubborn as some might make me out to be  On several occasions I gave completely incorrect feedback and removed/revised it. On some occasions I revised the feedback after the member posted and contributed positively regularly over a period of time.You may try it in your case which we know is the only way to rig the negative tag or revise into a neutral if you're a lucky one.",

You can also create a thread equipped with evidence that you don't deserve to be tagged negatively. However, if their accusations are true, it is better to forget it because that is the final decision. Besides, you are dealing with those people (who tagged you) and 1000% they will not change itBut you don't need to worry because with a negative tag you can still discuss... So it's no problem, right?",

I didn't make this thread to beg anyone to restore my account. I only wanted to know if there were any chance of getting it back and it seems from all indication it is lost forever.Quote from: PytagoraZ ...Obviously not, because he can't milk the forum anymore as good campaign will not accept negative trust account.You can see how he stopped posting after he got kicked from the campaign.[/quote]You claim i milk the forum what are you doing yourself.

Just keep in mind that many people using alternatives may get caught using vocabulary and stylistics that can be quite difficult to change when wearing multiple masks.We shouldn't emphasise this money issue because it is the same money that has kept you in the forum. Don't act as if you have not had your own saga.I will just say this before i lock the thread... We all have a common interest here on the forum and no matter how much you try to pretend and shy away from the truth. It cannot be denied, Let's forget sentiment almost 80% of the forum members have alts including the spam busters, scum masters, alt hunters and so. I accept the blame i was too careless so i got caught. As for those acting like saints as you pray never to be caught also be careful because the impact you might not withstand.For those asking why i stopped posting when my account left the campaign of what use will my post be. It will not be of much value no matter how much content i try to put into it. I wish you all well. My regards to JollyGood, Jawhead999, and Poker Player. They should make sure the stay clean on the forum because eyes are out to watch... Lovely kisses from my end.",
