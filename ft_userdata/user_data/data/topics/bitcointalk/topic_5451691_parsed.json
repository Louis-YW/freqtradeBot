Another good bit of Bitcoin promotion How about something like  Rosa Bitcoinius ? Anyway, again - awesome work  I hard a similar situation when a church I'm my local region was doing crown funding to erect a new signpost and I offer to spend some Bitcoin in funding the project, and guess what Bitcoin logo was encrypted within the space where there was project courtesy so what I did basically was to write my name and bitcologo. Only I know what exactly that means and some other few friends who were around when the design was done, nice one ops and I suggest you go with your original ideas but good you shared them here for us to read.",

It’s delightful to hear that you're lending your support to a small nursery and their crowdfunding campaign. Naming a new rose can be a fun and creative task! I like \"Satoshi Famosa\" and \"Bitcoin Florensis\" for their playful nod to cryptocurrency. Consider adding elements like color, scent, or unique characteristics of the rose to the name. Whatever you choose, I hope it brings joy to others.",
