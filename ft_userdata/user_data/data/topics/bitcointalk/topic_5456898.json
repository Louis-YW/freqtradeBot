  "content": "Housebets.io is a scam. I was givin restricted access simply because the housebets shotty development team failed to realize a bug when you wagered with BTC. $0.02 US was credited back to my balance. When confronting staff or a mod in discord or telegram I get muted simply because the chat agrees that I and several others shouldn't be held accountable for their mess ups. The mod (poochy) only reply is simply \"your bets were risk free\" not true, if I place a $2.00 wager im still assuming 99.5% of the risk. Housebets.io is the apitamy of everything wrong in the crypto market and the reason why median class citizens won't provide liquidity in the crypto market. You advertise decentralized betting but when things don't go your way you freeze accounts and ban people. Housebets is not for the people it is a dictatorship and me and countless other people that you banned are not gonna just let this blow over. If anyone can help point me in the right direction, I'd like to light a fire ðŸ”¥ underneath their bums. These guys need to be accountable for their actions and unrestrict all the accounts they froze and allow withdraws. Its to bad that some people exploited this bug (even though as I do the math I quickly realize that the juice is not worth the squeeze). Alot of people myself included simply wagered with BTC and for that we got are accounts froze and banned. You need to make this right and really be objective about this.The bug essentially \"due to the decimal places in BTC not being enough it rounded $0.01 & $0.02 spins to 0\". That is quoted straight from the mod in telegram (porchy). My chat is still up in the housebets/lunafi telegram chat and you can see for yourself his irrational, emotional and non logical statements. Bottom line is me and alot of people were banned because housebets sourced developers from fiver instead of hiring a competent and capable developer. Thats why your accountableÂ  and thats why you need to lift these restrictions.",

Op if what Wiwo is saying I'd right you have to delete or lock one of the threads so can create accusation thread against the casino in the Scam Accusation Board. Op Wiwo had just told you the truth about the whole Stuff. I call this as thread farming, that is you are creating one thread in two different boards which is against the rules of the forum. If you ban the yours is gone because if you create another account for the same purpose it will be it will be a tag of ban evasion against you. So to save your life, prevention is better than cure. Lock one the thread now.",
