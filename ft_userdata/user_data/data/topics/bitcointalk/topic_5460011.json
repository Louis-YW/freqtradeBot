Also Bitcoin user is still few percentage to the total population of the world to achieve real mass adaption. Bitcoin has already a campaign for itself but sharing Bitcoin to other people for awareness will increase the speed of adaption which is our end goal here.As long as banks keep stealing us our money and government fiat keeps printing unlimited. Bitcoin needs to fight for adaption relentlessly.",

I think that in extreme cases it wouldn't work because people don't like being forced to do the vidding of other people but if there's a way where the convincing is understanding and polite, I think it's going to be different.",

There are still many people who have not heard about bitcoins or have wrong knowledge of what it is. Still tell people about bitcoin or advice them to find out what it is. Tell Children when they are of age, but do not force them. Tell people about it but do not force them too. If the people who know better about bitcoins stop talking, the people who use it for bad and are promoting a bad name for it do not rest, and it means people who never knew about bitcoin will most probably fall into the hand of scammers and people that will deceive and give them the wrong information about it, that is something that should not be allowed to thrive.",

A more reason to make someone invest in BTC though is if the bull run is about to begin. If you wanna help someone struggling in this recession time, they best jump right into investing BTC because it will literally save them.For children, I guess they can learn more in the coming years when BTC is pretty much a household thing. Right now there are still people very reluctant to invest and that's one reason why its also good to campaign still.",

Bitcoin was already greatly adapted these days we can already see even banks starting to adapt Bitcoin, there are some banks here in my Â country where you could already buy Bitcoin on there platform.",

So there some areas that other person doesn't know that and you know so you have to tell the person what you have known in bitcoin so when you were saying that bitcoin is campaigning for itself, I was not comfortable because people need to hear it from you with good examples to convince them.

Bitcoin is not just a coin that is traded on the market, there is technology in it, and blockchain technology is not only used in finance but can also be applied in various fields.So for me, even though Bitcoin is popular now and many already know about it, it still needs to be campaigned because not a few people have heard of bitcoin but don't understand how to invest properly. We know that investing in Bitcoin without knowledge is very risky, therefore it would not hurt us to campaign about Bitcoin. Because if you invest carelessly without analysis and know the knowledge, you will lose, regardless of the type of investment, including bitcoin investment.",

Xiaomi, for instance, has opted to eliminate traditional advertisements altogether. This drastic measure has significantly cut down their advertising budget. However, what's intriguing is how Xiaomi has managed to imprint in the minds of everyone that when it comes to finding a feature-rich smartphone with official warranty, the answer is Xiaomi. Its reputation has spread through word-of-mouth recommendations from satisfied customers.Bitcoin follows a similar pathâit can promote itself if its existence brings tremendous benefits. However, considering Bitcoin's current position, achieving global recognition is undoubtedly challenging. Some countries still do not accept Bitcoin as a viable form of currency. As more and more people adopt the mindset that Bitcoin is the easiest investment without KYC (Know Your Customer), it gains prominence. When the Google search trends for such keywords start soaring, the result is an automatic surge in Bitcoin's value.",
