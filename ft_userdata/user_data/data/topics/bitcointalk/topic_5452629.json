It doesn’t make it any different with saving your coins on exchanges. People tend to trust too much on email and google doc but once it is compromised everything on it is exposed. Email one of the most vulnerable places to store your coins. Everything comes with a risk and self custody is also without risk but it is better to lose your keys yourself than handing it over to hackers",

It is crucial to keep your private keys and seed phrases offline, preferably on a hardware wallet, and in a secure location. Exactly. Your seed phrase or private key is supposed to stay offline and out of devices such as your phone. It's a common mistake that I've also made myself; your phone's storage isn't as vulnerable as uploading it online, but it can still be subject to theft or a possible malware attack that steals your data. There's a decent chance that it won't happen to you; Google services are generally secure and also require two-factor authentication (2FA), but there are a handful of security breaches on other services that can expose your information.I don't understand what kind of maintenance a wallet needs, like the OP is suggesting. Just store your private key on a piece of paper in several spots around your house, and you should be fine.",

You spent enough time on the forum to know how wallets work. I think it’s fair to ask you how much you have spent so far in “maintaining” your wallet and seed phrase. If a peon loses his device, he can easily import his wallet to another device, there is no other way to do it.  Quote from: Godlovesyou on May 13, 2023, 05:24:15 PMOnce you own bitcoin wallet or other crypto currency, thinking of how long you can maintain your wallet follows this steps,First send your seed phase or private keys to your emails, also use them to compose a little song only can listen anytime, write it down in your diaries, and makes sure have a google doc to save your wallet keys and other information.This is really bad advice. Once your seed phrase is stored online, just know your wallet has already been compromised, your email, online notes can be hacked. Online storage is very dangerous whether you use a song format or not, hackers can use malware to search for keywords that look anything like seed phrase. It’s better to be safe than sorry, store your seed phrase offline, you can write them on paper or engrave them on steel.",

Please tell me you're just pulling our legs.It's never a good idea to save your private key in any software that has anything to do with the internet since it makes it more vulnerable to hacking, and that includes your email address. I believe I saw a discussion where the user proposed integrating his/her secret phrases in a song, and I doubt he'll stick with that concept considering all the comments he received from forum members.Op I will not advise anyone to use any of your methods of keeping secret phrase/private key. You should also bear in mind that your secret phrase is not an asset that loses worth over time if not repolished, and you do not need to continuously check on them. You can just follow the standard procedure of \"writing them on different paper (preferably metal sheet) and storing them in different safe locations.\"",

Doing that means accessing your email is also accessing your keys. Emails can also be hacked easily. Writing your seed in a diary will be a good option if nobody can access the diary. You will be risking your Bitcoin if you write it on the diary that you use every time. Also, the topic of the thread is confusing. I was surprised when I saw the cost of maintaining wallets because I know that wallets are not like a fiat bank account in that you are to pay maintenance fees.

Hackers are also smart these days, they might analyze what these words are that have been sent to an email.But if you think that's safe for you, good luck but what's safe to me is to never associate it to any email and keep it offline and plainly in a piece of paper/card board or in an engraved dog tag.",
