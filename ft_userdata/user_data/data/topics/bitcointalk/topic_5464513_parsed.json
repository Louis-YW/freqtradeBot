  "content": "The appointment of pro-crypto, real estate developer Srettha Thavisin as Thailandâ€™s next Prime Minister means a 10,000 THB ($300 USD) airdrop is likely happening.The national airdrop would be provided to every Thai citizen aged 16 and above, with the condition that it can only be utilized within a four-kilometer radius of their residence.The airdrop will utilize a national token rather than an existing digital asset or cryptocurrency. Vendors will have the option to convert it into cash at specified banks.Thailand will now also offer a $1B tax break for firms issuing investment tokens... I'm telling you, the next best innovation in the blockchain space is coming out of Asia.https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/08/23/thailands-new-pro-crypto-prime-minister-was-an-active-crypto-investor/",

      "body": "But what's going to be the effect of it? We've seen these airdrops with real money which is like the US injection and printing of money like brrrrrrrr led to inflation. This leads to $14.3B although it's a different thing from the incident that I have mentioned. There's a certain rule on how and where you can spend this airdrop if you're from there. As he's a pro crypto, there could be more to this and this is just like giving the idea to its citizens that, \"hey crypto is within us soon\".",
