How much transaction fees do I have to expect before the money arrives on my btc wallet? Do I need to consider a fixed amount per transaction or is it in %?Thank you very much in advance!",

How much transaction fees do I have to expect before the money arrives on my btc wallet? Do I need to consider a fixed amount per transaction or is it in %?No, it’s not a fixed amount per transaction. You can use as low as 1sat/vbyte depending on how fast you want your transaction to arrive and also how congested the network is. And also the amount you’re transacting plays no role in your transaction fee, which means the transaction fee you’re using to transact with $10 worth of BTC can be the same with that of $10,000 worth of BTC, it all depends on the size in terms of byte not the dollar equivalent.",

No. Maybe.Bitcoin transaction are based on the number of outputs, not the value of those outputs. If I have a single output of 1 BTC, then to spend that I only need to pay for one output. If I have ten outputs of 0.0001 BTC, then to spend that I will need to pay for all ten outputs. It will be cheaper for me to spend one output of 1 BTC than it would be for me to spend ten outputs of 0.0001 BTC, even though those ten outputs of 0.0001 BTC are only worth a fraction of the one output of 1 BTC.An analogy is like sending cash in the post, where you are charged for the weight of the cash you are sending. If I send a single $100 bill it will be very cheap. If I send a few dozen coins it will be very expensive, even though the total value of the coins will be much less than that of the $100 bill.The $0.33 flat fee given by mempool.space is based on an \"average\" segwit transaction which spends a single input (regardless of the value of that input). If your $10 payment and your $1000 payment are both from a single input, then yes, they will pay the same fee. If they require more than one input, then the total fee will vary, although the fee rate (in satoshis per virtual byte, or sats/vbyte) will remain the same.",

What you should be looking at is the fee rate that the sender used. If the sender use 7 or 8 or higher fee, expect the transaction to be confirmed fast. But always look at the mempool, the sat/vbyte is not constant, you will see the sat/vbyte to be changing, if it gets higher than 8 sat/vbyte, the transaction may not be confirmed fast. But the mempool is not getting higher for now.",

So when you want to buy more space in that block (ie. when your transaction size is bigger) you have to pay a higher \"fee\" and when there is more competition for that limited space (ie. network congestion) you also have to compete and pay a higher \"fee\".And as others pointed out, your transaction size depends on how many inputs and outputs it has. So it doesn't matter if you are transferring $10 or $1000 as long as the tx size is the same.",

If you are using Trust wallet for multi-coin purposes, it is better to move your BTC's to Electrum or Sparrow in order to separate them from Altcoins, and if you want an open source solution to your Altcoins, there's unstoppable wallet or multi-coin hardware wallets that you can use.",

But in my view the fee is too low which could delay your transaction for longer than expected time but your transaction will be completed if not then nothing to worry about because if it will not be completed then it will reflect back into your account. New users of BTC sometimes get panic when there transactions got stuck or delayed for longer period of time. The only reason is, most of the big firms, institutions are running there own nodes and they mostly select the highest fees to provide highest priority to there transactions.

The transaction fee will remain the same for each single output. The lowest transaction fee one can set is at 1sat/vbyte, but if you want to have a smooth transaction then I would recommend to set a fee higher than 5sat/vbyte as that would help to increase the speed of transaction because the miners always prefer to add the transactions into the block that has higher fees.In case if you want to send $1000 and the fee is 8sat/vbyte, and you're sending that transaction to a single output address then the fee will always remain same, but if you're sending a transaction where you have multiple output address then you will have to multiply the fee for all those addresses.

Running your own node gives you privacy, and you can verify and validate things locally, but you still have to pay fees that are worth incentivizing a miner to add your tx into their block to be mined, and running your own node in this case doesn't give you any specific advantage because any BTC user can attach a high tx fee to their transaction, whether they run a node or not.",
