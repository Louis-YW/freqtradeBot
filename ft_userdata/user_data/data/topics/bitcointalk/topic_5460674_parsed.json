The widening gap between the Naira’s official exchange rate and the parallel market rate is the widest seen since the currency’s unification, largely driven by an insatiable demand for the US dollar that surpasses the available supply.  Initially, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) hinted at allowing free trade until the currency achieved a market-relevant level.However, market participants are now expressing concerns that the high demand for foreign exchange might lead to further depreciation of the local currency. There is a big gap between them again. How come?",

I no go talk too much on top this. No be rocket science go arrange things. Naira no be Nigeria challenge, so long as pressure dey on exchanging dollar to take important goods or take travel abroad for whatever purpose and we no dey produce what to export, Naira will still be depreciating. The economy lacks factors of production.",
