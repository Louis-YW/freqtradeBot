Only very few practice this on this forum. If the OP has been answered already. If you will notice some topics are in a form of question and everybody response to it with different opinion, if the OP is fulfilled with the answers then he can close or locked the thread. Depends on the topic if that was has a specific need.Thats the thing OP should always locked their thread if its already served its purpose. If he didnt probably some reported it so moderators can act on behalf. But doing or practicing it is a good responsibility for every users here.",

Only very few practice this on this forum. Based on my observations, topics about questions are usually created by newbies, so it makes sense if they don't lock the topics they create, even though they already have answers to their questions. Like on this topic for example: invest in bitcoin or altcoin?Raceonsucced already got enough responses which i think are enough to answer the question, he has also responded, but until now he has not locked the topic he made. Of course (although i'm not 100% sure), this has something to do with the newbies not knowing how to lock the topics they create or about the responsibility of being a topic maker. If you think the topics have got answers, you can report to the moderator to lock the topic to avoid spam responses.",

If reading through you find that you can add something meaningful, then it makes sense to add to the thread (i.e. adding further developments on a given topic being treated, or genuine related questions). One has to calibre properly if it makes sense or not-Generally speaking, people don’t go bumping oldish threads that much, and if they do, other will notice clearly whether the intent was to say something meaningful or not (and likely subsequently report the post if not). In the big picture, people don’t really resort much to locking threads themselves. I believe I might have locked a few in Meta when I asked something and got satisfactory replies, and a few time-sensitive threads that made sense to lock, but besides that, the others remain open primarily in case someone needs to add or ask something further down the road, alongside there not being a collective habit of locking them.One would think that threads that have not been active for a certain amount of time could self-lock, giving the OP the option to reopen them. A mechanism could be devised whereby threads could self-lock by default after x days without any activity (i.e. 90), giving the OP the option to adjust or even remove the default value x.Nevertheless, I’m sure we could find plenty of counter-arguments to vouch for this not to take place (i.e. can’t add more important related info nor ask valid related questions, it calls for opening new threads rather than building-up further context in an already existing ones, and so forth).",

Even when bumped, they most likely sink to the bottom soon after.The spam problem comes from threads which are still being actively discussed daily with no actual contribution. Replies here are just remakes of the ones before and those commenting do not bother to read previous replies and surely cannot read 4-20 pages of posts.If an autolock feature is added, it would do nothing to reduce spam mega threads.",
