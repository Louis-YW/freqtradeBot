  "content": "I got a job in a private university for about a year.  Where engineering is taught.  And I am a teacher of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).  I had a meeting with the principal of my university a few days ago and made a proposal to teach about blockchain and Bitcoin to students . The principal asked for some time to think it over and had several meetings with other teachers on the matter. And since Bitcoin is an huge valuable and trusted Digital currency and backed by Blockchain which is a advanced technology and Bitcoin is a widely used and well-known currency in worldwide and a lot of research is going on worldwide about it. so all the teaching staff including the principal agreed to this And prepare to teach students about Blockchain and BitcoinAs this decision is solely taken by our university itself and being a private university there is no scope for issuing any institutional certificate about bitcoin learning.  We keep it as an additional class.  We have one class on Bitcoin per week in a 2 day class routine.  Which is not compulsory for any student.  Any student may or may not take this class if they wish. But I was surprised to see that almost 90% of the students expressed interest in doing the Bitcoin class. And since I have been in this forum for a long time and this forum has all kinds of information about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency, I took the initiative to introduce students to this forum as well. Also our teaching staff has been asked to study more about Bitcoin and are in the process of hiring at least 2 teachers who are very knowledgeable about Bitcoin and blockchain technology I myself took my first class on bitcoin today in our university and firstly gave some idea to all the students about this forum because this forum is a good source to get good knowledge about bitcoin and cryptocurrency. And I am very happy today to be able to implement such a goal in my university.",

If you do a good job, you'll start a revolution (according to Henry Ford).As per our plan here students will be given general ideas about Bitcoin.  So that students can at least know about bitcoin, how bitcoin works, how to store it, how to protect bitcoin wallet, benefits of investing in bitcoin, what benefits can be gained by knowing about bitcoin, what are the future problems you can face if you don't know about bitcoin , What role will bitcoin play in the country's economy, is there any possibility of bitcoin harming the country, etc etc...However, there are plans to hire 2 teachers who are experts in Bitcoin to teach about Bitcoin mining and other difficult tasks.",

This is clearly a poorly arranged show to gain merits. Our friends from certain geography have shown to be more eager to teach bitcoin to family, friends, coworkers and students, seems like other regions have joined in as well. There is a thread in beginners and help about a failed attempt to teach bitcoin in a workplace. This kinds of post have been showered with merits and I don’t think they will stop until the merits stop.",

I should have posted a clear picture of the entire classroom to make it clearer.  But unfortunately I didn't do it.  Although I have seen a few topics before that teach about Bitcoin.  There were blackboards and pictures posted with some students.  I will try to make this more clear later.  We have only taken the initiative so everything is not fully organized yet. I will try to give a clear picture when I take another class later.",

Don’t get me wrong, It would be great news seeing lectures about bitcoin being taught in universities. Perhaps you’re a lecturer or a professor at a university? Or you’re a student yourself?Lately, there has been threads on here about teaching nephews, friends, pastor friends, and now a class at the university. It’s always good to see people advocating for the growth and adoption of bitcoin though lately, it seems we’re also looking for some sort of praise or acknowledgment from forum members for doing so.",

They should read something about bitcoin where you act as the teacher guiding them with explanations, but it seems you're not doing it based on the photos.If you actually do what you say in the thread for your students then you have contributed to bitcoin. But if this thread is just your attempt to earn merit or fishing merit, then I think you will fail at that. Honestly it would be a great idea if you and your university managed to spread the word about bitcoin, and I wish you success teaching your students about bitcoin with the right information.",

But like other members have observed there are so many things that are not in place in this your selfless service. You have failed to outline your lesson plan and how you intend to execute them. You seem also to focus more on introducing them to the forum just after the first class. I also doubt your report that 90% of the students picked interest because I am sure that many people still have negative views about bitcoin. I am also glad that you have promised to clear the doubt of some members in your next class. All the best sir.",
