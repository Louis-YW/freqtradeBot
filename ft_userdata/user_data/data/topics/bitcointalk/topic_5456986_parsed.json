  "content": "Arietta Smart Chain (ASC)Arietta is an innovative blockchain network that introduces a next-generation Proof of Authority consensus mechanism, offering remarkable features such as over 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), swift block times, and significantly reduced fees. With Arietta, you can enjoy the advantages of Ethereum‚Äôs advanced smart contract capabilities, while experiencing enhanced speed, heightened security, and lower gas fees. Discover more about Arietta by exploring our comprehensive documentation.  Proof of Authority (PoA) POA stands for Proof of Authority, which is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks. In a Proof of Authority system, block validators are identified and authorized by a central authority or a select group of reputable entities. Unlike other consensus mechanisms that rely on computational work or economic stake, POA relies on the reputation and identity of validators to validate and add new blocks to the blockchain. Validators take turns proposing and validating blocks, and their identities are publicly known, allowing for increased trust and faster block confirmation times. POA is known for its efficiency, scalability, and resistance to certain types of attacks like the 51% attack. ¬†Block Time A new block can be completed in just 2 seconds, making it more than 6 to 7 times faster than Ethereum and substantially lower gas fees. ¬†This faster block time allows for quicker transaction finality and improves the overall user experience in terms of transaction speed and responsiveness. However, it‚Äôs important to note that network performance can vary based on factors such as network congestion and the specific implementation of the POA network. ¬†Speed of Transactions The speed of transactions in a blockchain with a POA (Proof of Authority) consensus mechanism and a 2-second block time refers to the time it takes for a transaction to be confirmed and included in a block. In this case, with a 2-second block time, transactions can be processed and finalized within a few seconds. When a user initiates a transaction on a blockchain with a 2-second block time, it is typically validated and confirmed by the authorized validators within a short period of time. Once confirmed, the transaction is added to the next available block, and subsequent blocks are added at 2-second intervals. This fast block time allows for near-instantaneous transaction confirmation, enabling users to experience quick transaction speeds and reduced waiting times compared to blockchains with longer block times. It enhances the efficiency and responsiveness of the blockchain network, making it suitable for applications that require fast transaction processing, such as real-time payments, high-frequency trading, or interactive applications. ¬†Utility The goal of a POA blockchain network for utility applications is to provide a reliable and efficient platform for various utility services. It aims to support a wide range of applications, including payment systems, supply chain management, data verification, identity management, and more. By leveraging the reputation and authority of validators, the network can achieve fast transaction processing, high throughput, and low fees, making it suitable for utility-focused use cases.Additionally, a POA blockchain network for utility applications can offer customizable governance models, allowing network participants to make collective decisions and shape the direction of the platform. This ensures that the network evolves according to the needs and requirements of the utility applications it supports. ¬†SPECIFICATIONS - Total Supply: 10 Million - GWEI (Gas): 3 - Block Time: 2 seconds - Consensus Algorithm: IBFT V2.0 PoA - TPS (TX per second): 100,000+ - EVM Compatible: Ethereum Virtual Machine - Scale: Increase TX - Validator Set: Dynamic The project is part of the Arians ecosystem, but has not yet been listed on any exchange. The ecosystem also includes the established aRIA project, which is traded on several exchanges. Swap between aRIA and ARIETTA 1:1 The start of trading after appearing on the exchange will be significantly lower than the cost of aRIA, so seize the moment! ¬†OFFICIAL LINKS Website Twitter Discord Telegram Github",
