  "content": "Are we going to have Ledger server problems each time one of their partners mess something up and collapses like FTX exchange did?Everyone knows that FTX made partnership with ledger before, and after they announced stopping of withdrawals we saw big problems with ledger servers.Ledger Support first they posted tweet on November 9 saying they have many issues including connecting to the My Ledger tab and performing a Genuine Check, something that has nothing to do with FTX exchange.Some people even reported issues with bluetooth pairing, other people couldn't turn on their device, battery issues came back, people couldn't send any coins. sync was not working, etc.CTO of ledger Charles Guillemet even said that Ledger is facing scalability issues amid FTX collapse. This was resolved the next day and things should get back to normal now, but what is going to happen if something similar happens with their new partner Binance exchange.Much more people are using Binance so I am sure server problems and outages will be much more severe and it could last much longer.  Better think about this next time you withdraw your coins to ledger hardware wallet thinking they are safu.This topic will be used each time ledger faces some server issues in future.",

I know you are anti-Ledger, I know that they've made many mistakes, but now you are just misleading newbies (they may think that the CEX is safer than a HW!?!)Even if Ledger server is not working, one can use his Ledger with Electrum.Even if Ledger HW stops working, as long as he keeps the seed safely, his funds are OK and can be spent either from a new hardware wallet, either by making a cold storage (maybe with some help), or even with a hot wallet, although I don't recommend the last option.",

When did I say that?It's pretty much clear that if centralized exchange is connected with ledger device and you want withdraw coins from exchange from wallet, you won't be able to do this in scenario similar to FTX.You won't be able to use Ledger with Electrum when ledger servers are not working, no transactions are possible in that case (scalability issues  ).Only way would be to import seed words in different wallet or other brand of hardware wallet, but what's the point of owning ledger crap them  Sorry but In this case you are openly supporting ledger partnership with centralized exchanges like FTX and Binance, and this topic is not misleading anyone, it's created for ledger server issues.",

Coins on a Ledger are safe no matter what opinion you have about them. That's what NeuroticFish was trying to tell you, but you allow your personal feelings about the company to cloud your judgement. Ledger's awful data leak and the way they handled it, their Nano X battery problems, severe connection issues, and similar things have nothing to do with the safety of the coins.",

And it's something that I have pointed out before about the server connection issues with them and other wallets. For good or bad, coins are safe in your ledger as a hardware wallet. Once you have to start importing your seed elsewhere it all is moot.We would all like to think that we are not going to make a mistake, we all know it's possible to do something stupid when downloading another wallet, importing keys and everything else. I have said for a while now hardware wallets should never be dependent on ANY one piece of software. -Dave",

I do know that for the set up process, you need to \"install the latest version of the Bitcoin app\" but other than that, why it has to rely on their servers while there are plenty on Electrum? If you are using Electrum instead of Ledger Live when sending bitcoin, you are using the Electrum server you are connected to for all your actions. Among the things that were mentioned in the OP, Ledger's servers are needed to perform the genuine check, communicate with the services available through Ledger Live, and when sending transactions (via Ledger Live) because the wallet has to by synced. If it takes longer than usual to sync, everything else takes longer. I can't comment on the Bluetooth pairing because I don't know about that. Ledger's servers being jammed or down has nothing to do with devices not turning or Nano X battery problems.",

Really, that's the logic? The server issues is the cause why the device can't turn on and why there are battery issues? Applying that logic, if your Ledger device were to be stolen from your home, that's also because Ledger Live had server issues and the company was promoting the sale of FTX tokens. All that led to the battery problems and the stealing of your hardware wallet. You should take it up a notch. I heard there was this guy who dropped his laptop on the floor, and when he wanted to connect his Ledger Nano X, the laptop was dead! Fucking Ledger and their partnerships.

You are confusing your readers  I believe Ledger servers is also part of their products, you can't use ledger live app without ledger servers, and you also can't update firmware without ledger servers.Any issue related with severs can affect devices not being able to turn on, and it's interesting that I never heard stuff like that happening to any other hardware wallet manufacturers so far.",

That's not what you said previously. In your reply to NeuroticFish you said that you can't use your Ledger with Electrum if Ledger servers aren't working. That's false. Quote from: dkbit98 on November 15, 2022, 07:14:40 PMAny issue related with severs can affect devices not being able to turn on. Wrong again. You can connect your Ledger hardware wallet to any computer via your USB cable. That computer does not need to have Ledger Live installed and hence there are no severs to connect to. If the device is working, it will ask you to enter your PIN in order to unlock it. This action does not require Ledger Live or a connection to Ledger servers.",
