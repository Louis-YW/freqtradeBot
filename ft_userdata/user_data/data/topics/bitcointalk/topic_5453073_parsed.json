Other than that you can only use electrum, if you have your multi sig on a desktop electrum then it might work to have one part in mobile electrum. For ease it is best all co-signers use the electrum. I stand to be corrected",

Or will my wallet only work with Electrum ?Are you perhaps talking about the seed phrase's compatibility?If so, the workaround for BIP39 compatibility is to create your BIP39 seed phrases somewhere and then import those to your Electrum during MultiSig wallet creation.So instead of selecting \"Create a new seed\", select \"I already have a seed\" then tick \"BIP39 seed\" in the option;There'll be additional step of selecting the script type but the rest of the steps should be similar.Of course, the \"other wallet\" should also support BIP39 seed and HD MultiSig wallet.Note: If future version compatibility is your concern, this is more likely to be deprecated in future Electrum than Electrum's standard seed phrase.Or not strictly seed phrase?Because you can import the master private/public key(s) to Bitcoin Core via descriptors.Here's the basic instructions on importing HD Multisig descriptor to Bitcoin Core: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5427745.msg61426872#msg61426872For Electrum master private keys, the derivation path is different. (it's a tedious thing to do but it's possible to import with the correct inputs)",

(check the \"Warning\" when restoring BIP39 seed)The pro is of course, it's compatible with almost all non-custodial wallets.With Electrum seed, you can directly restore them in Electrum without taking note of the script type.Anyhow, both backup should still have a note of your selection of \"m-of-n\", number of required signatures and number of cosigners.",
