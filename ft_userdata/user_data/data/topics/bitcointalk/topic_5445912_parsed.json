While theoretically a private key could be placed under the security sticker, this has not been done to avoid regulation issues with the SEC.",

I have no idea who is behind it, but it’s pretty clear that all they did was rip off designs from Mike Caldwell and Mick Bruce then combine them into a single coin. Unless they paid Mike and Mick or at the very least sent them free coins and got their approval, I don’t think it’s appropriate to support this.",
