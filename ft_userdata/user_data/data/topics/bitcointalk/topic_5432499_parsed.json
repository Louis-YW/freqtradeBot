Take note that a bitcoin address is public key hash, starts with either bc1, 1 or 3 and is all you need to receive bitcoin. What's the problem now? Do you get any error when you enter your address and request a withdrawal?",

OR BTC something differerent?Of course, comes to withdrawal..different story...so, left with bitcoin option.  So, firstly, im wondering..because i never depoited via bitcoin....but ( having ) to withdraw via bitcoin...that an issue?The actual problem is, copied/pastedt the receive address as mentioned...inserted into the 'withdraw via bitcoin' on casino site'...but button still 'greyout'...spoke to 'help'  said, needed to include the 'hash' ( line of wallet im using' )  But...where do i place that? i only copied/pasted what was auto generated via my Wasabi wallet ( never used before btw ).",

Your bitcoin address is the hash of your public key and there shouldn't be any problem.The only thing that comes to my mind is that maybe they don't support bech32 addresses (addresses starting with bc1). Maybe, you need to provide a legacy address (an address starting with 1 or 3). Can you tell us what casino you are trying to withdraw bitcoin from?",

Im new to bitcoin and to be honest i dont want to use it..but i rarely have winnings so...thought for once i will pursue and get some pennies back!The site is one of a list using Cureuo licence, its europeon, so not expecting anything to be honest.  But, so far, they are replying to me re helping me, just wont let me withdraw using mastercard thats all.So,  PUBLIC LINK then..whats that about..and where can i find that..and ...is that not recommended..or more likely to go wrong and i dont get the cash??",

      "body": "@RobbyN789, STOP with thread spamming, you ask the same questions in several threads and thus only make it difficult for yourself and others who are trying to help you. To begin with, it would be wise if you finally say which casino it is about, because it seems that something is not right in the whole story. Deposits in fiat, withdrawals exclusively in Bitcoin, and finally, as things stand, they do not support \"bitcoin addresses\".What they ask of you doesn't make any sense, and maybe they just drag you around without wanting to pay you at all. In any case, even if it is a legitimate casino, it is one of the worse ones I have read about on this forum.",

IF you / or someone else could just answer me this once and for all - I am geninually trying to withdraw some monies from a online casino, the casino but belong under the same banner..exact same layout..as Cureuo licence..the likes of PlentyofFish/YummyWins -  Midnight Wins.   These are europeon, not on gamstop, better bonuses perhaps, and i have rare occasion recveived winnings via my depoist method of mastercard  but yes lose more than win. No need for lectures well aware.SO, casino are saying cannot pay to my mastercard, technical issues ( i spoke to my bank, and yes sometimes they query europeon / changed to dollers and even YEN!  - but they said usually no issues ), hence, casino said, why not try setup, Metrobank ( hence my thread..which happy to delete ) , i have no desire to setup a bank account..but looked into Metrobank..seems ok....I just want my winnings!! in cash!! none of this messing about even in bitcoin malarky!!  but..i am..where..i ..am...and this forum..seemed helpful.SO, upshot is,Wasbie wallet, tried the receive code etc.....spoke to Casino Help ( all very quick and helpful..but ultimately im still without winnings..so..that tells you something!! ) ....but they said to try, BLOCKCHAIN.SO -    this leads me onto..my final question.....BLOCKCHAIN.    Last attempt.  Shall i, ....knowing nothing!!!....download Blockchain..and try to withdraw my winnings?Can anyone tell me why not to do  /or ...is this ok to do this?  blockchain. Not looking for complicated stuff...i want to download approx 300euros  into...blockchain.....and then...would LOVE to somehow get that changed into proper cash.    First things first, get casino to give me the money into blockchain?Sounds ok? ( i dont need to upload any monies into Blockchain do i? i see its a bit of a 'send documents' process  as it is . All i want is to download winnings into it. thats it.",

( its a casino and lookinf for a few hundred euro in winnings. )I simply create a 'retrieve address'  a  long series of numbers comes up... i copied and pasted.Normally, for someone to send you bitcoins, you simply give them an address provided by your wallet, and apparently that is exactly what you have done.Quote from: RobbyN789 on December 31, 2022, 01:07:19 PMBUT...apparently i need the 'hash address'......so my long list of numbers starts with  \"bc1qs.....etc..\"  but in order for me to withdraw told i need the hashadress of wallet and numbers starting 01 ..02...Now, there is no such thing as a \"hash address\", so it is not clear what they are saying that you need to provide. You are probably misunderstanding their instructions. Your \"long list of numbers starts with \"bc1qs...'\" is probably exactly what they want ....HOWEVER,Quote from: RobbyN789 on December 31, 2022, 01:07:19 PMbut in order for me to withdraw told i need the hashadress of wallet and numbers starting 01 ..02...That statement leads me to believe that their now outdated wallet does not support bech32 addresses (addresses starting with \"bc1\"). What they seem to need is an address that starts with a \"1\", which is called a \"legacy\" address.My recommendation is that you install a wallet that generates \"legacy\" addresses. I don't know if a blockchain.com wallets does, but if they recommend it, then it should work. Either way, receive the bitcoins with a wallet that is compatible with that site and then perhaps send them to your wasabi wallet at some point.",

According to the other thread created by OP, the problem is that they don't accept bech32 addresses. OP's problem has been already solved with generating a legacy wallet on electrum. Quote from: odolvlobo on January 02, 2023, 04:59:40 AMI don't know if a blockchain.com wallets does, but if they recommend it, then it should work.Yes. Blockchain.com wallet generates both segwit and legacy addresses.",
