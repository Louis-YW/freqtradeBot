  "content": "First I would like to clarify that this is a true story, it was covered by reputable media in the Philippines and there are articles provided in this thread you can also Google this story.A lotto winner in the Philippines who won 12 million pesos in 2014 worth $217k now, can finally claim his lotto winning and this is after 9 years of legal battle QuoteOn Oct. 5, 2014, Mendoza went to the PCSO Main Office in Mandaluyong City where he submitted a handwritten account of the incident to the legal department.But because the damaged ticket could not be validated, Mendoza was told by the PCSO on Oct. 20, 2014 that he could not claim the prize. This was based on the PCSO’s prevailing conditions on claiming/payment of winnings.This prompted him to seek relief from the SC and after nine years of legal battle, the high court ruled that the circumstances surrounding the fact that Mendoza won the lottery were established and that the testimonies of Mendoza and his family were admissible.QuoteAlmost nine years ago – on October 2, 2014 – Mendoza placed three bets for the Lotto 6/42 through lucky pick in an outlet in Batangas. A day later, he found out he won. The problem was his granddaughter crumpled his winning ticket.In an attempt to straighten the ticket, Mendoza’s daughter ironed the ticket with a piece of cloth covering it. However, the ticket was blackened instead. The only remaining visible details were:The first two digits of the three bet combinationsThe outlet from which the ticket was boughtDraw dateDate of purchasePartially, the time the ticket was purchasedIn these 9 years, the winner did not lose hope and summoned the help of lawmakers and lawyers to help him win the case he even worked as an overseas worker and just came home just to attend hearings and follow with his case and he even sold some of his properties so he can sustain the battle.My questions are :Do you think it's worth the wait, he's getting 6% interest per annum but he still has to pay a lot of money and suffers a lot even to the point of having a rift with his daughterWill you do the same thing and fight for your rights to claim the prizehttps://www.rappler.com/nation/give-lotto-winner-damaged-ticket-million-prize-supreme-court-orders-pcso/https://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/classified-odd/10/10/14/winning-lotto-ticket-burned-flat-ironhttps://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2023/10/26/pcso-lotto-winner-damaged-ticket-12-million-prize.html",

Twelve million pesos is still a lot of money; he's now one of the millionaires in the Philippines, so he should be happy with that. The 6% interest per annum is another bonus, so I guess he'll now live a good life with the money he won from the lottery.The good thing is that the court has honored his winnings. I thought when a ticket is already destroyed, it's automatically non-acceptable, but the ruling of the court favors him but the sad part is after nine long years. What kind of justice system is that?",

He was so lucky to still have some details left uncleaned on his ticket after his daughter had ironed it with the intention to straighten the rumple ticket, if it was a complete blank ticket there wouldn't have been any evidence substantial to win this battle.  Congratulations to him.",

      "body": "It's worth the wait and it's a good lesson for everyone who is playing the national lotto in our country. I suddenly remembered my grandfather and I know where he is keeping his lottery tickets. They are all in good condition, not even a fold, even the lottery tickets from somewhere 3-5 months ago (if I remember correctly) were all in good condition, even the numbers are still visible. I always keep his taxi cab clean that's why I know it all and I am also the one who went to the lotto outlet to place a bet when I was young. A mistake was made by ironing the ticket but if the other details are still intact then I bet the PCSO could still track that it's a legitimate winning ticket from their records. Sometimes it's just a matter of fixing it in a different way but it seems like PCSO doesn't really want to give the prize money to him. He still has the ticket and it should be enough proof that he made the bet and PCSO would just need to confirm it by searching their system. I think it's also worth it because even though it took long, at least now we know there will be people who are willing to help out to solve the case.",

What kind of justice system is that?I have followed this story and the high court is right in presenting the decision to award the prize based on the article provided by OPQuoteThe High Court also explained that the circumstances surrounding the fact that Mendoza won the lotto were clearly established. Despite the RTC and CA’s characterization of Mendoza’s evidence as secondary, the SC said “secondary evidence may be resorted to when the original document is unavailable.”Hence the secondary evidence pointed him to be the winner and besides no other came forward to claim the prize only him, It is a total injustice if he is deprived of the prize when there is a piece of physical evidence presented although partly damaged, this is a landmark case and the court have uphold justice that the winner deserves his prize, the winner suffers a lot and its not good to go to another hardship all through his life by having his appeal denied.",

In overall, many company wants to don't give away prize if they have legal right to keep it but in this case, I can't blame company for what they did because ticket was really damaged and this is something that ticket owner has to take care. Btw I am happy that ticket owner won it finally. Yes, nine 9 years have passed and inflation has eaten some of his money but still it's better than nothing. This lesson will teach ticket owner to take care of everything that he holds.",

And it’s a good thing that it is earning interest.Also. it is not worthy just for his own interest. He made awareness for other people that it is possible to win those kund of cases. Now the PCSO cannot fool or scare people that it wont be possible to calim winnings when lotto tickets are altered accidentally. It's commendable that he unintentionally used his situation to raise awareness and potentially help others facing similar challenges. Not luke its a good thing that it took him 6years to win the case. Sometimes, the impact goes beyond the individual case, creating positive changes or awareness in the system. Happy for him.",

Both side have basis on their stand but I really like the decision of SC to release the prize since no one it that year while there’s already an announcement that 1 person win that time. Lottery prize has only 1 year to claim while no one claim that time aside from that person who has damage ticket. PCSO can make this issue short if they will just use logic on rewarding the prize yet the higher ups in there probably taking their time so that they can claim the prize once the winner get tired on claiming.If I’m with the same situation. Of course I will do the same since I knew myself that I’m the winner and I know that no one will claim aside me.",

The equivalent of the money then and now is far very different, but the most important aspect of it, is that he got his money back. It's not like the money isn't fiat. However, the whole story is heartwarming, they is more to learn from it; don't give the gambling house a chance to eat your money. Isn't they an electronic way for the lotto company to trace his winning and pay him, without causing all the stress of having to take a legal proceed.  I don't know if the annual interest added to him would be enough to cover for the funds he spent, following the case for 9 years. Yet, I'm impressed to see he won his money back. Everything do happen for a special reason. Today he'll control the money and use it for other things. And replenish all he's lost in the process. Personally, If I have the resources like the man, I'd follow up the money till the better end. No need to let it slide. And remain in the pains of the past forever. The whole story sounds like they naturally helped him save his money for 9 years. As that duration is quite a very long time, that not everyone would stay without moving on to the next level. The battle between gamblers and casinos never ends. A misunderstanding follows the big wins. Causing the gambler lots of damages; emotionally and mentally. The man is indeed strong enough to withstand the disappointment. Some would call it a misfortune and blame it on their daughters. Which would leave the family in chaos for a long time.",

However, the ticket was blackened instead. The only remaining visible details were:The first two digits of the three bet combinationsThe outlet from which the ticket was boughtDraw dateDate of purchasePartially, the time the ticket was purchasedI've done this accidentally on one of my tickets as well. Luckily we have all electronic system now so i wouldn't even need the ticket.Quote from: coin-investor on November 20, 2023, 01:12:09 PM-cut-My questions are :Do you think it's worth the wait, he's getting 6% interest per annum but he still has to pay a lot of money and suffers a lot even to the point of having a rift with his daughterWill you do the same thing and fight for your rights to claim the prizehttps://www.rappler.com/nation/give-lotto-winner-damaged-ticket-million-prize-supreme-court-orders-pcso/https://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/classified-odd/10/10/14/winning-lotto-ticket-burned-flat-ironhttps://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2023/10/26/pcso-lotto-winner-damaged-ticket-12-million-prize.htmlIt's never good to have a rift with your kids, but i have really hard for me to believe that rift hapened only because of this.And i am confused. Wouldn't the loser of the case need to cover all the expenses for the trials?Mendoza was clearly wronged and eligible for the prize money. Imagine him not fighting for it. That could leave some self-esteem issues for life.",
