Quick heads up—I've got my hands on a BC.Game clone script, and if you've ever thought about starting your own online casino, this might be your golden ticket.Here's the deal:Test Drive the Action: I've got a live demo of the casino with logins for you to check out the 12 original games—Limbo, Crash, Dice, Coinflip, Keno, Mines, Wheels, Ring of Fortune, Roulette, Sword, Cave of Plunder, and Plinko. Wanna see the admin panel too? I've got a video ready to roll. Just DM me, and I'll share the live demo link privately. I cannot share the live link here due to security issues.

No fuss, no muss.Extra Options: While it doesn't include slots, we've got an option to integrate 1000+ casino games through our API. Interested? There might be some extra costs, but it's there if you want it.Rest assured, this is not a scam or fake.No pressure, no hard sell.

Quick heads up—I've got my hands on a BC.Game clone script, and if you've ever thought about starting your own online casino, this might be your golden ticket.I highly doubt someone will be interested on purchasing your script given the fact that BC.Game reputation here is already questionable due to their multiple open scam accusation that is still unanswered. Starting a casino that similar to a script of untrustworthy casino is a bad start for business because user will connect you to BC.Game. Maybe you are not aware on what’s hoing on BC.Game here but you can refer this post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5473729.msg63144313#msg63144313 by @holydarkness that summarized it.",

Well, guess what? That's exactly what I've got – a chance for someone with a vision.Now, here's the real talk – I'm not here to pressure anyone into buying. I just thought, \"Hey, I've got this script, maybe someone out there is interested.\" If that's not you, no worries!Changing the design is a breeze.

I myself as a dev don't even know the limits of what a \"copy\" can be described as really and at what point does it become your \"original\". Heck, even without considering that, just identifying that the script you use for that casino is a modification of theirs is enough to land you in a lawsuit.",

Because, open source involves some serious risks. There can be security loopholes or code structure may be not in good quality. Moreover, in open source as well you need to hire expert blockchain consultants for completing the full game. Many companies have addressed this issues and developed their own clone script that can be helpful for game visionaries. There is a readymade system available infront of you. No need for touching any technical infrastructure development.If you are interested in learning more about this, DM me or request a demo on our official website. Here, I'm representing is my company iMeta Technologies. P.S - We are giving with full source code as well.",
