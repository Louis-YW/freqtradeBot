  "content": "There are lots of things as citizens that we've enjoyed especially when it comes to essential things that government of our various countries have subsidize.For some countries, government has helped in subsidizing food production, electricity, education,  transportation, health care services etc.This subsidy goes ahead in reducing financial burden on the citizens. for some it is one way the government has helped them directly, because government gives them grants to support their businesses.So I ask, what will happen if the government remove subsidy from some of the essential things that they helped citizens to subsidize, for example, fuel, electricity, food production, health care services etc.Because I leave in a country, where the subsidy for PMS(petrol) has been removed, and almost immediately, the citizens are feeling the effect of the petrol subsidy removal.The shocker this singler act has sent to the  spine of the economy of my country is second to none.At this point, I've realised that, subsidy is one gloomy light that shouldn't be dimmed further  by any government.Cause what other better ways can the citizens benefit from her government if subsidy is taken off from those essentials that directly touch the standard of living of the citizens. What do you think? Is government removal of subsidy from essentials products, services at this period of economic hardship people are facing the best policy a  government can embark on in the process of building her dwindling economy?",

That is the case in Nigeria right now.Also, the government's approach to subsidy should be dynamic depending on how progressive or regressive the economy and government finances are. If static and delayed for too long before acting, it would cause damage more than what they were intending to solve initially by it.",

It is the government thet is corrupt and not the process of subsidizing these essential products. Removing subsidies is causing so much hardship and some businesses have closed down. While many people have been pushed down to abject poverty. What the government would have done was to identify these avenues of corruption and deal with them. Loopholes and financial leakages should be identified and standard financial and accountability strategies should be put in place. The painful part of it is that the funds saved from the removal of subsidies will still be looted by these corrupt government officials.

If the saved funds will be used to build basic infrastructure that will lead to development, then it is good. But if the money will be misappropriated and stolen by corrupt government officials, subsidies should continue. In some countries, subsidized goods or services are the only benefits they get from their government.",

In case you don't know many developed nations subsidy many products to help people live a good life. And these nations make the process transparent and void of corruption. You don't need to \"throw away the baby with the water, you keep the baby and throw away the bathing water\". My point is clear @EarnOnVictor tackle corruption and leave subsidy. If your sole reason for removing subsidy is because of corruption, then it's not good. What happens to the people that benefit from it? If the government wants to stop subsidy because it cannot be sustained due to a fall in revenue or economic challenge, it's a better reason. Now the question you will ask yourself is that who is making the subsidy process corrupt? It is still the government. The money saved from subsidy will be shared among state governors through the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission and most of these funds will go to private pockets. If the government makes the fuel subsidy process transparent, it will alleviate the suffering of the masses.",

However in my opinion government shouldn't spent the more money on subsidy than on more long term thing like education and health. The more possible way may limit the subsidy, so the government could only subsidize petrol for commercial truck that are used for distribution, and public transportation so the price of other product wouldn't be affected.",

Because in your country they have subsidy to give from the Petrol to give to it's citizens, but in my country there's none plus the cost of the petrol is increasing fast due to inflation rate that affected the Petrol. Of course it gives a negative impact to the people especially to the people who needs petrol for their motor vehicle for their work. Imagine you working to provide for your needs and the little help the government could give were taken away? Nah one thing that first come to my mind in this kind of situations are corruption.QuoteWhat do you think?

As long as those money that were taken away from the subsidy would be use wisely to improve the country. I know that they are having a hard time to determine where to focus investing their money in any country. For example in my country which is PH, they invested at skyway and new railroads since one of the major problems here is traffic. Of course due to those investment there would be a hard time to provide the subsidy for the people. Maybe if there's no corrupt officials maybe losing subsidy despite of investing to any other projects, subsidy would still exist.",

I'm generally against the government picking industries to subsidize with tax payer money unless there's a benefit to every single citizen (and of course, there's no way to determine the \"winners\".)The energy sector and agriculture sector provide a net benefit to every citizen, those are acceptable. But the types of subsidies matter as I've seen government provide subsidies to green energy companies, to the tune of billions, only for those companies to go bankrupt a short few years later. And the companies that get these subsidies are often political donors. It's not necessarily corruption, but it isn't fair for the citizens to have to bear the cost of a politicians political favors either.",

To a certain extent, a government that has limited resources but is all too willing to provide subsidies left and right is an incompetent and lazy government. It's a government that's not creative or innovative enough, a government that doesn't study, analyze, and look for other ways and means to improve certain conditions. Subsidies are dole-outs. They're a band-aid solution. They're not sustainable. Money put into subsidy is most often money that is wasted. In my country, subsidy is quickly considered as a response more often than it should be. A rising price of rice, subsidy. A rising fuel price, subsidy. A rising transportation cost, subsidy. Onion price rising, subsidy. Poor families, subsidy. Retirement benefits and pension, subsidy. It's subsidy everywhere. It's not even counting the huge tax subsidies that it also provides to companies and businesses. Almost all departments in the governments are now providing subsidies.
