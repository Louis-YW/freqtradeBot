But investing in bitcoin is not simply buying to make a profit, there are many things you need to learn. As a newbie, you should spend a lot of time learning about bitcoin, especially how to protect bitcoin. I'm curious where did you store your bitcoins? Is it on an exchange?",

Your awareness of the importance of long-term investment using bitcoin will give you confidence that bitcoin will be better than now. Never panic when the price is still not right, you also need to prepare reserves to make repurchases when the price starts to collapse or fall to the bottom of the price, that will be better because it will give you more bitcoins. in the next 20 years it will be an investment that gives you a lot of profit. You also have to determine up to what price limit you will take profit.",

One can start that $150.00 and start investing to hold up to 5-7% into their overall portfolio. While this is a high risk to some, in the long run, believing in your investment will be good for your future. Bitcoin can be trusted overall and there are no banks needed nor waiting periods for a transaction.",

Let me know what you think about it in the comments below:Bitcoin's community should start to think positively about cryptocurrencies and technology.

How can we embrace the idea of cryptocurrency so that it's easy to have financial independence and a way to exchange information and data without worrying about financial risk?
