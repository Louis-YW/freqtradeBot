My question goes like thisThe next bull run that you are talking about will occur in first quarter of 2024, but the bull run will occur some months after. Do not expect bull run immediately after halving, although it might also begin like that. I just know that 2024/2025 would be for the bulls.Quote from: Sim_card on July 13, 2023, 06:46:21 AM1. What price do you think that bitcoin will hit in the next ATH.I guess the price would be between $120000 to $170000.Quote from: Sim_card on July 13, 2023, 06:46:21 AM2.

If the bear market is about to begin, it is what we are going to likely discuss on this forum just as we guessed 2022 bear market correctly.",

According to the last ATH as captured and recorded by various chart readers and exchanges, it was $69,045.00, and as such, any price above $69,045.00 is already considered to be any ATH. $69,050.00 is a new ATH. So if you ask me what price I expect to see BTC at in the next ATH, I will say any figure added to what it was previously recorded for. But if what's my maximum price expectation for Bitcoin to record after breaking the ATH is in the range of $70,000–$100,000, those are the possible achievable figures for me, which won't take place anytime soon, maybe 2024 after the halving or at the end of the halving year.Quote2. When do you plan to sell and make good profit from your bitcoin portfolio,is it next bull season or the next two bull market,because bitcoin price is always tempting during the bull run. Give me your target price that you will be happy to sell off your bitcoin.Let's discuss.I'm not being too greedy, but I don't even have any take-profit plans yet, but I will definitely sell off my holdings if I have any when I see it hit a new ATH, even if it takes just one bull run to do that. But that won't stop me from refilling my bag after I have taken a profit; I will wait for the right time to enter the market again.",

Yes, when will it come to be very accurate when it will come, it's still just predictions if you read the news and see people's comments and for the new ATH BTC, I don't think the jump is too far from the previous ATH.",

Give me your target price that you will be happy to sell off your bitcoin.To be honest, I do not have any plans to sell the coins. I don’t want to sell them because bitcoins are very rare and limited in number. Hence, I don’t want to sell something that is limited in numbers and whose price is also increasing day by day. I am investing in bitcoin for the long term. So as long as I don’t need any emergency funds, I will keep holding the bitcoins. I know the true potential of bitcoins, so I will continue accumulating them and holding them for as long as I can. I do not have a price target.",

Some of them are still trying to hold on in a few years, of course expecting ATH to return again, but for those who have bought at an average price of $16K - $20K then it already has a profit, it's just a little but it's better to hold on in 1 year, it's possible that the price will spike after approaching the halving.I also now have a plan where I will sell several stages and not all at once, because we never know what the peak price of ATH will be, above $100K start selling which has been determined from 10% to 40% and the rest will wait for another increase, considering that many people say in speculation that the highest peak will be $160K it could be touching there but we still have 60% bitcoin when the price is $160K it still benefits more.",

Many people will target a certain price increase, others hoping that the price doubles, but one thing that should be remembered is that there is life after the bull run and ATH. You do not have to sell off all your bitcoins because you have met a target you set. Still keep bitcoins to hold for the future after the ATH.",

Give me your target price that you will be happy to sell off your bitcoin.Let's discuss.If your going to see the Bitcoin halving timeline there was a really huge leap in the market price of Bitcoin up to 1000x is possible seeing the price from 2$ - 1000$ happened, I guess we can safely say that the price all-time high could easily be up to a million dollars in the next bull run, But you can say that x2 up to 120-150k$ is a safer bet since there are still a lot of things that affect the price of bitcoin and getting that huge amount of money into bitcoin is huge.For sure bitcoin investment could give us a bitcoin amount of profit, we all surely invest to make a profit, there are investors who just plan to sell their investment in the short term probably daily traders but still, it wasn't really bad if you're going to compare it too long term investors for sure it might be an even higher profit but it would still depend. The main goal is the bull run since it's the main cycle of the market and the opposite of a bear market, we could easily accumulate bitcoin on the bear market and then sell it later on the bull run, as well as we have a lot of room to HODL and wait for a more riskier opportunity. x2 profit is fine already but If I accum accumulate enough I have more room to wait for a higher market price to sell, probably around 200k.",
