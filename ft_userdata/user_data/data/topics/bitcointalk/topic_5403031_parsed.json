All investment sites that promise to double your investment are all scams there is no legit one. And this thread must be moved under service discussion.If you don't own this website I suggest edit your thread and remove the https:// so that the website won't get any backlinks here on the forum. If not then you are helping the website to promote and rank up on SERP.",

      "body": "The site isn't opening for me, seems there is an error message when I open the site. So can't read any info about that site and not many reviews exist online. As BitMaxz said if the site offers double money then definitely a scam. If you are not shilling and just curious about that site, then stay away. Offer double money means simply scam. Doesn't necessary further investigation. Don't be greedy and don't lose your money.",

      "body": "I dont know how you find this website and how can you say that it needs investment or what it offers because the site has basically no information of how it works. It only has login page and forgot page since registration page doesn't work. Plus, the website is using the logo of USDT which probably it's not affiliated and it's against the laws as trademark infringement. So, better to stay away to avoid any future issues.",
