  "content": "Hello everyone.My first experience with cryptocurrency was with a popular bitcoin faucet known as freebitco.in.A trusted site for years at this point, they utilize many forms of authentication technology, provable mechanics in all their games (not just the multiply game but on dplay and stuff too), and they are one of if not the largest distributors of free digital gold in the world.They have a great business model too, especially if it has been running for the amount of time it has.My question is, does provably fair technology exists specifically because of crypto gambling or is it something else?Thank you so much for answering <3 everyone, I learned a lot !",

Provably fair technology was created as a solution to the trust problems faced by players in conventional online gambling platforms. It primarily uses cryptographic algorithms to produce random results that players can independently verify. To my knowledge, the first platforms to adopt this concept were simple blockchain-based games, such as SatoshiDICE.",

When a new Casino is launched then people will ask if they could trust it with their funds and the game is not rigged then that's where the provably fsir technology come.

Some users even can code this on Python so it is not anymore time consuming activity to compare bet results on casino.",

As it is new, most gamblers don’t know about it yet. The technology is primarily used in bitcoin or crypto casinos and games. To define it, provably fair is an algorithm that checks and verifies an online casino’s fairness towards its players. It relinquishes the fear of most players that online gambling sites will rip them off.So provably fair technology created because of the need of transparency  and fair system in the gambling industry.[1] https://worldfinancialreview.com/what-does-provably-fair-mean-for-crypto-casinos/",

To be honest with you, I did not know that FIAT casinos actually also made sure to be provably fair, I thought their used their license somehow and gamblers were supposed to trust their games. I thought this way because the term \"don't trust, verify\" it is prominent here in the Bitcoin community and ecosystem.",

Thus, the outcomes of the game may be checked by the participants to ensure that they are legitimate.In 2012, a basic dice game called Satoshi Dice was developed on the Bitcoin blockchain and marked the first use of this technology in the online gambling industry.

Blockchain is responsible for that:Quote Games are built using blockchain technology, making them transparent and ensuring integrity with robust encryption.QuoteProvably Fair Games are so-called because they give players the ability to verify the fairness of their bets. It means that an online casino can’t cheat a player because the outcome of the game is provable, transparent and verifiable.They are built on open-source algorithms and run on smart contracts platforms, which makes it impossible for any online gambling sites to modify or alter the game outcomes. Games on these smart contracts are handled by programming code, which means that there’s no chance for a casino to change the result of the bet.Source: Glossary of Provably Fair Games – how does it work?Basically, with provably fair technology the casino is no longer in complete control of the outcome. This is why provably fair casinos are better than traditional ones... With provably fair games you can always check the fairness. If you really want to learn about it there are many articles and blogs about provably fair technology. One of the good ones is this one: Provably fair explained.Quote from: slapper on February 05, 2023, 05:00:32 AMBefore before, it was hard to tell whether an online gambling site was legitimate or not, therefore many people avoided using them.Before, and now for many traditional casinos and games, it was impossible to verify the fairness of the game.",
