      "body": "I have some other sort of theory.Back when they announced working with Blockchain Analysis companies, I suspected our privacy was slowly vanishing away while corporations and officials get to launder money legally.  How hard is it really to bribe Blockchain Analysis into pretending your UTXO's are 'legitimate' and always give them a green check.If only 'legitimate' Bitcoin is going through their Joins.  Then companies always get a green check.  Politicians in some countries are known for bribing and accepting bribe.  So silently offer them a few millions to move your billions.  How do I know they are going to deny such an offer.They can do this without even bribing.  Infiltrate the right people in Blockchain Analysis, get them to overtake leadership in a matter of years and now you got your own people saying yes or no to your transactions.  What if the right people actually already work at Blockchain Analysis.Then some transactions may be censored for other reasons that got nothing to do with criminal activity.  As of now, Russians are being actively censored everywhere around the world.  Is it normal for Blockchain Analysis to give red X marks to Russian transactions in support for Ukraine?  It is already happening anyway.  If you are from Russia you get no more ad revenue from big corporations.  Or you can not play sports supporting your nationality.  I rather remain neutral about the war in Ukraine.  But many of these people have nothing to do with the war.  And if we apply censorship, there are so many ways this can go wrong.  Including using Blockchain Analysis to accept or deny transactions.Or, you are Donald Trump.  And some body pays good amounts of money to Blockchain Analysis in order to block his Bitcoin transactions because his opposition wants so.Or, CIA tells Blockchain Analysis to block my UTXO's for classified information they have on me.  The actual purpose is they found I was trying to earn my Privacy, so they are trying to insert an obstacle and make it harder for me.  But would Blockchain Analysis oppose an order from an authority like CIA?  Big doubts.Fuck this shit.  This is the thing about checking for legitimacy of an action.  Think of it like borders and trafficking.  Some borders accept bribe and give criminals a green check and then you, as an innocent, get your car checked cautiously for what ever you may have on you.  I am going to keep my point of view.  Monero is still allowed to exist just because people on top of the system get to benefit from it.  Coin Join has become an uncertainty for us, average human beings, because Blockchain Analysis gives only particular people a green check for the transaction.  People on top of the system can easily get to benefit from it.-Regards,PrivacyG",
