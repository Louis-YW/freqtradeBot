      "body": "With such legacy client (older than Bitcoin-Qt 0.8), you can't even perform full blockchain sync. But answering your question, any HTTP application or library which support sending user-definited JSON data should work. cURL might work, but i doubt about  HTTP/GET since cURL example on Bitcoin Core always use POST.",

      "body": "Really appreciate your comments:Oddly HTTP delivers the best success.I get 401, 404, 405 errors and think my issues are about structuring the statement correctly, my HTTP scripting knowledge is poor at best, and information seems thinner than my hairline.http://user:password@127.0.0.1:8332/ came afterwards, I have a password which appears to login with any rpcusername, as implied by Satoshi earliest rpc server but the URL returns malformed error for HTTP/GET? statements also had browser issues simply not wanting to play but think that is solved.Any idea how an HTTP POST would have be structured in this period, examples may be a big help ...  just your best guess?thx",

THX!immediately I took a step forward again, just not there yet, defo valid password, double quotes no single !!! @json.txt !!! yes all in the detail, got it.... more testing and playing and learning to do...I also get 'Warning: Couldn't read data from file \"json.txt\", this makes an empty POST.' as well but might have some ideas there..any other finds? , the valid password ( is a 20 byte, 40 char hex string supplied in .upper()) also resolved using decodescript to an address.. but I think I am looking for a MD5 hash, almost as if it was a --Digest-Auth hash but Bitcoin stuck to Basic?..... the hunt continues...",
