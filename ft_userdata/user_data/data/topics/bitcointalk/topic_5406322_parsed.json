  "content": "Gm crypto fam, these past few weeks we’ve seen a huge wipeout and the market is chaotic, but, it's also an opportunity to determine which projects are here for the long run. One of my favorites right now is Maya Protocol, on the last quarter they updated their proposal,  participated on big events, maintained their community strong and even acquired extra funding. They are planing to release their first token [$CACAO] later this year and I am extremely excited about it, their rewards for node operators and liquidity providers are one of the bests i've seen.For more info you can look it up on their official channels:https://linktr.ee/mayaprotocol",
