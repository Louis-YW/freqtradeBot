  "content": "Alik Bakhshi Russian world order          On the Internet, on my article “Who are they Rashists” (1), a certain Russian supporter of Putin in a comment quite frankly explained the need for wars, through which Russia seized the lands of other peoples:“If you are at least superficially familiar with world history, you should know that wars between the so-called civilized peoples and tribes of small peoples were always and everywhere. Why do you blame only Russia for this?Moreover, these accusations are completely unfair. Russia was forced to wage these wars because these small and such peace-loving peoples constantly raided the Russian outskirts, killed, robbed, took Russian people into captivity and then sold them in the slave markets of the settlements of such \"nice and peace-loving\" highlanders. Europeans were not attacked by small nations. The Europeans themselves traveled \"to distant seas\" to find and rob these peoples. And after that you are indignant at the aggressiveness of Russia, but calmly perceive the aggressiveness of the Europeans. Is it fair?”    A small clarification, not the highlanders of the Caucasus descended from the mountains, but the Russians came to them in the mountains and by no means with bread and salt. (2)        The commentary presents the great-power worldview of the Russian people, and Putin is a sought-after conductor who embodies this worldview. How can one not recall the well-known expression of Count Joseph de Maistre from 1811, \"Every people has the government that it deserves.\" Remarkably, the count meant precisely the Russian people.       I have included the full text of the comment. What an exact justification for the Evil emanating from Russia and its people! The trouble with the Russian people is that they live not according to the law, but according to justice, and everyone has their own justice, while the law is for everyone. The law in Russia, according to the well-known saying, that drawbar: where you turn, it went there. In this “justice”, which justifies the war in order to conquer another people, the denseness of the Russian view of the world order looms, and the Russian people live in the past, not keeping pace with the development of civilization. What Putin is doing today is essentially the steps of Hitler. (3) Having discarded the imperial ideology, the peoples of Germany and Japan have achieved tremendous success, leaving the victorious country Russia far behind. The peoples of Europe realized that prosperity must be sought not in conquering a neighbor, but in free labor. Today, borders in Europe are not an obstacle and, being only symbolic, ensure prosperity and peaceful coexistence.    Colonialism for European countries is the last century. Russia, as it lagged behind the West by 150-200 years, continues to lag behind without narrowing this gap in the least, and no war will help this gap. In our time, it is not the presence of colonies in a country that determines the well-being of its people, but the ability of the people to work rationally in conditions of freedom, under the protection of laws that are equal for all citizens without exception. A striking example of this is Switzerland, a country that never had colonies. Once, while in Switzerland, I watched a farmer mow the grass, wiping his sweaty forehead. But he could, if he wanted to, hire an emigrant, but immediately thought if the farmers hired emigrants instead of themselves, then Switzerland would certainly become similar to some African country. I have seen how Swiss cheese makers and glassblowers work, but I have never seen emigrants among them. You can't build a country with someone else's hands. Or did Holland, a former colonial power, become impoverished with the loss of its colonies? Of course, the national mentality plays an important role here. If in the West the well-being of a neighbor causes a desire to achieve it, then in a Russian it causes an irresistible desire to destroy. I always refer to the experience of Finland, once the former provincial colony of Russia, in which the miserable Chukhons lived. But as soon as the Finns achieved freedom from the Russians, as a country that has no oil, no gas, no gold, there is nothing at all that Russia is rich in, except for the people who know how to work, it became the first country in terms of welfare. The Finns cherished this freedom, and when in 1939 the Russians treacherously attacked Finland in order to return the Finns to their empire, the whole people, including women, stood up as an insurmountable wall for the invaders. Today, a similar situation is observed in Ukraine.     Russians with their \"Russian world\" bring devastation and decline. One of the reasons that prompted the Russians to attack Ukraine was to prevent Ukrainians from getting better lives. The same reason lies in Russia's threats to the former Baltic colonies. Azerbaijan, which became independent and, as a result, got the opportunity to manage its natural resources, has achieved a lot in the field of economic development, and Baku has become a beautiful city that embodies the spirit of East and West. One must think that the countries of the former Russian Central Asia are not eager to return to the bosom of the empire. Today, Russia with its “Russian world”, which the revanchist Putin wants to reproduce again in the former colonies, is shying away like the plague. The \"Russian world order\" that Putin wants to present as something new is actually a return to the past.1. Who are they rashists. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/38049.html2.

Ukraine would rather be imperialized by the U.S. than they would Russia in retrospect, wouldn't they?By 'imperialism', I mean what the standard meaning of imperialism really is - https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=imperialism+meaning.Ukraine is a country that is divided. You can tell by the millions of people who fled the war, because they couldn't keep US imperialism from turning her into a war machine.The US Civil War is what paved its way towards imperialism. Then, in the early 1900s the Federal Reserve Bank was set in place without the people even realizing what happened. This was the beginning of the real US imperialism. Over the years, millions of Americans have died because of the banking imperialism... through loan foreclosures and other things the banks do.In Britain the same thing has happened. But the start of the people to move against imperialism there, began with the Magna Carta, first created in 1215, and updated several times in the following hundreds of years to the present. The Magna Carta is the only thing that is keeping freedom for the people in Britain right now, and it is gradually being replaced by banking imperialism, and the ignorance of the people regarding how to use it. As in the US, multitudes of people have died and lost property because of the banking system.At least Russia is straight-forward in its limited amount of imperialism. The US and Britain are underhanded with their sneaky banking system approach. Banking system rule is based on quasi-contracts, one sided contracts, like when you apply for a drivers license, and sign some paperwork, without anybody in government ever signing the other part of the contract.The bottom-line point is, now it is the world banking money system imperialism that is using the US and Nato to fight Russian imperialism. The second point is that you don't even understand this.",

Russia saving people who want to be part of Russia, but Ukraine would rather kill them than let them be Russian, which many of them were for years before.Wrong again. It was Russia that wanted Crimea and Donbas territory to be part of Russia.  - When countries like Ukraine start shelling and killing their own people like they were in the Donbas, Donbas people were thankful when Russia moved in to protect them.Not the people. Russia sent its troops to both regions of Ukraine to seize control over the territory of its neighbour. - That's the way to protect the people there.If the people of Donbas did not want to live in Ukraine, they could just immigrate to Russia. - But if they want to live in Ukraine, why move to Russia? They shouldn't have to get murdered by the Ukraine military just because they want to stay on their homestead.Many Russians leave Russia today because they do not want to live in Russia, nobody is invading Russia because someof its citizens do not want to live in Russia or be part of Russia. - Right. Russia isn't killing off people in Russia. It was Ukraine that was killing off Ukrainians in Ukraine.Americans are not invading Russia 'to protect the LGBT communities or people fleeing mobilization' there, are they? - The US is using the Ukraine government to attempt to take over Russia. Don't you realize that the West already sent over $32 billion in armaments and money to Ukraine. They want the Russian land, and they are using Ukraine to attempt to get it.Ukraine and Russia both made the same big mistake. They believed US leader lies. The Ukraine has already essentially been destroyed because of the war this caused, and the world just might have to put up with WW3 because Russia listened to the US.",

Free humans neither bow down to a emperor, party, club-boss, doctrina, czar, tycoon....or be lead by any other cult figure.That's just the point. We are way past eras of colonisation or subduing a people by waging wars. That savagery has gone with the 20th century and we've been more better since then, looking out for civilised means to archiving a goal.Unfortunately, Russians live in the last century.",
