I know i can transfer to my ledger however it is not as straightforward as others and I understand I need to download something called hashgraph first?I have my HBAR on Crypto.com and to my understanding I need to send my HBAR to Hashgraph and then from there I can then send to my ledger? If someone can please confirm, thanks",

Or is the only way for me to send my HBAR from crypto.com to hashpack wallet and then to my ledger from there?According to Ledger supported cryptocurrencies information site, you can use a Ledger Live or MyHbarWallet, on MyHbarWallet you can just connect the wallet with your HW. Do note, MyHbarWallet only support Ledger Nano. In case you have another device, the only option left is to use Ledger Live. It seems HBAR is fully supported on Ledge, for full references and a how-to guide, refer to https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009833299?docs=true.",
