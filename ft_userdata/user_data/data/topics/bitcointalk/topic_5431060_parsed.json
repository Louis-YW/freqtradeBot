For example if you are using windows and connect to the internet with it, there is a good chance that it gets infected with some sort of malware/keylogger and when you use a bitcoin wallet you can lose your funds (among other risks).This is why the term \"hot wallet\" exists. The solution is to use \"cold storage\" and only use your hot wallet for small amounts. Cold storage is basically an air-gap system that has never been connected to the outside world (through the internet or otherwise) and never will connect. You can use a dedicated system (like an old laptop) or use a secondary OS (even live Linux).Another way is to buy a hardware wallet and make things simple on yourself.https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html",

It is possible for your private key to be compromised despite your best efforts. It is recommended to always check out security settings when using the Electrum desktop wallet. For example, I suggest running adwcleaner, junkware removal tool, and Malwarebytes simultaneously. You should be fine if these don't pick anything up.",

By not downloading or visiting dubious resources or reading attachments that come to you from unknown sources, you provide yourself with half the protection.

It's pretty obvious you should try to avoid installing new software (especially from unverified sources) on a device which holds your wallet, don't click on/download any attachments from anyone (including your friends and family as their accounts may be compromised too). It would be better to have a separate device for your Bitcoin wallet, with limited or even completely without internet access (or better with no network card at all). Be careful when upgrading your wallet, there have been issues with that before (phishers uploading modified/backdoored versions). If you follow these simple rules you should be pretty safe.",

How do I know I'm safe and I'm not getting keystroked or my priv key isn't getting exposed?If you have concerns that your computer is infected, you should back up your critical data and wipe your machine with a newly installed OS.  But, I agree that you shouldn't install and use a desktop wallet on a machine you don't trust, even if it is a low-value hot wallet.If you're in the habit of downloading cracked software, especially games, or browsing websites of questionable morality, then you're likely to encounter malware at some point.  You can always isolate those types of activities by using a different machine or an isolated VM.  Quote from: cryptoliquor on December 23, 2022, 03:22:32 AMIs there somewhere I can check on my security settings or am I just being overly paranoid?Many malware are designed to hide from virus scanners and other other anti-malware measures.  The best thing you can do is be diligent and avoid any unsafe behavior on a machine which is used for bitcoin.Quote from: cryptoliquor on December 23, 2022, 03:22:32 AMI am trying out electrum but I am not 100% sure I can trust a desktop wallet.  Electrum can be used many different ways, the software itself is safe.  The security of your coins is largely dependent on how you use the software.  As others have mentioned you should only use it for small amounts, as a hot wallet when installed on an internet-connected device.  If you have a hardware wallet, you can use Electrum to manage those wallets by creating a wallet that requires the hardware wallet to sign transactions.  If you install Electrum on an air-gapped machine, it's great for creating cold-storage seeds, that are about as safe as you can get.",
