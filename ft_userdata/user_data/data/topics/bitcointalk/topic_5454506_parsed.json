The league has been national, single-table except for a period from 1949 to 1968 in which it was regionalized into two North and South groups. Since 1984 it has been organized by the Liga Nacional de FÃºtbol Profesional.Granada has successfully won LaLiga 2 for the 2022/2023 season and has the opportunity to move up to LaLiga 1, according to Wikipedia, the most current LaLiga 2 champions are Real Murcia with 8 wins in La Liga 2.SOURCE--This topic is for any news related to Segunda Division (LaLiga 2).

      "body": "granada is a team that was in the league so it was expected that they would be able to return, but what leaves me most shocked is to see that alaves, the east, Eibar have not managed to stay in the second position, these teams that have already been in the league recently they should have more ability to return to the main league, but what you see is that they are not with much difference in relation to the teams that did not reach the league recently, for example las palmas is a team that has not been in the league recently, but La Palma does very well playing against those teams that I mentioned, I'm talking about the last games, La Palma didn't lose in their last game against Levante, against Alaves, against Eibarso you see that the fact that a team is in the main league does not make it very strong in relation to the second division team, it is true that when a team is relegated, it loses most of its squad because nobody likes to play in the second division. Anyway, I don't see much potential at Granada or La Palma, so I see that they will be relegated from La Liga next season. the only way to not be relegated next season would be if they managed to make a lot of financial investment in the team, they would have to buy a lot of good players and not make the old and serious mistake of dismissing the coach that led them to move up in the division",
