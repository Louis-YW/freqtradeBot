Personally, I would never feel like that, because if I'm playing a lottery game or working on something which pays very decent income, I keep in mind I'm doing that because the potential rewards to be received. If I think I don't deserve to win a lottery prize or a high wage, why am I gambling on the lottery and working, then? For me that is the kind of syndrome which doesn't make much sense.The main symptom I see from big winners is the fact they get too compulsive over the prize won, so they start spending it without planning carefully their financial plans for the long term. So they tend to waste all the money in a very short period of time with travels, expensive gifts, luxurious superfluous items and accessories they don't need.",

I was an early investor so I profited quite a lot from the boom, not to mention I went to the path of expanding instead of saving up. It was rather big for me at the time since in the first place, when I started investing, the prices were cheap yes, but it still took around 2-3 months of saving up before I could buy one (I am so glad it was before it started growing so I had time to grow). It was hard I guess, I myself recognized I turned a tad bit too arrogant (If you can count that was what changed). What I did was distract myself. I used the money I earned to buy some stuff that can help me, specifically in my hobby of drawing. I bought a drawing tablet and a bunch of online school courses and used that as an idea that I'm just at the bottom of the barrel, at least in something. They definitely should. They should watch those ruined lottery winners. A LOT of them turned out really bad despite winning a lot of money. I was amazed at how much they could splurge really. I didn't have that impulse to spend money like water luckily, just arrogance.",

However I feel like if i won a huge amount of money in very short time without big effort certainly your brain will think that there’s something unusual is happening and mix of happiness and fair of that money can disappear easily at the same time.Chances of that to happen are rare the proof is whenever someone win big they all publish his story and name on internet because it something that happens once a while either on lottery or casino. And for what someone who is old and educated enough gets that chance he surely will think about saving half of the amount, invest some of it and spend the rest on things you wish to have before and change your life with it.Lol I wish i can get the chance and I’m so ready for the consequences or syndromes that comes after it.",

It was a sudden jump in the money that I was handling, plus I got promoted to a senior position in my job that greatly increased my pay. It was, at first, tough to handle the inflow of money since I wasn’t so used to it. I splurged and spent like there’s no tomorrow, until such time that I realized that it’s something that might be gone in a moment’s notice and that I should be careful in my spending. Thankfully, when I started to gamble, I already know how to handle my wins. I managed to use what I gained on my previous wins for my next sessions, until it became a habit that I will not deposit unless I have run my funds dry in my gambling account.",

Personally to me, I already experienced receiving a huge amount of money lots of time times way back several years ago. The feeling is, I am able to spend freely without worrying about my personal financial status. Although my regular spending becomes noticeably increased, I didn't turn into a sh*t person that always does unnecessary buying of anything. I was able to build our own house even during the pandemic, able to purchase a family car, motorcycle, bike, etc. That's why even though I'm currently not that holding decent money much the way I used before, I am able to use my earned money for good.It's really up to the people how they will handle things once they are now in that situation. Doesn't really need for them to have an awareness of the said syndrome as these people will only understand being in that situation once they personally experience it on actual.",

While it's normal to hear the comment that he/she would share with us his/her winnings, it is ironic that it's also perhaps equally normal to hear the comment that he/she would quietly leave the place and settle somewhere far where nobody knows him/her.I guess the latter is some kind of proof that becoming rich all of a sudden might indeed isolate somebody.

For example, someone who is just earning like $100 every month maybe gets to win $1 million in a stretch while having not even made up to $200 at once in their life. I think the best way to handle it is just to be yourself and think positively about how you can improve yourself towards becoming a better person that is living on top of wealth that will be unending, because if the funds are misused, the person will still go back to not having anything meaningful while they had the opportunity to be rich. Perhaps if it's some one that was bragging and isolating himself or herself for their friends, he or she would still have to come back to them again after exhausting all the money.",
