  "content": "Hey guys, I made a quick video report detailing the bitcoin ownership journey for MicroStrategy, who started as a humble business intelligence company to becoming a major stakeholder of bitcoin with a holdings portfolio close to 1% of the total bitcoin supply. I go over all of this and more within the video. Here is a timeline of major Bitcoin (BTC) purchase events in their multi decade history.TimelineIn August 2020, MicroStrategy acquired approximately 21,454 Bitcoins.In September 2020, MicroStrategy increased its Bitcoin holdings even further, acquiring 16,796 Bitcoins.In December 2020, MicroStrategy bought an additional 29,646 Bitcoins.In February 2021, MicroStrategy purchased 19,452 Bitcoins.From April to July 2023, MicroStrategy acquired 12,333 Bitcoin and now has well over 150,000+ Bitcoins and counting... You can watch the full video here where I describe each of the key events in MicroStrategy's lifespan in more detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfHKOcsC39Q",

You would think he would diversity a little and perhaps buy some ETH.I think last time he offered shares for cash and used that cash to buy more Bitcoin. Crazy. Like I said before, in 10 years time he will either be known as the best trader out there or he will be known as the worst. Hopefully he doesn’t start to scale out of these massive positions which wouldn’t be easy. Word would get out and people would copy trade him pretty much and it would be bearish.",

Not sure about buying ETH though, BTC in itself is volatile enough; adding ETH adds more unnecessary volatility in my opinion. Also taking note that I don't think Saylor is even a fan of ETH to start with lol.",

So give or take they are still even on their investment and we are currently in a bear market, during a bullrun they are the best positioned to take profits. It will be interesting to see if they truly hold for 100 years or anything close to it as they first announced.Here's a recap of their total business in Q2 of the year.",

The thing is, companies like this with a huge hoard are actually a threat to Bitcoin..... because they can decide to dump it all at once and it will cause a trigger affect in the market... with the price of Bitcoin taking a nose dive into the abyss.  We do not want huge whales, because we want a more even distribution of coins to millions of people... this will cause less volatility in the markets and the price.",

Our point of interest here is only the fact that bigger volumes bought means bigger price rise in USD and we are not following when the selling pressure is occurring from this side. They do sell but we are not taking them into account.What we should do is that buying and selling from our side should be given more importance than what they are accumulating. Rather sell when they are buying and follow your one suit about trading.Keep in mind that whales data is often not trustworthy. Take it with salt and reduce the importance you give to that.",

What unique idea you are trying to convey here. That's what i didn't get. But still, many people like me ignore the number to read and directly must have jump on the conclusions. So, keeping the number of BTC own by MS is also necessary.I have some discussion on this topic like previous weeks. And, you should also mention how much BTC he had soled and when. According to my previous discussion with members i came to know that. He sold some BTC every year in the month of December to safe himself from paying taxes. You should also discuss on that topic too. Make your topic something unique add your own experience and try to come up with different information which is not available easily.",

Retail investors are even weaker hands than institutional investors and they cause many of the price dumps because they panic and sell for any minor negative event.",
