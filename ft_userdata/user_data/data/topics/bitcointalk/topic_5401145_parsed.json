  "content": "A little bit explanation before i start. Iâ€™m using slushpool from around 2018y.From the registration and for 3 months after i used my own wallet for payments from slushpool, which were after transferred to the partners wallet in exchange of fiat.To avoid commission and fees i has been changed my own wallet in slushpool to partners wallet.Around five months ago our relationship with partner began to decline.I did request to support to change back current wallet to my own. Steps i did:I made a transfer from wallet i used at registration;I confirmed date of the registration;Only i had an access to my account, moreover I even listed all devices being authorized in the slushpool account from the first login and till now.As a result - wallet was changed back by slushpool support.One week ago i lost access to my account. Credentials was changed and my account now at third-party hands.Of course i requested a help from support. They told me to make another confirmation by using a wallet, that was being changed after i did confirmation as an owner of slushpool account five months ago.Another way to confirm is to change worker name, but this is impossible dye to some technical aspects.I would like to understand how it is possible to pass verification, confirm your rights, so that later slushpool will transfer your property to third parties without trials and notifications?",

But as i already said, i confirmed my rights 5 months ago. Nobody except me used this account. When i wrote - 3 months after registration i used my own wallet, means i got payouts on my own wallet for this period.",

It's impossible to change worker name or direct HR from one worker to another, because everyone need to update their firmware. It's thousand of clients and yes, in a 3-6 months this problem will be resolved. This thread is only about - how Slushpool can give your account to their partners if they will request it.",
