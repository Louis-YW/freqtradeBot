      "body": "After reading your text I thought CZ was trying to liquidate another exchange. But there it talks about them exiting FTX capital and now they are liquidating all FTT tokens on their books. What kind of FTX liquidation are we talking about? Apparently, to have no business with the FTX exchange, they are selling off any assets that may have a connection to their closest competitor. No strong impact, the exchange itself can safely buy its tokens back in order to keep the price and supply stable.",

      "body": "Probably FTX is trying to make pressure to CZ to liquidate his holdings on FTX so they can fully control their platform without having any support from it’s competitor. FTX is growing faster than expected and they are willing to buy that from CZ, not sure though for the real reason let’s see if CZ will do it and if he will disclose the reason behind this. I don’t expect any big impact for this because this is just a two companies dealing for their own interest.",

Many people are thinking that Sam will be the second Dokwon, but that will never happen, I think this is just FUD nothing too serious. Personally I also hold FTT and I will buy more of them if CZ really dumps.Everyone knows that FTX is Binance's biggest competitor, obviously this is a competition between two big players in the industry and it's an opportunity, not a disaster like luna.",

A part of it if SBF was also doing something wrong like try to support politician. SBF shall remain neutral rather than try to do that. CZ may started to feel disbelief with SBF. CZ will sell FTT and this will bring the price of FTT to go down again. Glad i never try to buy FTT. This token doesn't look good at all. I don't like the way alameda dominating everything by spreading the money acquired from FTX. This VC just like has unlimited money to invest in the various crypto. FTT doesn't have good liquidity anymore. Crypto red will be coming very soon.",

I wish he gave a clue on this matter, so at least we will have an idea of what is happening behind the curtains. Two monster exchange companies throwing haymakers at each other, IMO this is a good sign that something better will come out. He continued, \"whether this is a move against a competitor, it is not\". I doubt that.CZ may have been honest with some of his tweets but he is also the one who sees the numbers in his company. If it spikes down, something must be done.",

CZ already indicated that he has initiated the process of liquidating his FTT, see the tweet from SBF in response to it;BNB is also threatened right now, what if SBF goes ahead and dumps all their BNB in the market? Is CZ really doing what is best for the community or this is really a result of personal feud between the two of them?The fact that this is still a progressing case, and we have not seen the end give me chills.https://medium.com/@coinzone/the-feud-binance-ceo-cz-liquidating-ftt-ftx-ceo-sbf-liquidating-bnb-cc4fb5974fc0",

FTX may very well be solvent and there might not be any problems at all. However, after the recent collapse of Celsius and others I wouldn’t want to take any chances. I’d move those funds over to BTC and off of the exchange just in case the worst does happen. Better to be safe than sorry.",

They even argued and attacked each other seriously on social media about that.I don't believe CZ and Binance have enough power to liquidate FTT. It's a rumor, a drama and that's all.
