  "content": "I promise you that once you realise that nothing belongs to you or to your self, you will love being humble.* We brag about our bodies, our homes, our property, our finances, our spouses, our partners, our kids, our parents, and everything else. But it comes to an end. Boasting! If you really think about it, you'll realise that we don't own any of those items. They are solely available to us in order to lessen the required restrictions of our stay here. (Earth)** Even if you purchase a piece of property or a home, you will only have paid rent for the time you are still on Earth. None of them are yours.* If you purchase a car, you have only paid for transportation for the duration that the car or you will last. You are not the owner of it.* If you marry your spouse, you only have each other until things fall apart or you pass away. One does not possess the other.* If you have offspring, you have only satisfied the requirement for life to continue until death. You do not possess them. Because of this, the State still controls how you raise them.* If you have money, you have only accumulated enough to buy what you desire for while long you have left on Earth. The Central Bank is the owner of the notes.* Your pension is only guaranteed for life if you work and retire. When you die, it ends.* The food in your stomach isn't yours, even if you eat and feel full. It must be expelled back to Earth.The body itself, which you value so greatly, is not yours.When the loan is due, the Earth will unquestionably reclaim its fragments.Even the life we currently lead is a loan that will undoubtedly be repaid.We should thus let go of our fear of losing anything in this life because we have nothing to lose. We shall either lose everything we believe to be ours, or everything we believe to be ours will be taken away from us at some point. That day is one that none of us are aware of.So, if you feel like you have lost something, remember that nothing was really yours, not even your life. Never lose your head, your cool, your anger, your values, or your vitality.Therefore, my fellow members in the forum, be modest; the affluent and the poor both belong to this life cycle.",

When you humble yourself before your teachers that want you to become the leader of tomorrow, I believe you will not regret your decision to be humble, and we have many good teachers in the Nigeria local board who are very happy in teaching users by correcting them in some post in the forum for them to see their errors not to repeat the same thing in this local board and other forum too. Being humble is very good but don't be humble to some things that will kill you or lead you to the hands of scammers because, there are many newbies that use humble to distracted themselves from the community because they didn't take action to some things that need action.",

      "body": "Op what you just said is true and nothing but the truth. You have made all the necessary point, it is good to be humble in life. We are strangers on this Earth and has nothing to boost of. Sometimes I ask myself what is our porpose in life? When you see somebody that needs help kindly do if it's possible because who you help yesterday might be a helping hand in the nearest future. Some people have this habit of not giving their friends a useful information that will help them when dey need it, rather when time has passed. Now I ask what is the essence of helping someone when there is no need again. Like most of my friends whenever I ask them about any information? They will say no info but later you will see them starting work somewhere. Â And if you ask how come you started work when you said no info, they'll say e\"e get as the matter be\" but when dey see you make small move they will be calling you to know all your way about but theirs is a no go area. The gospel truth there is that no matter what we say or discuss here, it can not change people's characteristics. Because bad character is like a perfume, it fragrance always looms around you. but advise is not a course we learn everyday. If this room didn't have law that controls people, you would have started seeing people's behavior here. So let try to be humble because life is too short.",

So be humble and wise also smart in doing things with people to avoid being used and also focused in anything you are doing in life.",
