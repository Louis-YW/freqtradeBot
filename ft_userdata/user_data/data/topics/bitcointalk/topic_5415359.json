  "content": "Please note: This is a free community project. It doesn't involve money and making a profit. It concerns all of us because Bitcoin's PoW is under attack. I am not officially involved with the project or site, and I have no stake or interest in it.This thread is self-moderated to prevent anti-Bitcoin and anti-PoW FUD and spam.As the subject says, I am looking for social media influencers and those with significant friends/followers counts. The idea is to promote https://bitcoincleanup.com/ and the truth about PoW. As NotATether said on his site: \"It's time for us to rise up and defend our currency from external threats\".- There are no rules, there is no campaign manager, and no one will be checking what you do. Do anything you believe can benefit the cause. Our cause because there is no Bitcoin without PoW. - Participation is free, and everything you do is voluntary.- It doesn't matter how many friends or followers you have or on what social media you are, as long as you want to help.- You don't have to report your activities if you don't want to. A separate campaign thread might be created in the future.   How Can I Help?Some Bitcointalk members have started wearing the Bitcoincleanup.com avatar and a personal text. You can do that as well if you want. Click here for more info. A signature is coming soon that you can wear.- Post, tweet, and talk about the project on social media. Get your friends and Bitcoin enthusiasts involved as well. - Share the hashtags #EcoFriendlyPoW and #EndTheFUD.- Contact Bitcoin advocates, YouTube stars, crypto news sites, etc. and ask them if they want to help.- You can write to your MP, senators, or members of Congress and explain to them what PoW really is. Prepared letter templates can be found on the official website.      - Do you have a website, radio show, TV show, online publication, YouTube channel, or anything else that can help? Talk about bitcoincleanup.com and its message. More information about the project:https://bitcoincleanup.com/Bitcoincleanup.com: a website to stop Greenpeace's bitcoin FUDRelated threads and discussions:Would you be interested in promoting Bitcoin projects/services for free?Forum advertising space for free signature/avatar advertisement",

I am going to switch to the new avatar and personnel text now. I am looking at your original post in my loyce.club notifications and I wouldn't have minded if you used that reserved post either. But I think it's better that there is a separate thread for the signature campaign. That's what I would have done if I was in your shoes.  Quote from: examplens on September 30, 2022, 04:27:33 PMcount on me. finally some concrete initiative.I have several Twitter accounts and altogether have over 30,000 followers, plus some FB groups and pages which is under my control.

Two hashtags that NotATether mentioned on his website are #EcoFriendlyPoW and #EndTheFUD. You can make some tweets using those if you want to. @NotATether Are those two hashtags final or do you have plans to change them/add new ones?",

Thanks a lot. Just to clarify though, it's not my site. NotATether is the owner. I just believe it's worthwhile to help get the message out there.For those who don't know what site aoluain is talking about, you can find it on his profile page.

If you do make some posts via your social media accounts, feel free to share some of the things you said so we can take a look and see what kind of attention those tweets and comments are getting.@examplensHave you made any tweets since the last time you posted in this thread and how did it go?I am not very active over social media and don't follow many people or crypto personalities. But I wanted to share the site with Andreas Antonopoulos and see what he thinks of https://bitcoincleanup.com/. Turns out he doesn't want to get emails about promoting or advertising other sites or services, so I abandoned the idea of contacting him. I did send an email to the guys from Coin Bureau and asked them if they would like to have a look at the intiative. Haven't heard back from them though.  Anyone else? Have you contacted or talked with anyone from the crypto space about Bitcoincleanup.com, and who do you think would be interested in this community project?",

Andreas and his team can be reached through his website. He has a contact form where you need to specify the reason for getting in touch. The closest thing is the last option \"Promotion, Advice, or Review of your project\". When you click on that, you will see a notification that says he doesn't review companies, projects, etc. And it also says you shouldn't use other methods of contact to get around this rule. When I saw that, I stopped to not cause any harm to what we are doing.Quote from: examplens on October 18, 2022, 12:13:20 PMI am not sure who is behind https://twitter.com/BitcoinCleanup account, but maybe the whole thing could start from there.
