Be sure to read all the information before installing the firmware.There is no free ks0 pro firmware afaik. The one you linked at the bottom is for normal ks0. I am using one of the paid ones for ks0 pro and I'm doing 290 gh by just getting a good fan and unscrewing the sides. I bought that fw for 250 KAS. I have also ordered the heatsinks from ebay and will upgrade to the 340 gh firmware when they arrive. No issues so far, as stable as they come",
