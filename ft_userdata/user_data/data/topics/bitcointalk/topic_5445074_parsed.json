  "content": "Plagiarism:Everyone knows that Plagiarism is a crime even outside this forum. Plagiarism is frowned at in higher institutions and its consequences could be imprisonment or paying huge fine unlike the forum where the ultimate punishment for plagiarism is permanent ban.AI postingWith the increased adoption of chatGPT, which I am personally seeing to outsmart google in just a few years, I cannot say that the use of AI is a crime.But in the jurisdiction of Bitcointalk, do you think using bots to make or generate posts is ethical or should be acceptable?Well, I think my answer is NO.The essence of banning plagerists should be because of cheating, users copying others work to appear more intelligent than they are. And the severity of the punishment is heavy when the plagiarist wear paid signatures.If plagiarism (using others work without referencing) is a crime in this forum. It therefore means that AI posting (deceiving people to reply to automated codes thinking it's their fellow human) should also be a crime. I can say that some campaign managers agree that it is cheating and that is why Royse777 introduced this rule QuoteTo prevent AI domination effective from today we are introducing an incentive for forum users. Find AI written posts on this campaignand report to me either in public or in forum PM, please be sure you have enough reference to support the claim. For successful reportthe reporter will receive the weekly payment instead of the accused campaigner. The campaigner will be removed immediately.Also stake.com manager Carollzinha updated similar rule in her rulesQuote Posts being generated by AI will not count for your current payment & may cause you to be removed from the campaign with no pay In both cases, the punishment of the managers is to kick the defaulting participants out of the campaign. Does it therefore lie in the hands of campaign managers to curtail the usage of AI in making posts in the forum?If Plagiarism leads to ban, why is AI posting not leading to a ban?Considering that any post(s), that is not well connected in meaning with a flowing conversation can be regarded as a spam. I therefore suggest that the forum make an overall rule against AI posting. Else a board should be created for AI posting where signature does not display, incase we don't want to fight a fast evolving technology.",

      "body": "Well, responding to a thread should be based on an individual's own opinion (what they know and what they think) and not just what an AI bot generates; it may be partially authentic or unplagiarized, but the fact is that it's not original. Plegarisim is high-offense both in the forum and outside. I remember when I did my project work in school, in my theory writings, my supervisor had to do a plagiarism check, which I successfully passed. My opinion is that those members that use AI to post should not be banned; instead, let all campaign managers introduce the law that Royse initiated so that every forum member that is wearing a signature and using AI to make their posts be disqualified and restricted from joining signature for some weeks. Also, members posting with AI tools should not be allowed to join signature campaigns. Campaign managers should make it a practice to check users posts for AI content before accepting them into their campaigns; at least that will encourage more self-expression and original content. This is just my opinion, though.",

After all, the consequences of AI misuse will not only affect reputation, but account ban. So it should be avoided as much as possible regardless of being a campaign participant or not.Quote from: KingsDen on March 15, 2023, 11:54:00 PM-snip-Else a board should be created for AI posting where signature does not display, incase we don't want to fight a fast evolving technology.

Plagiarism means stealing someone's writing.  But the artificial intelligence of AI creates a content in its own way.  But AI can never create any new words, it collects information from Google or any other source, converts it into its own content with own strategy  and presents it to the customer. However, this forum declared AI posts not acceptable and added rules that no campaign  manager would accept AI posts and anyone using them would be kicked out of the campaign.  But I haven't seen any information that accounts will be banned for AI posts like Plagarism.  So of course AI content is less of a crime than plagiarism for this forum",

      "body": "Most topics in the forum are pretty lame anyway. You don't need the AI's opinion on those. When you are about to make a post on a serious matter, you can ask chatGPT's opinion, understand it and then repost it with your own sentences. Nobody will really notice that they are talking to an AI bot. But I think you don't need to take this forum that seriously. There isn't anything to gain. Even if you come up with the most sensible answers to the most serious questions, nobody will care.Right now people are using chatgpt to make posts without being smart. They ask a question and copy/paste the answer without making any modifications to it. That's because people who use chatGPT to make posts don't know much of a Engrish in the first place.It is like giving a monkey a machine gun. A soldier can use a machine gun effectively and kill lots of enemies but in the hands of a monkey you don't know who is going to be the next target because the monkey has no brains to use the gun effectively. He will just randomly press any buttons he can, shoot anything he can, sometimes himself too  ... No aim needed.",
