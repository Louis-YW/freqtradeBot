Parents suppose to balance things wey no balance to the level wey them fit. No be until parents hold scatter be the thing and no be just because one child hold and the other no hold be the the wey dey make their eyes or love shift enter for one person side, parents na human being so just like you go see someone and get natural likeness for the person side, na so kwa wey parents go take like one wey be say even if that one no dey do well, dem go dey pray or dey wish say na that one wey dem love inside their inner mind get dat pepper. Abi you never also see where na you hold cash and dey do things but dem still dey carry glory give another child. This life no balance my brother that's why I been say parents go try balance things. Although we all understand the power of money and wetin money fit do, the family matter dey everywhere but some worse though.",

If one of their pikin get the money pass the others, na that their pikin wey dem go regard pass the rest of their pikin. Every little thing na that their wey d provide for them, na him dem go the praise and talk good of, making the ones wey no d provide anything feel less of themselves like sae them no d try for the family. I don see in many families wey this kind thing the happen, how em take put their families in disunity. Parents love divided based on the amount of money wey you get. If you no get, no regard for you as their pikin. You will be talked to anyone as sef you worth nothing for the family. That's why you go see some young guys no d ready to come back home until they make it in life. Not that home no d hungry dem to come see their parents, na because they no want make their family make them feel less of themselves as if they are not trying. There is this adage wey people d say, ''when you get money, you are called honey, when you no get you be address as monkey''. Many parents are indirectly using that adage on their children, which them no care to know that kind depressing mode and pressure they are putting their children that are yet to start providing for the family into. I pray make God bless everyone wey d do legit work for here. Make Oluwa butter their bread so that their parents no go disregard them or pressure them in doing something stupid just to meet up or prove themselves to their parents that they can provide for the family also",

Just as my title take tok amYou wey be first daughter or Son, second and third to any number wey you be for your house, you don eva stay see say you don loose value for ur house onto say you no meet up with family needs or based on say you no dey job kon make ur old man or old woman to place value to ur sisters or brothers pass?How you dey face the hit for ur family because those people wey be bread winner for their families fit understand the kind of regards them dey get for house based on say them dey always provide for the family pass their elderly brodas and 6tas. I don see some people wey be say for their family wey no balanced well base on say dem never get work or something to do kon make their parents pass the loves to their brodas wey supply the family.As you get work kon dey bring money for the family how your papa or mama don reason ur matta, she don change or she still dey give special respect to your sister wey be odogu for house or every every don balance for balance for the family?Well if you never experienced wetin I dey talk e mean say your old man hold money scatter because na only them wey no fit experience am. People wey their old man no hold money understand wetin I dey talk because e dey very frustrating to see say as woman them come carry ur mantle of leadership give ur junior 6sta or brodas onto say your face no show and ur shoe no shine for the house.Abeg make we discussed respectfully to know wetin we dey pass tru as individuals, make we see people wey there mama remove the mantle give another person for family onto say she/him no fit assist the family as e supposed be.How una see this kid matta for ur house?Dis na serious matter wey some families for we country dey face. Wetin I get to talk for this matter be say, make we no too reason this particular matter because if person begin think about how him family don comot right from him hand give him other brodas and sistas wey dey too well, the person fit sick or go through wetin oyibo people dey call 'depression' and dis depression na very bad thing.My people, if you know say your hand no too strong for the family, no just do asive nothing concern you for the family.Â  Because if you commot body from family issues because say you no get money, people go see you as person wey no dey useful.Â  Yes na, you dey useless for the family. Even if say money no dey, make your presence, ideas, strength and physical effort prove say you dey think better for the family.",
