  "content": "Let's say, hypothetically, you can remember your master private key (256-bit) or a 24 word seed phrase with equal precision.  Would it therefore be equally/more secure to remember your 256-bit master private key and never use a seed phrase?  And actually more secure (not by a statistically relevant amount but still technically more secure for this hypothetical) because of the fact that a seed phrase can be used to get the master private key, but a master private key cannot be used to get a seed phrase if a seed phrase does not exist?  Please try and keep answers to the hypothetical, I'm trying to understand how things work and not necessarily how to store my own bitcoin.",

This doesn't make the master private key less secure nor the private key more secure.Better example: A seed phrase is used to generate addresses, but addresses can also be generated without a seed phrase; just by hashing a public key. The former address isn't (and shouldn't be) considered more vulnerable than the former address, as long as the seed phrase remains secret.Note that there's a high chance for your master private key to have a seed phrase, that isn't known by anyone.",

(Although it's extremely likely for every address to have at least one private key)A master private key is consisted of a private key and a chain code, both of which are 128 bits long. This makes the master private key 256 bits long. If the seed is 256 bits, then there a high chance for your master private key to have at least one seed phrase nobody knows.And there's also a nearly infinite amount of seed phrases, of any size, with a passphrase that can generate it.

I'm focussing on the word being used \"Guess\", it is impossible* to guess a seed phrase,so memorising it is perfectly safe provided you can recall the 24 words anytime and are in fullcontrol of your faculties in 10, 20, 30+ years from now.Also if we disregard another word \"hypothetically\" and look at what o_e_l_e_o postedin a related thread from earlier this week > Crypto vs \"the lucky dude\" --- Is Bitcoin really SAFE?Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 08, 2022, 08:11:10 PMQuote from: Mik75 on May 08, 2022, 07:40:51 PMFrom what I understand the only defense against this event is to divide your assets into many accounts to reduce the risk.No, the defense against this is math:Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on June 04, 2019, 05:44:16 PMLet's say we have a trillion planet Earths. On each Earth, there are a trillion people. Each person has a trillion computers. Each computer generates a trillion keys a second. All these computers have been creating a trillion keys per second since the birth of the universe 13.7 billion years ago. 10^12 * 10^12 * 10^12 * 10^12 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 13.7 * 10^9 = 4.3*10^65. This means thay they would have so far generated approximately 0.0000000004% of all private keys.If you are worried about someone using such a site to stumble across your private key, then you should be absolutely terrified of dying from a meteor strike, shark attack, or lightning strike, all of which are exponentially more likely to happen. You should also be terrified about someone guessing your credit card number and stealing all your fiat, since for every possible credit card number there is somewhere in the region of 10 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion possible private keys.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 08, 2022, 09:27:04 PMQuote from: coolcoinz on May 08, 2022, 08:23:43 PMI think he got some spent addresses but all of them were empty already.If he did, then it was because those addresses were generated insecurely (e.g. brain wallets), or he had some additional information or knowledge about those addresses. No one has ever or will ever randomly stumble across the same private key as anyone else, period.Quote from: coolcoinz on May 08, 2022, 08:23:43 PMSorry, but your chances of winning a lottery are higher.Given that most lotteries have a chance to win the jackpot in the region of 1 in 108, and there are around 1077 possible private keys, then you are a few trillion trillion trillion times more likely to win the jackpot 5 times in a row than to find a single previously used private key.Imagine stumbling across an address with a only few thousand sats in it, knowing you could have exponentially more easily just won several billion dollars by winning the lottery over and over and over!",

If I want to brute force master private keys, then I must first generate the master private keys, and then work down the derivation tree and then convert to public keys and addresses. If I want to brute force seed phrases, I must first turn each seed phrase in to a master private key, and then do all the same operations that I did for the master private key. A seed phrase will be computational more expensive.Having said that, none of this matters at all. In terms of protection from brute force attacks, it makes absolutely no difference if you back up a seed phrase or back up a master private key (provided both were generated equally securely). Every address in your resulting wallet, created by either method, will show up in some other hierarchical deterministic wallet at some derivation path. Anyone who wants to conduct a brute force attack with no prior knowledge of your seed phrase or master key will instead just brute force individual private keys, which is a much faster process than either seed phrases or master private keys, and at that point it makes absolutely no difference which method you used to generate those private keys.",
