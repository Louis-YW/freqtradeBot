  "content": "We all know about the Lightning Network. And while it is great for handling enormous loads of transactions nearly instantly and at very low cost, it also has some tradeoffs like you can't take receive more Bitcoin than you've sent at any given state of your node, liquidity could sometimes be a problem at least until LN expands more, money can only be sent if the receiver's node is online, and the whole idea of needing watchtowers and needing to keep the current state of your channels so that your channel partners can't act in bad faith and try to steal from you.LN is great but its not a perfect solution and in an ideal world for Bitcoin I figure there would be more L2 options for Bitcoin with different or maybe even fewer tradeoffs.So I'm wondering are there any other L2 solutions for Bitcoin that are being worked on or have been proposed? I read in the Fall someone talking about rollups I think on Bitcoin, though I'm not clear about what rollups actually are, I think I just know of them because I've heard about them as L2 used on Ethereum. Lightning is the only L2 blockchain solution that I actually know how it works so I don't know what other sorts of L2 solutions have been invented and which ones could work on Bitcoin and which ones are possibly being worked on for Bitcoin.You all know of anything besides Lightning?",

Bitcoin is more of a public good for humanity than a money grab for companies, so absolutely devs tend to gravitate toward smart contracts and apps/tokens than work on serious Bitcoin projects that could improve money for humanity. This does indeed leave Bitcoin with fewer developers working on important things, and lots of developers looking to make the millionth crypto app lol.It would be nice to see a bit more active work done on the Bitcoin ecosystem considering how important it is, rather than just another slew of altcoins and smart contracts and crypto apps that no one is going to care about in a month or a year or next market cycle.I'd love to see competing L2's with different tradeoffs and positives being built for Bitcoin the way they are being built for Ethereum, even if its not really needed for a number of years until we start seeing lots of payments being done in Bitcoin, cuz by then we are gonna want these L2's to be mature and battle tested and widely supported.",

Ethereum and all altcoins are entirely run by founders and companies that make all decisions for the network and impose whatever hard forks they want while users/operators simply have to go along with them because the founders/companies have 100% control. With bitcoin the community ultimately decides if something goes ahead or not. If devs were concerned about central points of authority they would be running fast from Ethereum to Bitcoin.Devs go to Ethereum because you can create tokens and apps and try to get rich quick, while on Bitcoin there are no tokens and you can't just create a smart contract app to try to get rich from, you have to either do the hard work of working on the Bitcoin protocol or the hard work of building an actual business in the Bitcoin ecosystem, not just release an altcoin and try to get it pumped.I don't know why you would try to claim it is Bitcoin that is centralized and Ethereum (controlled entirely by Vitalik) that is not centralized lol. That's the most bizarre backwards lie ever. Like, no one would take you seriously when you say stuff like that. It seems like you prefer the altcoin model of hardfork constantly, no immutability, and centralized control over the network by a founder/company, but you just tell yourself that all that is somehow more decentralized rather than more centralized. If you want an attempt at Bitcoin that is just a centralized altcoin controlled by a single person or a small group then you've got the failed altcoins BCH and BSV and you can join their communities. You don't need to stick it out with decentralized immutable secure global digital hard money if you just want a centralized token that changes constantly, seems like joining a centralized token community would make you happier than sticking it out with the future of money.",

Yeah I've read this crap before on the internet. Uusally it's followed by a pitch to by some random centralized altcoin, or pushed by the failed BCH/BSV communities who try to convince people that their own centrally controlled altcoin is \"the real\" Bitcoin lol.So you come up with nonsensical arguments about Bitcoin and LN because you thing blockstream is like the bitcoin Illuminati haha. gotcha. Your point of view makes sense now, its just incorrect. Are you a BSVer or BCHer but you just don't mention it because then your intentions would be too obvious? That seems likely.Also you literally said people flee from bitcoin to ethereum because they wanted to get away from bitcoin's centralization. But bitcoin is the only decentralized cryptocurrency and Ethereum is far far more centralized so I was just pointing out how backwards that claim of yours is.But yes sure SOMEONE has to maintain bitcoin's open source development - the github maintainers - so naturally there is going to be a group of developers that are technically in charge of the update process. That's the one thing in Bitcoin that isn't extremely decentralized, but there isn't really a good way around that. And obviously Ethereum and all other blockchains not only have that but have far more centralization in numerous ways because their development is entirely controlled by founders and companies, rather than just being open source projects maintained by lead developers. So you're just bubbling over with hypocrisy when you claim devs move from Bitcoin to Ethereum to get away from centralization, that move is very strongly in the direction of centralization. Any dev that wanted to move away from centralization would have to move to Bitcoin from anything else.",
