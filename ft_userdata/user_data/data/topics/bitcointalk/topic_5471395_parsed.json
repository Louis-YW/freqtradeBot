They have over $80M in funding before the launch of their zkEVM mainnet.Scroll's TVL skyrocketed after 24 hours of the announcement from $100k to over $2.3 million.Before the mainnet was recently launched, I have interacted a lot in both the Scroll Alpha and Scroll Sepolia testnet.In my own instincts, here are some of the possible multipliers for a possible big Scroll airdrop after the future snapshot date was taken:1) Transactions in the Scroll Alpha testnet stage2) Transactions in the Scroll Sepolia testnet stage3) Transactions in the Scroll mainnet4) Using the main native bridge of Scroll and other bridges supporting it like Orbiter, Owlto, etc.5) Scroll OG role in Discord6) Guild.xyz for Scroll7) Own a Scroll ENS domainAnd possible other ones out there.....What do you guys think about the possible Scroll airdrop in the future? As this is just a speculation, I would like to hear your thoughts, reactions and opinions about this. Thanks in advance!",

The Scroll is a big project with this kind of Funding, also I used its many features in the Testnet phase with these two as you have mentioned one of them is sepolia. I did some of its tasks through the Taiko Testnet where scroll Testnet was involved. I can smell something from it because I think it will do a big airdrop and we have to use its official bridges as its tasks are also now on the Layer3.I have been using it since the start of their Testnets and I had already verified all tasks that were on the Laer3, which could be helpful for a big Airdrop from the Scroll Team. Looking at their funding, I think something big is coming from Scroll. We have to interact as much as we can on its Mainnet even as that was before in Testnet. Using its Native bridge would be juicy.",

You can mint one at the Scroll Name Service.Check the official X post here: https://twitter.com/scrollnsdomains/status/1714274472231117004I think as much as possible despite not knowing if Scroll L2 will be doing an airdrop in the future, we can farm as many possible multipliers as we want as long we can afford to spend gas fees from time to time. I also remembered a game called the Omni Kingdoms which was also introduced during the Scroll Alpha and Scroll Sepolia days. Every interaction like training, gold, battle, arena, etc., cost you gas fees.Not much fancy graphics, but a simple old-school click and interact type of game. They are also on the Scroll mainnet and they're having an ongoing quest on QuestN.Check here: https://app.questn.com/quest/830990611889221905I'm keeping an eye on Scroll L2. Can't ignore this especially of having an OG role on Discord which is possibly a strong criteria.",

Source: https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP/status/1717527880539000849They've introduced Scroll Origins which is their own commemorative NFT. The only qualification is that you must deploy a smart contract under the Scroll mainnet within the 60 days of Genesis Block starting from October 10, 2023 6 AM GMT. There are 3 stages such as Quintic, Quartic and Cubic.Additional info here: https://scroll.io/blog/scroll-origins-nftRemember Aptos' very first airdrop? The only qualification was to mint an NFT and they've reaped the big rewards.This also reminds me of the Linea Voyage where they reward us with commemorative NFTs and the rarity is base on the Galxe points we've accumulated. I've got the Beta tier by the way which is the second highest rarity next to Alpha. Probably by having this commemorative NFT for deploying a smart contract, this will be a potential multiplier for their future airdrop. They also did mentioned some extra surprises for those deployed contracts that are being exceptional.To know how to deploy a contract in the Scroll mainnet, here's a helpful source from HEADBOY: https://medium.com/@ndidiesonwune/how-to-deploy-smart-contract-on-scroll-mainnet-8c1a3b9490ca",

What about the other past airdrops? I'm not talking about those 2017-era airdrops but those airdrops like ARB, SUI, Optimism, etc... I think many people still considered them as ideal airdrops because they pay really well. Rewards can also depend on the effort and the amount of money that we put it in.There are still airdrops that are legit. It's just that creating crypto have became easy now or many people got involved with it and want's to try their luck as well. The only bad part is many of them are not producing a good quality project and many only want's to scam the public. If people want a secure income, there are better things that they can do than doing airdrops.",

Historically all big airdrops came unannounced. Regarding farming and losing fees and project not giving airdrop — I understand the frustration but it's just way it is, either don't farm and be genuine in you using projects so if something comes it'll be unexpected surprise otherwise you wouldn't care as there was no expectation in first place. There are farmers, who farm all potential ones, and if they make it big in one it recoups all other loses.",

Couldn't agree more, I think most layer2 project main focus for airdrop will be on mainnet users, although looking at arbitrum you would expect other L2 projects to act same way. However, this hasn't been the case, perhaps scroll will be the one to reaffirm airdrop hunters of such hope.Testnet activities in my opinion no longer carries the same level of hyped it carried during the post arbitrum airdrop. Since nothing has happened since then, thanks to Linea, the interest has gradually died down.  Between they are thr ones farming the airdrop farmers.",
