Nonetheless, I respect Satoshilabs and those how use this firmware to keep their satoshis as I was going to give it a try when I was new with Trezor but I did not dare because the installation process.",

Because my personal experience have been almost flawless so far using the normal firmware.I suppose the signing time may get reduced slightly but I cant think of any other advantages I would notice.If anyone reading this thread has tried this specific firmware, I'll like to know about your own experience with it in the form of a short review, please. That would help a lot.",

      "body": "I have been using bitcoin-only firmware on two of my Trezors for years now.   It is easy to mount trezorctl on a linux terminal and install the BTC only firmware.  For more casual users the Suite's software will now make it easy to install.Many here say their devices run well with \"normal\" many coin software.  I can't speak to that since I am a diehard old school crypto user from a decade ago now.  I do have more devices where other coins can be used.Security advice:  it comes down to attack surface and CLEARLY bitcoin-only firmware has a total edge over the \"normal\" firmware IF in fact you are only using Bitcoin.  Why would anyone expose attack surface unnecessarily?  Further some of the updates with all the coins need to be corrected because something is glitched or changed by the respective coin blockchain/system.  I worked in computer security and I believe Trezors are safe, but I maximize my security when possible.  Why wouldn't I?Quote from: dkbit98 on August 21, 2022, 09:41:05 PMQuote from: SFR10 on August 20, 2022, 09:31:02 AMTrezor finally introduced an easier way for \"normal users\" to directly install the Bitcoin-only firmware in Trezor Suite!Note: Bitcoin-only firmware existed \"since 2019\", but it was meant for advanced users.It's important to ask if Trezor allows it's users to move back to multicoin firmware after they installed bitcoin only firmware, maybe they changed their mind or they need to use this device as 2FA?

      "body": "One more important update for Trezor Suite software was released few days ago with version v22.9.1, but it's only pre-release and you can install it if you opt-in or do manual install.Long awaited biggest change is coming with Coin Control feature, so now you can manually select UTXOs for your transactions when you are sending Bitcoin.One more small update, among other small improvements, is adding optionally display of Bitcoin amounts in Satoshis (Sats) instead of default BTC, and it's simple to enable/disable this with a click.https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/releases",
