Can you recommend a new coin worth investing besides LUNA?LUNA? do you think it's profitable? when people no longer believe that Do Kwon is playing with crypto. I'd rather avoid going crazy than having to drop money on a new crypto where it's not clear where it will end up.There is no guarantee for new projects at this time, the market is no longer responding. We're starting to enter a fairly long bear market. Especially if you intend to start investing in new coins.If you have done research on a project, then stay away from hype stuff like LUNA.Oh, maybe LUNA v2 is now supported by many major exchanges? Naturally, because the stock exchange suffered heavy losses due to the current LUNA crash. So what they do is take back the lost capital.",

Can you recommend a new coin worth investing besides LUNA?In general i think that new projects have the biggest potential in terms of possible profit. I mean for that conclusion you only need to check on some of those projects that are now in the top 20 in terms of coinmarketcap. Projects like for example solana are not that old but early investors already made a x50 of their current investment even now after the market is in a downward trend for many weeks now.The other part of the truth is of course that the risk for a total loss of your investment is very high when you invest into new and upcoming projects. So the principle \"only invest what you can afford to lose\" is even more true for new projects than for cryptos in general. Also when a market is going down. Small and new projects are usually falling even more.",

Can you recommend a new coin worth investing besides LUNA?Big no-no for me.I'm not investing in new projects or new coins because they are more risky than those top market cap coins.I only have a limited budget to invest that is why I'm a bit conservative and focusing more on low risk, low reward coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB etc. Since I'm not investing into new coins, I'm not getting huge profits either, but I've already seen many people gaining huge profits from investing into new projects. It's a high risk but high reward strategy as well. LUNA?? Just stay away from that shitcoin. As of this moment, the coin went down from near $20 to now near $5 and expect that it will go lower until it will become a worthless shitcoin. Like I said, what happened to the old LUNA will not be forgotten by just creating a new blockchain or new coin whatsoever. Do Kwon's reputation has been affected by what happened, therefore the trust of the investors to him is already gone.",

Small and new projects are usually falling even more.If you get in early enough in a real promising coin, you can indeed have massive profits (x50 or higher) but you really need to find the hiddem gems. In a bull market everything goes up like crazy and it is easy to make profits. But in a bear market like this, some coins can drop 80 or 90% and will never reach their old price anymore...I still like to take some risk from time to time to invest in hype or new projects, but only with low amounts. Risk is sometimes quite high to loose all your money.",

Whatever choice of new coins you want to invest is up to you, but don't dabble with Terra (LUNA). BTW, I can't recommend any new projects for now, if you want to know about new projects, you can search for them on various Initial platforms and be prepared to buy them later.",

It looks like, investor is not interested anymore with LUNA, and this is just an ordinary token which is more volatile. The old LUNA might also start to die because of this, well I still have it but its fine if I lose that money, it’s not that big anyway.",
