I countlessly reset my devices and don't really care about the earning I got from it, I've been using it for years and I do wonder how much should I potentially earned from it. I just really enjoyed brave browser as my main browser and rarely switch into other browser given that those don't have a built in ad blocker. If I were in your position, I would personally withdraw the BAT earning and store it in a wallet and leave it till next bull market arrives. There project has been running for months now and I believe it's a good project, That's why I think it still has potential to it.",

What is your take on BAT?I think that i am using the brave browser now for around the amount of time as you. So far i have 94 Bat collected from displayed ads within the browser. If i remember correctly, then the price for 1 BAT was at around 1 Dollar during the last bullrun so then my earnigs would be almost 100$ withing two years from just using a browser that i would need to use anyway. So i would say that is definitely not to bad.I have noticed though that since january of this year or so i am not receiving rewards anymore because they have changed something and now you have to connect your account in order to continue to earn BAT by watching ads.The problem for me is that in my country both account providers that Brave is offering do not work in my country (Germany). I still use the browser because it works like a charm.",

Despite this minor scandal, I have continued to use them and have accumulated BAT. I don't plan to spend them for now and as a user I will continue to support them as much as I can. Also, I've only managed to accumulate 40 BAT so far. I think this topic can turn into a small-scale contest. I'm already wondering how much BAT our other friends have accumulated. :)QuoteThe browser maker Brave, which launched around protecting online privacy, was called out this weekend when users noticed that typing in the name of the leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, resulted in an auto-complete that ended in a referral link.https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/06/08/brave-browsers-affiliate-link-controversy-explained/",

I seriously haven't seen any good reason for BAT to exist, nor i see any value in it to anyone.People clicking the ads are poor and they aren't the target audience of marketers so everyone gets scammed here.Different from viewing ads at PTC and faucets websites, here we don't have to watch the ads for 5-30 seconds. You just have to click to open it once the notification appears on the right bottom side of your screen, and you are already credited with BAT for the upcoming payment which is done every month.So, it doesn't consume any time at all. It's simply extra income, although it's low. Maybe for tier 1 countries, where the target audience is concentrated, there are more ads available and the payrates are better. It would be nice to hear a feedback from someone living in such countries who also uses Brave.(Most ads displaying here are about NEXO lending platform. While I'm writing this post, a NEXO ad notification has just appeared ).",

A browser is prone to browser fingerprinting, even though brave has fingerprinting minimization. Another feature that Brave has, is private browsing using the Tor network, but I wouldn't recommend that. An inherent risk of using a browser is a trackable fingerprint, also, Tor Browser has specific guidelines to incorporate Tor with a Browser, so I would not recommend Brave to be used with Tor.Quote from: trendcoin on February 25, 2023, 09:04:13 PMQuoteThe browser maker Brave, which launched around protecting online privacy, was called out this weekend when users noticed that typing in the name of the leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, resulted in an auto-complete that ended in a referral link.https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/06/08/brave-browsers-affiliate-link-controversy-explained/That issue is also worth taking note of, along with many others one.

It depends on when he will convert it to another crypto like btc or fiat.He can just collect it for now, anyway, using brave browser is free and if you are just using the net all day long, why not use brave while earning some BAT?",
