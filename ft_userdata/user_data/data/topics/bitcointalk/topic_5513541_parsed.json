Trump might wield great influence as the president, but we also have the Congress and the Courts that can put him under checks. Three things:1. As president, Trump can do a LOT within the existing system, since he has complete control over agencies like the SEC, the FTC, and so on.2. Trump has absolute control over his party, who will presumably win a majority in Congress if Trump wins.3. Trump is a convicted criminal and indicted on over 100 more counts--and his voters clearly don't care. In other words, US voters will be voting for a politician who breaks the law with impunity. As such, it would be pretty silly for Trump to worry about pesky little things like, \"the law\" .QuoteQuote from: legiteum on October 17, 2024, 04:04:23 PMThe US government couldn't fully \"destroy\" Bitcoin, but changing the laws absolutely could cause it to drop in price by at least 90% as most major holders of Bitcoin are American.The US might be the leading country in crypto businesses.

Trump coin has no basis in fact, it is just based on market speculation and its price can drop at any time - it is not much different compared to shitcoin, and people who are interested in buying it are basically just gambling. Unlike Bitcoin, it has potential and its value can increase even more as the adoption of Bitcoin increases in the future. So if a person has the right mindset, they should be able to choose which coin is the best for them to invest in.",

(And lest we forget, the US has enormous influence over financial operations all over the world--just look at the sanctions the US led against Russia).Trump will be operating with an extra-legal mandate from his voters, and most likely a majority in Congress for his party. Just ask any Trump voters: they absolutely want him to be a dictator, not a mere politician. In the last four years Trump has bounced hundreds of Republicans, including very famous ones, out of office because they defied him. Congress, therefore, will almost undoubtedly do... whatever Trump says.Don't get me wrong: I think it's also likely that Trump doesn't tell them to do anything because they aren't competent enough to figure all of this out. But he absolutely can squash Bitcoin in the US and pump his own if he wanted to.",

There are literally hundreds of former associates of Trump right now campaigning for Harris, calling him a dangerous threat to the US and to world peace. The reason is that Trump deals with people like Musk the same way he has dealt with the women in his life: transactionally. In other words, he gets what he wants out of the person and then dumps them. If Trump wins, Elon Musk will learn the hard way that control of the US government is infinitely more powerful than his mere \"money\". Along with Bitcoin, Twitter is another platform that will be in Trump's way, and therefore may find itself on the wrong side of US regulators and regulations whereas TruthSocial will coincidentally be perfectly compliant. The CPC in China has been doing this to tech companies for decades now, and Trump could easily learn how they do it.",
