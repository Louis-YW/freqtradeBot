  "content": "- I followed the advice at https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server#how-to to set up a connection between Bitcoin Core v25 and Electrum Personal Server 0.2.4.- I try to set it up on Windows 11 Pro.- The Bitcoin Core is already installed, operational and fully synced - normally run with Ledger SatStack wallet. This works fine.When issuing the suggested command Code:.\\bitcoin-cli createwallet electrumpersonalserver true true \"\" false false true, I get the following response:QuotePassphrase provided but private keys are disabled. A passphrase is only used to encrypt private keys, so cannot be used for wallets with private keys disabled.I tried a variant without passphrase (if I got it right) too:Code:.\\bitcoin-cli createwallet electrumpersonalserver true true false false truebut I received exactly the same error message as before.So I created the wallet manually in the GUI:https://ibb.co/mRKPQWFI then ran:Quote<omitted>\\electrum-personal-server-windows-release-v0.2.4>electrum-personal-server.exe config.iniINFO:2023-09-27 11:33:32,629: Starting Electrum Personal Server 0.2.4INFO:2023-09-27 11:33:32,629: Logging to <omitted>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp/electrumpersonalserver.logDEBUG:2023-09-27 11:33:32,629: Process ID (PID) = 16216DEBUG:2023-09-27 11:33:32,630: no datadir configuration, checking in default locationDEBUG:2023-09-27 11:33:32,630: obtaining auth from .cookieDEBUG:2023-09-27 11:33:32,682: Checking whether rescan is in progressINFO:2023-09-27 11:33:32,688: Displaying first 3 addresses of each master public key:INFO:2023-09-27 11:33:32,693:electrumpersonalserver =>        bc1<omitted>        bc1<omitted>        bc1<omitted>INFO:2023-09-27 11:33:32,696: Obtaining bitcoin addresses to monitor . . .INFO:2023-09-27 11:33:32,696: Importing 1 wallets and 0 watch-only addresses into the Bitcoin nodeDEBUG:2023-09-27 11:33:37,706: Importing 0 watch-only address[es] and 1 wallet into label \"electrum-watchonly-addresses\"Press any key to continue . . .As I understand the correct message should be \"Listening for Electrum Wallet ...\", but it never appears. After I press \"any key\", the processing just ends.Please note that the bc1 addresses above are correct and based on the master public key \"electrumpersonalserver = zpub<omitted>\" I have put in the config.ini file. This master pub key was extracted from Electrum wallet from Wallet -> Information.I have checked the log file <omitted>AppData\\Local\\Temp\\electrumpersonalserver.log, but there is nothing useful in there - just the same messages that appear in the PowerShell console above.Any suggestion or help appreciated.",

If you're confident that the wallets are newand empty then there's no need to rescan, just restart this scriptAfter starting EPS again, it looks like EPS is available on 127.0.0.1:50002. This is also what the Electrum wallet is trying to connect to. Alas, the wallet does not seem to be able to connect:https://ibb.co/jh7VLRBBoth EPS and wallet are running on the same machine.",

I started again both EPS and E. wallet (\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Electrum\\electrum-4.4.6.exe\" --oneserver --server 127.0.0.1:50002:s).And it worked!!  But idiot as I'm, I had to fiddle with the cert - I wanted a really long validity to be future-proof. So I generated a new cert, exactly like before:openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:x -out server.pass.key 2048openssl rsa -passin pass:x -in server.pass.key -out cert.keydel server.pass.keyopenssl req -new -key cert.key -out cert.csropenssl x509 -req -days 4825 -in cert.csr -signkey cert.key -out cert.crtBut then the EPS <-> Wallet connection *stopped* working. The wallet refused to connect to EPS even though it was running fine - \"Listening for Electrum Wallet on ('127.0.0.1', 50002)\".After a lot of swearing, I found out that Electrum Wallet keeps a suspiciously named file 127.0.0.1 in %AppData%\\Roaming\\Electrum\\certs. The expectation was that it is the *old* cached cert that has already been overwritten in EPS. And because of cert-pinning, the fingerprint no longer matches.And indeed, after I deleted the file 127.0.0.1 and restarted the Wallet, the connection works again (fingers crossed):https://ibb.co/VSDwkxXI think it's rather stupid to distribute software (EPS) with expired certificate without which it does not work. Also I do not quite get why SSL is needed in the first place since the components by default communicate via localhost on the same machine.Anyway, thank you very much for help! BTC",

But it's not for everybody. Moreover, without your hints, I do not think I would get it working on my own.Also, it may be a good idea to generate a new cert from the security point of view. As the README.md says:If your wallet connects over the public internet you should generate your own SSL certificate instead of using the default one, otherwise your connection can be decrypted.I updated some related posts on reddit, so it may help someone too.",
