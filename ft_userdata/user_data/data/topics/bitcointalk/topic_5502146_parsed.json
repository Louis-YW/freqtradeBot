How do I convince such person? what are the smartest ideas and informations I need to share to such person inorder to align with their vision?I need suggestion to this.I suggest you, stay away from the idea of ​​implicating someone in something.The very fact that you have to ask for advice means that you are not completely sure of what you should present to that client.Also, if he wants to invest, he must do his own research and become better acquainted with the matter in which he plans to invest. It is a pretty bad idea to invest based on your or anyone else's recommendation in something about which he knows little or nothing.There are two scenarios, certainly, if everything goes well, everyone will be happy and satisfied. But things can go in the wrong direction and you don't want to be blamed for \"bad advice\", and that can also happen if the market goes down (as it is right now) and your client has no long-term patience.",

If someone doesn't want to invest, I'd say it's inappropriate to try convincing them. Bitcoin seems like a good investment, but investment always entails a risk, so a person should be willing to take that risk to proceed. If your client wants to learn more about Bitcoin, it's worth to look at the price chart, at some data on who recognizes Bitcoin and in which roles, and of course at safe options of buying and storing Bitcoin, as well as at pitfalls when it comes to using it.",

You need to feed them information personally to fasten understanding or else, they will spend months to fully understand how this thing works. You can also link this BTT forum to them for additional information aside from encouraging them to watch online tutorials. But talking about how to convince them? Well, telling them the truth and the risk will make them doubtful. That is why please don't but just let them decide and approach you if they have interest. Otherwise, you are taking big responsibility for their money. Introducing them is enough but urging them to invest is another story and the worse thing may happen is they will blame you.",

Speaking out of your own understanding alone may not be the best way because they may consider your information not to be completely truthful because there is always the possibility of them being a bias that maybe you stand something to gain from bringing them to invest in bitcoin.

So don't introduce your client yet, have a practical knowledge of what you want your client to indulge in, is not always Rosie with the cryptocurrency market so it's better you have a first hand experience of the volatility. If you're client invest with high hopes of possible high return on investment in a short time, then it didn't go as planned, obviously you will see your client frowning at you, because that might not be what you must have told him, so all of these involves what you know and how to go about it before helping others.",

My question now is: How does he or she want to invest in something they don't know about?  And in situations like this, you are not the person convincing them to invest because, from your statement, the person already has the intention to invest in it. So all you have to do now is educate the person on how bitcoin works, ask the person what kind of information they have about bitcoin in the first place before they want to invest, and make them understand it's not a fast money-earning means if they have all the information in their hand, it will now be left for them to decide their next step.",
