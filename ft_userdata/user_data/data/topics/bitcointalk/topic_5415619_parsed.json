You will just have a notification on email to that you change your account details and have a time to recover it using the email but it's nonsense if the account being hacked is not active anymore.Most of the account being are dormant account which hacker being target by brute forcing it.

Also to retrieve that account the only way is to have a signed bitcoin message that you own so even your details got stolen, as long as you can prove the authencity of that then they will gave your account back.",

Hide your email address from public.Two mandatory steps to do for account safety.Quote3. Make sure your account in this forum and email have different password.Different passwords for all different accounts. Don't resue any password on many platforms.Quote4. Create strong password with various combination and use 2FA (if possible).It should be set up for email that you use to register your account.Because forum account can be hacked by a password reset via email. If you email is hacked, your forum account will be hacked by password reset via email.If you are not sure that you can protect your email safely, you can use a non existing email address. So your forum account can not be hacked via email. If you do this, you have to do the first step, signing a message that is helpful for account recovery later.Quote5. Regularly change your password every month.Good advice but not enough. When you change your password, make sure they (old and new passwords) don't have anything related to each other, don't have any template format like \"MyforumpasswordSeptember2022\" and \"MyforumpasswordOctober2022\".",
