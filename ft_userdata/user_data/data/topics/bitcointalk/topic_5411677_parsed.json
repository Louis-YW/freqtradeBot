When you do that, look at your post history and ask yourself if you don't already have an online job since you are an active bounty hunter?If you want a better online job, you will still have to work a little harder to develop some new and sought-after skills, and programmers, web designers and web security experts are always in demand. Maybe you already have some skills that you can offer to the forum members? In that case visit Services",

Freelancing sites are always happy to see people who can offer their skills and abilities. Another question is what do you know?If you are a student, try to study well, and you are attracted by IT technologies, judging by your posts, move in this direction.But participating in a bounty will take up valuable study time, so you first need to make a choice. Will you study, or participate in a bounty?",

No any serious and legit online platform will tolerate deficiency in both writing and speaking fluently when it comes to English because that's the accepted universal language for communication. Additionally, Google and YouTube is there for you whenever you're ready to learn any online skills aside being a bounty hunter.",

You could be qualified to some freelance platforms like Upwork which according to their ToS that you might need to be at least 18.  I would advise you to fix your writing first, OP since that kind of writing ain't going to budge the first place in freelance platforms which is the approval of profile.Skills that are in-demand in that platform as of writing this were mostly web dev which is also my niche since every business owners out there are always looking for someone to build website for their businesses. If you are really desperate to earn quickly, you could go for data entry, but it is extremely saturated and highly competitive and it might take a while for you to land your first job there.",
