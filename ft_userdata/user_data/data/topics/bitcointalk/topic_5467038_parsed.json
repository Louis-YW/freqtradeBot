Well, boss man, you talk well for this matter but how we way be the victim fans, watin we go do? Nothing, me self I no go for talk wayder na jealously nai go make them kill the boy, since the father of the celebrity no talk nai be say those people way kill em pikin done short em mouth up with money, but waytin be money for were Papa and pikin they nah?The father no try at all and nah because say the father no talk nai make no body won put mouth.But on a second thought, Maybe the person way kill the pikin done still send some group of boys to go threaten the family so that them go keep quiet because I no see any better reason way go make papa no talk way some body kill em pikin, although say them no catch any body red handed but at least small investigation for they to make sure say them try their best.Even the police self them no go like lose their jobs especially now way the country hard and now them say money speak louder than voice.Rest in peace MOHBAD (Rip).",

I come say make i try do my own critical observation online, because based on watin i dey see online, people's emotions are high and it could easily make a mob action taken towards some persons that have been fingered to be involved either in intimidating the young man or make him go into depression.Obviously mohbad has gotten issues with his record label, some close person's close to the record label said, it is cult related. That he has been asked to be initiated to a cult group by the owner of the record label, but he refused thereby causing a rift between himself(mohbad) and the owner of the record label, that has even lead to physical attack of mohbad.Another source said ,it could be drug related. So i later saw that the mohbad guy has really gotten himself involved with a lot of wrong person's that have been after his life for a long time coming.Whatever he must have done to those person's, his death can never a be reward for whatever they where asking from him.

Boss, I like this your reasoning, the global music industry is a bunch of cult groups evil doers. As @Brainboss talk say him label manager, friends, girlfriend dey after him life, na true. If these top music people don give you wetin you want, which be firm, money and things of the world, you have to pay back your own side of the agreement and when you fail, no dull am, na your bone man wey dey very close to you, and na part of them, na him them go send for you. Mohbad has already seen his death coming but what surprised him was that it was his close people that were coming after him and I believe say them go don take oat wey be say if him talk na instantly there him go die. Musicians and Ritualist and yahoo boiz no difference. All these people have already sell their soul to the devil. Our police na them be the worst mugu wey everybody fit use money shut their mouth up. If the boy father no do anything, na who go come carry the mata for head.",

First una sure say the boy hand clean? Una sure say him dey completely innocent for the whole thing? I know say for Naija, the person wey dey no dey dey guilty but we gat think wide sometimes. Our people say if pikin dey cry dey point one place, if them check am them go see say either him mama dey there or person wey him know. Why be say everybody dey attack the boy? From Naira Maley to some randomguys on the street, the guy just dey collect from everybody. I hear say him be don talk say if him die, make them hold him wife. Una sure the matter dey straight? On the other hand, it is possible that there is a huge conspiracy involving his wife and some powerful gang, to get him out of the way. Check out the following incidence: He was attacked by group of boys in 2021; He was attacked at his estate; His wife bought pickup for her father after his death. All these are pointing to one thing.",

Observing the entire process following his death. And most of the videos that came up showed how the boy was threatened and bullied, and I appreciate how people are fighting for him, but I don't like how his father is treating property. And, thank God, the police have made it public for the investigation, and those responsible for his bullying should face no more punishment. Something need to be corrected in the music industry.

The marlian records as he has said and his family. How can they be aware of his predicament and refused to do anything about it when they know he has challenges with his record label. It is unfortunate that our celebrities are just there doing a social media \"justice for mohbad\" without any actions just driving traffic for themselves. The Nigeria police too can not be trusted to do a proper investigation.
