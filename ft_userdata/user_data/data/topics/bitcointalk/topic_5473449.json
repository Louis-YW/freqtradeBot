For those that wants to invest in bitcoin, they should make research about it and study the historical chart of bitcoin, halving and how the price of bitcoin may go up after halving. But those that do not make any of such research in the past will not still regret if they are able to hold their coins and not sell.",

That's why it is vital that you focus on long-term investment rather than short-term so that you can always wait till the price gets to your target. I still reiterate that Bitcoin will get to $100k. In order to reduce the risk of keeping Bitcoin, it is advisable to use the DCA strategy to buy your coin. This investing pattern will help you spread the risk of your investment because you will not suffer the same loss since you didn't buy at the same price. But OP you failed to balance your position because there are also many bitcoiners that have become millionaires because they held the coin for many years. I don't think swapping BTC for USDT is ideal because the latter is centralised so keeping it for a long time is unsafe.",

      "body": "For many, the \"HODL\" mantra has been both good and bad. It fits with the Stoic idea of \"weathering the storm of volatility,\" but its not always the smartest thing to do financially. The emotional ups and downs from the high of $69k to the low of $20k show how unpredictable the market is. A fluid plan is important, in my opinion.Definitely, if the market keeps going down, it makes sense to protect your gains by switching to a stablecoin like USDT. Its about finding a balance between the hope of a recovery and the harsh truth of market trends. Your idea makes room for a plan that needs both alertness and quickness.I believe that you should always have a way to get out of something. Not only do you need to know when to enter, you also need to know when to leave, even if only for a short time. Its not about selling in a hurry; its about keeping your money safe in case of a big drop. There might be a halfway ground between people who are HODLing and people who sell as soon as they see trouble coming.",

Now, those that are in the phase of regretting and didn't managed to maximize the situation especially during the bear market. The lesson is there and all you need to do is to think of what you can do right now with that. If you buy at this rate, the same scenario you're going to think of it and have your mind stress with the same thoughts. The important matter to be learned here is, how long you are willing to stay on this market? Because no matter what price targets you have, the market is going to continue and it is no other direction to go but to go up and increase its demand as year pass by.IMO, holding is still the best choice.",

Because time is relative for anyone and our definition long is a variation so I just want to ask the specific length of time. Maybe this kind of mindset of being afraid to hold your bitcoin for a long period of time is probably rooted in the fact that they're probably too focused on their bitcoin investment in that they don't have any other means to make money so they try to get profit at a short-term to sustain their daily needs.Quote from: OgNasty on November 09, 2023, 08:25:35 AMMy suggestion to those who havenâ€™t been around a long time or donâ€™t understand WHY Bitcoin is valuable is thisâ€¦ Think of Bitcoin like a subscription service or a union.

I would agree with you about the union part though, your contributions will eventually pay off because you know that they're going to have your back. Subscription though, I feel like that's not how bitcoin is, subscription doesn't imply that you're going to get anything back out of your subscription fees from that services, bitcoin is more akin to a doomsday prepper saving tons and tons of salt, it might look stupid now but when everyone has a bland meal when the apocalypse happens, salt will be worth more than gold.",

It's funny how you really proved the opposite of your opinion with your arguments.69K USD was a bubble, right? When you buy during the moment when bubble is about to explode, this is your fault but long-term, it's not really a fault that costs you a lot. There is a halving in less than a year, what do you think, won't it reach 100K and higher? It will, I am 100% confident about that. While my confidence doesn't drive price, there are many reasons why it will happen and the blackrock's involvement in it is a huge drive alone, price went rom 26K to 36K and it's not halving yet.",

Unlike if you have huge balance at stake for sure once there's a bull run will came at projected figures will get hit then for sure with that you can earn a lot for holding your bitcoins for long months or even years. If you only have small fraction of bitcoin them maybe try to multiply it so that on next time that there's same event like the Bull run speculated by other people we can participate and have a good earnings when new set of price has been hit. Also we need to understand the market that there's no always up with it and we should learn how to secure our profit once price of bitcoin reach for its new ATH recorded. Since if we came late for sure we will just end up picking up some small pieces while bitcoin is starting dump.",

I've mentioned before on the forum what you narrated about buying at a high price and still holding, and this is not a lie that some would have still been in many losses due to this. What I see here is that people are ill-informed and are blind followers and I even saw some of them offline where they might be at a bar or at a salon discussing Bitcoin. It's in this condition some people advise others to buy Bitcoin when they themselves do not understand the coin at all but are just fortunate to have invested at the right time.My advice is this, do not just be a blind follower, be you, learn about Bitcoin investments and know how to interpret the chart accurately. The weekly and monthly charts should be able to guide any serious speculators well, and then moving the coin to USDT/USD might be the best option during a confirmed bearish market for the traders in this category.However, that's for those with a light Bitcoin investment plan. For the real Hodlers, they continue to hold come what may in both bearish and bullish seasons.",

If you can not hold, you can not get rich but it is not enough. To hold and get rich successfully, an investor must pick a correct asset.
