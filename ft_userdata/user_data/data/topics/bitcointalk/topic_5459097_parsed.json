It is expected in some cases, the internet connection is hardly functioning to utilise digital currency, but an offline method of transaction, like using Bluetooth or NFC eventually still requires internet access. We can not send and verify the transaction itself without any internet connection, so we can make sure the whole transaction process goes thorough. It is just inherently not how digital currency essentially works.",

According to the original cryptocurrency theory, the structure of chains and blocks really cannot be offline.  But this is a brand new technology.  It is not only encrypted, but also offline!",
