The coin was loaded by him and we got it graded by ANACs in ~2016 with MJ's help. This auction payment would be contingent on me sharing this with the winner. (Of course)¬† I'll share it as soon as I get it from Sky - will also ask him to post here when he's available. @av8rjeff - I can understand if you want to opt out of the auction till then! Apologies for the inconvenience. Vibhor",
