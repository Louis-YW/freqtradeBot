Amazon - $299.32. Apple - $297.53. Google - $281.44. Microsoft - $191.65. Walmart - $113.86. Samsung Group - $99.77. ICBC - $69.58. Verizon - $67.49. Tesla - $66.210.

These three are used by majority of the population, with their ties to technology, market, education, and general every day lives of the people. TikTok is surely making a name for itself as more and more users and brands are using it for marketing and entertainment.",

The same thing applies to Google, Apple, Samsung and the rest of the companies. I'm not a big fan of Tesla and TikTok, but who cares. The company's brand is just a shiny package without any content inside.By the way, I'm surprised that Meta/Facebook/Instagram isn't in the TOP 10. Maybe that's why Zuckerberg is desperate, so he created this \"Threads\" app.",

TikTok/Douyin - $65.7https://www.visualcapitalist.com/top-100-brand-value-2023/The concept of brand value was first coined in the 1980s when consumer goods manufacturers were forced to offer discounts to increase sales. In this case, many organizations are interested in increasing the brand value with patience. Anyone who works in the marketing world knows how important a brand is to an organization and in many cases its value is more valuable than the assets or equipment of the organization. Among the many assets that an organization possesses, one of the most important is its brand value.",

Chinese government wants their kid to stay away from such distraction so they have banned it. It's available in China in the name of Douyin and it's a heavily regularised version of Tiktok.

TikTok could have a chance to beat Tesla in market value only if Elon Musk would let it happen. Quite the competitive businessman, his product surpasses that of GM motors and according to the listings giving by the op, it's just a $1.2b difference between Verizon and Tesla. TikTok is a fast rising social media app, but I doubt it would surpass Tesla..it might stand a chance with Twitter but not the automobile company.",

TikTok/Douyin - $65.7In my opinion, these companies really deserve to be ranked in the top 10 in the world, especially Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft. The four companies are always included in the ranks of the world's top 5. So I'm not too surprised by the company's entry into the top 10 in the world.Because it can be clearly seen in terms of users and customers who are always busy every year.But this year, to my surprise, several new companies have managed to climb into the top ten, namely Tesla and TikTok. These two companies have succeeded in shifting Facebook and Huawei, which entered the top ten in 2022.QuoteSurprising to see that TikTok/Douyin is now becoming the most valuable social media brand in the world. I guess people really love watching lip-syncing celebrities.It's not just lip syncing, but currently there are lots of features on TikTok that can be used by all users and this is one of the attractions that is very good and attractive to many people. Apart from that, there are many challenges that can be done on TikTok, so there are many people who want to try it. And with a short video duration, I think it's also a special attraction for TikTok. Because in my opinion, by watching videos with a short duration, I tend not to get bored quickly.In my opinion, these are the factors that have made TikTok increasingly popular in the world.",

They always use their profits for business development, so maybe that's one of the reasons why they are always at the forefront.Do shareholders lose money because they never get stock dividends?No, of course not. Even though Amazon never distributes dividends to shareholders, their share value always goes up. In the last 10 years, the value of Amazon's stock has increased by up to 20% annually, which is a larger amount when compared to the dividend payout. Apart from Amazon, Google and Apple also do not distribute dividends to shareholdershttps://www.suredividend.com/amazon-dividend/",
