I've done the process a couple of times and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. You guys got any tips?",

Or you mean it generates different addresses?If it's the former, a possibility is that that you didn't check BIP39.If it's the latter, a possibility is that you didn't specify the correct address format.",

I’m not a Blockchain[.dot]com user, but in March/April 2021 they set their default to Native Segwit (typically starting with \"bc1\"). If that is the case, make sure you’ve chosen the correct address type, as the guide you are following defaults to legacy on the screen shot.If the above is not the case, i'd suggest detailing the steps you've taken so far, so allow people to get acquainted with your exact context.",

      "body": "I believe you downloaded Electrum wallet from https://electrum.org and you  verified its signatureAfter the download, open the wallet, name your wallet, click on standard wallet -> I already have a seed. Enter your seed phrase (of blockchain.com wallet) and click on 'options' -> check BIP39 and you will be able to click on next and you will have to choose a derivation path, just like the image below. If your address start from 1, click on legacy (p2pkh), while for native segwit (p2wpkh) are addresses that start from bc1. You have to choose the correct derivation path and it depends on either your blockchain.com wallet bitcoin address starts from 1 or bc1.",

      "body": "Could it be that you simply haven't gone to view, and selected the \"receiving addresses\" tab to show? I'm doing it by memory here, but as far as I can remember that isn't enabled by default. If not, just run us through step by step of the process you took, and we can let you know where you're going wrong exactly. Obviously, take out any sensitive information like private keys or seeds. Alternatively, if you're having problems you could create a new Electrum wallet, get the receiving address for that one, and send your Bitcoin on Blockchain to it, obviously that requires a fee, so only do this option if you must. It's a good learning lesson to know how to import/export things anyhow.",

I suggest you go into more detail about the exact result you got, as other members have suggested.If you can see the \"Addresses\" tab in Electrum, you should have at least some btc addresses there. Are you saying you can not see \"your addresses\" or can not see the Addresses tab at all?",
