  "content": "cttoVenue: Japan (tentative)Date: November (tentative)Marlon Tapales was given the go signal to fight either Fulton or Inoue for the unified title and with the latter winning the bout last night, Tapales vs Inoue is a sure go AFAIC.Inoue have said that he will be the unified champion at the end of the year so most likely this fight will happen on the fourth quarter of the year.With Inoue's superb performance last night, do you think that Tapales has a chance to dethroned Inoue and became the first ever Filipino boxer to unified the four prestigious belt?QuoteWBA gives green light for Marlon Tapales to unify title with winner of Inoue vs Fultonhttps://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/boxing/872157/wba-gives-green-light-for-marlon-tapales-to-unify-title-with-winner-of-inoue-vs-fulton/story/Note: will update OP once we have the final venue and date and the odds also.",

Naoya is just reaching his prime right now and it's hard to stop a fighter like that who is very complete in my opinion.",

Tapales is quite bigger than Inoue, but we all know the power of Inoue. Personally, I do believe that Inoue would still win the fight as he is very dominant. I think no one can stop him in the current division he is at. His win against Fulton is a big statement that he could dominate the division again, so I will already book this; it will be another Inoue's KO win.It says it's going to happen this year, so we don't need to wait any longer.",

It would be the ideal opportunity to fight in Las Vegas and gain more recognition outside of Japan.The chance of Tapales winning the fight is very slim. If he can survive the power punches of Inoue, he can't compete with Inoue's speed. But we should appreciate what Tapales did. Despite knowing how powerful Inoue is, he is still willing to unify belts with him. In fact, he was in the venue to challenge Inoue after the fight.I'm not sure about the accuracy of these odds below, but Inoue is a super heavy favorite.Inoue: (-1000)Tapales: (+600)https://box.live/boxing-betting/inoue-vs-tapales-odds/",

If he can master that for sure he has a chance to defeat Inoue.He also need to make his emotion and not let Inoue dominate him in that category since if he let Inoue came into his head maybe it can destroy his focus then will give Inoue a huge advantage to win their fight. Although its early to tell but still this is another exciting fight to come.",

I have become convinced on the Japanese fighter. Inoue is like the young Pacman but with more knockout power in his hands.I agree, he might not reach 8 division title as Pacman, but the way he is destroying everything that in his path, it's like Pacman when he was in the beginning of his career specially at lower weights. And Inoue can make another history, for Japan and then having won the unified title in bantamweight and super bantamweight in the 4 belt era.Quote from: bbc.reporter on July 26, 2023, 06:13:03 AM@bisdak40.

However, Inoue's promoters should begin organizing his fights in Las Vegas if they want him to become a big name like Pacman.Possible that it might be good to held in Japan so that Inoue will be more known in the US market. Just like what Arum did with Pacman, and with that, he might gain a lot of fans as well. Although he has taken notice already, like Mike Tyson or Tank Davis talking about it. Might be better if casual fans will know his name and support him in his US fights.",

I hope this fight happens in the US but considering Inoue's demand in Japan which is the world's 3rd biggest economy after the US and China, it is most likely that Inoue stays at home for a while.Since last night I've been talking to some of my boxing friends and all of us are having difficulty imagining how Tapales overcomes Inoue. Inoue will be faster and carries the bigger punch. Tapales is not a KO artist and is not known as slick or faster than Fulton. Tapales had been down several times in his pro career which means he is really beatable. Still, I believe Tapales has underrated power punches. Tapales is actually 9 wins, 1 defeat (by TKO) with 8 KOs starting from his first world title fight at the bantamweight division. Tapales also has a big heart and experience being a 2 division world champion too. So Inoue cannot take him lightly, especially from Tapales' counters.",

However, I am not underestimating Tapales, but Inoue is currently hyped, and he is really good. So, we can't blame people for expecting that he'll win his next fight, considering how he dominated the super bantamweight division in his first attempt.",

Most of his fights have taken place in Japan, so I believe he needs to come out and compete in front of bigger crowds and challenge the best in the next division he moves up to, assuming he wins this unification fight.There's no doubt that Inoue will dominate in the super bantamweight division, but as he moves up in weight, there will be questions about whether he can still carry his speed and power and continue to prove himself.",
