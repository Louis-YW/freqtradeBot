I guess it was reserved for the rather computer-savvy people? When did it get easier?Thank youYou pointed out a great question but i think the previous member has already answered your query. But, i think many member used to create their own wallet address using their computing power and then they use that same Wallets which is aforementioned to send and receive BTC. I also sometimes think, why the adoption rate was lower back in days because it was so difficult to use and keep the BTC in your wallets and on any exchanges (like MT GOX) but as of now many exchanges and Wallets have User friendly interface which every buddy understand easily and liked too. Just like in your last Topic you just created, where you share your experience like how newbies prefer to use CEXs just because they sometimes do not like the technological terms included in Hardware wallets or in DEXs (as most of the DEXs have no User Friendly Interface). The point is, what if the current people who find current apps and technologies still hard to learn due to their interfaces then how would these people will survive or able to use the same technology back in 2010? Well, thank God to all developer who came into market with such software like SVP wallets and User friendly, CEXS and DEXs.",

      "body": "If I have to guess How did you do at the beginning to have bitcoins and how were they kept, it was simple that most of them preferred to mine and keep it in their wallets which were installed in their systems that were supposed to mine. Every Mining tutorial asked users to install a Bitcoin Wallet and that Bitcoin wallet was used to store the Bitcoins which they received after mining. Some of the users which joined a bit later had to buy it from an exchange called Mt.Gox which literally ran away with the user funds. So I guess those who mined themselves are bit safer and might have more chance of holding them since 2011-12.",

No, it wasn't so difficult to use,Bitcoin Core is basically still the same as Bitcoin QT, Â it hasn't changed much in terms of user friendlyness.Sure, there's a lot more Wallets today and some of them might be more user friendly than others,but that doesn't mean it was difficult to use in the early days, using it was always as easy as using email. Do you think email is difficult to use?The difficult part in bitcoin was never its usage, but to understand it, what it is, how it works,.. to wrap your head around it, that's the hard part and that didn't change at all.Quote from: Upgrade00 on July 16, 2023, 06:37:05 AM... mining them, this could have been eaisly done using a mobile device. Mobile device? When did anyone actually use a mobile device to mine bitcoin?As a proof-of-concept ....maybe, like that guy that mined with a pencil and a piece of paper.In 2010 \"mining\" was just an optional setting within the Bitcoin QT wallet that you could activate.If you did, your CPU mined blocks working in the background.Some smart people tried (and succeeded) to optimize that process and wrote their own mining software, which was faster than Bitcoin QT.If I remember correctly the first public GPU-mining-software came out around october 2010, GPUs were a LOT faster than CPUs so people started to use those.Then in 2011 came FPGAs, not that much faster than GPUs but a lot more energy-efficient and in 2013 the ASIC-era began.I've never heard of mobile mining devices,every \"app\" that tricked people into \"bitcoin mining\" was a scam.",

I guess it was reserved for the rather computer-savvy people? When did it get easier?IMO, it comes from mining and might also from the faucet which is very common at the early stage of Bitcoin.Because as I heard, mining was relatively easy and could be done using regular CPUs or GPUs that were commonly found in personal computers.Â  But now, mining became more competitive, leading to the development of specialized mining hardware (ASICs) that has higher computational power and energy efficiency. I assume that early miners typically stored their Bitcoins in software wallets or paper wallets, employing offline backups and secure storage practices.Â  But now, we have a hardware wallet that offers more security than any software wallet.When did get easier? It might be when CEX arrived like Mt. Gox.Â  These platforms acted as intermediaries, allowing users to trade fiat currency for Bitcoins and vice versa.Â  It was made easier without even having knowledge of mining.",

When did it get easier?Thank youI am new into bitcoin but from the little information that I have gathered so far,in the early days bitcoin was gotten through mining because mining was easy and one can mine directly from his phone. Another way is through faucet. In my country then how one do sell his bitcoin use to be through watsapp group,where people exchange crypto for our local currency. Although, sometimes you might get scammed and your coins is gone. It wasn't easy then to sell your bitcoin due to lack of trust but if you have a trusted person,it is no problem. CEx came in later and made life very easy for buying and selling of bitcoin.",

It seems that things were much simpler back then compared to today. The Bitcoin Qt software served as both a wallet and a mining tool, all addresses started with \"1,\" and the main security concern was safeguarding your wallet.dat file and private keys. In the early days, there were no altcoins (except for a few), SPV wallets (until Electrum came along), seed phrases, or SegWit addresses,... and scams were also far less common than they are now, mainly due to the smaller size and tight-knit nature of the early Bitcoin community. So yes, there are a thousand and one ways to acquire bitcoin today, but there are also just as many ways to lose it permanently.",
