When you're talking about bitcoin in general nothing has changed with bitcoin in other not to create fuse about bitcoin not serving it purpose of creation, but here we have the bitcoin improvement proposal (bips) which are the basic protocols implementation that works in consensus with the bitcoin network and blockchain as a whole, we have them in numbers and you can read then, bitcoin still serves and continue in serving being a decentralized digital currency and Satoshi's appearance or disappearance still change nothing about bitcoin he had created and blockchain has simplified it all, there are bitcoin consensus protocols that must follows with every transaction made on the blockchain.",

I appreciate if someone could explain those changes in plain English with examples. Core principles and Bitcoin base protocol didn't change, but there was a lot of bug fixes and small improvements since early Satoshi days.We now have different address types starting with 1, 3, bc1 and recently Taproot protocol was implemented, there is much more wallet clients now.There was several attempts to make bigger hard forks but this only resulted with forked shitcoins with much smaller prices and irrelevant trading volume and transactions.There is no easy way to explain this in a simple way if you don't understand coding, but you can study history of Bitcoin and check out code changes for yourself.You can always check change log from Bitcoin Core to see most important changes:https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/",
