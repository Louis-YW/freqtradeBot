Those are days that we also need withdrawal address and there are no mandated KYC.Maybe one of the surprises crypto in the list is Ethereum, the gas fees are very high as compare to let's say Bitcoin. So it doesn't make sense for gamblers to use it. But in the list I have used BTC, LTC and Tether.",

It has highest market cap and biggest trading volume, so naturally gambling sites or online platforms have many reasons to consider Bitcoin as their first accepted cryptocurrency before any altcoin.If you don't take Tether USDT into account, you will see rest coins are very old cryptocurrencies from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin to Dogecoin, they are all old altcoins.New altcoins can die and centralized and online platforms have more reasons and fear of listing/ accepting those new altcoins.How many cryptocurrencies failed?",

Perhaps litecoin made it into that position over tether base on transactional usage due to its low fee over tether.",

Less risk of rugpull than with Smart contract cryptocurrencies.New altcoin blockchains like Solana and Tron need market tests, security tests, hack tests practically before their blockchains can become stronger and attractive for people to use and companies to deploy on their platforms.Ethereum used to be in this comparative table when it was PoW.https://howmanyconfs.com/",

Even though Bitcoin fees is already cheap, but many casinos charge a lot additional fees.Not to mention many gamblers said gambling with Bitcoin aren't their choice because if they spent $100 today, it might worth $500 in the next 4 years.",

I was surprised too that TRON didn’t make the top 5 but not for Solana (im not fan of solana) overall I think TRON is still one of the most popular cryptocurrency for gamblers. We all know it has low transaction fee and most gamblers prefer it for that reason. Since most USDT transactions happen on TRON if im not mistaken so probably total activity is likely higher than what was shown in that ranking.",

I don't think we need any revaluation before accepting the fact that Bitcoin remains the high used cryptocurrency in whatever platform, and we have to accept the fact that gambling most especially the cryptocurrency gambling industry has been one of the biggest supporters of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, so yeah Bitcoin will always rank as highest used, if not some few times when transactions fees could be crazy on Bitcoin network I don't think anyone will consider using other coins to gamble aside Bitcoin, so the ratio of the other coins as just in the proportion of it alternative use when Bitcoin goes high in fees.",

The old timers in crypto does have millions of it just being wagered in yobit dice for like 50,000 doge every dice roll. One of the oldest casinos in crypto I think have started adding dogecoin even before its price turned $0.001 BTC is not surprising. People think Bitcoin was only created for geek's casino.",

And I'm under the impression that most gamblers still uses Bitcoin today as the fees are no longer a factor unlike last year when it goes very expensive and then we look for other options. I haven't used Solana or Doge, so not sure how quick it is. So the one that I used is Bitcoin and then USDT, obviously the latter as you might want to used it for slot and put the currency to a minimum like $0.1-$0.2. And I think this trend might continue as Bitcoin could still be the widely used crypto by most of us in the next couple of years.",
