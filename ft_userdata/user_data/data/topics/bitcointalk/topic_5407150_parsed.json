  "content": "Some of us might be aware about the ongoing protest in the province of Henan in China as thousands of people are unable to withdraw their funds from the banks.This is seem to be largest bank scam in the country after the four small banks in Henan province refused to pay the customers after they went to withdraw the funds from the banks but were unable to do so and till then the protest are going on there.The official of bank clims the system are being updated or in maintanence but have not communicated with them after that and people are protesting out there.So what's the safety of your funds in these banking institutions? You are unable to withdraw your funds only and have to take the street of protest for it?Quote The four banks that were the focus of the protests are believed to have frozen a total of 39bn yuan ($5.8bn; £4.9bn) of depositsSee how the protest are going on in the country and people are getting injured just to get their funds back as it's their savings and they can't let banks scam them but are being mistreated:The ongoing protest are getting violent day by day and authorities have claimed to give the funds back to the extent they can :Quote Advance payment will be released to customers with a combined amount of less than 50,000 yuan savings in one institution,\" it said.\"If the combined amount of a single institution is more than 50,000 yuan, the advance payment will be made successively, and the advance payment arrangement will be announced separately.\"The regulators asked customers to contact the association from 09:00 local time (02:00 BST) this Friday.But in the latest news the authorities have deployed tanks outside the banks to counter the protest and restricting people to enter the banks in Henan province :There is lot going on in these provinces at this time as people are eagerly waiting for their funds while the bank scams and protestors being suppressed by the forces and officials through these cheap tactics and when you will look into the matter there are many disruptive images for the protest going on.So this is why China doesn't want bitcoin because it can provide freedom to the people and they won't let it happen and you would find social media restrictions also there and they want full monopoly there but under these people are being suppressed and bitcoin is hope for them but they are being taken away from it.The bank getting scams and declaring your funds as investment products and completely restrict you from using your own funds is sign of how centralised chain of authority is curse for the society.This is where bitcoin empowers you and your funds are your own.BTCBTCFor more information read here;Tanks outside banks  Henan province bank protest",

The government wants to control the people and as such, need to control the flow of money. This is not possible with Bitcoin, hence the outright ban on it.In other less stringent countries, Bitcoin might be the solution, but no one can yet live solely on it as their basic currency, creating the need to hold fiat to a certain extent.",

      "body": "For many years, people believed banks were the safest and most secure place to store their wealth. I wonder if that is changing. Banks have accumulated a significant amount of negative headlines recently. Once bankers made great efforts to align their reputation and name brand with integrity and stability. It seems the ethics of banking could be cyclical in the way that some claim climate change is. They go through phases of being somewhat moral followed by phases of the inverse opposite. If the reputation of banks is damaged. I wonder how long it would take them to recover. Could it create a vacuum for other emerging upstarts to topple banks from their places on the top of the economic mountain. There are some who predicted this could occur. Can a culture of business or banking be sustainable over the long term, if it is built on a foundation of greed and corruption. This may be a crucial question that will be answered in the future. The concept of friendship being magic is a bit too cringe for most. What do people think of greed and corruption being magic. Maybe not a good type of magic, I'm thinking.",

I doubt that this situation however will have a strong effect on the opinion of the Chinese government on crypto currency as it is a known fact that they are quite a rigid set. It will take more than these, maybe a series of events for their opinion to change or be forced to change.",

While this is very seldom seen in the country, I hope this means that the Chinese people are now beginning to assert their right and freedom and are willing to voice it out on the streets if need be.Of course, the government would always repress, oftentimes with violence, such show of resistance from its people but at the very least it goes to show that the people in this totalitarian country actually have the courage to confront an unfair system.",

From here, the appearance of tanks becomes a completely unsurprising decision.Any transactions in cryptocurrency are recognized as criminally punishable. As for today's events, Chinese interest holders who cannot get their money are some kind of symbol that trust in banks will fall, but they are also in a position where the use of bitcoin is also prohibited.As the most pessimistic people who do not trust anyone say, the only way out is to keep money \"under the pillow.\"",

For instance, what if some of those people that are protesting want to pay for their electricity or food, how would they go about it? Well, as a small number of food suppliers and electricity suppliers offer payments in crypto, they would need to convert their crypto into FIAT, and then we go back to square one, and that is FIAT dependency. So let us not look at everything with rose-tainted glasses as there is much to be done still with BTC becoming the desirable currency.",

There's something wrong their for sure as we really don't hear that much news coming from them as obviously they are very secretive of every news that comes out from them. Just remind us of Tiananmen  square incident in the last 80's.For sure, this and other events show how bitcoin can be a safe haven from this centralized banking system.
