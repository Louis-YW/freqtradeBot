  "content": "Newbies should learn from this fast confirmed transactions tricksMy message today may not freak the senior gurus here but has turned me to a mini celebrity in my office and locality. Bitcoin transactions got many people frustrated for two weeks and counting, some transactions do not know the time they will get confirmed as I write. But I get my transaction confirmed everyday since I know about ViaBTC.What you don't know, you don't know and what you think is no more a secret to a community is a cherished secret elsewhere. ViaBTC was never known to me or people around me, this is until many of us were complaining to my hearing, two transactions of mine were stuck too, but fortunately I got to know ViaBTC via online search. It was a stressful search and many that I tested did not work until I finally got it right. The people I recommended it for has been thanking me, so I thought I should let newbie and novice that are in my shoes to know this.https://ibb.co/16rrYGQThe requirement is simple, just go to https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator and paste your transaction ID at the requested place and click on Free Submission or Paid Service depending on what you want. The difference is that the paid service can accelerate any transaction fee, but free submission will only accelerate the transaction provided the volume of a single transaction is ≤0.5 KB and the transaction fee rate is ≥ 0.0001 BTC/KB.Everybody I told that has been using 17sat/vb has been singing praise in less than 15 hours.",

They have only 100 slots per hour and the transaction size has to be below 500 bytes if you are to use the free version.The paid version is probably more expensive than just bumping the transaction with a higher fee if it's RBF enabled.",

      "body": "Paid transaction accelerator services usually charge more than it would take to prioritize the transaction and get it confirmed in no time, through the initial fee or by bumping it.ViaBTC is still effective for low weight transactions when transaction fees go really high and you can use it for free as long as the tx falls within the criteria. This is one reason to consolidate your smaller transactions when fees are cheaper so you can affordably transsct when the feerate rises.",

Except for the most recent transaction that had a problem, I am not sure about sometime back when transaction fee rate was up around 200-500 sats/vbyte. My 20 sats/vbyte transaction got confirmed with their help using the free service optionIt's probably the only legit free Bitcoin transaction accelerator I know about currently.",

The minimum fee rate to be eligible to use their free accelerator is 10 sat/byte (note that it's 10 sat/byte, not 10 sat/vbyte.)For a normal segwit transaction with 1 input and 2 outputs, the minimum required fee rate would be around 16 sat/vbyte.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on May 17, 2023, 10:28:03 PMand I'm unable to use their service because I used 10.13sat/vbyte for it, which makes it practical as they alerted me that the fee was too low.That's because your fee rate was below 10 sat/byte.",

So before this network fees have increased, that's all what it takes but way back then, you'll get confirmed by the miners even just for a 1 sat/byte fee but if you're in a hurry you have to opt to a 10 sat/byte fee + the usage of viabtc accelerator.I don't know if they've increased the fee since I'm paying fees now more than 20 sats/byte or the amount for what mempool is suggesting.But, that's really the minimum fee of your transaction should be for them to help you to accelerate it since I've been using it even until now.
