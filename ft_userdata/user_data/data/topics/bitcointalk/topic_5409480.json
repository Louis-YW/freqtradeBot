Specifically a bitcoin seed phrase for Ethereum?This may sound unnecessary to many, but will actually have the benefit that there is only one backup to be made and not many different backups. Of course. BIP 39 seed phrase is the common one. You can practically use one seed phrase to store all cryptocurrencies with its own derivation path.One major disadvantage is if somehow the seed phrase gets leaked or compromised, then all of your cryptocurrencies are lost.Quote from: ANSEL_2.0 on August 11, 2022, 10:24:30 AMI thought its partly open source but no problem I am good for now until I can lay my hands on a hardware wallet later.It was open-sourced, but now it isn't.Quote from: Teraboy on August 11, 2022, 10:30:10 AMseed phrase was getting generated randomly by the nodes that acquired from the blockchain and there was no universal seed phrase. the only possible thing used the seed phrase in the blockchain that have the same spesification like ethereum and BSC. Wrong. Seed phrase generation came from the entropy that is generated from the user device, not blockchain. And yes there are universal seed phrases, please browse around about BIP 32/39/44.",

It's a shame because I prefer using Trust wallet over other wallets, I thought its partly open source but no problem I am good for now until I can lay my hands on a hardware wallet later.Trust wallet is a non-custodial wallet and non-custodial means decentralized not centralized because you have your private key/recovery seed phrase when you create wallet on trust wallet. They are now not open source but that doesn’t mean they are already custodial since you still have your keys when using that wallet. Don’t get confused by some random comment and always do your own research.Learn more about Trust wallet: https://www.investopedia.com/trust-wallet-cryptocurrency-wallet-review-5270400",

But we all have our preferred way of using wallets and what we think is convenient for all of us. There are the pros and cons for each of them and whichever you choose, make sure that you're aware of how convenient they are and you're decided in using them.It's not all about the seed phrase's purpose why we choose a wallet but on this case for OP, he has the specific reason as he said.",

I don't think that it is possible the way that you are describing it because in the end the seed phrase can not be chosen when you create a wallet but it is presented to you and you need to write it down and never lose it in order to be able to access your funds even if your computer dies or something else happens. So you can not choose the same seed phrase for every wallet.But of course there is still the possibility to transfer all your funds to a multi currency wallet, like some others in this thread have already mentioned. Examples for such wallets are Exodus or Atomic. If you have everything in one wallet though this also means obviously that if this wallets gets hacked then you lose everything at once.",

Security will be the main issue here and since different project different network and a different system, I don’t think its feasible. Altcoins are meant to be as our alternative option, and that’s why many created their own unique phrase so the wallet details of their users can be more sate, if we only have one phrase just to save time from putting a lot of phrase I think its not worth it with the risk. Yes, two different network can’t be combine easily, a lot of work needs to be done and many will surely be discourage because of the risk issue.",

If this is possible, then in my opinion it will be easier for us to manage assets, since we only need to manage and store a single seed phrase for all assets. But about the security risk as you said, if unfortunately attacked, we will most likely lose all our assets. So you're better off storing different wallets to limit your risk, although keeping different seed phrases can take quite a while, but it's safer. I agree with you option 2.",

It is more like the seed phase compatibility, there are no such things as \"Bitcoin\" seed phrases. Generally, BIP 39 is mainly used since it is universally accepted across many wallets. You can try to generate a seed phrase on Metamask, and then try to import it to Electrum. It will work. Another example is try to play around with iancoleman BIP39 site: https://iancoleman.io/bip39/.",

So I don't think we can refer to BIP39 as a Bitcoin Seed Phrase.And yes, it is. Assuming the wallet is compatible, the BIP39 Seed phrase used for Ethereum, can also be used for Bitcoin.",
