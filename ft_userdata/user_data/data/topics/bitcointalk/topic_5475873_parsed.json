First is to make your rank increase or rank up to Jr. member which requires 1 merit and 30 activity points. Second is by buying copper membership and to buy copper membership is to go here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=credit;promote and you have to pay for it in BTC.

But nevertheless, if you have a post  that contains an image you might want to share for further understanding, then you can upload your image on Talkimg.com( Bitcoitalk image hosting site),  then copy and  drop the image link along side your post. A member may be willing to help your repost the image or you can request for a member to assist you.Edit: gave op 1 merit to enable him rank up to a junior member and be able to post images. Op, you can now post images with your new rank. Just upload them to talkimg.com, copy and paste the BBCODE full link. Lastly, you might consider locking this thread since you might have gotten enough replies for your question, to avoid repeated or spamming replies.",

Hope you can learn from here and later you can upload images to the forum yourself. Minimum Junior Member and Copper Member account is required to view uploaded images but you have already achieved Junior Member rank, hope you can view images with image link after uploading images.",
