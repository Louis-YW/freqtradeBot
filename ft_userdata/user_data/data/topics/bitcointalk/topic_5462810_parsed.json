Stable but less or higher reward but higher risk, it's your choice. Though I'm pretty sure that majority of us here would choose crypto investment, we are on a bitcoin forum aren't we? I also think that banks don't really give that much annual profit to their customers as in our country we can only recieve I think maximum 5% on physical banks. Both has risks but putting your money on crypto will grant you risks but yeah, I would personally put my money on crypto as I've been doing it for years. I'm just tired of the banks.",

Cryptos have higher risk so the reward should be higher. The risk with banks is lower so it will give lower return. But the structure of both investments are different. Trading of any kind is gambling and it comes with a huge risk. Daily profit is possible in both cases but that's not guaranteed. SoÂ  let's not compare these two very different investment choices. But cryptos have the power to make someone rich or bankrupt overnight.",

However crypto investment puts your capital at greater risk (main point).If we are going to put Bitcoin aside from the table then I will definitely go with the Banks and related investments. If we are going to compare this against the altcoins then I have better options with higher returns and fewer risks. For example, I can simply rely on Mutual funds, Recurring deposits, and Fixed Deposits and have as high as 8.15% to 22% returns on various investment instruments. I am not saying altcoins are that bad, but they are worst sometimes and they could make you broken fast. The only problem is their short life span, ability to lose the clients and their trust, and most importantly they go bankrupt or spammy in a very short period of time. These are the few points I never understood about the Altcoins that make it the worst investment for us. I am not blaming the entire altcoin ecosystem but this is the case with most of them and hence its worrisome.",

In terms of cryptocurrency especially if you are trading it, you run the risk of losing all your money if the trade is against your position and while hodling it also, some things can happen like if it is a shit coin the exchange may delist it. If the coin is only in one exchange and it is delisted, that means the coin and your cash is gone. Hodling to profit is only more reliable with bitcoin.",

Here in my country does only offer 2-3% per annum which it do really sucks. Knowing that banks is doing up some business with your stored funds then it isnt really that justifiable and this is why other people would be thinking on pulling out those funds and making up some investment on which this is really just a normal approach on which it is really just that the risks is really high compared when you are just simply putting your funds at the bank but of course it wont really be that increasing or would really be that huge interest even on storing it for a long time which it is would really be just that right or sensible for you to do so on having that kind of investment action or dealing despite of the risks but at least you do know that potential gains and profits would really be that much more bigger than let those funds sitting those at the bank in idle. In overall, it would really be just depending on the certain individual since not all would really be that sensible in towards their money and wants really to play safe and dont want to touch up risky things and this is why options and selections would really vary.",

But if you Invest in a bank, although the profit can be small and inflation might have also taken its toll, but you will still secure your capital and profit.But in Altcoins, if peradventure you invest in a coin during its ATH and it drips to a new level of ATL, then you probably would have more loss on your asset.

It's not always like that as if it's easy to say that they can earn quickly and do that without having problems. In fact, many traders are problematic in day to day basis because instead of making profits, they are incurring losses. It sounds nice and chill when someone talks about traders and the market, wherein reality things are too complicated and hard to do if we'll check out the facts.",

There might be years where in some countries the FD rate goes above 10% but than at those times, inflation is also high. Still 8-10% is a generous rate. There are less risks involved on saving on modern banks and the yield is also lower. Even at the rate of 12% compounded, your money would double in 6 years. Another good investment available around the world are stocks, choosing a better one is easier and their returns are mostly better than banks.And there's altcoins, with most of us are hoping for x2 or x3 in a couple of years and some adventurous of us x10 or x100.The best strategy would be to diversify your investment between banks, stocks, real estates and crypto.",
