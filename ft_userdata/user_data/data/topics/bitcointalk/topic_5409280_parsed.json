Maybe if we set off thousands of nukes, maybe then we might be able to affect climate change.NASA admits climate change occurs because of changes in Earth's solar orbit...Quote from: https://www.sott.net/article/420049-NASA-admits-climate-change-occurs-because-of-changes-in-Earths-solar-orbit-not-because-of-SUVs-and-fossil-fuelsFor more than 60 years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has known that the changes occurring to planetary weather patterns are completely natural and normal. But the space agency, for whatever reason, has chosen to let the man-made global warming hoax persist and spread, to the detriment of human freedom.It was the year 1958, to be precise, when NASA first observed that changes in the solar orbit of the earth, along with alterations to the earth's axial tilt, are both responsible for what climate scientists today have dubbed as \"warming\" (or \"cooling,\" depending on their agenda). In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet by driving SUVs or eating beef, in other words.But NASA has thus far failed to set the record straight, and has instead chosen to sit silently back and watch as liberals freak out about the world supposedly ending in 12 years because of too much livestock, or too many plastic straws.In the year 2000, NASA did publish information on its Earth Observatory website about the Milankovitch Climate Theory, revealing that the planet is, in fact, changing due to extraneous factors that have absolutely nothing to do with human activity. But, again, this information has yet to go mainstream, some 19 years later, which is why deranged, climate-obsessed leftists have now begun to claim that we really only have 18 months left before the planet dies from an excess of carbon dioxide (CO2)....",

Why is everyone trying to make it seem like there is a big climate change conspiracy done by scientists? Yes, climate change is a natural process, however, our planet is equipped with mechanisms to counter, lessen, or just keep those changes on track to where the environment can (in most cases) can adapt to them. What you are missing from this short story is that human climate impact has tilted and jolted that natural safety mechanism and the planet is unable to catch up to it. So no, climate change is not caused by humans, we just sped up the process, removed the safety measures, and put everything out of wack. Good job.",

Until you realize two things about science, your faith in it is misplaced:1. Science is mostly not understood by the scientists who are discovering/examining it, until...2. the engineers come in and attempt to use the science, thereby correcting the mistakes the scientists make.The way you seem to have faith in science is the same way religious people have faith in God.

In fact, 'green' is just barely hanging on with all the subsidies it gets from government. And the war in Europe has shown the Western European governments just how little 'green' really works. To promote 'green' is to promote failure so that when people realize how much of a failure it is, they will dive back into oil all the way.I know. We all need to wake up and put a little more depth and scope into our thinking. I commend you for your attempts.",

Global warming is simply part of the climate change up and down swing.Possibly mankind just might be able to kill off most life on planet earth - by using things like chemtrails and pharmaceuticals dispersal. But the Great Barrier Reef near Australia shows us we are failing in that project.Mainstream media downplays good news at Australia’s Great Barrier ReefQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-mainstream-media-downplays-good-news-at-gbr.html#There has been a massive rise in the annual growth of coral over Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR). According to the 2021-2022 annual summary from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), the level of coral cover in the northern and central areas of the reef is now at its highest levels over the past 36 years of monitoring.However, this excellent news is being downplayed by mainstream media. This comes as no surprise as the demise of the world’s coral reefs has been the go-to poster scare for climate change activists.In October 2020, the BBC told stories of the reef losing half its coral, while the Guardian set the coral doomsday ball rolling in 1999 by reporting that the “imminent destruction of the world’s coral reefs is not a scare story,” adding that “global heating could jeopardize recovery.”Still, many believe that the notion of global warming causing corals to die is a fib that “environmentalists” made. Tropical coral, which is closely related to its cnidarian cousin, the jellyfish, thrives in waters between 24 to 32 C. They are highly adaptable, but seem to dislike sudden changes in temperature, which are often caused by natural weather phenomena such as El Niño events.The latest results from AIMS show that coral quickly recovers when localized conditions return, and often grows faster in warmer waters nearer the equator than in the GBR. This lie suggests that minor long-term sea temperature changes will wipe out the coral, but scientific evidence suggests otherwise.Evidence shows coral reefs are not actually dyingData from AIMS showed that growth can be seen in the northern reef, and recovery is said to have continued following a “period of cumulative disturbances” from 2014 to 2020....",

They have recently released a report showing that the globalists believe they are losing the propaganda and information war regarding climate. The opponents who are singled out as “super-spreaders” of “disinformation” are surprising in several ways.(Article republished from FreeWestMedia.com)The extremely well-financed and influential globalist think tank Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), the Institute works with influence campaigns directed at the populations of Europe and is paid for by these populations’ own authorities as well as globalists such as Bill Gates and George Soros.One of the ISD’s focus areas is to monitor those who question or contradict the establishment climate narrative that there is global warming due to man-made carbon dioxide emissions. On June 9, the ISD published a 115-page report entitled Deny, Deceive, Delay: Documenting and Responding to Climate Disinformation at COP26 & Beyond.COP26 (Climate Change Conference 26) was the United Nations climate change conference that took place last year between October 31 and November 13 in Glasgow, United Kingdom. At least 120 world leaders and over 40,000 registered participants, including 22 274 party representatives, 14 124 observers and 3 886 media representatives flew there to discuss how people could be made to emit less carbon dioxide.MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER is an American author and democratic politician, including a gubernatorial candidate in California. He has been named “Hero of the Environment” by the news magazine Time and is a winner of the Green Book Award. Shellenberger has been called by the establishment “environmental guru”, “climate guru” and “North America’s leading public intellectual on clean energy” and “high priest” of the environmental movement. After he changed his mind, he is now singled out as one of six people that the globalists especially emphasize as a threat to their climate narrative, not least because he comes from their own ranks.

When people thought they could build a biosphere habitat, where they would live sealed off from the world, it barely worked for a period of time. Ultimately it failed.QuoteThe above graph compares global surface temperature changes (red line) and the Sun's energy received by Earth (yellow line) in watts (units of energy) per square meter since 1880. The lighter/thinner lines show the yearly levels while the heavier/thicker lines show the 11-year average trends. Eleven-year averages are used to reduce the year-to-year natural noise in the data, making the underlying trends more obvious.The amount of solar energy Earth receives has followed the Sun’s natural 11-year cycle of small ups and downs with no net increase since the 1950s. Over the same period, global temperature has risen markedly. It is therefore extremely unlikely that the Sun has caused the observed global temperature warming trend over the past half-century.Is the Sun causing global warming?No. The Sun can influence Earth’s climate, but it isn’t responsible for the warming trend we’ve seen over recent decades. The Sun is a giver of life; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. We know subtle changes in Earth’s orbit around the Sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the ice ages. But the warming we’ve seen in recent decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth’s orbit and too large to be caused by solar activity.One of the “smoking guns” that tells us the Sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of solar energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites, which tell us that there has been no upward trend in the amount of solar energy reaching our planet.A second smoking gun is that if the Sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a buildup of heat-trapping gases near Earth's surface, and not by the Sun getting “hotter.”https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/14/is-the-sun-causing-global-warming/NASA admits the Sun isn't causing global warming^^^^(And they do a really good job explaining why they know it's not)",

You know about the mammoths frozen in the ice in northern lands... some with grass they were eating still in their mouths and still in their stomachs. What does this mean? You might be able to think of more things, but to me it means that the Northern lands were once way warmer than they are not... maybe as warm in some areas as the African jungles. Or do you think aliens took the mammoths out of the African jungles and dropped them in Northern Siberia and Northern Canada? Lol.Look at the chart in your link. Notice that the chart goes for about 140 years. Notice on the right side that the temperature only rises over that period to the tune of 2 decrees C. That's less than 4 degrees Fahrenheit, in 140 years! Do remember the mammoths from the previous paragraph? At best, the earth is super-slowly trying to get back to normal.Now, if you look at this 140-year chart, you will see the little 11-year sun cycles plotted in. Notice how much larger the heat waves of each 11-year cycle are. But the global warming and cooling is much less, though cumulatively it adds up to a whopping less-than-4-degrees Fahrenheit in 120 years.\"WORRY! WORRY! Global warming is going to get you... maybe next week!\" Lol.Personally, I can't wait for the healthy, warm planet we used to have.",

It really isn’t brain surgery. The farther from the giant flaming ball we’re circling in space you get, the cooler the temperature. That’s the main factor.",
