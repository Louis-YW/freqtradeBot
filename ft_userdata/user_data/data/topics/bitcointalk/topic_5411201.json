  "content": "Hey all,Would love your opinion on this.I'm spending an increasing amount of time in the counterparty/XCP (bitcoin blockchain) collectible space and while there are channels and web marketplaces for artist's to sell their physical work, I think that this may also be a place given some of our past sales history and our collective community proclivity. Several of the XCP artists I'm in touch with may be interested in listing their physical work here - an original painting, drawing or rendering of their NFT, or of other artists work that they've been gifted, bought or traded for - all XCP/BTC project based, and in my estimation, all collectible.As my first love (and collection) is art, I'm compelled to support some of these artists here if there's a market and interest from our community.Would love opinions and am open to suggestions as well.Thanks.sweeteye",

Digital NFT collectors will not only flood the forum, but the amount of theft/scams/negative activity will increase also. Glad to hear that and I hope the consensus here would remain that physical art with digital assets (NFTs) is a good thing.I disagree with you from my experience with XCP on the bitcoin blockchain.In fact, more scams have been perpetrated on the forum in the collectibles group during the time I've been involved with groups on XCP. Like here, there's a solid community of people looking out for each other and newbies, warning of fraud or bad actors.And in terms of the physical collector like myself looking to also have digital assets, or the digital collector learning about physicals, you're right the forum will be flooded with hungry, passionate collectors on the BTC blockchain.",

They are also subject to forgeries and scams.Like physical items, if the NFTs are made and stored correctly they can last a long time.Xcer is making dope physical collectibles/NFTs minted on the XCP blockchain.I'm not sure of the tech, but I'm not crazy about the XXCER.prefix (ie. XXCER.RARECOLLECTIBLE) that gets tagged onto historical assets when redeemed. That and having to use their site to redeem the NFT (I wouldn't anyway, I'd leave it locked on the card) is adding another party to depend upon/trust and we've seen how that worked out with Titan, a once reputable coinmaker.I have no issue buying their originally created/minted sets, though, and as stated above, I'd leave the NFT locked on the card (I think, as an example, of a fully funded and a peeled coin - you retain the physical, but you've sold off or moved the coresponding value - somebody correct me if this is a bad anology).Not a shill for them, but they probably have the coolest complete set of 21 baseball cards (or 42 baseball NFT's) you'll ever own: https://xcer.co/product/1649859332876x495965899793615170And then there's that thing about the forum. I wouldn't say it's dying, but it's definitely changing and maybe going through a bit of a staid period. We've seen an influx of new buyers and enthusiasts from at least one coinmaker's Twitter following, and that's probably good for the forum in the long term, the same way that an influx of new collector's, artists and maker/creators is a good thing.Y'all all just gotta look out for y'all~",
