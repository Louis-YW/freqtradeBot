Where to start, where to end, which one to read first, which one to read quickly, etc. I lost interest in reading my posts. Just then, it occurred to me that it wouldn't be this way; I have to start from scratch, and to maintain the order and beauty of a place, I have to first obey the rules of that place. Only then can I propel myself to my next step. So I am starting to know the rules of the forum by reading the post at this link  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0 Because nothing is above the rules. To keep the community clean, we (especially us newbies) need to follow the forum rules and posts. We have to slowly move forward in this journey of Bitcoin by following the rules of the forum community.We newbies hope you will surely benefit from the link post, like me.Please correct me if there is any mistake in what I said.",

This might not be related to your topics but here’s a list of links that will help you improve your knowledge, and keep in mind that no one here is perfect so if you encounter any problems do well to use the search option and if you still couldn’t get any solutions then go ahead and create a thread like you just did, but make sure you kind the type of threads you create so that you won’t end up creating threads every two minutes which will later turn to spam.

I discover this forum 2015 but I didn't create an account since I don't know exactly what to do here while I can still browse all the post available on all the board.I have courage to register in the forum after I already find my interest in crypto and to determine which I really like to discover here. On my case, I'm interested on altcoin trading on c-cex and at the same time joining on hyip and doubler. These is what makes me pursue Bitcointalk and later discover more on Bitcoin since it's the primary discussion here.Determine what you really and search it so that you can have reason on your stay here. Browsing tons of post and discussion will surely makes you lost since you don't have any idea what they are talking. Focus on one topic at a time.",

The plagiarism policy is very strict, with less severe policies for spam and AI posts, in which you receive a warning or the post will be deleted. The only unusual thing that you should be aware of is plagiarism, which leads to you being banned without any warning, but all the other rules are simple and should be followed by anyone who wants a healthy discussion.",

      "body": "Welcome OP. It is nice having you here. As a matter of fact, all you have said is the raw truth and nothing different from the truth. You know it is normal that every organisation, platforms, groups etc all have rules, guidelines and principles which they must abide by to keep them together and for things to work orderly and accordingly. Same is applicable here and for the fact that you took such step, it shows that you are willing and ready to learn more about bitcoin and this platform. As i can see you already have started doing that. However, some links have already been posted here by members which would be of help to you and i believe if you read them accordingly, you would benefit from them.Avoid plagiarism here because the community frowns at it and if caught in the act might result to you likely being tagged. So therefore, you should do well to always reference your post if you copied it from else where so that it would not make you face some backlash here. As a newbie, what you will just have to do now is concentrate on reading, learning to gain more knowledge. You can ask question here if you feel there is anything you are lacking in knowledge here and you want to get clarification on.Lastly, I do not know where you are from but i will advice you to locate your local board as there is a local board session where one can freely interact with their locals and also communicate with their local language for better and easier understanding. Here you can meet with other members you would also guide you through your stay here.You can as well ask question there as it bothers you.",

And these prizes includes devoting yourself to first discover where you are and then followed by the orderliness of the rules and then looks at where their discussion are channeling to before jumping into discussion or going elsewhere to source information to share here. Apparently here is the number places that highly prioritize rules and orderliness whomever that can't maintain and cultivate a reading mentality would always finds it difficult to scale through this forum which I know too well that here is a free place but the ability to remember some of the rules and abides to them is the major headaches.",
