I was on Coin Market Cap an hour ago, and looked at the stable coins. They are all except USDT well below a dollar. All were up 3 to 5% today and still wasnt up to a dollar. They were moving around like they were being fed to try and stay in their dollar spot. I got a bad feeling about today and/or tomorrow. Keep close eye out and react quickly. Hope I am wrong, but its strong enough feeling I just had to say something. Good luck!!    Brandon",

Good luck!!    BrandonAre you talking about correction is due to happen after these continues surge of Bitcoin and some cryptocurrency?  Well,  we already have seen the price of Bitcoin being corrected probably it is affected by the news about SEC cracking staking on some exchanges.  It did bring some bad news and we have seen how the market sentiment reacted negatively.   There is even news about bitcoin to possibly retest $20k since it is looking for support on that area[1].[1] https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/13/first-mover-asia-bitcoin-might-test-20k-as-it-looks-for-support/",

Good luck!!    BrandonYou must be reading the charts wrong or looking at really exotic stable coins. Major stable coins such as USDC, USDT, DAI are holding around $1. The 24h low for BUSD, after the bad news from the SEC, is 0.9988, so it's -0.12% against $1, so no need to panic for now. However, this does not change the fact that we have recently witnessed increased SEC activity, very unfavorable for the world of cryptocurrencies. You're right that we should to be vigilant.",

We're actually experiencing some blood bath for the start of this week and that's normal. If you're feeling bad for today and tomorrow, that's okay.That's the uncertainty that everyone feels when we see the market isn't going up and that's a normal encounter as you stay on this market. A bomb or not based on your description, we've seen the market went up and recovered a bit so, it's expected that it shall go through a correction.",

Name those stable coins, every stable coin i looked at seemed acting perfectly normal with like 0.02% waving.Please show me the screenshots of the charts or links to charts you were looking at or i will just rule this out as fud.

Good luck!!    BrandonDollar-backed stablecoins will function normally until something terrible happens to the dollar itself. Until then, their rate will fluctuate upwards within one dollar, deviating very slightly from bitcoin units. So far, there are no particular reasons for concern. The economy of the United States and almost all other countries is now in decline, but this state is temporary. This has happened before, and more than once. All falls are inevitably replaced by a period of economic growth.",

Sideways markets have always been a characteristic of the crypto market, and what's happening right now is pretty similar. As for stablecoins, of course they won't really be trading far off from one dollar as that is what their purpose are. If they stray too far from their intended valuation, then Tether or any other organization handling those stablecoins would do the necessary adjustments to keep the price up or down to acceptable levels.",

The collateral of these stablecoins itself is questionable and they price these tokens are not as stable as they should be, judging from their name. You don't even have to talk about algorithmic stablecoins, they were born to always experience de-peg.

Good luck!!    BrandonThis feeling will definitely not go away and its part and parcel of the cryptocurrency market most especially when you constantly do a dollar cost avaraging. Most stablecoins are below their dollar cost and even though they recover back to $1:1 it won't take long before the price still slide a little below that and sometimes $0.98.-This is something that we should get used to as long as the market continues to either recover or slide further.",

Good luck!!    BrandonIt's ok we understand your concern about stable coins, perhaps one of the reasons is that SEC categorized BUSD as securities in which Paxos disagrees,QuotePaxos categorically disagrees with the SEC staff because BUSD is not a security under the federal securities laws. This SEC Wells notice pertains only to BUSD. To be clear, there are unequivocally no other allegations against Paxos. Paxos has always prioritized the safety of its customers' assets. BUSD issued by Paxos is always backed 1:1 with US dollar-denominated reserves, fully segregated and held in bankruptcy remote accounts. We will engage with the SEC staff on this issue and are prepared to vigorously litigate if necessary.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paxos-issues-statement-301745616.htmlSo this might be the start though, and that's why many stable coins are below 1 dollar.That statement or ruling from SEC really put all the stable coins on the limelight again, and it doesn't look good to be honest.",

The counter forces are always nagging up and down to keep the stablecoin valued at $1. Plus dollar itself is getting little hardy these days. I think its really normal.",
