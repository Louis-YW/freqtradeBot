I looked at the Electrum github and at first I didn't see anyone mentioning this problem.",

You can not have option to get a private key for one public address.Quote from: Lucius on May 13, 2023, 09:53:18 AMI can confirm that on version 4.3.4, which I still use, there is an option to view the private key for each address individually, although I personally have never needed something like that.

However the 4.4.2 version seems complicating the features.In previous versions you were able to set your preferences from one window using several tabs but it seems now they have less information to set from the preference window. When you try to send and receive bitcoin then there are separate options to set up you personal preferences only for the transaction you are about to do. It makes the job redundant to be honest.",

But I will advise to have a hard copy of the the private key and the seed phrase because for you to uninstall the app and install it again, you have to insert the seed phrase to bypass the stage. Or probably you should have a copy in inside your phone gallery or message. Anywhere you can keep it save. This new Electrum Wallet is really confusing. The atmosphere has changed and everything is different from the old one. The only thing I see on the home is receive and send then if you want to do anything you have to click the name of the wallet to that the down drop list. I like the form design.",

Or probably you should have a copy in inside your phone gallery or message. Anywhere you can keep it save. As he said in the post you quoted, he was away from home at the time he needed the private keys. Hence, he didn't have a hard copy of them. I assume you mean a physical backup when you said \"hard copy\". I wouldn't recommend carrying that with you for your travels. It's better to prepare some UTXOs you want to use and not carry your whole bags. Additionally, no digital backups should exist of your main stash. If you must have something, then only to a hot wallet you could afford to lose.",

I wanted to uninstall and install back electrum on my Android Electrum for some reasons.What you were about to do 'in the field' is very unsafe, particularly with an Android device (not much better if at all with iOS).So your wallet is made up with imported private keys. I assume the following steps you intended:* display a private key* copy it to clipboard, then paste it somewhere on your device (usually the keyboard app is involved here, too)* repeat until you copy/pasted all your private keys of your wallet* de-install Electrum, then re-install the app on your Android* create new wallet and paste all earlier private keysThe safety issue here on an Android device is at minimum: a lot of other apps can subscribe to changes to the clipboard, you have no control whatsoever which app might get to know your private keys. Can you trust your keyboard app? Some fancy keyboard apps are sometimes a real privacy nightmare, particularly the 3rd party ones.Correct me if I'm wrong in my assumption of your steps, but anyway it's bad and unsafe practice.",

Well it's not complicated, it's rather uncomfortable due to some significant changes.The idea behind versioning is to make the software and/or application more user friendly. This is to say that the latest version would be more user friendly and secured than the previous version. But, if by any means, after an update, a precious user struggles severely to use the said app or even prefer the former version, I can say that the update is unwanted or its purpose is defeated.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on May 21, 2023, 05:22:05 PMThere is a way, which is to make a screenshot and use an application that converts images into words, but I do not know whether there is a screenshot activated inside the wallet or not, not to mention the risks.I cannot remember being able to take screenshot in an electrum wallet. Even if I know the security advantage of it, I will always sweep my fingers to screenshot and then nothing will happen.",
