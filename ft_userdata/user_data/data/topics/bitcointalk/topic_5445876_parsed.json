I already know that there will be a lot of voices against this but I at least for sure agree.There is a reason why some people in some countries have a lot of faith in their government and some have almost none, and this is a bit ironic, you go and vote (well in democracies, not NK or Russia) and then you argue the ones you've voted can't be trusted. Every single government is made up of people, people from that country, that have grown up there gone to the same schools as many more, and played with a lot of the future \"plebs\" it's not like the authority in that country whatever the brach, law or judicial has a will of its own, it's still a group of persons behind it. Quite interesting, the same people who wouldn't trust anybody to run the country have no problem flying with a plane with a stranger and not thinking for a moment the pilot might be high or on a suicide drive. How many ask themselves how capable the bus or uber driver is before stepping in?Much of the \"distrust\" when it comes to politics is mainly about stuff they don't like personally, not much else.Quote from: Bananington on March 22, 2023, 06:30:18 AMIf there had not been any reason to not trust the people in control, the idea of a decentralized system will never have been.Decentralization under different forms happened way before Bitcoin, it's present in the US when it comes to local government or education, it's present in technology with distributed databases, it's present in commerce and tourism when you have different hotels or chain stores that despite carrying the same brand they have different prices, different merchandise, and a ton more. Quote from: Bananington on March 22, 2023, 06:30:18 AMKnowing how things can get out of hand when everyone is left to do as they please, don't you think that the freedom and anonymity from bitcoin will be really abused when accepted and adopted for use even more than some people do now? Regulation or no regulation, people will abuse everything, give a man anything from a broom to a flower pot, a keyboard, or a pie and he will eventually hit somebody in the head with it instead of using it as it should. Â Fertilizers should be used for growing crops and trucks to carry furniture around, yet we have idiots making IEDs out of them.There will always be abuse, regulations and punishment might reduce it, not make it disappear.",

I already mentioned many times that I can do a KYC without much of an issue although I am doing as much as possible some sort of privacy like using platforms that are not asking for KYC for all of its users. I don't usually trust people especially those at the top. We already know throughout history that those at the top aren't really honest with their ordinary citizens. People nowadays are craving more privacy and decentralization due to the many failures of those on top that are in control. They aren't serving the good of everyone anyways but rather they are serving themselves and the people within their circles.",

And because it's the government choosing them, these regulations would be bad for bitcoin. That's why we probably need a long time before bitcoin will be regulated correctly.",

Truthfully, I love Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ideology very well, and presently, I am making daily income from the opportunity the coins have brought. But this doesn't mean I should be selfish, our dear cryptocurrencies will still be active, yet, regulations will cover up for the illicit flows that the evil users are using.I read one article on this, and it so much agrees with what I thought about the who situation. Before cryptocurrency, scammers, terrorists, money launderers, and traffickers use other tighter means that is stringent for them. But now, they use crypto, which is worrisome.No matter how much we love cryptocurrency and want to support it, should we selfishly hate our society?Only regulations can reduce these illegal financial rates. Else, people will do as they like, and most people don't care if the whole world collapses as long as they are benefiting.",

This I agree with, but I'm not gonna generalize this reasoning for all centralized services. I've heard more about cases of service injustice controlling user wealth since I've been in the crypto space. The reason that might make sense is the difficulty of resolving legal steps when cases such as unilateral control occur, so this serves as protection for services to make any decisions that are unfair.",

When you use bitcoin you no longer need the banks, the same banks that use YOUR money to lend money to other people and worse of all run \"fractional banking\" (they lend more money that they have!) and have turned to basically usury centers and are also ruining the economy by creating more and more liquidity and inflation.With bitcoin you eliminate them.When it comes to regulations, I never had any problems with the spirit of regulations. After all we are living in a regulated world. The problem is always about the fact that when most governments (specially in democracies) talks about regulation, they are talking about control and surveillance. It is also extremely rare that a regulation helps bitcoin or its users.Take regulating exchanges for example, all they do is increase their surveillance on exchanges. They don't do anything about the scam nature of them or the fact that when they run away, go bankrupt or get hacked the users have nowhere to run to.",
