  "content": "Ethereum went to POS on September 15, 2022. POS is an acronym for Proof of Stake or Proof of Stake. Simply put, Ethereum cannot be mined on video cards. Many were skeptical about the new term, of which there were already quite a few. But in the summer of 2022, the first Ropsten test bench was launched, which was supposed to prove the safety of the merger. After it, Sepolia was launched, followed by Goerli. All testnets have been successfully merged, and the final date has been announced as September 15, 2022. There are still rumors that two networks may remain for the time being, one will work on the POW algorithm, the other on the POS algorithm. But these are just rumors so far, and most likely this will not happen.",
