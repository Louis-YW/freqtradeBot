      "body": "There is no problem with the transaction rather than the low fee rate. The actual amount paid for the transaction could have gotten it confirmed but due to the high number of inputs (5) and the outputs (3) the fee rate seems to be a bit lower. With the RBF opt in on the transaction i Would advise you bump the fee more. Free Acceleration wouldn’t work because it surpasses the requirement to meet, the transaction size is big except if it is a paid one. I wouldn’t also advise a paid accelerator because looks cheaper. A paid acceleration is above $10 in fee but with Atleast $7-$10 you will get the transaction confirmation at a fee rate of 50 sats/vbyte. So if you’re in a hurry to get your transaction confirmed use the RBF option or even the CPFP option if the receiving address belongs to you and it is a non custodial wallet",

If you can wait, let's wait 2 more days before bumping the fee.If you want it to be confirmed sooner but not too much, bump the fee to 25 sat/vbyte that is about 8 vMB from tip of mempool. Don't bump the fee rate to more than 30 sat/vbyte because you will waste your satoshi for transaction fee.",

Or will this be cancelled?Ohh I thought the sending address belongs to you that means you are receiving which I saw three addresses with two having small amounts. Then you can’t possibly do a CPFP with that little amount.  Yes you can wait and see since the fee rate is around 50 sats/vbyte now and your transaction is 20 sats/vbyte you should just wait and probably the transaction fee rate could get down more. Or better still if there is a way contact the sender to bump it using RBF. Also the transaction could also get dropped back to the sender address at least after two weeks( although could be more due to nodes difference in purging transactions) if the transaction is not rebroadcasted again",

Your money will not be lost as the transaction may be cancelled within 14 days of not being confirmed. If the size is small, you can accelerate it through viabtc. I recently did a transaction that lasted that long. I could not accelerate same because the size was too big, so Had to wait for 14 days for the transaction to be cancelled after which I sent it again with a higher fee and it was confirmed within 24 hours. Trust wallet sometimes split the fees thereby making the size of the transaction too big.",
