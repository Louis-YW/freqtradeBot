  "content": "Guys I was using exchanges for the bitcoin but after having some discussion with my friends due to few issues with exchanges I installed Electrum and as experiment I send a small amount to my friend, but sadly it's not works for me. Now I have question why this not works for me because it's almost 18 days, and It's still showing pending even I spend 700 Satoshis as fees, so any solution for this. Can I cancel this, or I have to wait for the to be settled, and why is this happening on electrum any updates about this could be appreciated?Here is Txid  2f37443a344a5c5c05d361713616a89db702a6dcc68abf30ed5f188375e7cc09",

I have done right-click on transaction and I have one more option cancel double spent please give some information about this what is this and how can we use these thanks.",

I hope it is more than 10 sat/vbyte now. Or you can post the txid like the one you posted above so that we can know if you can use ViaBTC accelerator to accelerate the transaction. Or just use ViaBTC free accelerator by inputting your txid into the space seen on the website and submit it. https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/About cancel transaction, it is also RBF transaction, but in a way that it would be sent back to an address on your Electrum wallet. Increasing the fee is needed for it too, just like to pump the transaction.",

The issue is that you have not increased/pump the fee to at least 10 sat/vbyte. You can still do that on Electrum. You can let us know the txid once you do that. Just for experiment because txid supposed not to be shared, for privacy purpose, to serve as proof of payment only. After you increase the fee on Electrum, it would be accelerated on ViaBTC.
