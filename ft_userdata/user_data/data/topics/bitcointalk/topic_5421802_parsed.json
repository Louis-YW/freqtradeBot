Maybe the comparison is not the best, but considering how the forum works, no one can force the person behind that account to pay the old debt.It is tragic that such user accounts can participate in any campaigns at all, which means that those who accept them are worse than them.",

In the past or even currently, I have participants who defaulted loan but wanted to join my campaign, they sent me PM asking if I will accept. I told them to settle the debt and promised to give a try on my campaign. Some worked very well and the lender got his money back.Coming here, creating a scam accusation thread, leaving a negative tag, supporting flag and not giving a chance to redeem means nothing. Lender do not get his money, loan taker do not pay his debt. One side lose his cash and other side lose the entire account. Isn't it good to give the other side some motivation to settle their debt?",

Assuming he gets paid $75 weekly, that'd be around 40 weeks assuming he doesn't mind posting for \"free\"that won't happen for sure. I believe that the reputation of that account is no longer important to the new owner. like all red-marked users, they will probably get involved in disputed flagged campaigns like 1xbit and similar. they have already shown that they do not want to participate much in the improvement of the forum.unfortunately, nothing should be expected from the return of this loan. if the original owner took out a loan, nothing prevents him from creating a new account and presenting his story with possibilities of repaying the debt (judging by his previous positive ratings).",

Creating a new account (which probably he already did and watching) is fine but why would he expose the new account, risk to get red tag and repay $3k? The amount seems a lot of money to him.Behind the face of reputation, some people are scammer in their heart. I sometimes doubt those scam busters. What is their incentive? Build an account as they are some authority figure of the community, take loan, do projects, do charity and when they think it's time to disappear, they disappear. There are many high rank users who are loan defaulter. They were active and seemed very caring to the forum members. Always active busting alt accounts, always active to aware users against scam projects. They spend their entire life busting scammers, tagging them and even leaving unnecessary neutral tag. All to achieve some sort of attention and build up reputation. But eventually the same person scam another member when they find a good opportunity. Not long ago a charity where most of the members were from Philippine scammed around 1 BTC (I can not remember the amount but it was around this amount). The name was bitcointalk charity I guess.Sorry for your loss zazarb. It's gone and hope for nothing.",

As the user scammed you would you like to create flag type 3 so that it shows \"Warning: Trade with extreme caution!\"Also on this post as well as the next post if scammed happens would you like to correct the following:Reference Link: it should be the link where we can see the reference. For this case, it should be this one.Proof of Payment: it should be the link to the payment. For this case, it can be the transaction id of the payment if more than one transaction then you should post all the transaction id. I think this is one of them. Another one, another one which is the largest one I think. I think this wallet id has been used only to scam you.",
