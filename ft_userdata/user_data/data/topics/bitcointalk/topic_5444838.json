  "content": "Does anyone know of such a channel? Can be a start-up with few subscribers yet...I'm looking for a channel that's Bitcoin only, and sums up the main Bitcoin news every day in a short and sweet way with commentary (English language only).The same format as Altcoin Daily basically, but for Bitcoin Maxis (no alts).I know about all the biggest channels, like Simply Bitcoin etc, of course, but none of them quite \"fit the bill\".Anyway, if nothing like that exists, it might be a good idea to start one...I would do it myself, but too busy and not native English speaker.Thanks!",

Bitcoin in itself is pretty boring(and this is a good thing); that frequently at times there will barely be any decent news that people will be interested in. Hence why YouTubers are simply incentivized to cover the broader cryptocurrency space. Would love to see someone try though.",
