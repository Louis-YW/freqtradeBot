But even though many countries around the world term Bitcoin as an illegal currency the truth remains that the citizens are still dealing with Bitcoin as a p2p alternative currency. So I believe shortly some other countries are going to reason in the positive direction and adopt Bitcoin just like El Salvador and the Central African Republic that have adopted Bitcoin already.",

People are rooting for adoption like it will resolve everything, but adoption is not only governments adopting crypto, it's also people doing the same and actually using BTC as a valid payment source, not just an economically unstable country buying a bunch of BTC and thinking it's a get out of jail card.",

      "body": "Bitcoin usage will continue to increase as we start to put more pressure on the current financial system. We are definitely headed towards a future that is very different than the one we live in today. Bitcoin adoption will not end in 2022, but its adoption will gain momentum in the years to come. The Bitcoin blockchain, and the technology of the crypto-economy, will continue to mature and evolve, and this will impact the way we interact with the \"digital\" economy in the future. As a result, the increased Bitcoin adoption in a traditional environment will help to pave the way for future adoption in new and innovative ways.I think the Bitcoin economy has the potential to play a positive role in the world economy. Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin has no central authority that can devalue it or inflate it to save their own corrupt sectors. I think this is the true advantage of the Bitcoin system. Additionally, Bitcoin is significantly more resilient to national bank currency crises and there are more free-market banking alternatives in existence to improve the efficiency of the system.",

Bitcoin as far as I know can be traded and transacted anywhere and anytime, even if it is banned then I don't think the government can afford to ban decentralized networks. Bitcoin is a commodity asset in my country, it is tradable but cannot be used to legally pay for goods or services.The problem is, have you ever thought of new ideas for future use cases, such as receiving a salary in bitcoin at your workplace or maybe as a means of payment for public transportation?",

How about you, do you have any good ideas for future bitcoin adoption?When you do have a business and tending to accept crypto then it would be possible as long your country doesnt prohibit or banned bitcoin or crypto as a whole or simply we can say that they are still in neutral phase then you could actually do that plan of yours but if not then you should avoid since you know on what would be the penalties or violation. We are still on a decades existence even though we cant assureon what the future looks like when it comes to payment options but as we can see on how it do progress out then we could really say that it does have the potential.Bitcoin adoption in the future do surely looks bright but of course always take consideration on minding about the risk.",

Which football club will use Bitcoin as a means of payment also.At times I feel like the FIFA World Cup can be a good place for Bitcoin to get it's awareness it deserves, using Bitcoin as payments for First runner's, second runners and also third. If it can also be used to purchase tickets for the world Cup.Lastly, I borrow books once in a while from the library, I know there is Gon be a possibility but, not at the moment. I want Bitcoin to be used as a means of payment in the library for subscription and also payments. Finally, I hope to see Bitcoin as a Legal Tender in My Country Nigeria!",

There have been companies or freelance markets that do issue and pay their workers with bitcoin. That's not actually a new thing and it's just part of bitcoin as a use case. You'll see those coffee shops that have QR codes if you want to pay them bitcoin. Honestly, IMO, we're just getting started and more merchants and stores are starting to become open to it as a payment and that is because they like the idea of owning bitcoin. They'll get paid by it and then they hold it as an investment.",

Everyone of these adoptions as it continues to come by brings us closer to a global adoption.One of the concerns that has made this global adoption an issue is the volatile nature of bitcoin and I think, as we come closer to exhaustion as bitcoin is a limited/scares commodity, the issue of volatility would be solved and we would have bitcoin  for a currency.",

The priority is much towards investment than as a currency for daily needs. More number of people getting into cryptocurrency usage understanding the growth of bitcoin over the years. As said the adoption is happening in a slower way and this is really good for the market than getting pushed all the way. Nowadays there were some promotion about bitcoin, from firms that use bitcoin a tool. Apart from that there is no kind of promotion which is the real success.",

If someone will ask you about it, you can simply deny it, nobody will try to seize your Bitcoin unless you have been involved in a crime.

One of them is the legal tender route, we are going to end up seeing a ton of more nations that will make it a legal tender for sure, there is no denying that. Second one is getting the machines to accept it, we use credit cards and even our mobile phones these days to pay and why not have bitcoin related product for that? It looks like we are going to end up going head to head with the banking industry over it, but there is absolutely no denying that it could be technically possible even today, so why not better in the future.",
