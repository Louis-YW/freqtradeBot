  "content": "Many of you will read this and probably think hell no: We go to $20-$22K. We go down 80% like every time to $14K. There'll be a multi-year bear market. But what if most of you were wrong.Things repeat when they rhyme. But by enough metrics such as log growth, timing and 6 months apart double top, there is little rhythm compared to previous cycles.I don't doubt there could be a capitulation wick, as is the tradition, as based on profit/losses we are in the fear stage as there is still 16% more unrealised profit than losses in the market. But what if there were more long-term investors in the market than speculators, and a realised price of $24K actually seems reasonable.I'm not really suggesting the bottom is already in, and do think we can easily go a bit lower, but I doubt it will last very long, similar to in March 2020 when price recovered within 6 weeks. The 1 year+ hodlers reached a new all time high of 65% this week, so this is far from the pre-capiluation levels of sub 1:1 ratio of long-term to short-term hodlers which has been the common cause of previous bear market ending capitulationsCorrect me if I'm wrong, but it seemed that most people thought $30K would hold (myself included), others believed we'd go to at least $20K. So far the former group have been proven wrong, so it seems likely enough that the latter group can be wrong as well. It reminds me of 2018 when most thought $6K would hold, and a year later at $14K that price would never go back below $4K, before both events occurred.The one thing that is sure is that there are a lot more on-chain metircs than the bear market of 2018. Specific tools that long-term investors prefer to use to analyse price using more fundamental data, rather than prise-based, bearing in mind there currently are more investors than speculators right now, unlike a year ago. Another factor is that twice can be coincidence, while three times or more is considered a pattern. So with the previous bear markets of 2011, 2013 and 2018, there was a distinct pattern of a recovery. Call it hopium after breaking a higher low and higher high structure, which for me did confirm the end of the bull market, but I do think this bear market could only last anywhere between 1 - 6 weeks, even if consolidation thereafter takes considerable time. Longer-term holders are still refusing to sell at a loss, with shorter term holders (particularly 6-12 month unsurprisingly) instead taking responsibility for the selling. I'm still struggling to see how a crypto winter is coming, I already feel like we've been in one for 12 months already. Either that, or price will have to go significantly lower or in order to shake out strong hands.",

Either that, or price will have to go significantly lower or in order to shake out strong hands.You've been around long enough...  Don't you remember when the crash from $20K to $6K happened and then it bounced back above $10K and everyone said the bear market was behind us?  Then we fell to $3K and sat there for a long time.  While you can see clear signs of capitulation a few days ago, I think that was a clear bottom in the short term.  Longer term, I think we have lower to go.  Scarily, the major support level does seem to be around $10K, so if we're still mirroring the 4-year cycles of past, I would expect a revisit to $10K sometime over the next year.  Not saying it's set in stone as I don't think we've ever seen this market fall below the previous cycle's high.  You can see from the NASDAQ leaders that market leaders have fallen as much as 80% in some situations.  Altcoins are down similarly in that period.  So I understand the argument that we've hit bottom already.  My question to the people who make that argument...  Do you really think it's different this time?",

It has slightly recovered back to $30k but it's struggling to stay, so I'll probably just prepare myself for another dump in the coming days. IIRC, it was not only $6k, but bitcoin dump to $3k after it achieved a $20k ATH. That happened after over a year from the date bitcoin reach its ATH. So $20k to $3k, so it's possible to see at $10k price.",

The $30k price is the hold point and waits until the ATH will come back. But however, I did not have too much in worries because I am a long-term holder which is I know the BTC price will increase after the correction (the term correction was still what I am thinking during this dip).So possible, $25k is already at the button and it will never go down beyond that price. I think, avoid thinking this and think that you are holding like a year to bring out your benefits.",

In other words nobody can claim 80% drop because it happened before because nothing of this trend is like before and even if price did drop that low like the $14K you mentioned, it still wouldn't be because \"it happened before\" but instead it would be because of a million different new reasons.",

Just saying. Yeah, we are just basing on the historical logs, but we are not certain that it might follow that series of events or not. Seems to be around $29k-$30k right now. And so if we maintain $30k, then the next obvious attempt will be $32k and see if it will hold again or not. I don't think that we will have a \"terra luna event\" in the future. Yes we felt the effect but is not going to last as the price might bounce again to somewhere to $35k at least.",

Who do you mean by long-term holders? To people like Saylor, Winklevoss twins and some other billionaires, or ordinary people? The big ones have refused to sell because they are not gambling with the money they need for a living, and most small investors are unfortunately out of the game for fear of losing even more.
