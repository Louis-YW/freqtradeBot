I think I've seen some people that are high ranks have shared in some other threads about some signals group but they're not paid at all. Although IIRC, they've got those VIP treatments if you'll pay them. Kinda need of hard work to dig on those threads on this section.",

Actually trading is really need of experience, a good analysis still not enough since trader usually follow his emotional rather than his analysis.",

Even if you get to find a good signal channel it will become unreliable and unsustainable in a short time. Sometimes you have to learn walk first before you can run, I notice that you are in a hurry to make money and you're willing to just jump straight to the money making part without passing through the process, that can pose a danger to you.

And nowdays everybody have learned how to read btc support resitance so AS longes btc stay on support we know pmp can go on If btc fall lower then local support then we know that might drop. If signal coming out u do little reasearch you check where is the btc If btc Has a lot support Also then u enter in.Some people really making full time income that way only.Also u never go in full If you use leverage futures you entry in small % and when price moved Desired Direction u add little more Margin and u can adjust leverage step by step to higher.That way you get the risk like you trade with lower Margin and lower leverage but your profit Will be big like you really use high marging high leverage.That way really 200%-300% profit not Hard to make it.And with 300$ each trade 300x2=600 few days 600$ profit its a over 1200 to 2000 monthly income off course If you use margin and leverage increasing step by step.If we trade we want more money and better life than those who dont trade why ELSE people come in trading ?We come here to be richer then average people.So... Plz share good signals channels and whos Active channels Im here to make s...t loads of money becouse i like wall Street syaing,i create nothing but i own everything.",

I am sure you will get a bunch of channels telling you about the signal to buy daily or weekly. But I do not guarantee that you will get valid signal information. Perhaps, the signal is almost the same as the other groups.The other suggestion is you can try to analyze by yourself, and no matter if you are not a pro trader, you can try to use RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Band to know where the price will go. If you can't trade for a specific time interval or target profit in a day, you can trade for a short term. For example, you should try to make a small percentage for taking a profit, but you do that continuously for a day. By doing that, you will get more profit.",
