  "content": "Hi,I bought some crypto coins in 2018 (a few months rent worth) and forgot about them. I think I bought Dogecoin, Bitcion, and either Ripple or Verge. I think I bought them on Binance and then stored them in desktop wallets and made paper keys or electronic keys and deleted the wallets.I made some notes to retrieve them but am struggling to do so. The notes are (I have changed the key letters but kept the number of letters etc the same):vehiongin tioinli siolnio sioorpn cinniop tionviv fionumg nfghnin ghniiondo3eRT5tyg6t6tGYt4rfgy6rghyFdesfrftytHYUg5TLTTGgfr4t4gbin5RT6Y7R45EDFTHG6So the first key is 9 undercase words (not real words though) of 7 letters. The second is 52 alphanumeric characters, and the third is 16 alphanumeric characters.I also have an electronic key called do_wk.key which when I open it in notepad it is 128 characters long (upper and lower case letters, +, / and numbers).I think 'do' is short for dogecoin and 'bin' is short for binance. I wrote it in a way, that if someone found it they would not understand it, but it seems to have me fooled too. I think ve is verge. Not sure what 'wk' means in the electronic key. I don't remember which wallets I used but I'm sure I would have used the main/better known ones. Any ideas how I can get the coins back?! Cheers.",
