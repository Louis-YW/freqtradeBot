But losing that much is not good hope you learn a lesson and hope you feel better soon.",

Many gamblers fall into the trap of chasing their losses, meaning that they continue to bet money in an attempt to win back what they have lost. Unfortunately, this often leads to a cycle of increasing losses, as the gambler continues to bet more and more money in a desperate attempt to recover their losses. Eventually, the losses become too great to bear, and the gambler is forced to stop. This behavior is alarming, as it can lead to financial ruin and other negative consequences. I felt this too before and lost not an enormous amount but only a considerable amount. I'm happy for you since you didn't lose, but don't do it again because luck is not always on our side.",

Unless we are lucky enough to win a good amount. Cause what I've been experiencing is that I deposit a $10 which is big amount of money convert to PHP money and then I will loss my $10 so I decided to deposit $30 and then I'll won and my money is increase UpTo $116 which is I have. Doubt If I'll gonna withdraw or not  so I'll stay playing end when times goes by  that $116 will totally loss and I regret  cause I am greedy and I didn't control my self is didn't stop betting when I won. So that's the reason why nowadays I'll think twice after my bet when I am loss 2x then I'll quit and relax.",

If you have stop in the first bet, it will be understandable but you didn't stop, went ahead and did additional $250, this is where you should have cut your loss.Adding $1800 deposit is nothing but poor gambling management and poor skills in betting, yes you heard me right because you don't want to use $1800 to recover $85+$250, how does that sound fun to you? Sorry for the loss but this is bad decision bro. Take care of your health and hard luck.",

Just like with martingale wherein you’d be increasing your bets on each games which simply means bigger tendency to end up with huge loss. In this case wherein OP wanted to get back with his losses he used a bigger bankroll to may e have better chances. However, if it happened that his added bankroll just contributed with his previous losses then that is obviously a worse scenario. The only way to get back with previous losses is to increase your bet indeed but in my opinion it shouldn’t be something to do on a regular basis; you’d more likely just be more frustrated. Check if you are lucky or nor, then let things be. Never force something in gambling. Sometimes setting the goal which is to lessen the amount to be lost for a single day is better than to check for an amount to be used as a revenge from yesterday’s best. That’s just how luck works in this industry.",

Did you think that only a regular gambler or an addicted gambler lose or what? The casino is indifferent to all this and will not figure out whether you are an old player or just came to play for the first time to clean out your pockets.Quote from: Wapfika on October 25, 2023, 03:40:19 PMLastly, I deposit 1800$ to have a better bankroll again, This time I’m betting like a high roller and lucky manage to recover my losses and bag 150$ profit.What if this step didn't lead to winning back? Would you deposit $5,000 to try to win back? This is how the casino gradually extracts money from their gamblers.Quote from: Wapfika on October 25, 2023, 03:40:19 PMConclusion: I will never gamble again when I’m bored or chase loss small amount.

You have gained invaluable psychological experience and you are unlikely to want to experience it again. Use these negative emotions experienced (remember and feel) if you decide to play gambling games again.",

Best to stay consistent in how you play. In nlackjack some like to increase bet on a win. For example I bet $25 and win a hand, next hand I wager $30. Keep increasing $5 til you lose.

I could remember the casino I started using not quite long that almost made me to chase my loses although I could see that it does not worth. I had no option than to leave the casino and not bet there for about few days before I decided to back and start gambling on the casino. The kind of winnings I had was very surprising to me because I never thought I could make such consistent winnings. I think if everyone take this kind of decisions when they noticed that they are becoming addicted or having too much loses, it is good for us to leave gambling for a while that the loses would not affect our emotions if we continue to bet with any plans or taking a leave or rest for a while.",

Not the only rules but in order to explain I am focusing on those rules specifically. What you have done, is a terrible mistake that a professional gambler should never do. It is bad for starters too. Gambling is best on luck. You may win or you may lose. And in a place where your skill doesn't matter and won't improve your gambling luck, chasing your losses in a situation like that is foolish. You have made some losses and some wins, but the losses were higher. When you gamble using your money, consider that money already gone. Gambling is for entertainment only when you don't stake money that you can't afford to lose. Whenever it comes to money, it does not stay as an entertainment. It becomes an addiction for making money or recovering what you have already lost. I hope you never make the same mistake again.",
