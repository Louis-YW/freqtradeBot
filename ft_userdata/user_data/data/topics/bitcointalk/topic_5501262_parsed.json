When the network is congested, fees get up and become very expensive. Just a few months ago, we saw that the network had been attacked and spammed, resulting in its fees reaching up to $100+ just because of that.Quote from: DrHodler59 on June 27, 2024, 03:16:47 PMAnd what would you respond to this criticism if you were confronted with it in a conversation? I'm not a developer but it's always been said about scalability. Maybe, there will be a real solution for that someday but I agree to Jawhead that despite that disadvantage, Bitcoin is more secure than the other cryptos. And with those cryptos that will say that they've got solution to Bitcoin's problem, just wait for them to get clogged and they'll also experience the same problem.",

You see, Bitcoin is mined by many miners and these miners use electrical resources to support their various mining equipment, but the government instead says that this is just a waste of energy and it has an impact on global warming because the electricity used mostly comes from non-renewable energy. Do they only deal with Bitcoin mining? what about factories that use millions of tons of coal? are they not to blame for global warming? and what about energy use in the financial industry? it is much bigger compared to the Bitcoin mining industry. And in fact, the Bitcoin mining industry is much more aware of this problem compared to other industries, and is starting to improve and streamline their mining equipment, carry out mining in cold places, and use some electricity from renewable energy to support their operations. There are many actions being taken by the Bitcoin mining industry to improve itself, and criticism about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining is becoming increasingly irrelevant today.",

It's okay to be an anti bitcoiner because it's a digital asset surrounded with other related potential characteristics such as the Altcoins. The federal authorities could also be against it due to its decentralized modelitty.So, there's no way we can expect everyone to talk good about the bitcoin. Let whoever that want to say anything about bitcoin do and your endivoirs of engaging on arguements with it is like trying to convince them to what they don't believe.Bitcoin is a real digital currency and criticisms can't make changes over its potentials.",

You need to understand that Bitcoin is not Visa or Mastercard; Bitcoin is a monetary network and protocol. Bitcoin Layer 1 is something like Fedwire; it is only used for settling high-value transactions. Further building can be done on Layers 2 and 3, etc. The Lightning Network can perform millions of instant transactions per minute, but there are still significant challenges. The problem is that Bitcoin is decentralized; there is no foundation, no one taking care of Bitcoin. This is unlike scam altcoins, which have entire teams of developers and marketing teams, and who have kept a large portion of the supply for themselves before launch, earning huge amounts of money which they invest in marketing and developers.",

We have side chains and layer 2 for Bitcoin, but it's not as safe as the on-chain.People who argue these speed of Bitcoin lack understanding of the 3 bodies of a coin such as the decentralization, the security and the speed. If you want to build coin, one must he sacrificed among that 3 and Bitcoin choose to prioritize decentralization and security before the speed. If there is no decentralization, the network will become a failure and if there is no security, nobody will have confidence and say they will buy Bitcoin that is this expensive.Most altcoins today are prioritize 2 among these 3, mostly they prefer to make people think speed is what they need and they ignore security and decentralization, hence why most of the altcoins aren't that security tight and aren't decentralized, it's either they are hack today or the team just make decisions about the network, this never happen in Bitcoin network because of how decentralized it is for everyone.",

I believe it was never designed in a way to be used by so many people. So the biggest problem it faces is the scalability issues, the moment you see a lot of on chain traffic immediately you will see the fees skyrocketing up, you will see slower transactions. Apart from this obviously the environmental impact of the Pow consensus is also a big criticism which a lot of pro environmentalists pose on bitcoin. So obviously the PoS or the hybrid solutions are becoming much more relevant to the overall situation in cryptos right now. and honestly I don't have any proper answers to the question on the scalability issues.",

But if there is such a real risk in the mid term (8 years from now) what do you think could be the reason behind BlackRock and other funds are are accumulating so aggressively?The situation is really worrying as this mining companies are purely driven by profits and they have professional advisors who can show them they can earn twice as much on different project.On the scale they operate even couple percents would be worth switching but due to high volatility the profitability of mining must be much greater for them to switch from one project to another and the halvings make this decision much simpler - unless the market cap will be able to multiply in value after each halving in which I don't believe at this trillion+ levels.As for BlackRock and other sharks, they just want to multiply their FIAT - they don't have any love for cryptocurrencies but will say otherwise to pump the price up.They will have no second thought to cash it out after getting their target or seeing that there might be some unrecoverable trouble.Again, they are not HODL'ers, they are not Bitcoin lovers, they are businessman who want to multiply their stack of FIAT and they have a lot of professional advisors. Nothing else.Quote from: Porfirii on June 27, 2024, 06:39:58 PMAnd, on the other hand, what more profitable projects do you think miners would switch to?Ethereum was a big contender but they switched to PoS.Monero is feared due to their past of changing PoW to fight off ASIC's but maybe they will be interested in CPU mining - who knows.Edit: it is already happening: https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-profitability-halving.htmQuote\"Marathon Digital announced on Thursday that it has decentralized its mining efforts towards mining Kaspa, an alternative proof-of-work cryptocurrency network from which the firm has gained $16 million since September.\"All the other projects are noise but I could be wrong and they can view it differently.",
