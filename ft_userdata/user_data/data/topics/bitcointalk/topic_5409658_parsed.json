Options trading is unlimited. And there are a lot of big whales who can move the small developing market that is crypto currency.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is highly volatile basically because there are too many coins in very few hands. It allows market manipulation by whales in high intensity.If those whales didn't have so many coins and those coins were splitted among more hands (more investors), bitcoin's volatility would decrease considerably.On the practice, it means few individuals could sell their chuncks of bitcoin, but it wouldn't have a big price impact at first point, moreover it wouldn't lead to panic or mass selling by other investors like we still see nowadays.",

      "body": "Even if the market is regulated all around we'll have the similar level of volatility. Maybe I'm wrong, but this is what I believe based on the technology that backs bitcoin. The supply and demand have got its role, beyond that is the Influencers. In recent days the market is into the hands of Influencers who had the ability to move the market, just because it is speculative by development. So, based on the scenario different parameters make the market volatile.We can't indicate specific things as the reason for market volatility, if so the decisions from governments, influencers, positive/negative things relative to the cryptocurrency, etc can also be added to the list.",

But these four reasons will also not last forever because they still have the potential to change again in the future when the world conflict is over and regulation for Bitcoin begins to exist. Because two of the four listed reasons can still change when all the good things are in Bitcoin.",

Hence, many users are being attracted into this market for the purpose of possible high profits.Also, there may be other factors influencing this market, but most of the time, it is the combination of those factors why we are seeing the price movement.",

As years pass, many countries acknowledge that cryptocurrencies especially bitcoin can help a lot in our financial system so countries that want to accumulate a huge chunk of it spreads some fuds that will cause for some holders to sell.  A single event about crypto also causes a chain effect on bitcoin that it can pump or dump quickly if a particular institution did something about it.",

Same thing being applied over a long time frame of a year shows less difference.Similar assets in the stock market or precious metals also show such volatility. If regulation were to come in place, and that too about exchanges and daily volumes then only volatility would decrease. But these talks about bitcoin \"instability/volatility\" it is an exaggeration if you ask me.",
