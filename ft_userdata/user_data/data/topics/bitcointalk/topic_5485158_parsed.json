The term \"bullish\" comes from the analogy that a bull beats its horns from the bottom up, and the term \"bearish\" comes from the analogy that a bear beats its paw from the top down.",

This heightened demand is a result of various factors, including the limited supply of Bitcoin and its volatile nature. With a limited supply and increasing demand, the price of Bitcoin tends to soar, as more people seek to invest in it. This phenomenon creates a cycle where the more people desire Bitcoin, the higher its price climbs.",

There are many others if we go deep into the mico level but generally, these are the ones mostly used. To understand this you have to understand what is halving and after how much time it occurs. Halving is the period when the supply of some coin is cut to half. And BTC halving is going to happen in a few days (halving count down).It happens after every four years, so after every four years there comes these phases accordingly, after halving it comes bull, then bear and then accumulation. Now halving is near and that's why people are saying market is bullish and its the time to make some money but that's not for guaranteed also, you have to do your full research before choosing which coin to invest in.",

Many things can dictate market sentiment such as global events but as tar as cryptocurrency is involved we have long periods when it can be said we are neither in a Bull or Bear Market, we have long Crab Markets which is a light hearted way of saying sideways.

There is an air of positivity so the markets move up, the Bulls are aggressive and are buying.In contrast to the BULL market is the BEAR market. What do bears do in winter? Hibernate,which means little or no activity. In terms of the markets they either stagnate or fall back.",

One is a \"Bull market\" and the other is a \"Bear market.\"A Bull market refers to a rising market where most investors are buying, demand exceeds supply, market conditions are high and prices are high. And an investor who believes that prices will rise over time is called a \"Bull\". That is, when prices in a market move rapidly upward, most investors become \"Bullish\" about rising prices. Simply put, a Bull run or Bull market begins when the market experiences sustained or significant upward growth in the financial markets.       On the other hand, when financial market conditions are down, it is called Bear market.",

In simple words we can say that the bull market is a market in which price will rise and asset value will increase more and more with the aspect of profit gaining. While its reverse phase is called the bear market, in which the price generally falls due to selling volume, It means that the assets drop due to selling pressure and their value decreases, which means they lose value.",

During a bear market there is a lot of dumping in the market.
