I cannot, and if regulatory bodies have failed for such a long time now to offer protection or security, they will not be of any benefit to Bitcoin. This is besides the fact that Bitcoin was originally designed to be decentralized in its protocol, discussing how we can introduce regulations undermines how it was designed to be used.Quote from: IceLincoln on July 01, 2024, 03:23:12 PM- Can self-regulation and industry standards suffice, or is government oversight necessary?Bitcoin has survived for this long on a consensus based system, this shows that it can suffice. The talk of regulation about Bitcoin is all about control and not security of users.",

      "body": "my view of regulations is that regulations SHOULD be about checking on businesses acting honourably/morally/legally to protect consumers.. not the other way round. regulators should stick to policing the businesses that take custody of their customers assets however current regulations allow businesses to continue to process a transfer of assets as long as they report on the customer who requested the transfer if the transfer is suspicious. thus it doesnt stop transfers(if illegal/suspicious) it however later on helps capture/punish the person after the crime. thus is not even preventing crime nor prevents the criminal transfer by the serviceso current regulations dont even do anything effective to their proposed purpose",

Regulation of products like stablecoins and exchanges are absolutely needed to make the space safer for people. But those regulations should naturally be done in concert with crypto organizations precisely because the crypto organizations are going to be a lot more knowledgeable on the issues and potential fixes than politicians and regulators will be.",

People don't buy a stock here, they don't get an IOU. What they get is an asset, like one of the common precious metals, or a painting. What the customer should focus on is that he's getting genuine bitcoin, not a promise or something of that sort. It's equally important to educate consumers about self custody. They need to make sure they can keep their coins safe. The government should focus on people who offer custodial services, on exchanges and wallet providers to make sure they're punished if they try to cheat their customers. Bitcoin itself needs no regulation and customers don't need to be protected from it.",

With Bitcoin's transparency, should Bitcoin have regulations as intended by the definition of regulation itself?Bitcoin does not belong to the government or any party. In the white paper it is explained clearly from the beginning to the conclusion.Anyone who owns Bitcoin, freedom is with the owner. If Bitcoin has to have regulations, it is a joke that makes no sense because Bitcoin does not belong to the government which must be monitored because Bitcoin is not an object that can carry out its own actions like humans whose actions should be suspected.",

It's just too broad and the approach by each government may be very different or the approach at different times can be different. In short as long as regulations end up with consumer protection, they can be good.But the problem is that so far what we've seen from regulations has meant only one thing: government seeking control.For example they enforce KYC through centralized exchanges so that they can monitor people's finances and tax people more. They never provide people with any kind of protection for cases like the CEX running away with your money!",

      "body": "Seeing a thread on bitcoin/crypto regulation after some time now.In my opinion, regulation is a necessary evil. There are projects based on crypto known as ICO which allowed people to buy a token on ETH ERC-20 blockchain and the holders would have some rights. Almost all the projects failed and the investors were angry. This does not mean that innovation was there, most of them if innovative enough, would have gone for the mainstream tech market, which they did not.See how cunning they were? They knew that the crypto users were gullible enough to fool like that and thus stayed away from mainstream/legally protected markets. Sadly legal approaches did not work much for ICOs for the same reason or paperwork related difficulty.That is why it is necessary, and I feel that the \"evil\" part will get removed, because those who are in charge of this, will make sure to allow innovation just like any other industry.",

Do you actually understand what you write in your post?Bitcoin is decentralized from developments to Proof of Work network to find blocks and confirm transactions. It's helpful for security and privacy of Bitcoin users and their funds. But they can make transactions smoothly with centralized blockchains like altcoins with some risk like blockchain pause, reversibility/ rollback, lack of privacy.https://howmanyconfs.com/",
