I think most coins and tokens on the metaverse are racing for each one but with the trend on thr apecoin, I think there is more chance or opportunity with it as they are just started their ecosystem with their recent land sale and token launch, it still too early to judge if they can beat out sandbox but in terms of profiting, of course youll choose a smaller cap and you know what it is.",

All metaverse tokens will dump 95-100% from ATH - thats how every new technology is being welcomed by market. Enormous pump of everything even slightly related to metaverse, dump close to zero and than fundamental pump of good products. Just like dot.com bubble. Amazon dumped 93% from its ATH in 2000.Metaverse will be a big thing but not in 2022. Maybe in 2030 with good vr set or in 2040 with good brain chips (something like braindance in cyberpunk). Looking for investment in metaverse in 2022 is like looking at 2 random toddlers and betting which one of them will win noble prize.",

Which metaverse coin do you choose and try to say which coin is the right one for you to keep, maybe you can recommend it to others too if the metaverse coin you choose can last in the long term.",

I consider this from the hype. Ape has not even launched its metaverse but the hype was so big and this is also the number 1 of metaverse token in the market. Sand is good but the hype is not as big as ape token. I do agree with other people said. I can imagine when the launch of ape metaverse will come soon. This may become the next big event",

Do you agree?Everyone has a different side and well, there are always those who say that Sandbox is better with its metaverse, it's far from possible that Sandbox is the best-selling project but other projects are also the same as the concept of the metaverse but I can't be sure what is clear I know Sandbox longer and of course I follow its development compared to ApeCoin.So do you want to invest from both sides?ApeCoin and Sandbox have good products they are growing very fast.",

Look at bitcoin, it's not doing well and the market will continue to fall this year, so don't risk investing in Sand or Ape right now. I agree with @Titanic Janusz, Metaverse is an area with real potential but it's too early to say how successful they will be. Except for the hype around Metaverse tokens, I haven't seen any value in them.",

The reason I chose Sandbox is because Sandbox already has their product, while ApeCoin, they don't have a Metaverse product yet, I just looked at some local news portals and read about ApeCoin that will make their Metaverse and this is just a discussion.",
