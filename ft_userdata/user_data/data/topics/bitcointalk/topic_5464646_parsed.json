So why can't you?Every business you choose to invest in carries a degree of risk, whether it's crypto, stocks, or any other form of investment. It's important to acknowledge that investing in crypto specifically involves substantial risk due to the high volatility of cryptocurrencies. While people often share their success stories they tend to overlook the challenges losses and risk management they encountered along the way. This oversight poses a significant issue. Before making any investment, it's important to do your research  (DYOR) yourself about the investment opportunity so you can see how much risk you can handle.you just need to have it in mind that there are no guarantees of profit in investments. Therefore it's advicable to remember only to invest an amount you can afford to lose.",

My guess is less because a lot of people have had success with this crypto.There is no business in this world that doesn't have a form of risk, but the risk is in levels. Some businesses are highly risky while others have relatively low risk. Another fact is that sometimes the higher the risk the greater the profit, while the lesser the risk the lower the profit. When it comes to the crypto industry, Bitcoin has lesser risk than other altcoins because its price is more stable than other coins. The price of altcoins can shoot up overnight and it can also fall within a short time.QuoteSome are investing and some are making a lot of money by trading. So why can't you?People are making a lot of money and others are also losing so much money. Trading cryptocurrency requires some skills and experience because it is very risky especially if you are trading on altcoins.",

      "body": "Volatility is among the things that make it risky. If you can learn how to manage those risks, then you will have fewer problems to worry about.Another risky thing is security; learning how to also protect your holdings should be another important factor, because the more careless one is, the higher the risk of getting their funds lost at the hands of a scammer who did not work for them.Going back to your question, it's better to manage the risk than avoid it, like Kodec5 has said, because we always have the chance of making something out of somewhere that's deemed very risky. It all depends on how we handle those risks presented in front of us, and when it comes to crypto currency, there is a lesser risk provided that you make the right choice of a coin and do not get involved in a higher leverage trade. Reduce the greed of getting rich quick, and I think you will be a little good to go.",

So to start any business or trade, even in the conventional business life, there are risks associated with it and the understanding of this fact will be the beginning of your breakthrough as that will guide you through the process.Now for crypto currencies, like any other platforms, you need to study the intricacies before investing or trading. Cryptocurrencies are another advanced alternative to the fiat currencies and like I have advised others, I will advise you to take it on. But more importantly, study the process to mitigate the risks attached.Good luck buddy!",

Typically, during a year of travel, I had between 8 and 11 cards blocked. To unblock them, I had to return to the country where they were issued. And when each card was blocked, access to the money on it disappeared. When I started using cryptocurrency, I eliminated this risk.Businesses also face significant risks from account blocks. I am from Russia, and I know that banks often block accounts of Russian companies, even though they have not done anything wrong. Switching to cryptocurrency would eliminate these risks for businesses.",

A lot of people are indeed making money from crypto investments because they have the required knowledge to navigate the crypto market and they get information early about newly created crypto projects. When you don't know something you end up as a failure. For instance, you have invested $50 in crypto to make some profits, After you have invested your money and the token you bought dumped, you will be afraid of losing all your money in the process you will sell the token not to lose all your money. In other to reduce this risk we should invest in Bitcoin",
