Satoshi has already disagreed with this type of abuse in multiple places. From the whitepaper title where it calls bitcoin a payment system not a cloud storage to his clear stance against storing junk data (like DNS) on bitcoin blockchain.But unfortunately because bitcoin core developers screwed up in implementation of Taproot soft fork, we ended up with an attack vector that is being exploited with the code-name Ordinals, and so far there isn't any serious work being done to mitigate that.",

You won't find the exact quote, because that thing didn't exist at that time (and things like colored coins were invented later). However, there are some quotes about using Bitcoin for other purposes than payments, and as far as I can find, Satoshi wrote only about separate network for those cases, for example in BitDNS:Quote from: satoshi on December 10, 2010, 05:29:28 PMPiling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale.Bitcoin and BitDNS can be used separately.  Users shouldn't have to download all of both to use one or the other.  BitDNS users may not want to download everything the next several unrelated networks decide to pile in either.The networks need to have separate fates.  BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.For me, that is sufficient to guess that Satoshi accepted using Bitcoin for other things than payments, but didn't want to put all of those things on-chain, because \"piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale\". And that is one of the reasons why ordinals as a concept may be accepted, but the way how it works may be totally wrong, because it will unnecessarily compete with other payments.",
