It's perhaps sad, even pathetic, that people who get their information from the mainstream media find themselves misled. Nevertheless, I think it's important to list and archive these opinions and remarks, as they belong to the history of bitcoin. We've seen that some people have changed their minds about bitcoin over time, and to show that encourages people to change their minds if they wish. Ego is a very bad partner, so showing that you can change your mind can only be beneficial.",

You know this was the reason why most people sees bitcoin the other way round, i mean something that is scam probably after listening to All this fake news about bitcoin maybe when you try telling them about bitcoin investment they won't have you say a word because they believe they have gotten the right information from the media. because they think those information is coming from a reliable source without knowing that most of those information gotten from the media happens to be fake, probably just trying to mislead those who can be so naive to them.",

(he didn't specify which deal it was)This is the first time I see a take like this. The usual take about Bitcoin is that the FBI or CIA made it, or something along those lines. Never thought I'd see someone believe Trump and his gang made it 10 years ago to fund their campaign today. Do he provide any evidence or do they act like a Reddit poster? Makes me wonder how people like this end up having power in our society.Speaking about terrible takes on the media, I don't think I've heard anything remotely close to what you posted on my national media broadcasting ecosystem OP. Not sure if it means Bitcoin is not that popular or we have more people with common sense here.",

Screw the naysayers, they won't last long anyway and have been a dying breed for a decade now   That’s because they have never accepted bitcoin in all honesty. Maybe few of the banks are now open about bitcoin, but majority still remain to be in denial, even though there are already living proofs that bitcoin could be an asset to the world’s economy. However, I understand their stance, because that’s exactly the point that the government is trying to instill to them, they’re just great followers.",

It is very dangerous for a public figure to speak about things he does not understand to a very large audience. Even more dangerous is for him to issue these positions as if they were facts and not indicate that this is his idea and his grandfather's, which we do not include anyone else out of journalistic integrity, which he is supposed to have studied in his first years of university. It is really more sad than funny.",

Not only France is dedicated to fuck up technological advancement in its country, as it also has a good weight in the EU it also has much of the blame that technology startups that have a minimum of initial success end up going to the USA because they cannot comply with regulations and taxes here.At some point the EU has to realize, and it seems to me that it will be the hard way, that you can't dream of living in a wonderland because in the real world you are competing against the USA, China and India.",
