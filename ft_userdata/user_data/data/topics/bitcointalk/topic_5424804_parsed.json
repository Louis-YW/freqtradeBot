  "content": "Hello all,my friends. I think it's time to hear the opinion of the whole forum on this topic. Look what way bitcoin has gone from the beginning of its creation and to the present time. It has gone through everything: the fall, the rise, the hype, the huge theft, disappearing exchanges. But it still holds on and lives. And it holds on you and me as well. And it will live on.I started reading this forum, when I was a student, and I read Satoshi's last post, but I decided to invest only some years later.It's a great tool that gives you freedom, and everybody needs it.But lately they little by little deprive us of this freedom, introducing passport photo, face and whatever else they want at registration on exchanges.In my opinion, this contradicts all the principles that Satoshi promoted.Bitcoin should be a tool of freedom and no state should control it.They want to tax it and they want to control everything and they won't allow money to flow out of their economy.It pains me that this is coming, but no one can do anything about it.So I want to ask your opinion.What do you think will be the fate of bitcoin in the future?",

That's why you should avoid centralized exchanges, and exchange decentrally. It's cheaper, more private, and requires less effort during registration. Downsides are that there's less liquidity, and financial institutions such as Revolut might subject you to money laundering if you're transacting with strangers electronically for big amounts. Exchanging face-to-face unfortunately isn't a realistic option.",

It is all about exchanges and fiat (ie. banking system used by exchanges)QuoteIn my opinion, this contradicts all the principles that Satoshi promoted.Not at all.

Because, if you do, you surely wouldnt call it cheaper. Instead, cex like binance is coming up with offers like \"zero spot fee trading\". So you decide who is more cheaper.Moreover, cexes are more user friendly than dex (the orderbooks, the flow, etc. etc..). Whatever we say but reality is dex still got a lot of work to do to compete..

There is no one working behind the scenes from the team for Bitcoin adaptation. Many dramas have been made, and many more will be accomplished in the future. However, Bitcoin is still alive and will continue to exist. I'm not sure if another form or current forms should be used.

But if in a case you didn't store your bitcoin on exchange then I don't think any exchange would asked for kyc or data, which is why it's best advisable to store your assets in a self custodian wallet which you may want to have control over instead of exchange. If per say you wanna sell then I can say you could used p2p from trusted, reputable p2p forum provider with them no kyc is needed.",

It can be said that CEX provides all the necessary services and utilities so that we can use them conveniently and also make a profit in this market. Most newbies will look to CEX instead of DEX, DEX for them is pretty complicated and not user-friendly as well as transaction fees are very high and this is what investors complain about the most.
