  "content": "SCAM ACCUSATIONS : ROEE BEN SHUSHANWhat happened :This topic aims to expose ROEE BEN SHUSHAN, a multi-recidivist scammer, who has many scam projects to his credit, in and outside crypto. After scamming with ZubiCoin, GPN Coin and PCN Coin in 2018, he is now back in 2022 with more crypto scams such as Rex Lands MetaVerse, Gorilla Army Club NFT and Partyland NFT/PALA tokens.Outside crypto, his LinkedIn profile presents him as the CEO of Rasbula and the President of Blacksor. His name is related to multiple scam websites and businesses.Link : https://il.linkedin.com/in/rasbulaScreenshots : https://imgur.com/a/eQGPmggArchive : https://archive.ph/wqjFORasbula : https://imgur.com/a/wczaiFyMethods are always following the same pattern : Fake team (pics taken from Google), fake promises of partnerships, fake approvements by all the top exchanges even before he starts anything, fake price prediction, bots to grow his members/followers on his social networks, constant effort to collect more money without any development or any work done besides creating the token and listing it (sale of the tokens at an ICO price and then start of different promo offering up to 825% bonus to attract more people, dump on exchanges the millions tokens he has for peanuts, threatening people who are selling by targeting the ETH address which is selling and linking them with their Telegram handle....)Referral, airdrops or bounty tokens are distributed through his web interface in the users accounts (just a number in a database) so he can ask after the users to send him ETH to cover the fees if they want to receive their tokens in their ERC20 wallet. ETH asked to cover the fees are far too high compared to a usual transaction and he ridiculously justifies those high fees by having set \"gateways\" to secure the tokens on the blockchain...His methods include : Intimidation, lies and stories, threatening with complaints and lawsuits through his imaginary lawyers, multiple messages to harass the people who exposed him, insults, racism, death threats with mafia connection....What to expect from this topic? : In this topic, I will post proofs about his scams, methods and threats. Links, archives and images. I have created a Telegram Channel in which I have forwarded all the related messages for those who wants to verify the source and the authencity of the screenshots. Because he recently changed his group settings while I was writing this topic, I couldn't forward some messages I haven't saved or forwarded before. In this case, videos of the chat have been recorded.This topic is intentionally very detailed as I will use it as reference to report him wherever I can.

Didn't last long, scam has failed.II - GPN Coin (2018)His biggest scam to date. He raised around 290 ETH in 2018. The GPN Telegram group is now used for Partyland scam but all the previous posts and medias about GPN are still there.GPN Coin ICO topic (tagged as a scam) : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2940312.0Archived topic : https://archive.ph/k8UNiPartyland Telegram group link as of today : https://t.me/partylandio1) First step of his scam was to grow his user database with referral and airdrop tokens. Those tokens were only credited to the users accounts on the web platform he was using (just numbers, not real tokens). Once the distribution started, he asked for 0.0499 ETH up to 0.10 ETH according to the user balance, as gas fees, so he can send them their tokens on their ERC20 wallet (Activation). If they got more referral tokens after distribution, they had to reactivate to receive them by paying more ETH for gas (0.0799 ETH). All because the \"4 gateways\" set to secure the token.Screenshots : https://imgur.com/a/noOTRx9Link to authenticate the screenshots contents : https://t.me/roeebenshushan/312) The GPN team he claimed to have was initially made of fake members (pics from google).

The tokens never had any value, the only goal was to collect money.Screenshots : https://imgur.com/a/ho3EAvxLink to authenticate : https://t.me/roeebenshushan/41All the ETH collected during the ICO (almost 290 ETH) were sent to Binance to be sold.His main ETH address was shared between all his scam projects GPN Coin, PCNCoin and Click Terminal (not crypto related).Link : https://clickterminal.comArchive : https://archive.ph/WO1GzScreenshots : https://imgur.com/a/xXvXZlZLink to authenticate : https://t.me/roeebenshushan/44a) Main wallet (wallet W0) used between GPN Coin, PCN Coin and Click Terminal : https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f5affd524e4f0efffa61e25f85c05aff37de051b) Transaction to move 281.5 ETH to another wallet : https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcf2785f87dd862bd2ba162e5f51880b0f6abd30bca98f007eed5d072ba309fe8c) Transaction to move 286.7 ETH from this wallet to Binance : https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc4231a4665467f18c6b7b58c1237e343af5f60c8faf0817031006e4447fe4a00Main wallet comments : https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f5affd524e4f0efffa61e25f85c05aff37de051#commentsDespite all the money he collected, he was desperately asking all the time the users to give him more money pretexting a top listing.- During the ICO, he asked about 350 ETH to be listed on a top 3 exchanges (he pretended that it has approved GPN Coin)Screenshot : https://imgur.com/a/X1Ku887Link to authenticate : https://t.me/roeebenshushan/48- He confirmed the listing on HitBTC for July 15 but it was a lie and nothing came on July (he said he needs to fix the price first)- But despite the low price, he came after that to ask from the users to pay a \"listing company\", which will list both GPN and PCN on 5 exchanges from the top 20 exchanges + the top 10 DEX exchanges. For only 65 BTC. He said GPN Team will pay 40 BTC and need 25 BTC from the users.Screenshot : https://imgur.com/a/Ugr0GZLLink to authenticate : Not available as he started to delete his old posts before I could save them- After that, he said again that a top 5 exchanges has approved GPN Coin and he is raising the funds to pay them.Screenshot : https://imgur.com/a/L4bMO67Link to authenticate : Not available as he started to delete his old posts before I could save themSo he delayed HitBTC because of the price, but then, with a lower price, he wanted users to pay for a \"listing company\" and had personally 40 BTC but then he needed to raise funds to pay for only one exchange. All was lies and his only goal was to make people buy on Token Store and DDEX so he can sell his tokens.And as everyone knows, top 5 exchanges would never have listed a shitcoin with no trading volume and a very bad price.4) a) About the partners, during the ICO, he said he was in negotiation with 500 companies, and he promised many times a big partnership. A big gambling website with 300 millions dollars monthly volume. Announcement was wait for July and never came. The only annoucement was Change23, a scam website to exchange crypto, owns by him, and which is now offline. And to announce this, he asked 0.4 ETH from 20 users to be VIP and to know about the announcement before the others.Screenshot : https://imgur.com/a/OKbXXJDLink to authenticate : https://t.me/roeebenshushan/52b) Another fake partnership was made with Leadim4u which is nothing else than another of his own scam business :Quote from: gpncoin on October 10, 2018, 07:35:02 AMAnnouncment!One Of The Biggest Affiliate Networks In Wprld With More then 30,000 Active Affiliates And 2,000 campaigns Have Decided Ti Implement The GPN Coin As Payment MethodCoin Is Already Implemented And Used By The Network To Be Used As payment method to withdraw profit from the network LEADIM4U:https://leadim4u.com/You can find on the website RBS everywhere which stands for Roee Ben Shushan.

He was asking people to register and trade on Binance with his referral link to get profit from their trading. And he was saying that it will help the listing of GPN on Binance because Binance will see that GPN is sending them new users.Quote from: gpncoin on October 10, 2018, 09:26:28 AMalso,if users want to get GPN Listed In Binance: DONT PAY US.Just Register here To Binance And Start Trading. it will help GPn Get Listed Faster In Binance:https://www.binance.com/?ref=18003110Screenshot : https://imgur.com/a/ZMJgm1uLink to authenticate : Not available as he started to delete his old posts before I could save them5) After the ICO, he started to put sell orders on Token Store and DDEX exchanges and dump the price while he was accusing people.Those 2 wallets are his wallets and he was using them to sell the token :First wallet (wallet W1) : https://etherscan.io/address/0x4705ec465a549ef0fa3e75d37ec87bac154b10ebSecond wallet (wallet W2) : https://etherscan.io/address/0x0663a5c12e3f6bf59a2ac6c95ffc5fe90393554eYou can see that all the ETH collected from the sell orders were sent to his main wallet : https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f5affd524e4f0efffa61e25f85c05aff37de051In the first wallet 0x4705ec465a549ef0fa3e75d37ec87bac154b10eb, we can see the interactions with the Partyland Deployer (his ongoing scam).

I started to alert all the bounty managers and hunters promoting his new Partyland scam and I was always repeating the same things to give them proofs. Now we have a unique topic anyone can refer to and that I can keep updating.As I said in my first message, I wanted it as much detailed as possible so I can use the link to this topic as a reference every time I will report him somewhere.As much as this topic harmed his scam (he keeps asking me to delete it, with threats or corruption attempts), he still continue his effort to push his scam, as he is targeting newbies who don't read or don't understand much in crypto. Bots to grow his telegram groups, fake volume on Opensea to be more visible by trading his NFT between his own wallets, lies about the ongoing development of the platform, etc... You can even see him still posting about his NFT in his announcement topic right after my message tagging him as a scam with a link to this topic...Believe it or not, but even after the scam accusation and all the proofs I've provided, some people still want to hope it is not a scam and that they will earn something from it...Even if some people will still be scammed, I won't let him scam easily and I know this kind of post bother him as it slows him down.I will post soon the next step about what actions can be done to report him. He is a cancer for the crypto industry and businesses in general and he has to be reported.",
