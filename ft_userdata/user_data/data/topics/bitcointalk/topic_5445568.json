Through education you'll be able to make yourself better with acquiring knowledge about bitcoin and the same could help you have even more number of bitcoin. Just because you've done your school education you were able to know about bitcoin, if not things would've been in the opposite way.",

My advice is just follow the undergraduate program in that college. Continue to study and process to improve yourself in college.The educational title that you will wear later after graduation and all the certificates or all the knowledge you get are actually just bonuses. The most important thing is that if you enter college or go through that education, you will continue to hone our thinking skills, ways of solving our problems, ways of social life with a wider and more diverse scope.Sometimes a person will work not in accordance with the degree he has. But the important point is that you have to improve your thinking skills, speaking skills, writing skills, problem solving skills and social skills.This is a matter of increasing your abilities and elevating yourself to work, family and society in the future.Quote from: cafter on March 19, 2023, 05:48:44 PMIf, I will learn everything from books/online, will any company will give me job by just completing school/12th class.? and without any type of certificate .?The company may still accept you according to the latest education, but don't expect to be able to occupy a good position or get a lot of salary in a company.Sometimes there are several large companies that accept employees regardless of their last education, but the employee must really have something expertise that not everyone has.Quote from: cafter on March 19, 2023, 05:48:44 PMbecause i don't have enough money to invest in education and thinking to buy bitcoin by half of education money ,Investment is important, but you will not be able to invest if you do not have income later.Education is one way to improve the quality of yourself and to get a good and decent income if you want to work in a certain company.",

In the companies and industry they give zero fucks about what you study, they only care about results, if you give them good results you will keep your Job and you will be able to grow in the business.I spend a lot of time studying and getting some nice degrees, but I never worked on my area, I learned about bitcoin on my way and decide to make cryptos a lifestyle, and here I am while I should be working on a chem lab.  My recommendation is to see the school as a gym and the brain as a muscle. Never stop learning new things. And ut your work and your time where your passion is.",

You might not get enough knowledge from college degree as much as you can get from the internet.But the degree will land you a good job where you can save some money and buy bitcoin later.Bitcoin is here to stay and so are you but right now it's time for you to get that education and experience and make your parents proud.Keep learning about bitcoin and you can try to do a part time job to save yourself some money which again you can use for education or buying bitcoin.",

If you want to become an engineer or a doctor, you have to go to University. But if you want to become a web developer, like front-end developer, react developer, UI/UX designer, then you don't need to go to University because all that matters for employer is your portfolio. You have to know your local market and how is the situation in certain fields. There are professions in some countries where companies don't require certificates but there are countries where certificates carry actual value, for example in Germany.You have to fully analyze and decide yourself what to do, it's your future, not ours, so it's easy to talk about.",

I do not know what is the timing and workload of your colleges have for you. but we are free after 2 PM and have not had that much workload on us. (my because i study in a cheap university, hehe.) well, that's one of the factors. So I was saying you should not skip studies to earn money because by doing so you will close opportunities doors for yourself and will regret when in future you will need those certificates to get a job or to start a business. if you think you are not able to go to college just because you are shy then it's one of the biggest reasons to go college because there you will not only learn or get experience from seniors you will also groom and become more socialized. Buying bitcoin from half of your education money and hoping to end the bad days of life while doing jobs for others will get you nowhere. Well, i hope you would mind learning skills that will pay you best and from those skills, you could build a business. Because my logic is if you came into this world contribute in it by sharing your knowledge or benefit others by your skills. Quote from: cafter on March 19, 2023, 05:48:44 PMIf, I will learn everything from books/online, will any company will give me job by just completing school/12th class.? and without any type of certificate .?Maybe or maybe not, it depends on the strictness and nature of the companies, some companies only seek certificates with zero experience, but some seek only experience. if you could not get any of those then you will remain behind and you will be useless to the community or to your country. which no doubt will be a loss to the country. (no Offense) just sharing my point of view. A proper mindset and roadmap is one of the key components to achieving success in life and I am happy you consider those by asking these questions. I always wanted to be a senior programmer but never try to achieve this aim with the proper strategy I was just following those people who lack knowledge in that domain, and i get nowhere. I will give you a combo of advice that hear everyone and follow only your instincts. (maybe some of the members will not agree on it but it is what it is)",

So how can you find a job without experience since a lot of company doesn't even care about fresh graduates? For me having a degree for the course or field you like, it can be applicable in the future once you have a proper experience. I know a lot of millionaires who are undergraduates due to they pursue on business , trading and investing rather than wasting their time in college. But there's no guarantee that you'll success if you are more on talk than actions because knowledge is the key to success so if you're not doing anything to improve then you won't succeed.
