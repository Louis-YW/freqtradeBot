      "body": "This is unique quality of this forum, you will not see in any other forum. DT members are doing there job honestly. Indeed This forum is a best place for getting full knowledge about any financial topic especially cryptocurrency. This is why here no tolerance for spam/scam or any misguides. Many members signups here including me as a beginner and then learned a lot in short period which is not possible in other social platform. Youtube, twitter are also place of earning but influencers will also misguide you because mostly are hired by projects.  There are also some compaign manage by reputed members to improve quality which is plus point for meaningful content. Quote from: 1miau on August 13, 2022, 04:04:06 PMProviding a good posting quality is essential to keep Bitcointalk’s role as an important source of Bitcoin-related content, with hopefully some new people signing up here and of course, established members staying active and not leaving Bitcointalk.",

I was also amazed to see the police on this forum and how active they are.But recently a member, died and he used to be a spam buster, I hope his place will be filled by some other member and it will. Because nothing remains empty for so long, positions are refilled. Well, this forum has grown a lot, I am saying it because I recently got to use another forum ALTT, which is also awesome but things are different there and other things too. What I am trying to say is the law and regulation system is also a little different here and there. I am not saying any of the both bad ones, just saying there is a difference.",

Talking about the the transparency of the forum, I think transparency is one of the things that has made the forum to be very standard because the rules doesn't favour certain people and punish others, the judgements and penalties for the offenders and rule breakers are same likewise the rewards for good forum users.",

Some people are not per say above the law but based on their reputation they community looks the other way.It is just like being a  traffic police, sometimes a road user may be let off with a warning and while another person may be given a ticket. To be fair, I have seen both newbies and oldies being given a second chance. The former based on lack of experience while the latter because someone put in a good word for them.",

You should focus on learning the topics you are interested in learning about, especially cryptocurrency. The forum also has rules, which you should abide by because, in any organisation or setting where many goals are accomplished, rules are necessary. The only advice I can give you regarding the forum is to read the rules, make sure your topic is well-written, and have good ideas for your response when you wish to respond in person.
