  "content": "Based on a recent incident I came across on X, I have realized that a lot of us don't actually practice what we preach when it comes to the safest way to hold bitcoins securely.Many of us, the Bitcoin OGs are quick to advice newbies to get a hardware wallet, that it is the best way to hold bitcoin and other supported crypto assets securely, but coming back to ourselves, many of us don't do the same, probably out of over confidence in ourselves that our wallet can never be hacked due to our already vast knowledge in crypto.I am making this thread to let us all know that nobody is safe, be you an OG or newbie, you need to get yourself a hardware wallet if you must hold your bitcoins and other crypto assets with rest of mind.I came across a post from this dude on twitter whose bitcoin wallet was hacked, and all BTC25+ held since 2012 he said belonged to him and his father were all stolen, this is one lost that will be very hard to get over, holding 25+ bitcoins since 2012 and just one day, in a twinkle of an eye, it's all gone.Anyways, in a 5 minutes video he posted on X which i will share below, he did mention always advising people to get a hardware wallet and store their bitcoins on it, meanwhile he himself doesn't own or use one, due to his confidence that he could never be hacked, but unfortunately, it happened, he got hacked.This is something for us all to learn from, nobody is an expert when it comes to online security of your bitcoin and your funds, get a hardware wallet today to significantly increase the safety of your funds.Here the link to tweet on X - https://x.com/RMessitt/status/1723141037856596175?s=20Click the shot to watch his 5 minutes video also on X..",

You can safely set up an offline wallet on airgapped device and it will work same as an hardware wallet. Also hardware wallet or probably all cold wallet isn’t just the problem but also how we back up our seed phrase or keys. Even with hardware wallet if you don’t store your seeds properly it will still be needless.",

You're right that everyone should practice what we're preaching if we tell people to hardware wallet and then we don't even have it, you're helping others but not yourself. But if a newbie just known that hardware wallets are good way to store our Bitcoin and he advises that while having no hardware wallet yet, I think that's fine as it's just sharing knowledge and soon that person might own one then.Aside from advising to own hardware wallets, we must also check out how we are browsing the web. With our activities, it is the mainly reason how we become vulnerable.",

This is what I was thinking as well, a hardware wallet without a doubt is a practical device for those that do not really know how to secure their computers and coins on their own, but if you have an old laptop lying around and you install Linux in it, keep it updated, keep it offline and you only use it when you want to make a transaction then you can get the same functionality than a hardware wallet, however if a person does not really think they can do all of that then they could go through the hardware wallet route and keep their coins secure that way.",

It is crazy how we can start feeling invincible in crypto until someone we think is an expert gets hacked.  Goes to show that we all gotta stay vigilant no matter how long we have been in the game.  Probably good for me to brush up on keeping my holdings secure.  Cant get lazy...  The world is full of bandits ready to snatch your goods! Thanks for the nudge, OP, to make sure my wallet is locked up tight.  Better paranoid than sorry when it comes to protecting my investment.",

Anyway, I don't get why he'd store seed phrases in a password manager. It's just a step more secure than holding it in your email or on google drive. I don't use a hardware wallet at the moment, but I've always had an airgapped machine that holds all my .dat files and I don't even have seeds for these wallets, just good old password protected files stored on a computer that gets powered up once or twice a year and is small enough for me to carry out of the building in case of flood or fire. I also have a spare backup drive in case something happened with the main computer and that one is well hidden, so it's theft-proof. For small transactions I have my desktop wallet that's online all the time and stores coins I get from signature campaigns. It's a risk, but a risk I'm willing to take for the sake of convenience.",

If he keeps being sorry about it, some health problems will follow and that's when he'll realize he shouldn't have given too many fucks about it. Many people despise legacy banking and financial markets but bitcoin etf's (or trust funds or whichever is available nowadays) like grayscale come handy in these situations.People should indeed own their private keys/seed words but not everybody has to. Especially If you are only interested in the price of bitcoin, there is no need to hold too many coins in your hard/paper/soft/cold/whatever wallet. Funds like GBTC will take care of it and you can never lose your coins that way.",

However, there may be valid reasons such as many not importing hardware wallets simply because cryptocurrency and all its related devices are illegal in their country. This reality is happening to me. But since I haven't been able to use it currently I wouldn't suggest it to people as it just doesn't look right to me, I have and will continue to suggest others use the hardware to make those investment more secure.Quote from: sunsilk on November 12, 2023, 07:51:47 PM.Aside from advising to own hardware wallets, we must also check out how we are browsing the web.

The dunny thing is that a hardware wallet is hard to see in my country and I don't think that I will be able to buy one. I still believe that it is very easy to get an old computer and use it as a cold storage wallet and generate your seed on offline and never connect that computer to the internet, since it still serve the same purpose of a hardware wallet.Since bitcoin gave is the opportunity to be our own bank then our wallet security lies in our hands, and this is why one must take wallet safety very serious to avoid the loss of your bitcoin. A word is enough for a wise because nobody is safe, but when you are careful and do the right thing, you can be safe from these hackers.",

Yeah, not the end of his world but he'll surely be having hard time of getting up and starting to pull everything together. Resiliency of a person depends on how optimistic he is and if he's not like that, he'll dwell on this situation of being sorry and regret for a long time. I guess a week or even a month of sorrow is just fine and enough but if it takes longer, he does need to seek some professional help or not even from the professionals but to get and ask support from his immediate family.Quote from: Adbitco on November 12, 2023, 09:02:22 PMI can tell you with a loud voice that out of 100% bitcoin holders 40% of us do not own a reliable storage where our bitcoin can not be touched or hacked by anyone untill it happens to any one of us before we could know that we need to buy one and store in our funds.

I think majority here, maybe because we really don't hold that much bitcoin or we have a hard time acquiring it, we seldom uses hardware wallet.But in any case, security should be the priority here. Maybe we can start with Electrum only wallet and then gradually learn the best securities out there, like air gapped PC, muti-sig or hardware wallet. And then back up all the seed and private key. And again, we should just keep quiet about our bitcoin because we are also not safe by criminals that might attack us physically in real world.",
