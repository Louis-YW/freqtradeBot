Why did you offered 300K USD to kick.com for streaming? Are you a big gambling influencer or something?Why do you have to use Eddie from stake.com as an example? He is the living proof, that the only way to profit from gambling is to own a gambling website, not gambling itself.",

The Wins should be bigger enough to compensate for the losses and earn profit as much as possible. It's like 3:1RR with at least 30% hit rate.3. Gambling is a long game, no pressure to make money fast. Slowly is the fastest way to make money in gambling like preschool to college.4.

Gambling should never be considered if one is seeking for a legitimate and dependable approach to make income. There is no such thing as qualified strategy in gambling; we simply pick out effective approaches that worked for us and apply them to our gaming activities.

Regarding the building right gambling strategy, it is not easy to beat the house edge so make your calculations carefully before testing the new strategy with real funds, IMHO.
