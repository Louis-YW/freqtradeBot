Why did you offered 300K USD to kick.com for streaming? Are you a big gambling influencer or something?Why do you have to use Eddie from stake.com as an example?

Gambling should never be considered if one is seeking for a legitimate and dependable approach to make income.

Â However there's no 100% guaranteed strategies in gambling because a good number of profits are out of luck but left for me I'll say that one of the best strategies to be a successful gambler is by avoiding greed, greed is not a friend to the casino and you ought to know when the quit cause the more you're trying to recover loss or make more profits from little stakes the more you stand a chance of losing.Â Another method I could recommend is staking high with little odds, this strategy had been of good benefit cause I've come to understand that the lower the odds the higher the chances of winning a bet and it also makes betting easier for me, you can join me and make a roll over of 1.50 and stake with 4k and make a profit of 6k.",
