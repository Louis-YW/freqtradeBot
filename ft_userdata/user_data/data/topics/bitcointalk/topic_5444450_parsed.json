  "content": "So now we are all in a downside in all the cryptos generally speaking as I think this is because except Banks in Europe,in US,Japan and England they have all shown signs of disaster nearly to that of the Lehman Brother crisis in 2008 and they are all down to at least 5.6% which is a grave indicator.Now back to the title of the thread,many people are mining ETC which the price is 16.6 dollars right now and just a 100 Mhsh gives you about 0.014 approximately in rewards daily while this same Mhsh gives you almost 0.08 ETHW in rewards daily and the price of ETHW is 3.12 dollars right now.So why do people mine more ETC which I think has a more limited upside in the next bull run compared to ETHW and it is much more difficult to mine ETC compared to ETHW,I am not seeing the catch and don't tell me ETC is better as both coins have had security breaches before.",

      "body": "ETC is an old coin and is more trustworthy among miners. Mining on ETC or ETHW video cards gives very little profit due to the emergence of new ASICs, so there is not much difference in profit. Now mining these coins is not profitable even at a cost of 6 cents.",

      "body": "Perhaps the fear of the unknown when it comes to a new coin like ETHW. Most miners and traders are a little more familiar to ETC since it's an older coin (about 7 years now) and has shown promising up turns in the past, whilst ETHW is still an uncharted territory. ETHW could just continue to tank even during the next bull run.",

      "body": "In times of crisis/bear market, everyone has their own plan and goal, and many people would rather mine a more solid and stable currency than take a risk with a currency that may be worthless in a few months.ETC was once worth $133 at its peak, and some may think that in a likely BTC bull run, the coin may reach its ATH again.On the ETHW side we don't have enough data yet to predict a possible peak price.And I think a very relevant fact should be taken into consideration: ETC has many more projects and developers than ETHW. Although I think ETC has lost a lot of its relevance, it is still stronger than other currencies.At the moment, it seems that mining ETHW is an option for those waiting for a pump to sell.Eventually in a bull run there may be very large unexplained pumps.In short, those who mine ETC prefer a more stable coin that will get a good sale value in the future, while ETHW would be more of a gamble.Being honest, which coin do you think has more chances to remain active and with a good price?My answer is ETC without a doubt.",

But given that the core dev team appears to be a bunch of scammers who were incompetent at coding it (they needed outside help/corrections) and listed a bunch of companies as supporters including us on their website without permission I believe ETHW has no chance.

Sometimes the gamble pays off, other times it doesn't. We will wait and see.One thing I noticed about cryptos, especially altcoins is that hype is what drives their prices the most. Without hype, the coin prices will stay stagnant or continue dropping. Whatever happens to ETHW in the next few months or years will depend on how hyped up the community will keep up",
