Why is it that if a person is bad and they start treating him badly, the same attitude automatically relates to his subordinates, because they are not him? How to avoid humiliation in the social sphere if you are good and your boss is bad?The leader of the government or organization determines the public opinion of the people towards the group. If the leader has a questionable character the public will have a negative view of the organization. In the political setting if the government is corrupt the people will see everyone that is part of the government as untrustworthy. In my country, a particular region of the country is rebelling against the central government because they are marginalized. For a few years now these people have been targeting a killing government officials. They don't care how good such official is because they have tagged all government officials as oppressors. Also, the leader has the influence to force his followers to do evil. A good man can be influenced by a leader negatively. So the best and only way to avoid this problem is to resign from any organization or government that people believe to be bad. If you perceive that the leader of your organization is not doing the right thing, you have to depart from the place because everybody will think that you are in support or you are also involved in such bad practices.",

How to avoid humiliation in the social sphere if you are good and your boss is bad?The answer is simple,Â  because the leader controls the rest member of his team and due to fear of the leader,Â  even if the leader is not right in his idea or directives,Â  the followers have no option but to follow suit and when there is any mistake the whole team will be blamed for that,Â  but in a political setting,Â  even when the team fails,Â  it is the leader who will be called out for that and that alone is enough to suggest and point to how weak our political institutions have become.",

You want to get respected as well so, you'll just do what he's doing and that's why you'll also earn the respect that he's earning. It was like being a role model just as parents to kids and vice versa. We do have a point of view where it differs from person to person depending on the culture where we're living. And in this society, if people have been treating someone badly, there's a reason for it. For that, the person should realize and understand that there's something wrong with him and not the society but it can also be the opposite wherein that view has been passed on from person to person even without defending the badly treated person and these people have just relied on hearsays.",

I know you are trying to be positive but if you read my response to OP again, you will see that my main point is that if a person that is good or bad is placed on a group of people that are of the opposite attitude/personality, that person will inevitably be alienated or influenced by the group. Which is why most people tend to judge others depending on the type of people they surround themselves with.",
