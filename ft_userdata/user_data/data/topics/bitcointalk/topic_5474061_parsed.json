The memepool is currently congested because of the number of transactions going on it, this has caused transactions fee to increase rapidly. it is as a result of the bitcoin scalability issue and not the wallet.It's at least  better now compared to last week. the SEGWIT address is still the cheapest of all Bitcoin address and the fees are allocated by the miners not the wallet so don't get it wrong.",
