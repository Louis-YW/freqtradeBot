  "content": "Some people thought that the next ethereum merge will reduce bitcoin transaction fee, you can check the few misconceptions circulating around among people but which are actually not true but false. The MergeQuoteMisconception: \"The Merge will reduce gas fees.\"False. The Merge is a change of consensus mechanism, not an expansion of network capacity, and will not result in lower gas fees.QuoteMisconception: \"Transactions will be noticeably faster after The Merge.\"False. Though some slight changes exist, transaction speed will mostly remain the same on layer 1.You can click on the link and read the other misconceptions about the upgrade.",

That's about making ethereum will not be so inflated and changing the consensus to the POS mechanism. I think that people didn't even aware about this. They keep talking about scalability upgrade. Perhaps it was just a typo mistake from the OP because we know that there is no correlation from the merge to bitcoin fees. Of course it has nothing to do like reducing the gas fees because it is just moving form PoW to PoS.And so if there is a huge demand for ETH then the gas fees will continue to exist.For sure many are not that technically adept to understand what will happen to the merge but it's good the ETH foundation themselves are clearing this misconception.",

The merger event is only a few days away and many people are still misinterpreting the event. Upgrading to POS only helps ethereum reduce energy consumption by up to 90% like atltcoins using POS today. If we want gas fees to go down and the processing speed and scalability of the ethereum network, we need to update our sharding technology, which is expected to happen next year. I also read news about USDC, they said that they will only support Ethereum poS and not support ethereum poW at all if there is a hardfork.",
