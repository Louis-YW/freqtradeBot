      "body": "They are all centralized exchanges, they can ask for KYC at anytime. I use Huobi global and OKX among all.I was unable to access Huobi global derivative trading until I did KYC. Maybe this has changed On OKX, I was able to use derivative trading, and able to withdraw to certain amount. I left the exchange for like a month or two. When I went back to the exchange, I deposited some amount of bitcoin. I converted it to USDT. A time came when I wanted to move the USDT to another address, i was asked to verify my mobile number. I was unable to withdraw until I verified my mobile number. I wanted to create a thread about this some months ago when it happened, but I just thought it is not necessary because it is still a centralized exchange.People should know that using centralized exchanges can come with some inconveniences too like freezing of your coins and blocking of your account. But even if this is not the main discussion of today, there is still the fact that they can freeze your account and demand for KYC compulsorily.",

I have issue recently with them all my mine coins are automatically transferred to their exchange(From ViaBTC to CoinEx) the problem is I'm planning to withdraw my funds from them but I can't able to login I don't know why but I'm sure my password is correct that is why I ended up using forgot password and it requires to pass KYC verification with your selfie including your fan sign that you are changing your password after giving them it changed and can able to login again. So if you are using Coinex make sure that you are ready if this will happen to you the same as mine because KYC is required when resetting the password.",

It's not that great of an exchange and still does some shady stuff but it's nothing like it was before during the \"hack\".

      "body": "Quote from: Ratimov on September 22, 2022, 07:40:56 PMThis happens quite often if you use the OKX exchange strictly for depositing / withdrawing coins with small amounts, as an exchanger. The exchange does not like this and therefore may ask people to verify their phone number.Probably what that happened. I deposit on the exchange frequently and of low amount like $40. Probably what that caused it. Many people will prefer to do it the way I did it too and a means it is very possible many people on OKX are doing KYC compulsorily.I like OKX though, the exchange has high liquidity. But about the KYC, I will not advice anyone to believe on those centralized exchanges like I said before, your coins are with them, they can make it impossible for withdrawal until you provide KYC. I remembered when Binance made KYC mandatory, I asked people on this forum if OKX is good. I joined OKX, thinking KYC would not be requested for, but I was forced to do KYC. That is the point.Quote from: stompix on September 23, 2022, 12:05:52 AMIt might be interesting also to add the counties which are blocked from trading on these exchanges as most of them are not allowing US citizens to do so.That is US, they prefer to just trade on exchanges where only US customers are present, except those p2p exchanges. About including the countries where the exchanges are not allowed, the list can be very long and I do not think it is necessary for the OP to do that because it is not what we are talking about.",

There are no stablecoins or modern cryptocurrencies.There is Bitcoin, monero and it works.Please don't tell me that crap like MEXC or Ascendex you listed are ''good'' exchanges.  This is not the topic with review about exchanges, just about ones that don't have mandatory kyc.I don't recommend any exchanges I listed before, except Bisq and I clearly said that.",

To get level 1 verification, which opens access to the withdrawal of $ 2000, you need to fill out the following things:Like I said before, I never filled any of my real personal information and phone number field is empty, I never sent them any documents and I can still use ftx exchange perfectly normal for all crypto deposits and withdrawals.They can ask whatever they want each time I log in but it's not mandatory for limited amounts up to $2000 per day.They could change this at any time so I am not recommending anyone to use this method with larger amount of money.Quote from: Ratimov on September 23, 2022, 04:45:01 PMYeah, it's very appropriate to compare a billion-dollar top exchange like MEXC to some dull low-liquid shit that is TradeOgre.  Of course, you don't have any intelligible justification why such an exchange as MEXC is crap.LOL billion-dollar top exchange located maybe in some chinese village garage, it has fake volume and unrealistic high amount of BTC withdrawal limit... scam just waiting to happen",

In MEXC case I think its very high, much higher than of for example Binance, FTX, Coinbase etc.Quote from: dkbit98 on September 28, 2022, 11:33:17 AMI am not saying this exchange is not working right now, but isn't 20 BTC withdrawal limit for MEXC looks suspicious, when all other exchanges are reducing their limits or totally removing them like Binance.It is a high indeed (AFAIK withdrawal limit is even higher than that, according to this and for that you have to go through KYC), but Binance has even higher, that goes up to insanely high 8 million USD for users that did standard KYC.Quote from: Ratimov on September 28, 2022, 11:49:50 AMFor me, an exchange is garbage if it constantly blocks withdrawals or lists solid illiquid garbage in the listing.
