Okay lets take for instance if someone pays #600 to his place of work to and fro for 30 days thats about #18,000 then lets assume that the person earns like #30,000 you will see that his transportation alone has taken more than half of his salary thereby no much money left with him again and lets consider if its someone that has a family how will he be able to meet up catering for his family and also paying rent and other bills.Then in a situation whereby someone wants to buy something they can just order it online then a delivery man or dispatch rider brings it to them thereby reducing the cost of transportation they would have used to go and purchase it on their own.I think our government should create an online platform whereby its citizens can trade and make other business transactions so that the cost of earning a living in the country can be reduced to the minimal.Though i know that there are some challenges that might be encountered in the course of trying to perform business operations online like maybe for people that aint too lattered how they can be able to use this online medium for transactions and again sometimes one may not actually get the exact thing they ordered for but at least i believe that with time alot of people will be familiarize with the system just like during the naira redesign period where almost every individual in the country had to open account in other to perform business transactions due to scarcity of the naira note, i think it brought alot of sensitization among the citizens to know the importance of knowing how to handle online transactions though in these course, fraudulent activities are being experienced but with time it will reduce.Share your thoughts and opinion towards these ideas.",

This country really needs serious deliverance I swear",

Just imagine the job of a security personnel and gate men who need to be at there duty posts physically. Also imagine the work of a cashier in our local banks, they can't work from home because people need to see them physically everyday. What about those working in the farm and doesn't live within the farm settlement? The best thing to do is look for someone who works close to your office or in same office who has a car or motorcycle and negotiate with him on the need to ride with him on his car or motorcycle. You can be contributing in buying fuel weekly. Let's say you are spending #600 daily and you are working 5 days a week that will give you #3,000  per week you can discuss with the person that you will be contributing #2,000 on weekly basis. You have saved #1,000 per week. Or alternatively you can relocate closer to your work place to save you transportation expenses. QuoteThen in a situation whereby someone wants to buy something they can just order it online then a delivery man or dispatch rider brings it to them thereby reducing the cost of transportation they would have used to go and purchase it on their own.Remember when you are ordering something online the cost of dispatch rider will be added to the total cost that you will pay. This can only be effective in a situation where more than one person wants to go for the shopping. QuoteI think our government should create an online platform whereby its citizens can trade and make other business transactions so that the cost of earning a living in the country can be reduced to the minimal.Guy it is not the duty of the government to provide an online platform for all business activities in the country. Every business owner has the sole responsibility of deciding if there businesses should have an online platform where they can easily reach their customers. Government can only do this for businesses they control. What happen when the server is down and undergoing maintenance? Does this mean economic activities will be halted? Or will still go back to the physical market trading thereby still paying the cost we were avoiding in the first place.",

Illitracy, Lack of information on technology, inability to comprehend towards online creativity, inability to provide capital which enhance the process. Eg. Buying  of electronic gadgets like laptops or phone and steady subscription.

The primary motive of a business, is to make profit, and when there is no profit it's no longer a business. If your location is far from your working place, you need to either relocate closer to your work place, or look for work close to your location, to reduce the expenses.Quote from: Richbased on November 27, 2023, 03:33:59 PMThen in a situation whereby someone wants to buy something they can just order it online then a delivery man or dispatch rider brings it to them thereby reducing the cost of transportation they would have used to go and purchase it on their own.I think jumia and other online platforms are there, but not everything online can do for you. Odering something online will  not exit the expenses but will reduce it but definitely you must pay for delivery fee. So nothing is free.Quote from: Richbased on November 27, 2023, 03:33:59 PMI think our government should create an online platform whereby its citizens can trade and make other business transactions so that the cost of earning a living in the country can be reduced to the minimal.Share your thoughts and opinion towards these ideas.I will be glad if they do. But I doubt if you will really need the oder.  Because the charges they will extract from you, it will be better off to buy from a nearby store.",

When this kind problem arises, it's left for the innovative minds in the country to see the problem as an opportunity to make money by solving the problem so they start up companies that does logistics businesses. Already we get dem plenty for the country like dem jumia, Kongo, jiji and so on for online market and for logistics we get plenty delivery bikes dem wey you fit use receive your delivery so that one no be issue. Working from home is becoming a normal thing in the country especially among youths as working remotely na one of the hottest thing in town now so we dey get there definitely but make you know say we can't completely go remotely as we still need some physical workers going to work manually as we always had.

Your point dey valid and I no dey discredit am but you fit still run any kind of business online including that examples wey you use. People dey sell fish from house online without having to go to the market. We get wetin dem dey call personal shippers wey fit run all your shopping for you and you pay dem. Many of dem dey work through online, the market woman, if she play her compass wey fit no dey to dey come market again but dey do home delivery for people wey order from her online shop and she no even need create website. She can host it on any social media like Whatsapp, Twitter self or Facebook. We need to take advantage of this social media something because e dey create better connection to a wider range of audience wey dey in their millions. People dey find way to make their life less stressful so if you fit deliver for them (stress less life,, na better money dey this kind business).",

But let it be known that not everybody would earn a living from working at home. All fingers are definitely not equal. It is true that the advent of digital skills and marketing transactions are making wave in the world's economy, as it stands soft skills like the tech and trading  are the current paying factors in the economy and at the same time, digital currencies are fast becoming the most recommended form of transacting in the business market.    In subsequent times, the change will be massive as the world turns global, it's very best that as fast as one can, one should get for himself soft skills because they'll so much be needed in the long run even those that still end up working long hours and also the digital marketing ways should be learnt, understood and mastered. Try to give into the digital era as early as possible so it won't be challenging in the long run. The analogue world is fast becoming a digital world.",
