Bonds are also rallying and same with the equity futures.It’s not a true pivot but GS said that the fed will most likely not hike rates at all next meeting while a couple days ago they might of hiked 50bps. This is why the 2 year lost like 75 bps. Hence why risk on markets are rallying.",

But I see that this could become a trap, it won't last long, because we are still in the winter season and market conditions are still unstable.",

Read in full https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1337Yes the Fed will make deposits in the bank whole (printing money) so that means USDC is back to being whole.It'll be interesting to see what the Fed does as far as interest rates in like a week. 3 banks just failed in the past few days...and higher interest rates are gonna hurt the economy. Will be real interesting if the Fed lays off on raising interest rates for now to not exacerbate the sudden issues. At the very least I think this will cause them to stick with a 25 point raise instead of what looked more likely to be a 50 point raise after the lastest strong job growth and not great inflation numbers.",

Everyone has noticed that bitcoin pumps everytime his advice tells us to dump. There are some people starting to joke in social media that the Inverse Cramer ETF is presently becoming a substitute for a bitcoin ETF heheheehhe.",

That USDC depegged is also a factor. There was risk associated with the stable coin that lost its stability so there must be many who decided to convert to Bitcoin for safety reasons. There's already a severe precedent of a stablecoin that lost stability and collapsed. So there must be panic and quick conversions made to avoid a possible similar scenario.

This might be because it appears that the department of treasury of America and the Federal Reserve are going to give Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank the funding and the cashflow that they are needing to give their depositors 100% of their money.It could be for that reason, it could be for another. Initially when the SVB news came out, Bitcoin had already dropped to $20K and moved sideways after that, seemingly unaffected. Then price pumped back up to $25K and in the meantime they appear to be getting bailed out. I think it's easy to speculate that it's because of the bailout that price pumped, but didn't it already pump before this news anyway?In reality one of the reason Bitcoin was created is because of the lack of trust with centralized banks, and now we see a major bank go bankrupt for first time in Bitcoin's history (if not mistaken). To me it seems much more likely that the strength of the rebound was because SVB had liquidity issues and needed to claim bankruptcy and/or get bailed out, not because they were bailed out...The irony being is that $19K to $20K has been a strong level of support for 9 months already, and priced bounced back from there into the $25K resistance level that's also about 7 months old!",
