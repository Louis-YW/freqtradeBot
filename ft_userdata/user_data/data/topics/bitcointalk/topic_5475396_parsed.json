  "content": "Hi all,The idea is simple. It is like trustpilot or tripadvisor but limited to services which accept BTC as a one of the payment option.Why we need this:We have lots of listing topics on various service providers but when checking as an enduser I am confused to conclude with whom I may start with. For example, from the list of crypto debitcards, I want to test one service but I prefer the one which was recommended by one this forum member after tested for real which is not readily available, this topic will solve that.How to share:Please share your experience of any services which was availed by you for BTC in the following format:Name of the service & URL: Category:Rating /10:Verdict/Experience:Sharing is nothing short of caring:Already shared one incident on this forum, you may simply link, I will list here. (You do not need to write a review again just for this topic).Found a review by a full-member+, please link here.Things to be included primarily:Please add as much as information you found/gathered/experienced with a service which led you to like or dislike them under verdict/experience part. This will help others to avail right things by avoiding others.I will link your posts into here under categories.Few rules:1. No affiliate sh*t for any reasons.2. Newbie's entries will not be encouraged.(more to be added if needed)Disclaimer:1. Past things never endorse any future incidents. Always try new things with least risk.2. I am not affiliated to anywhere. I am just listing what people share on this topic.3. You need to do your own due diligence as this topic is only for outline and not for exact.",

If a wallet is close source, you have to be more cautious and careful when using it. If you have better options like open source wallets, you will have no or less reasons to use close source wallets.",

      "body": "Such lists need dynamic management, which is represented by a website where you update that list periodically, and you can write the date of the modification if there is any need for a recommendation.Some good BTC list websites ---> https://walletscrutiny.com/Hardware wallet --> https://thebitcoinhole.com/hardware-walletsIf you do not have experience in managing such sites, start by making a Google Spreadsheet, and over time you will find someone who will turn the idea into a website with you.",
