  "content": "Hey everyone!I'm trying to get some initial feedback on a new project I'm working on. The concept is simple, revolutionise the way real estate development projects in the UK are funded.By harnessing blockchain protocols we allow our web3 community to fund the development of real-world assets all through our self-serve platform; moving away from reliance on traditional institutions, we give the power of lucrative development financing to the people.I know this is a very brief and simple description so if you'd like me to share more details alongside our website and whitepaper feel free to drop a comment below.I would really appreciate it âš¡Thank you in advance for your time",
