  "content": "Today I received a PM from this user SCORUM.COMMUNITY who apparently is proposing partnerships, but does not inspire any kind of confidence.Here is the message he sent to me and other users:Code:[b]Hello![/b]I want to offer you a cooperation in covering the release of our game — P2E NFT Aviatrix.Aviatrix is a new and exclusive blockchain-based game based on the use of NFT tokens by each user. The game uses the Play-To-Earn (P2E) mechanics with NFT, when the user's game object (plane) upgrades depending on the experience and makes a profit depending on its place in the rating.The game has already received 2 Awards from prominent industry organizations such as ‘Unique Selling Point’ from Sigma Balkans and CIS as well as ‘Hackathon Winner’ of Binance Smart Chain.Visit our testnet to find out more about the game: [ftp=ftp://https://www.aviatrix.bet/]https://www.aviatrix.bet/[/ftp]The most suitable cooperation option for us is any mention of the game from your side here on bitcointalk (for example, mentioning our links in your signatures and writing posts in our thread). Could you also share a price list for such an advertising company?I will be very glad to receive your feedback if you are interested in our offer. Also, if you have other proposals for cooperation, I’d highly appreciate if you let me know about them.[b]Best regards,Alina[/b]The main highlight for suspects was the camouflaged link.Detritus, Pmalek, wmaurik, HEWRA, bounceback, Mazt rhiezt, Maestro75, Peanutswar, ThemePen Do not click on this link as it may contain malware or the like.If anyone else receives this message, stay tuned.However, I have already reported the situation to the moderators.If this is not where I should leave this alert, I apologize.",

Although i see nothing wrong or something malicious on the letter, just a proposal so i just ignored it since i'm not interested at all. And yep, looks like the majority here seems doesn't like such way of promotion or proposal via pm. Yet, i think this is best to reputation than meta.",

I didn't really pay attention to it after seeing the words \"NFT\", \"cooperation \", \"play-to-earn games\", etc. Since I never heard of the person who sent the message, I quickly checked their post history and noticed that the only forum activity they have was posting in a ban appeal thread. Judging by the people who reported having received similar PMs, it wasn't an isolated case where only those that joker_josue mentioned got PMed. I'm not sure what the goal here is and if they are in fact proposing an honest partnership, but clicking on the link and visiting the website is not something I am planning to do. I'm going to use my forum logic and conclude that it's a scam until proven otherwise.",

Therefore, I think that the ban evasion rule does not apply here.But regardless, mass sending of unsolicited PMs is not allowed. If they are looking for partners and promoters, they should do it publicly rather than privately.",

I'm going to use my forum logic and conclude that it's a scam until proven otherwise.  They are clearly spam messages trying to find some victims through these offers as they think NFT is the new trend and we can attract members towards our project which may or may not exist in reality with these keywords but you are right on the part that we should not click on the links we received from these newbie and strangers as we are aware about the phising scams in this space.Although I didn't receive this PM but in past have received some kind of trading partnership messages trying to scam you of funds and this is also the same but surprised to see how many of you have received his PM.Quote from: Halab on November 25, 2022, 09:41:40 AMI see him now banned (not by me).Do not hesitate to report this kind of PM.
