But truth be told, news like this, especially the ones coming from the US government can cause panic, and all thanks to social media, because they are the driving force behind such.But moving 10K BTC to Coinbase when price is at $58k sounds a little weird. Or has Coinbase always been keeping US government's Bitcoin?.And lastly, the Link you provided is not working. Is it general or just me ?.",

But no one cares whether they sell or do anything with those bitcoins . Governments or organizations selling large amounts of bitcoin are no longer scary, instead the market is gradually adapting and no longer cares. If you think people still care then they'll spend more time worrying about Mt.gox than the bitcoins the US government has moved.https://x.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1823375642953486636",

People just misinterpret everything US government do and they only look at those figures moved then get panic since they think there's negative effect it will give to the market. But we see people reaction on that situation and they should be calm in such situation since we need to normalize those kind of selling since there's provably instances that any institution will take their profit so we need to chill and don't get scared about those situation since it will never create scary dump in the market.Maybe some people like OP just want to hear some opinion from other people regarding on this action done by US government. So provably lots of people confused about that situation already know that there's nothing to get fear and its better for them to relax then focus on their investments.",

I agree with you that no reason to be panic now but disagree with you that moving bitcoin to an account on Coinbase Prime does not have any risk of selling now or in future. This movement can serve as moving to a third party custodial wallet but in future, it might be sold by the owner of these bitcoins, the US. government.It's more realistic to assume that these bitcoins will be sold, just a matter of time, when it will be sold only.

For most governments, Bitcoin has no particular value, especially considering that they didn't buy it, they confiscated it. Sometimes they decide to sell some of their Bitcoin when they need to, but on a national scale, these funds are insignificant to them. If they move it, it means they have plans for this coin. My opinion is that in this case, it would be better if holders who don't understand the value of Bitcoin (like some countries) sold it, and let it be in the hands of true holders.",

They are nearly the same, as transactions can be done for wallet switches or preparation for sales later.Do governments want to do this, move their Bitcoin transactions, to fud and manipulate the market?Only governments know intention of their activities but we only can know when they already sold their coins. At times of transactions, we are uncertain about next movements of these entities but to be sure, if those coins will be sold, market can survive and move next into the future. No need to feel panic when someone, some entities sell their bitcoins if we know and believe that Bitcoin will exist for a long time. I don't know how long but it won't die soon or die by any sales from governments.",

With 10K BTC being only a small fraction of daily volume, it’s not likely to impact the market much. Keep calm and keep holding! A big amount of coins moving to exchanges or back to wallets if a reason for nervousness, that trader should not trade, because they lack the trader's mindset. The latter needs to identify these changes but not get emotionally charged because of it. There are so many such movements happening every few days, what do we have to do about it? Wait for the price to drop and buy it, its plain and simple. Because when you have bought at that low you have ample points to sell at having a good multiplication of the price.",
