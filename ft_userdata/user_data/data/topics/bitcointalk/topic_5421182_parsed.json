  "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried is the most efficiency promoter of \"not your key not your coin\" (nyknyc). He promoted nyknyc inadvertently, but it is more effective than any good advice from a nice and qualified person. Even if Satoshi Nakamoto himself would show up to giving many interviews to the mainstream media and repeating nyknyc over and over again, it would be that effiecent.Maybe the Crypto Industrie needs such tragedy like FTX/Alameda so that average joe really understand nyknyc.",

So SBF alone may have done nothing if there wouldn't have been Luna, Celsius and the rest.",

If he was that good at advocating nyknyc then he wouldn’t have had the opportunity to steal billions of customer deposits for his own personal gain. I think some people just get too comfortable & too trusting in our industry. Either that or they’re just top dumb to take self custody of their coins. It’s sad that 10 years after Gox we still have people storing their wealth on centralised exchanges. What more needs to happen to drum in self custody. I guess it always happens to somebody else and it won’t happen to me until it does…..",

This is because you hate science, and you would rather fall into scam after scam after scam. Bernie Madoff is rolling in his grave.
