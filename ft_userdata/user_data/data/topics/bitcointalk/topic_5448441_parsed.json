Send me a PM if interested.Hello Kryptowerk, Thank you for the offer but no trades as it stands. After liquid bitcoin. Gotcha. Hard cash is always nice, I understand.  If you ever change your mind, though, don't hestitate to send me a message. Possibly also interested in that silver CryptHodl silver chip (trade).Ah and btw, sexy pics, comme toujours.",
