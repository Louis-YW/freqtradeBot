You are right and it's good to bring this in newbies' attention now and then, however I would extend this by recommending a good read of Why KYC is extremely dangerous – and useless. It doesn't cover the phone, still it's an eye opener for being much more careful on what data we give out to unknown people and businesses.I will add that even e-mail can be tricky and could be good to use only one e-mail (or set of e-mails) only for crypto related stuff.. because even changing e-mail can be a problem (eg. giving up an e-mail all your friends know).",

In that way, I don't have a problem with lost passwords, hacked email addresses, or restricted access.as long as I manage the domain, which in that case is hierarchically higher, I have no problem accessing any email address. I can also create a separate address for each service if I suspect phishing or something similar.",

It's close to \"browser saving password\" as usability, but it's not in the browser, hence imho safer.Plus, instead of having new e-mail for each new service, I have a list of e-mails I use for \"not so important\" things.I will add that certain e-mail providers (eg. gmx.com) offer a number of alias addresses so you don't even need so many accounts, and in case of problems you dispose the problematic alias.",

I don't remember signed up for any cryptocurrency exchange with my mobile number but every time I used the email but it doesn't mean you can feel safer and also it is not advisable to use new email for everytime you register on a crypto related platform.If you feel you don't want to expose your primary email then keep a secondary email for every crypto related stuffs and when talking about exchanges never forget to avail the 2FA authentication security feature which can save you from phishing and swim swap attacks.",

It’s really dangerous to use mobile phone number only to create an account without any other security but this will be helpful if you setup multiple security since you can be easily notified if something is wrong with your account.In my case, I’m depositing significant amount of money on my exchange so I use personal email and sms to create my account since it will be painful in case I use only a dummy email or sms and somehow I lost access on it since I’m not using it most of the time. I still preferred my personal sms to give me quick update since I’m not viewing email very often. But of course I’m just doing this on website that I can trust not and not to those mediocre services.",

With phone number, there is Sim Port AttackWith email, you must turn on 2FA that has two options (SMS code and 2FA application). You should not choose SMS code because sometimes you will have issue to receive SMS code. Reasons can be from telecommunication company or newly applied restrictions in your country.With 2FA application, you are free from government and it is how we survive in crypto.When you use 2FA, make sure you backup its code for recovery if your initial device is technically broken.",

One of the things that is required, for example: the exchange I use is 2FA, phone number and email, needful.My country has a rule for its citizens to use a phone number of no more than three registered phone numbers/one citizen, which is for sure at this time the phone number that I use is only for crypto exchanges, The second and third phone numbers are free for me to use, but for now there are no suspicious signs, for that the phone number I use for the crypto exchange, the phone number is not used for others, only for exchanges, it's regardless of risk.",

After that, I had to change the number and use separate numbers for both calls and instant messengers.",
