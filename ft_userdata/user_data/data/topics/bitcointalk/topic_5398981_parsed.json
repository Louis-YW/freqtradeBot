Btw those three projects on the list seems not familiar. If they're new, welll it's unpredictable IMO.",

All token mentioned in list are long term coin but price you set will not happen soon. Xrp price is now less than 1$ and for reaching 3$ it requires big news and good market condition. Bnb and Etherium can get your goal very soon because they are very top coins with large Usecase and with recovery of market these will follow BTC faster than any other coins.",

But considering they are centralized and people are moving away from them, a coin that reached second position, barely standing in top 10? I can't guarantee anything but at the same time I cannot say it won't happen.However, I am well aware of bnb and eth, and I know that they will be doing much better and they could reach not only those numbers but they will reach a lot better numbers as well. I do know that it will be much better, 1k+ is nothing for BNB, and it will be even 5k right now, and ETH will be 20k+ one day as well.",

The plan should be easy to develop and make sure you feel the risk factors as well as the profit from this market going on. For me, there are only a few that I can see myself being interested in for the long term. Other than BTC and ETH, the rest depend largely on trend signals taking place, and they are easily obtainable regardless of price levels. That's when the market is going strong, and that has to have a specific condition. If you have faith in that plan, there will be people who will discuss it as good or bad, but if you are sure of your strategy, is it worth it? set phrases from the outside. When we experience success or failure, we will learn from both.Yes, but what you suggest, like ETH $8000 I also think it is very feasible in the future, as I myself have made some profits in this market so far, and those profits never came. The hour comes quickly, and escaping the influence of the crowd as well as the mentality of steadfastness is part of the chance of profitable success for me.",

It may take another years again for XRP to solve its problem. Using a token that owned by a foundation that is still in a problem with the regulators were very bad choices. Sometime it can be collapse but at least this is not doing the worst like luna. Be a wise person is the best thing for now. Investing only in the reputable token and coin available on the market. Avoid to use coin or token with so many problems that have not yet solved as investment.",

In these situations, it is hard for all of the altcoins to lift the price and make a new ATH, and that is because the BTC price movement is not too good. But I am sure that those 3 coins can achieve the new ATH, while I don't know about the other coins Just stick to those 3 coins plus bitcoin, and you will be okay. With preparing at this time, we will see the next altcoin season soon.",

Even if you only hold ETH and BNB it will suffice. The bottom line is your level of trust over a long period of time. Altcoins are still altcoins, which is not a 100% guarantee. It's just that if I were you, it wouldn't be divided into a large number of altcoins too much.",
