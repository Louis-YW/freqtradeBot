If you take 10 matches from 1.07, you will end up at approximately 2.10, which is not the same as choosing 1 match that is also at 2.10. You are the favorite in every match, but if it goes wrong in 1 match, you have lost your entire bet. To be honest, I wouldn't put a lot of money into such a strategy right away. However, any strategy can work if you make well-considered choices and don't just pick matches blindly. There are people who have become very rich with multi bets.",

      "body": "it's a clever idea play single match and not as multiplier. probably in this part of the season, after a world cup, during Christmas holidays, underdog teams can have some chance so not bad at all... however the odds are an indicator of probability of a certain event. if the odds is @6 it means that around 1/6 you can get a win  I will be not really confident on it but let's see if you are lucky enough and achieve a decent win  good luck!",

      "body": "I do feel the odds of winning, however possible, might be quite easy if you have some major gambling experience. The psychology of gambling is developed after several tryouts, only then can a strategy be formed. As it concerns soccer, it might just click but soccer is one hard game for multipliers.Also, I doubt the frequency of winnings is going to be much as compared to making single bets. I do like your thinking and willingness to openly share your strategy. I would try these out one of these days and encourage any of my friends who find this probable to also give it a try.",

But if it parlay, I am guessing he will lose it.Well, we know if the odds are high, usually, the bookies are right.

So, what do you think, will I lose the 6 bets?Imagine in fact if you did not bet on the underdogs but you placed a parlay for these three teams which would be about 1.7 in total so you would have won now,Leeds lost 1-3,Arouca is losing 3-0 already in first half and Paris has beaten Strasburg.What we can learn from these bets is that you never put a parlay forÂ  3 teams with underdogs and even 3 single games for the underdogs usually do not give you a good payback because most of the times you lose.It is better to place parlays with these favorites or find a good single.Personally I am loving the both teams to score experimenting I am doing because most of the games in the popular leagues end like that so if we are careful to read the news and check the stats we can get a big multiplier by chasing for example instead of 3 underdogs 3 both teams to score yes games with odds 1.8 and up and the odd would be 6 or more but with much higher chances than betting on the underdogs.",

So, what do you think, will I lose the 6 bets?I haven't bet on football but I used parlays many times when betting on my favorite sports, and it's hard to hit a 6 game parlay obviously because you really don't know what to expect as you have said.There were games that you think it's a easy call because the team has a higher chance of winning and then you add it to your parlay. However, that one game, that will totally ruined and destroy your parlay and it's very hard to accept it, hehehe. So as much as you analyze the game itself and thinks team A will win, but then again, you need that element of luck as well to hit that magical 6 game parlays of yours. That's why I only bet like 2 with odds higher like 2.5x or 3 game parlay with 3.5x odds and then put a decent money (maybe around $100 and up) instead of looking for a huge odds of 7.x higher.",

I too go for underdog sometimes just because I used just little amount of money on betting, so if I lose, I will not think about it like something left my bucket because the money used for it is small. All I have noticed about betting is that there is no way you can win the betting site more if you gamble more, even if you are selecting the underdog, they still get your money, if you are taking the strongest team, they have small odds that still will let them win your money.",

Yes mate, chasing for huge multipliers through parlays are very hard to get, even a 2 game bet parlay is already very difficult to predict, what's more if you bet 5 or more, the odds are not on your side. Try this on tennis as well, maybe the most I got is predicting 5 games but that is one time only, and that is very very hard and probably I did get it because it's on early rounds so mostly rank players vs un-rank but still though there are the chance of an upset.",
