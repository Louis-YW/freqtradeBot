But you have to consider everything about what you are going to do. It depends on where you live, because now those who accept payments with bitcoin are not comprehensive, even in some countries they are still considered illegal and are still prohibited from existing. Also one has to consider whether you will actually make payments with bitcoins during a bear market like this, because it will eat up a lot of bitcoins that you will spend.",

In order for Bitcoin to be accepted as a form of payment across the board, all the countries in the world that govern the world need to work together. If they all work together it is possible to make Bitcoin the only currency, At the same time, payment for everything is possible with Bitcoin.But in any case it is my personal opinion that most countries will start exchanging Bitcoin within the next few years.",

So I urge every one of us to key into cryptocurrency as a means of exchange in any businesses we deal with.It's actually a great idea to adopt Bitcoin as a payment method in our business but before we do that there are certain factors that we must consider before the implementation of it. It's same thing as opening a wheelchair shop in a community that has zero amount of crippled people. If you want to introduce Bitcoin payment into your business the most important question you should ask your self is; the people that are going to patronize me, do they have any idea of what Bitcoin is? Or do they even understand how the whole Bitcoin transaction work? If the answer is NEGATIVE then you can consider organizing a lecture on how to get started with Bitcoin you can teach them things like; how to buy Bitcoin, how to keep your Bitcoin safe ( things to consider when choosing a Bitcoin wallet) etcetera etcetera etcetera. And in the process of all these you'll will end up building a relationship with them that will definitely affect your business positivity.",

Other thing again I sense there is that, bitcoin is more cheaper and faster, smarter for transactions compared to buying USD from bank. I.e, buying USD with their local currency then trade to btc before using it for payment of goods is more cheaper than buying USD from bank and use it as a payment the charges are much unlike bitcoin.",
