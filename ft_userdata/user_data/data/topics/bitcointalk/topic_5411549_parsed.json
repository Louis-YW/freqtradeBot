Be that as it may, although I understand that it is difficult for people to survive (especially today), but is it even possible to earn something from all those worthless tokens that sometimes they don't even get for their work?Quote from: DaveF on August 29, 2022, 03:14:29 PM~snip~Looking at it, how many people who are on this thread as of now would want to be associated with the projects these people are posting / tweeting / writing about?I know that I would never agree to be associated with such and similar projects, but there are always those who will not only promote such projects, but also manage them for the right price. According to the criteria of this forum, some bounty managers are members with very high trust, and they don't mind being associated with such projects.",

Registration in the bounty takes place in batches, with a difference of seconds, and minutes. If someone starts to convince me that this is a company of people, friends who suddenly decided to participate in the bounty every minute, and after registration has the same time to leave the forum, I will never believe it.Even if there are companies of friends, there will still be a time difference, in this case, everything happens clearly like clockwork.The task is to register several accounts, then register in another company, and so on.But what the OP caught, unfortunately, is not the limit.It is difficult to fight the machine, but one day the machines break down and fail.Accounts with synced activities are marked with a negative tag.",

This doesn't show it's 1 person, but also doesn't prove it's more than 1 person but every 2-4 account use the same 1 wallet up to 63 different wallet among all accounts.It's a big farm, but to be honest I wouldn't tag them individually to 145 accounts. One of my reasons for that is because the bounty manager doesn't care about all these cheaters even though the bounty rules have warned him. No matter how many thousands of newbie were caught and tagged for cheating, they would continue to exist for even bigger waves.But OP, I appreciate your time and hard work. You are amazing.",

But, no doubt, there is some crazy shit going on.You will be surprised by how far account farmers can go.Polar91 had around 109 documented high ranking alts that were not only participating in bounties but some signature campaigns too. as soon as the accounts were busted, they all became inactive from that time showing that it was probably one individual or perhaps a couple of them.",
