  "content": "1 month ago, I made a mistake, I sent $2418 USDT (TRX network) from my Binance account to a TRX address of Duelbits. At that time, I have both TRX and USDT in my Binance account, so I send mistakenly USDT-TRC20 instead of TRX because both of them are on the same TRX network.The following is the info of my transaction (31 July 2023)https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/de46cb587e41bfa38093384c71f7fbfd33daccf3d113d7a562e70c486958cd6dThe TRX address of Duelbits: https://tronscan.org/#/address/TVivvjzWVb37N4Fz9vGpJLLg8GoFYd2A4gIn the past, I deposited TRX correctly to that address many times.I contacted Duelbits support many times since that day, but each time they only tell me that they don't have any update and as soon as there's an update, they will get back to me (via emails)It's been over 1 month without any updates. I don't know how much time I must wait. Is it possible for duelbit.com to retrieve my wrong deposit ?Thanks for reading my question.--------------------Full story about my mistake: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465827.msg62806874#msg62806874--------------------Conversation with Duelbits support so farhttps://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/07/mEw1d.pnghttps://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/07/mEuRI.pnghttps://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/07/mEd2g.pnghttps://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/07/mEa5H.pnghttps://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/07/mEUEv.pnghttps://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/07/mE2wb.pnghttps://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/07/mNl8C.pnghttps://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/30/PvefT.png (Update 12 Sep 2023)https://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/09/30/Pvq8l.png (Update 26 Sep 2023)",

How hard for them to recover the fund? they did not promise a time frame for recovery? It is a shame to them that it took a month but the fund was not recovered, so where is their good reputation right now?Contact their manager too on their signature campaign, it will probably help you but don't expect too much, probably he surely has a contact direct from the duelbits team.

      "body": "Technically, duelbits should be able to retrieve funds as deposits address for usdt on trx network is usually the same as deposit address for Trx itself, and they also both share the same private keys , so if duelbits supports trx deposits, it means they have the private keys that control trx wallet, which should also be the private key that controls the usdt wallet even if the casino itself does not support usdt deposit through trx network..they can still recover this funds.But then as I understand, platforms usually do not recover funds sent over a wrong network for free, they often charge the customer to help him or her recover the fund, this is if they decide to help the customer recover the funds though ..So in the nutshell, this funds is very possible for duelbits to recover, but then, it's in their discretion or liberty to decide whether to help you(@op) recover the funds or not .",

Patience and persistence in your communication with their support team may be your best approach.I think it is possible for Duelbits to retrieve your wrong deposit but it is not guaranteed. The success of retrieving a wrong deposit depends on the difficulty of retrieving it. It has been over 1 month since you contacted Duelbits support.
