So to become the authority in any field, you really had to get your hands dirty, your feet wet to get and feel on what it is, and what you really want to accomplished.And this author become the authority but just doing that, they try to learn it by themselves and then sharing it to others, whether to gain financial freedom and others things in life. But the most important thing is that we should enjoy what we are doing, maybe we are motivated, but at the end of the day, life is hard but at least when we traverse that journey, we should learn how to smile and enjoy.",

Does it rely chiefly on there professional or focused field or by becoming best sellers from there books.Reading is good but, one has got to realise it doesn't end in the books. The books can offer you nothing more thanÂ  information, informations you can fund anywhere but what you do with that information is what makes most of the difference.You've got to be willing and ready to do what it takes to be discipline to attain heights unimaginable and places of respect as an authority.",

I hope that this service does not offer inventing stories with all other services, although I would not be surprised if there are such \"Authorities\" who are actually fictions but their books are sold only because they are well written or have a good cover.",

Every writer chooses the type of ideas he or she wants to put in the mind of the reader and as such it is pertinent that writers being regarded as Authority should do well to inspire positive influence in the lives of their readers through their writings as negative messages through books can go a long way in poisoning the minds of some readers that lack the wisdom to think for themselves. Like I have heard of a person that quit the idea of committing suicide due to the message pass to her from a book she read, now that's a positive influence of Authority from a writer.Every good writer must endeavor to be a transmitter of positive authority and not to just write a book because you feel like writing one.",

Influencers in the international political arena have characteristics that differ from those influencing the means of communication. The former influence important international decisions and control people's destinies, while the latter rely on their talents in comedy or persuasion to promote mainly commercial products and services. Both rely on different talents.",
