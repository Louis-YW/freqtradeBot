The successful of ICO actually depend on the project itself. I can't deny the fact that if these days so many icos were trying to create partnership with the various decentralized exchange site as a way to raise the funds. The ROI from the ico is also depend with the hype around it. Sometime a very strong ico will be fully backed by some big name in the crypto",

And what values ​​do you as an investor observe before acquiring a crypto asset before its launch?For me ICO is a very risky gamble. Yes I am investors to most ICO and I could say not all are profitable and some really are down from its price. In order to pick a good project, you must taken into account a lot of factors.For example, team members and partners. Some really like to check whether the VC are those commonly dump their projects. But if you see a logo of a good VC make sure they are really into that partnership cause you might got faked because its quite easy to put a name and used someone company for their own sake.",

How long will it last? When the huge token amount will be released on the market as it can cause a massive dump when investors cash out and take profit.When you check block explorer, you must pay attention on top wallets to see whether that token has a fair launch, fair distribution. Lastly, make sure you pay attention on top wallets to see whether tokens are locked in smart contracts or not. Being locked means there are vesting terms that are good for retail investors. It will reduce risk of scam exit from core team members of that project.",

But if you look at it bigger, failure is bigger than success, the level of compatibility with the ICO no longer gets great support, of course this will affect the ICO journey in the future",

If you see a great value for that and you think many trust the project then maybe you can also participate. In a bear market, I don’t usually invest on new projects because of the fear of losing everything since some investors are not focused on new projects, they also prefer the old projects because they usually survive the bear market.",

And what values ​​do you as an investor observe before acquiring a crypto asset before its launch?First of all i think the time of the traditional ICO's that we had in the years 2017 and 2018 are pretty much dead nowadays if i am not wrong. Back in the day most of those ICO's could be joined by anyone and most of the ICO's did not even have a hard cap back then which mean everyone could invest without limits. Like the Filecoin ICO that collected more than 250 Million $.Nowadays most of the projects are only doing small public rounds, which means that you either can only invest a very small amount if the project is very hyped and a lot of people want to invest or you need to join a lottery in order to be allowed to invest.You should always check the whitepaper, the roadmap, the team behind the project and also the tokenomics of a new project before you invest.",
