All of these are good. They are like doing your DCA investment now. Truly sometimes the fees for sending out coins whether Ethereum or btc can be very high and annoying. You could require almost $10 in btc to move out coins from your wallet agreed but the high fee rate is not because of bull season, as it is now that the fees are high yet it is not bull season. The reason I think may be because of traffic of transactions at the moment and it is only natural that highest bidders are attended to. To have a lower transaction fee, it is better to make transactions at off pick period like late at night.Quote from: Outhue on May 03, 2023, 07:46:36 AM.If you are here in 2018 you know what I am talking about, ETH is unforgiving in every bull market. Like I have mentioned that it is not only during bull season that it happens. During 2017/18, fees get high and low based on traffic but it is really annoying to be stocked because you have less fees in your wallet to send out coins.",

To invest in gas costs, many platforms are available, apart from the ETH network, there are several other reliable networks.The ETH network is known for its high gas fees, why bother buying ETH when there are other platforms that offer cheaper gas fees. I used to be no stranger to the ETH Network, after the arrival of Binance Smart Chain (BSC), I prefer to switch to the BNB network because it offers cheaper gas fees.",

If you remember, a year or two ago—I can't exactly specify how long ago it was—gas fees were extremely expensive, and there were an abundance of threads in regard to that matter. Personally, I always used the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and never paid any excessive fees when staking. However, I also saw a noticeable increase during the bull market for even simple transactions such as approving BUSD or USDT in order to add liquidity, not to mention the actual deposit and withdrawal fees for adding liquidity and removing liquidity.",

The OP isn't telling no lies but it won't be as high as you have illustrated on your post, let start with Bitcoin, the fees will definitely increase since there'll be congestion on the blockchain as more people return to the market to make use of the blockchain for their transactions (buying, selling etc) and as for Ethereum, they have been looking for solutions to their high gas fees problem which they have migrated to the proof of stake algorithm and with this move they'll be scarifying the little decentralization they had left for more scalability.This move will make Ethereum very centralized since Ethereum will now be controlled by big exchange like Binance that'll be having lots of staked Ethereum to their name since they're offering the service for their customers to earn staking reward. Ethereum also has lots of layer 2 projects that are been development which will reduce the workload on Ethereum blockchain and developers can build on these layer 2 protocols which will make the fees not to be as high as it was previously. Alot is been worked on as we are in the bear market and we mightn't have similar experience as last time. Bitcoin now also has segwit address that'll also contributes to lower fees.",

The gas fee increases if the network is congested; it is true that during a bull run, there will be multiple transactions on the ETH network; as a result, the fee will be high, but not as high as you exaggerated the fee to be; however, it is a good idea to plan for your gas fee. Quote I have bought 50$ of ETH today for transaction fees only. Not just buying now, but sending it to the right place where the transaction will take place, I mean the wallet; otherwise, the sending fee as at the bull run from exchange to wallet may take a very large percentage of the money; thus, for those of you who invested in some coins under the ERC-20 network, if you buy your ETH now, do well and send it to your wallet.Quote from: BitDane on May 03, 2023, 02:37:48 PMI also noticed that Bitcoin transaction fee also surge this past days.  The normal $0.5 gas fee became $5+ which is kinda heavy for small transaction.  I look on the reason why the transaction fee of Bitcoin surges and I found that it is caused by the spike of Ordinal adoption.  Now imagine if we are in bull run and Ordinal amass more transaction that will bloat the network.  It looks like the crises before (high transaction fee and unconfirmed transaction) will re-emerge due to the Ordinal inscription.  Check how Ordinals inscription affect the BTC transaction fee.This ordinal will be one of the major problem of Bitcoin in the future, specifically on the transaction fee if Bitcoin scalability don't upgrade. I've also noticed an increase in the Bitcoin transaction fee. The transaction that I used to process for 17-20 sat now costs 123-125 sat. I waited a while to see if the mempool would be less congested, but the transaction fee remained high. I was wondering what was causing this until you provided such information.I hope a proper solution is found before the bull run.",

I still remember the crazy gas fee of the Ethereum network, which you are referring to, but I think it will not be so much in the coming bull market because they have solved that issue of the crazy gas fee. Even in 2021, when a friend of mine traded an ETH-based token that was worth about $280, he spent almost $100+ for gas fee, but that has been solved, and this time it will not be so high. The current fee charged on the Bitcoin transaction I am sending this day is just about $1.3 or even less, so even during the bear market, that transaction will be more stuffed or congested , but the fee cannot still go so crazy. At least $5, $10, or less will not really be much for some people to spend unless those sending small amounts can still modify their transaction fee (to small fee) and wait for any time their transaction gets confirmed.",

But in my personal opinion, no matter how big the transaction fees are in crypto, these fees don't eat up all the assets you have. In fact, I think that the transaction fees involved in buying and selling crypto are still cheap and not too expensive even during a bull market. So I don't want to worry about transaction fees in crypto, because basically all transaction fees in crypto must have been adjusted very well.But I also don't think that those who talk about or object to the high transaction fees during a bull market in crypto are wrong. Because it is certain that investors in crypto do not all have very many assets, there must also be those who have few assets. So for crypto investors who have few assets, they will definitely object when transaction costs in crypto become expensive, because for novice crypto investors or those who don't have many assets, when making transactions and the fees are quite expensive, they will definitely feel quite disadvantageous.",
