Even the most primitive ASIC sha256 chips from say late 2013 delivered speeds in excess of 1GHs when pushed hard and over 500MHs when throttled back. Even a very high-end PC with 24 or more cores cannot match those early generation mining chips.

Ja, it is always nice to know it or at least have a decent understanding of it but overall aside from some very specialized purposes not helpful to know.Point is that any real world application of sha256 blockchain technology is going to use ASIC's - not any mid to high level interpreted CPU code like C, .NET, Py, etc running on CPU's. Even the most modest applications would at least use FPGA's or even GPU's vs CPU's. The fact that Intel jumped into the fray with their open-to-all-comers mining ASIC proves that.Now, if you want to explore how to talk to an ASIC mining chip might I suggest you checkout Kano's cgminer git and pickup a low cost USB stick like any of Sidehack's to run the software on? Compiling instructions are here.Being fully open source you can not only see and tinker with how the software that interfaces between the BTC network and a miner operates but also investigate the code used as drivers that interface between software and the actual ASIC chips. The driver library also includes one for FPGA's as well as a variety of ASIC's.  That is the side of your learning that has useful career possibilities.Edited for typo's",

I understood your idea. You want change original block header a little bit and make it possibly be a best block header in order to hash this header data to contain a nonce to resolve a block. 1. But, the problem is there is no criteira (or no better way) to select a best block header data from the original block header. At the moment, in the state of art, an original block header has created bllions of local header data to be used, then, asic miners do hashing on billions of these local block header data. Now, bitcoin network has 200+ EH/s, which means 200 plus E block header data are hashed in per seconds. So, a PC can't fight with these ASIC machines. A very fast PC only can hash a header data in 10 minutes and find 0, 1 to 3 nonces as I experienced.2. But, you can use your small ASIC machine and try your optimalized block header data to do hashing in a cost saving way against those big miners. The key issues  are:(1). to find a  or few common or univerrse nonces, which is a broken hole in sha256 algorithm, or hashing collision aspect. (2). to find a way to reduce search space (sha256 hash function has a huge space) or focus on a sub space for your search the nonce from few of header data, which is common optimalization method (task) in computing optimaliztion algorithms.(3). in computer science, there are a lot of optimalization algorithms. 3. You can google \"cpuminer\" to find old cpuminer software in github. eg. cpuminer pooler. too many there. Then, do your development of them. Good luck.",
