  "content": "If you use KeePass, remember to upgrade it to version 2.54 as soon as it becomes available, this vulnerability affects KeePass 2.x (users of KeePass/Strongbox/KeePass 1.x are unaffected). QuoteIn KeePass 2.x before 2.54, it is possible to recover the clear text master password from a memory dump, even when a workspace is locked or no longer running. The memory dump can be a KeePass process dump, swap file (pagefile.sys), hibernation file (hiberfil.sys), or RAM dump of the entire system. The first character cannot be recovered. In 2.54, there is different API usage and/or random string insertion for mitigation. Source: CVEThread where this vulnerability was exposed: SourceforgeThis is PSA thread. I don't understand technical jargon mentioned in above sites  ___Edit: KeePass 2.54 released: Download",

That righ OP, There was a vulnerability in KeyPass versions 2.x prior to 2.54, which could compromise the security of the user's master password and it is imperative that KeyPass users upgrade to version 2.54 as soon as it is available to ensure the safety of their sensitive data.",

      "body": "I don't think it's a good idea to use a software or password manager with a vulnerability issue just like before when someone's password was compromised. All of his coins were withdrawn and he also used a password manager. So it's not safe to use any password manager if you want to use a password manager then only use it if there is no money involved on that site. Sample Twitter account and Facebook I use password manager from Chrome only for social media accounts and sites that have no money involved. So upgrading to the latest version wouldn't help to save your compromised password it would be better to use a piece of paper to write all of your passwords and put it in your wallet(That's the offline way and safer than password manager/PC that still connected to the internet).",

Although I don’t recommend saving passwords online not just because of the vulnerability to attacks but also this makes one to rely on them total and can cause one to forget the password total. But when it comes to password managers I think KeePassXC is one of the highly recommended ones by the forum community. It is open source and the seeds or passwords generated can be stored on encrypted form where only you can access it.",

      "body": "Important thing to mention, from the SourceForge discussion:QuoteAn attacker needs read access to your filesystem or your RAM. Realistically, if your computer is infected by malware that's running in the background, this doesn't make it much worse - for that you could already be attacked by e.g. KeeFarce etc. (and there's no protection against that without specialized HW).Unless you expect to be specifically targeted by someone sophisticated, I would keep calm. The issue here could be, say, someone stealing your computer and taking the HDD out. It's not eniterely unrealistic, after all that's what the police will try to do in a raid. You can find several companies developing special forensic software for these kinds of scenarios. But it's really not what most people should panic about. If you use full disk encryption with a strong password, it gets even more unlikely.This finding alone doesn't allow anyone to steal your passwords remotely over the internet.So not as troublesome as it sounds (still a big problem, of course).",

      "body": "It is a kind of physical attack or RAM access, but it is unfortunate to see what happened with an open source program. It is better to keep the passwords encrypted in a password manager, so even if the hackers gain access to the hemorrhoid management program, they still need to access the private key from For decryption, which you can keep in an offline environment.Thanks for the warning and it is better not to trust the default in open source software.",

The other features that I'm currently working on (which are also related to security and which I don't want to postpone) are almost finished; a realistic estimate for the KeePass 2.54 release probably is \"in the beginning of June\" (i.e. 2-3 weeks), but I cannot guarantee that.Best regards,DominikBut if anyone is worried, there is a development snapshot with corrections: https://keepass.info/filepool/KeePass_230507.zipOf course, you should verify the link through the developer's own comment on SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/f3438e6283/?limit=25#0829FYI: It's KeePass, not KeyPass.",
