My guess is that they think you've provided a false or fake identification. They probably didn't need to conduct any KYC verification but still went on as a matter of procedure.",

That is, of course, is a possibility. Do you have brothers, sisters, parents or relatives who live with you who might be into gambling as well? Are you sharing the same internet access with another household, or is anyone in your neighborhood accessing your home network through WIFI? Maybe you are accessing someone else's network on your end.Have you ever accessed your Rollbit account from outside of your home? An internet café, a friend's house, a public network somewhere, etc.?",

To scam 1000 people out of 1 USD is way more easy then to scam 1 Person out of 1000 USD. In any case this is just an example and I am sure that rollbit will resolve the matter since they are a trustworthy casino in my opinion.

Does it make sense if they were scammers? [...] What I don't understand is why you are not supposed to have multiple accounts.It's a common rule on most casino with an understandable reason behind it. One that can be easily think of is that multi acc means they can cheat on whatever bonus the casino --I'm talking about casinos in general-- gave, like faucet, rain, first time deposit bonus, free bets, etc. Another thing is the possibility of distributing a huge amount of balance acquired through cheating or abusing the system into several acounts with smaller withdrawal amount to avoid suspicion.A one time withdrawal of 10,000 USD might raise the casino's attention and prompt them to look into your account. Split them into five or ten accounts, and then withdraw 500 USD at a time, and you can take them all without even going into their radar.",

Another thing you can do with multiple accounts is try to abuse betting limits. If the casino has a max bet of let's say $500 for a particular game/league, that's the maximum amount of money you are supposed to wager there. There is a reason they placed those restrictions. Abusers could try to cheat the system and create more accounts to bet above those limits. Some sportsbooks, for example, offer bet boosters (the names of the platforms aren't important). These boosts are limited to 1-2 sports events per day. You can easily get more than you should by using multiple accounts.",

I only have one account here.Why the need of ID verification if they knew that this user is involved on multiple account violation. When OP provide different ID, they still insist a multi account accusation despite there ID is obviously different since the support is still using the IP connection and not the similarity on KYC documents as reason for OP lying. Even if the OP provides same ID to other account or not the decision is still the same though. You probably the real owner of the other permanent ban account if you are not using VPN in your defense. You are just admitting to the crime since no one can access rollbit website using same IP to you except to person who’s connected to your internet. Permaban account means you’ve done something wrong so I’m sure rollbit will not gonna let you withdraw if you are connected on account like this.",
