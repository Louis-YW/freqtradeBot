  "content": "I would like to inform about purchasing on a KYC exchange.My friend will buy $700 worth of Bitcoin on his account at NEXO/Binance, and he will send what he buys to MY hardware wallet Trezor.He will have tax obligations and unnecessarily worries about how I will handle those specific sats he sends me?And I am completely unconcerned because it doesn't matter to me where those sats come from? For me, it's the same situation as if I bought them peer to peer on the street for cash?What does it mean for me?What does it mean for my friend?Edited: Thank you for answers, now I know its better to not complicate it and taking from friend cash and then buy P2P…Moderator can lock/delete post",

But it's probably better if he returns cash to me, and I buy peer-to-peer for cash in the traditional way. Because I don't want him to incur tax obligations after I sell those sats in the future.",

Because I don't want him to incur tax obligations after I sell those sats in the future.I see.This will depend on tax laws in your country, if gift worth of $700 is taxed, your friend need to bear the tax. As long as your friend declare that he give that $700 in Bitcoin as a gift, he don't have to worry.But yeah returns cash is more private and convenient.",

Now you want him to give you the $700 cash so that you can buy through physical P2P because you want him to avoid tax. It will depend on the tax and crypto laws of your country if the move is legal or illegal. However, it is commendable to look for means to avoid taxes as much as you are not breaking any law. You can save a good amount by avoiding taxes.  If your your friend can give you cash and you have a genuine means of buying Bitcoin you can just avoid these exchanges. Buying through traditional P2P means also promotes privacy since there will be no KYC. The bottom line of your situation is that both you and your friend will avoid taxes and save money.",

      "body": "So he is giving you that money? Then he has no tax obligations and you do have tax obligations. Once the money is yours it is yours! You inherit the cost basis from his buy ($700), and when you sell it you pay taxes (sale proceeds minus cost basis from his buy) assuming you sell it for profit.So it is the opposite of what you think. He will have no tax obligations, you have the tax obligations.That is how things normally work when it comes to taxes. For example if you are in the US or many other countries. But if you are in some country with bizarre tax rules it could be different I suppose. But the normal way govts implement taxes, you will have the tax responsibility, not him.",

I don't seem to see anything about submitting KYC to an exchange as long as it's like Binance or some other platform, in my opinion. Then, if you received what he sent worth of satoshi in your wallet in Trezor, what are you worried about?Are you the one submitting the KYC or the one sending it? I'm just not sure if it's the right understanding that I'm saying in your post that this op ah, please correct me if it's wrong.",

Since the obligations and regulations of the countries differs,is it also advisable to partake in the investment process and make financial recommendations as well.Does he really need to comply to the standards,rules and regulations.Maybe its necessary just so they can monitor suspicious and illegal activities.",
