Do you think Elon Musk is safe?Safe? From what? What are you talking about?Also you do know that speaking about this is politics, it's just a matter how professional are you going to be about it. So if you are going to take talking about this seriously and get voted in, does that mean you are selfish, manipulative and corrupt then or were you already that before? On what stage it becomes somehow more devious?",

We might need to worry about the sanity of people who still support him or think he's a genius of some sort but OTOH that's their business.As for Hunter's laptop, the story was in NY Post and none of Post people got murdered because of that (as far as I know) so I can't see why Elon would now be unsafe publishing some info years later.",

Do you think Elon Musk is safe?Elon Musk is a businessman that wants to make more money. His business is not a charitable organization forget about his kind gestures towards Ukraine. He has promised to clean up Twitter and make it a free social media platform that promotes truth and equity. Musk would not achieve this lofty goal because politics and economy are inseparable. Very soon he would have sympathy for either the Democrat or the Republican which would make him begin to favor his preferred party. It won't take much time global political forces would begin to plan how to manipulate him using diverse political tools such as the carrot (contracts) or stick (sanctions). The only thing that would save Musk from compromising is if he decides not to have more money.",

He was quickly hired as Deputy General Counsel of Twitter by then-CEO Jack Dorsey. In the subsequent months, Baker would once again play a role in protecting the deep state, and after being outed by an internal investigation last week, Musk has now fired him.According to Conservative Brief:Twitter CEO Elon Musk revealed on Tuesday that Twitter’s former Deputy General Counsel James Baker was “exited” from the company after revelations about his alleged role in the platform’s handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story.Over the weekend, journalist Matt Taibbi published internal communications from Twitter’s top brass in October 2020 about how to combat the New York Post’s publication of materials about Hunter Biden’s laptop.“In light of concerns about Baker’s possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue, he was exited from Twitter today,” Musk tweeted in response to Taibbi, who shared a story about Baker and his various corrupt roles in government by famed legal scholar Jonathan Turley....",

But, they are trying to carefully do something.Censors set their sights on Musk’s Twitter takeoverQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-12-15-censors-set-sights-on-musks-twitter-takeover.htmlCommentary? – Not long after Elon Musk acquired Twitter with his promise of ending its censorship regime, a reporter from Reuters covering a White House press conference asked Karine Jean-Pierre, President Joe Biden’s press secretary, whether Twitter might become a “vector of misinformation.” Jean-Pierre’s response at the Nov. 28 press conference was:(Article by Charlotte Allen republished from TheEpochTimes.com)“This is something that we’re certainly keeping an eye on. Look, we have always been very clear that when it comes to social media platforms, it is their responsibility to make sure that when it comes to misinformation, when it comes to the hate that we’re seeing, that they take action, that they continue to take action. … We’re all monitoring what’s currently occurring.”That sounded pretty chilling. The idea that the government could be “monitoring” any part of any media for “misinformation” and “hate” speech—both of which are protected by the First Amendment unless they stray into defamation or incitement to imminent crime—ought to raise the hackles of anyone who cares about the Bill of Rights. And why, in particular, should social-media platforms have any legal obligation to “take action” against speech that might offend some people but is neither criminal nor libelous?But in fact, that is exactly what the nation’s two wokest states, New York and California, have already decided that social media platforms, a category that can include everything from Facebook to chatrooms and traditional journalism blogs with comments, must henceforth do.Brighteon.TVThe New York law came first, in June, and it went into effect on Dec. 3. Realizing that free speech enjoys constitutional protection, New York’s legislators decided to outlaw only what they cagily called “hateful conduct.” But “hateful conduct,” as defined in the New York law, means “the use of a social media network to vilify, humiliate, or incite violence against a group or a class of persons on the basis of race, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.” Vilify? Humiliate? That sounds pretty much like … constitutionally protected speech....",

Or are stolen election revelations really making Musk some new enemies?Twitter Files prove FBI lied to Big Tech to steal electionsQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-12-16-twitter-files-fbi-lied-tech-steal-elections.htmlA whole lot is coming to light via the Twitter Files, including mountains of evidence implicating the social media platform for things like censorship, blacklisting, and child pornography. You can also add election meddling by the FBI to that list, according to the latest drops.We now know that the FBI interfered with the 2020 election by lying to tech giants about the Hunter Biden laptop scandal. Not only Twitter but also Facebook and many others were on the receiving end of these FBI lies. (Related: The Department of Homeland Security [DHS] also colluded with Twitter and Facebook to silence free speech.)Hunter’s laptop came to the forefront of the news cycle on Oct. 14, 2020, when the New York Post published an article about it called “Smoking-Gun Email Reveals How Hunter Biden Introduced Ukrainian Businessman to VP Dad.” As its title implies, those emails proved that Hunter and his criminal father Joe were engaged in deep state treason.Emails, text messages, and video footage recovered from the hard drive of Hunter’s laptop fully indict the fake president’s son, as well as the fake president himself. And yet the FBI influenced Twitter and other social media platforms to censor it as “fake news.”Using its “hacked materials” policy as an excuse, Twitter systematically banned the Post story from being shared. It even suspended the official account for the Post as punishment.Jim Baker, Twitter’s then-Deputy General Counsel, along with Yoel Roth, Twitter’s then-head of “Trust and Safety,” both agreed that the Post article needed to be censored. Roth acknowledge that the situation was “emerging,” but said “the facts remain unclear” – and that was that.Baker agreed that “we need more facts to assess whether the materials were hacked,” adding that “it is reasonable for us to assume they may have been and that caution is warranted.”...",
