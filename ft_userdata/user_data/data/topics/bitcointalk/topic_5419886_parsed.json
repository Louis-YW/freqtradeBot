  "content": "For those who don't know the merch by amazon program - It's a place where t-shirt designers can upload their work and let amazon sell it to their traffic with prime services applied.The account can make u thousands of dollars monthly if you are active and can afford to hire a team maybe.I've made 7000$ from it so far and it's a great passive income. I haven't uploaded new designs in a long time and I'm still making money from it.The account is at tier 2000 but if you can upload new designs they will promote it to 4000 because I've surpassed the required threshhold for a promotion.I've had an offer of 3000$ for it so far.",
