  "content": "I recently saw that Edward Snowden publicly called for Bitcoin to implement privacy features. Source: https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1786170805728039127In a recent thread here many senior bitcointalk members actually agreed to this sentiment. We've all come to know bitcoin as a blockchain where inputs and outputs, all of them, are displayed on the public ledger for everyone to go through. Transactions are pseudonymous but nevertheless traceable. While it's not necessary that a transaction has to be connected to a person, actions of governments against privacy tools and no-KYC services make it very hard to conduct bitcoin transactions without having them attached to your real life identity. Many would view this as an attack to the freedoms bitcoin has been associated to. But it's also understandable if some bitcoin users are against such a radical change to the protocol. So I'm making this poll thread to start a debate. Feel free to vote and respond with your thoughts.",

I don't really know much about the technical aspect of Bitcoin from the layman's view privacy feature has both advantages and disadvantages. One of the beauties of Bitcoin transactions is that in the public domain where anybody can access them. This makes the transaction transparent and easy to trace. Making the transactions private will cause people to lose the benefit of tracing transactions. Anyone who desires extra privacy can use other tools.  However, the attack on privacy services would have assisted interested Bitcoiners to remain anonymous is making this difficult.Having a privacy feature in Bitcoin will increase government attacks on the sector. It will increase the claim that Bitcoin is used for criminal activities. It could lead to a ban on Bitcoin in some locations like the US. Bitcoin is been integrated into the financial system of the US because the country has developed robust policies and strategies to regulate the industry. The way they are attacking privacy services is the same way they will attack BItcoin if it becomes fully anonymous. Nevertheless, I support the implementation of privacy features in Bitcoin but I am scared that it will attract more enemies to the sector.",

I highly agree, and when the government starts to attack the Bitcoin protocol itself, most people will get discouraged to use them for transaction.   I think it is a no brainer to know that ordinary people don't want any hustle on their transaction, so if Bitcoin implement the privacy features, it is more likely get the government attention and might possibly forbid the use of the Bitcoin network.  This will automatically kill Bitcoin's target of mass adoption",

However, it's certain that such actions would trigger regulations that many exchanges and investors may struggle to comply with. Governments typically oppose privacy measures, as they seek visibility into transactions. From my observations, it shows that some Bitcoin enthusiasts are prepared to endorse this idea and await the backlash action of the government. Even if implementing the privacy protocol leads to its declaration as illegal, I see no fault in using it  . Illegality is not a new concept and has been practiced in almost every part of the world",

      "body": "I miss an \"optional\" button in the poll, maybe even something like \"off-chain\"/\"sidechain\".Because I would be very likely against implementing a mandatory privacy feature like Monero or Grin have, for the simple reason it would make Bitcoin less scalable, and it would also need a hard fork which would basically re-start the transaction graph. And I think that an optional privacy feature would lead to an anonymity set large enough - because it's Bitcoin and not some random altcoin.About the tools I would like to see implemented: mainly my bet would be for better support for sidechains, because in this case sidechains can go fully private. Imagine a Monero-style sidechain with a token 2-way-pegged to Bitcoin. I think however that could bring some additional challenges, because of the need of sidechain users to monitor \"unruly\" coin creation. But anyway that would affect only sidechain users, not the mainchain users.In general I would approve the Litecoin model with MWEB too, but I think extension blocks will unfortunately not make it into Bitcoin.Quote from: ChiBitCTy on May 10, 2024, 07:10:37 PMIf it were anonymous, governments would shut down the exchanges within their borders, putting a massive clamp down on it's potential and future upside.This would be ineffective for governments if the goal is to combat crime, because you could buy Bitcoin still via atomic swaps with Ethereum for example or any non-privacy altcoin. And atomic swaps cannot be banned nor prevented in any way - see also this thread. Yes, the ETFs would be probably gone in most countries.Monero actually increased its usage even after it was delisted at Binance, as you can see in the last stretch of this graph (ignore the spikes, these were spam attacks probably):Source: BitinfochartsIt's price is also slowly recovering, compared with Bitcoin, even taking into account some more recent news (e.g. Kraken delistings in several European countries).But see what I wrote above. I also think it's 99,9999999 unlikely that we will see \"mandatory privacy\" on Bitcoin. But better support of optional privacy would be cool. Taproot was already an improvement on that.",

But the reason I didn't specify is because Mr. Snowden said protocol level, so layer two solutions are ruled out. As of \"optional\"... Aren't privacy transactions on Monero also optional? Why would anyone use them though? Notorious markets pick monero specifically for its privacy. So if this feature was enabled on bitcoin, even optionally, all of that kind of usage would naturally be attracted to the bigger network. So if by enabling such feature on the bitcoin blockchain a sizable part of the user base starts using it, all the disadvantages it could bring will come really fast optional or not.",

Aren't privacy transactions on Monero also optional?I'm not a Monero expert but AFAIK on Monero you can't simply create a transaction only with your own inputs/outputs, you have always use the ring signature feature and mix it with other inputs/outputs, which would be equivalent to use only CoinJoins in Bitcoin. A thing which is optional are stealth addresses, you can use a single \"primary\" address if for some reasons you need someone to see e.g. the income on one address.Quote from: alani123 on May 11, 2024, 12:07:59 AMNotorious markets pick monero specifically for its privacy.

So if by enabling such feature on the bitcoin blockchain a sizable part of the user base starts using it, all the disadvantages it could bring will come really fast optional or not. I interpret that you are also afraid of legal/regulatory action of many governments against Bitcoin itself? IMO Lightning already provides a privacy level similar to Monero. So we can observe if there are LN-specific regulations to come, or if Litecoin is affected in any way due to its MWEB feature. Generally however I don't think it would be easy to ban Bitcoin privacy (e.g. certain kinds of transactions, like LN, CoinJoins or atomic swaps) without outright banning Bitcoin usage, and Bitcoin usage could be protected by law in many countries (basically it's signed messages, so it's free speech).If you're more afraid of criminals, I believe most criminals operate already with BTC and not XMR, and use XMR only as a mixer.",
