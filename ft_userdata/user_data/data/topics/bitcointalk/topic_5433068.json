They might be able to offer some things such as stability in mining power but they feel a lot more like they're profiting from a lack of competition in the sector. A lot of centralised companies nowadays look more like they're into profits and exploitation over the original more hobbyistic values that were once employed (it'd seem to me a lot of the hobbyists quietly sold up and left too).",

I reckon there is some truth to what Su Zhu has tweeted. He might be a corrupted gambler, however, he might not be lying about this. But he might have an agenda in exposing the truth hehehe.In any case, on stETH/ETH depegging, @lookonchain has this analysis onchain that shows that Su Zhu might be telling the truth.https://mobile.twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1610177926145900545",

Without that scandal, the price of BTC would certainly be much higher than it is now and would not go below the 2017 ATH. In that case, all these companies you mention (and many others) would be in a much better position, and now they are in a rather unenviable situation that somewhat resembles a dried-up lake with only a little water in which every fish is trying to survive until the next rain - unfortunately only few will survive.",

It would have been very easy not to have come across the topic if you were not very active in the forum during that time. I admit, I too was just learning, and I actually thought Bitcoin Unlimited \"might be a good upgrade\" for Bitcoin.But, after going through all of it, it was probably all just hand-waving, and trying to convince the community to join them in forking Bitcoin away from the rightful stewards of the Bitcoin network, the Core Developers. Gavin Andresen wanted his \"block size increase\" with Mike Hearn, Roger Ver had his own with Jihan Wu, and Barry Silbert organized the \"New York Agreement\". All of them had one thing in common = Core Developers excluded.QuoteTHE NEW YORK AGREEMENTMeanwhile, the block size debate raged on. Another software client to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit per hard fork, Bitcoin Unlimited gained traction among Bitcoin’s mining community. Endorsed by Bitmain’s Wu in particular, the project appeared to be heading toward a potential (and controversial) hard fork.This looming threat, and the possibility of a “split” in Bitcoin’s blockchain, was reason for DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert to organize a meeting ahead of the Consensus 2017 conference in New York. Initially announced on a private email list for Bitcoin entrepreneurs and other prominent industry members, the meeting would bring together a significant chunk of the Bitcoin industry, including miners — though, notably, no Bitcoin Core contributors.https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-long-road-to-segwit-how-bitcoins-biggest-protocol-upgrade-became-reality",

According to Cameron Winklevoss there were public lies, private lies and accounting fraud on the side of Barry Silbert.However, it appears that Barry is winning hehe. Winklevoss twins appear to have a case on Barry but do they want to take this to court? They might not want to do this because it might implicate themselves.
