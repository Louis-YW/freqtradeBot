You can report the user to the manager, but I don't think it will change the user's behavior completely even if he is removed from the campaign. This case is only about one user - but there are many other users who behaved the same way and not all of them have a signature on their profile. I tend to report posts like that to moderators rather than managers - but you can contribute in your own way.",

This is where if I have something to add to the table, I do that, and if I have nothing to say, I just work away.Â In a thread of 1â€“10 pages, only a few members will have the time and energy to read through them all. That's just the simple truth. Unless the thread is really something of interest and there is simple information the person is looking for in it, it's not as if it's the best thing to do, but people just find it too lazy to do that as they want to focus their attention on other things.

But when we see that in the new topic the first page of posts is entirely of totally the same answers on the first post without anything new comparing with the first or the second answer post, it kills all the discussion.It is so demotivating when you read main point of a discussion, read a couple of last pages (of 5-7-15-20-...) to know what in the direction of a discussion at the moment, come into it with your idea and then see many answers of the first post of the topic, that are totally ignoring all the discourse was before them. It kills a discussion in those topics. No sense in answering if nobody will ever answer you, if a significant part of the participants in a topic will answer only the first post again and again. Answering the first post on a third page has sense very very rare and nearly never it has any sense on the 4th page or further. And it never has any sense even on the first page if your answer is duplicating several the same before yours.",

You can agree with others and give some additional info or view, or you can disagree and say something in oppose, or you can side one point against others. But you are communicating with others in the topic, not only answering to the OP.Simply answering to OP is a blog format: there is one blog author and others talk mainly to him. Forum discussion is different: all with all. If you open some topic and all answers in there are answers to a first post then of course no one is interested in reading all that similar answers without any additional info. It is boring and pointless. And if there was a discussion with some new ideas or separate points of view it could be totally different. So similar pointless answers kill any discussion and so make pointless reading topics and entering discussion. Self multiplicating problem.
