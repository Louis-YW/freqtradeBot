  "content": "Hi all,While I am not new to BTC wallets, I am new to Electrum. I decided to start learning / using Electrum as the one of the few open source solutions not relying on any company that might fail or change it's behavior in the future. Verified the files (using GPG) prior to installing, used Testnet for practicing, and when I was getting ready to really start using it with Main net, I saw a pop up on my mac asking whether I wanted to grant permissions to Electrum for screen recording (allowing the application to record the content of my screen and audio even when NOT using the app, see screenshot below). Is this something that should be expected? If yes, what is the use case for that??https://i.imgur.com/k1Wy3Ip.png",

I'd disable it though if you can (or leave it turned off) I doubt it's necessary, there's also the chance it's accidental or it's come from something else as the android one doesn't ask for that and the Windows version I have also didn't ask for microphone access.",

      "body": "As Husna QA pointed out, if you are not planning on using the QR scanning features of Electrum, you can just disable that permission. It's not going to affect your ability to send/receive bitcoin or use Electrum's coin control features. If you ever come to a point where you need to scan a QR code, try to remember that the permissions for that action need to be enabled first because it's not going to work. Your OS or the client might display an error message though, which will lead you to understand that a permission needs to be enabled in order to proceed.",
