  "content": "My curiosity drove me to research and create this topic. Covid -19 saw the proliferation of online casinos and the statistics of have been increasing by the day. Today, my intention is to with you some interesting facts about online casinos. Some you may know while others you may not know. I hope you learn a thing or two.FACT 1: The First Online Casino Hit the Web in 1994 It’s hard to believe that online casino gaming has been around for more than 25 years, but that is in fact the case. Developed by Microgaming, a company undoubtedly ahead of its time, the first online casino popped up just about 100 years exactly after the first slot machines started making their way onto the casino floor.FACT 2: At any time, 1 in 10 internet users is gambling.11% of internet activity worldwide is made up of gamblers using online casinos.FACT 3: Roulette is “the devil’s game.”Roulette is sometimes called “the devil’s game” because the total of all the numbers on the wheel is 666 hence it is often associated with the devil’s supposed number.FACT 4: In some places, citizens can ONLY gamble online.There’s at least one place in the world where residents are banned from gambling in person, but they can still get their kicks online. That place? Monaco. Yes, Monaco with the glamorous, world famous casinos that feature in James Bond movies. It seems only tourists and superspies get to step inside that elegant world.FACT 5: Online gambling and gender Online casino gamblers are predominantly male. It is considered that about 11% of those people who access the Internet actively use gambling websites. Annual statistics say that over 80% of the people in the online casinos are going to be male. Of course, this does incorporate all forms of Internet gambling, so betting is also included. Another interesting fact is that gamblers tend to be over the age of 30 years, and this serves them well because gambling problems are predominantly in the younger male gambler who is 7.5 times more likely to become addicted and have a financial crisis than their female counterparts.I must add that this is dependent on the location. For example this research suggest that more than half of all active Swedish players are womenFACT 6: 90% of slots players opt for online casino gaming than at land-based casinosOnly 10% of punters choose to play slots at a land based casino while 90% of the players choose online casinos. This means that it is more interesting to play games online.FACT 7: You can tip the dealer in online live casino games Just like in land based casinos, some operators like Evolution gaming provide the player to tip the live dealer in appreciation for good service in case they wish to do so.FACT 8: Most Popular GameNot only are slots almost exclusively played online these days, but they are also the most popular game. Perhaps the rules of table games such as roulette and craps are too hard to get the hang of or maybe people just like the mindless fun after a long day in the office. But whatever the reason slots are by far and away the most popular games to play.What other interesting facts about online casinos do you know?https://www.gamblingsites.org/blog/10-interesting-facts-about-online-casino-gambling/https://www.thephonecasino.com/blogs/online-casino-facts.htmlhttps://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/en/NewsDetail/index/12/19226/18-Fun-Facts-About-Online-Casino--https://www.gambling.com/country-overviews/monacohttps://1883magazine.com/top-10-interesting-facts-about-online-casinos/https://baronmag.ca/2022/06/7-fun-facts-about-online-casinos-you-should-know-about/www.translationroyale.com/how-are-women-changing-the-online-gambling-industry",

I would've tipped a few dealers if the feature was more visible or maybe it's only limited to a few tables or casinos.The last one was obvious but it's still an interesting one knowing it has a high house edge you would've expected fewer people to play the game but it still remains popular as more providers make different variations of slots.",

I can't even imagine myself going to land casino to play slots... moving from slot to slot after minutes of playing, maybe waiting for someone else to stand up from my favorite slot. Playing slots online is a lot better experience, big screen and a big (huge) choice of providers, each with many attractive slots and other live games.",

Because online slot games display very entertaining visuals and audio, they can also provide big profits.and what makes slots continue to be popular and also top because it is very easy to play even children and parents can play it because it is very easy, and with a way of playing that is easy to understand, with limited capital it is often the player's choice.",

      "body": "\"90% of slots players opt for online casino gaming than at land-based casinos\" .... I think the reason for this is the house edge. The Brick n Mortar casinos have a lot more expenses to pay to operate a Brick n mortar casino, so their house edge or RTP (return to player) sucks... compared to online casinos. So you might get the \"feeling\" that you are gambling longer with the same money that you spend on a casino. There are also a much larger variety of Slots online, compared to the amount of Slots that you get in some of these casinos. (Slots are also accessible 24/7 ...and you do not have to wait for someone to stop playing, before you can play that slot)",

I sometimes play crash after a long day at the office, but I can also play it while in the office. Actually, I like to bet more on sports events, but I also play slot games. Also, I didn't know that online casinos have been a part of our lives for almost 30 years. This information is also very interesting.",

      "body": "First online casino didn't really 'hit the web' in 1994. They completed it in 1994 but most of the tools and other end-user stuff didn't really launch until 1995. And even then, the experience isn't really that great, but it's something that propelled us closer to what online casinos are right now since people got the idea and they just developed things even further from there. Also for the slot games, that is something I didn't know first. All I know is that there are tons of possible bet combinations, but never knew it reached up to 666. And it's more fun online because of RTP. Online casinos are quite generous on that part compared to land-based casinos.",

You need a passport if you want to enter a casino in Monaco - other forms of identity document like drivers licenses are not accepted and you'll get turned away. I imagine that Monaco residents are either super rich and hold dual citizenship if they wanted to skirt that entry rule, or they can simply pop over the border into Spain or Italy to find that bit of excitement. I find it fascinating that so many people are drawn to online slot games because they are so clearly rigged to favor the house. I guess they are the most popular because most elements are controlled by the casino and they don't have potential third party issues like collusion and other forms of cheating to handle.",

The facts presented may have some deviations to reality but these will give us idea about online casinos.But we can definitely say that the online gambling population is increasing day by day, just look at the online casinos that are being launched everyday.",
