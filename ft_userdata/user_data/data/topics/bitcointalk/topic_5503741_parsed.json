But the internet is like water in our world, without water the world will perish and if the internet is lost the world will stop developing and return to the stone age. So this scenario will never happen so you don't need to worry and think too much about this issue. I can't think of any scenario in which the Internet could disappear from the world, even World War III wouldn't make it disappear. Unless we encounter the destruction of the earth like the time of the dinosaurs.",

Bitcoin remains to be existent even if there will be a shutdown of internet. Its operations, transactions and confirmations will be stopped if the entire world will have no internet at all. But with all the modern technologies that we have, it's interesting to read if there are good people working on this technology just to be prepared when the unexpected has come to the world as it won't only cover Bitcoin but also the companies that are solely reliant to internet for its daily operations.",

Banks cannot process your withdrawals and as such even to get physical cash from the bank will be impossible except for those who hoard or stach fiat cash at home. Even places like hospitals will be in trouble since some machines works with internet connections there too. So bitcoin will be the least of all worries if the internet collapses except for someone who has its funds all in bitcoin Quote from: Obari on July 22, 2024, 08:00:32 AMMy question was born out of curiosity and I’m not actually inclined on the technicalities of bitcoin and I just want to know the fate of bitcoin if there was no internet for maybe 24 hours If it is slightly for 24 hours some people will panic and when it comes up again I believe there will be FUDs spread about it and could lead to some investors taking some coins off and turning them to cash. On bitcoin network all transactions will just stop and continue later once it gets back. Since it is a total universal shutdown nothing will change in the network, if it is Some part that experiences that then after they have internet back they can just synchronize or update their servers back.",

That's why I don't think having an internet shutdown will be allowed to happen, most especially nowadays that everything relies greatly on the internet, particularly our own communication with those people we want to have connections with.",

If it was a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack or a hack then the infrastructure would be intact and eventually the internet could be restored.

Transactions will not go through, panic will ensue, the rest of us who kept our coins on air-locked computers will be good but with the prospect of never seeing nor being able to access the internet again, from let's say, a solar radiation that would disrupt technology as it stands today, the whole cryptocurrency world, as well as the whole planet is going to miserably suffer. Bitcoin may not be pegged to any currency right now but it relies heavily on the internet. It's the medium at which it travels. Take the internet out of the equation and bitcoin wouldn't work. A small disruption or outrage wouldn't cause much problems, cryptocurrencies are made to be resilient to such after all. But prolonged outages? That's another story.",
