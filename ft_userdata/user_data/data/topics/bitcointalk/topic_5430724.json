If I am not mistaken, this is the first local board added since 2017 which makes it even bigger accomplishment.As I've kept saying for some time now, if you keep your local topic active and clean of spam, sooner or later you will get what your own local board, and finally that day has come. I have no doubts that your activity will Â increase even more now, as it will be much easier to have quality discussions now when everything won't be cramped up in one thread.",
