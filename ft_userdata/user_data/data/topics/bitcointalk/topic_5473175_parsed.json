It's just that after registering and starting to log in, I experienced a problem saying that my account was disabled so I had to contact customer service. It's really strange, even though I wanted to immediately study the applicable rules before deciding to make a deposit to take part in the promotional bonus offered.After contacting support, they said that users in my area were flooding registrations so they did a mass ban. Again quite surprising for me as this is the first time having this problem. In other words the conclusion means I will not be able to play for this casino.",

I see that your casino has a TOS designer and it seemed to me to be a very fair TOS in terms of requirements and I suggest that everyone read the TOS first and then they can create an account, especially pay more attention to the part of the TOS that talks about deposits, withdrawals and betting. This is to avoid that after people create an account, deposit, play and win and when withdrawing, they make many withdrawals and are surprised by the casino's stance on this matter, so read the TOS carefully:https://www.seabet9.io/#/terms/rulesand if you decide to create an account at this casino, be aware of these rules, and for those problematic people who cannot control themselves when they play and create an account at the casino and then exclude themselves and then come to complain here on the forum, I suggest that you also take a lot of time to read their TOS about the self-exclusion part:https://www.seabet9.io/#/terms/selfExclusionI've seen cases of people complaining that they excluded an account but forgot to withdraw funds from the account, so read carefully what their TOS says about this to avoid complaining later",
