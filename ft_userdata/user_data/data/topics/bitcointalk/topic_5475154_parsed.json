Years back the same thing happened to BitMex and this exchange used to be the top over all, the CEO did the same thing and he was fined and he was never locked up, they let him walk free, I am not sure they same thing will happen to CZ this time, the BitMeX CEO never made anyone his enemy, that's why I doubt that they will let CZ walk but we will see what will happen.",

You are damn right the US doesn't wants an outside firm working in their area and also putting a great influence on a market whose they are judged of. I did not come to think of this point until this post, but it makes sense now and if it is valid then Kraken will be the next exchange because Kraken is also sued by SEC for unregistered securities.If that's the case then they will be forced to comply with laws too otherwise they will be following the Binance pathway but I know they will comply with them as they have no big resources as Binance has. And they are providing opportunities to their own platforms like BlockRock etc. Because this platform will bring more investors and tax paying customers.",
