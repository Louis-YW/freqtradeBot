The system he will use can be determined by the kind of script he is installing on his blog. Basically, it's meant to be automatically done, just like giving merit is automated here. So, op is working on building something for the good predictors to get popular and recognized. Thereby earning more followers which can lead them to more opportunities. Quite correct, it'll be difficult for Op to climb the ladder, yet we can't conclude how soon untill everyone wants to use his platform. Moreover the market is large, and they are spaces for him at the top, but he may not sit down. He needs to work with the concept he has in mind then focus on marketing. It's a smooth idea. I love it.",

That's good do you have experience in blogging and how long have you been blogging, I'm sure you are going to use a WordPress script you are very specific on what you want to do with your MMA blog but do you already have a theme for your MMA blog what are the plugins that you are going to use so you can be sure that you can create your goal on your blog. What you posted here will only be good depending on the theme and plugins are you going to use, I encourage you to do that if this is something that will give MMA supporters and bettors a new experience.",

Well, this one would be a good idea especially to those who are new ones in this industry or those who are just interested with particular gambling games or sports (if sportsbetting), for them to gain knowledge and to help them with their bets. As others have mentioned, there are existing prediction threads in this forum so if you want to make it special, probably creating another platform would be a good idea. If it is just sharing, then there will be no problem into it BUT if you are aiming to get profit from it, perhaps with accessibility, then that would be you.",

The OP is already banned due to multiple ban evasion offense. This is already his 2nd account to evade ban. Also this guy is known for bragging and promising too good to be true offer just to seek an attention for his gambling experience.I doubt that he will pay too on this contest even if he was not ban. Just report this post to moderator so that this will be lock already since OP can’t open his account anymore to lock this.",
