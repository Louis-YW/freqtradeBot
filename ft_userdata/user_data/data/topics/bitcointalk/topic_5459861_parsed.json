Honestly, I don't know in what context these issues are related in the film, whether in a positive or negative way, since I haven't had the joy of seeing it yet. but what I do know and I am sure is that without a doubt The entertainment industry and the film industry are extremely influential and have a wide audience. and whatever the context, the film could arouse the interest and curiosity of viewers in these technologies (cryptocurrency and AI) in a fun and accessible context.but more than that I think that this film could break with some stigmas and negative perceptions that surround cryptocurrencies, presenting them as something exciting and full of possibilities. It could foster a more open mind towards these technologies and allay the fear or uncertainty that some people may have due to a lack of understanding. Personally, I don't know what you guys think, but I find it intriguing that they're producing movies related to this field on the big screen. What is your opinion about it?Funet: https://criptotendencia.com/2023/07/13/mision-imposible-tom-cruise-se-enfrenta-a-la-inteligencia-artificial-y-a-las-criptomonedas-2/",
