I will repeat some advice that was given to me when I first asked a curiosity question. The forum is too big, and it covers every aspect and field of specialization. So just choose where you think defines you the most and where you think you could possibly be useful. And start engaging in conversations there. Those things that you think you could possibly do in other social gatherings, you are free to do them here. There are no limitations to what could be posted; just don't steal others content, as mentioned by other members. The forum doesn't punish or victimize anyone for speaking their mind; everyone's opinion is respected and valued.",
