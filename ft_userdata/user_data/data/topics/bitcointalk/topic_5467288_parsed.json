      "body": "Quote from: theymos on May 10, 2016, 04:25:11 PMYeah, that's what it is. Posts over 65535 bytes get cut off at 65535 bytes. If that makes the BBcode invalid in certain ways, then you get the INVALID BBCODE error.Also, note that a byte is different from a character. Because SMF stores \"special\" characters in a particularly space-inefficient way, each Russian character uses about 6 bytes, and each line break also uses 6 bytes.Yes there's a limit/post as per theymos its 65535 bytes (65,535 ASCII/English characters).  But when it comes to other languages like Arabic/Urdu it needs Unicode to save and size of it depends on the encoding for example:UTF-16 - Each Character needs two-bytesUTF-32 - Each Character needs four-bytesI guess bitcointalk is using UTF-16 so the character limit for Urdu is 65535/2 ~ 32767 Characters in Unicode.Edit: I believe it's UTF-32 which means 4-bytes/character, I tested it in a PM (assuming PM/Posts have same character limit) and I'm able to send a big message with mix Urdu/English characters and it automatically got trimmed at 21,799.Not sure why Russian characters needs 6 bytes? I think it should also take 1-4 bytes only.",

I don't know the limit though, wasn't in need of such a topic in my bitcointalk journey lol.Actually, I believe shahzadafzal is correct. It's not really a character limit but rather a byte limit. So, it really depends on the language you're using. For instance, you can fit a lot more characters in a post written in English (or some other Latin-based language) compared to a language that uses Unicode characters.",

I remember this problem from 2018, and in some languages such as Roman, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic, the number of words is less than the number of words in the English language, and the reason for this is that we have about 65,535 bytes limit per post (focus bytes, not words) in ASCII characters (completely compatible with the English language) each 128 characters are encoded using 1 Byte, but in some languages such as Arabic and Russian, where there are extra characters, which are expressed as 1920 characters, they are encoded using 2 Bytes, and thus the number of bytes consumed by characters in any local language becomes much higher than in the English language, and thus the number of characters in the English language more than other languages.If your topic contains longer words, the words consume more letters and require more than one post.Quote from: dzungmobile on September 19, 2023, 11:59:36 AMLimits are in bytes like you can see in a guide of forum ad design.
