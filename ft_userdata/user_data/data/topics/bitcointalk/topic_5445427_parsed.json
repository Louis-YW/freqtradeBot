No one wants a currency they can't withdraw from the platform, that's why the price difference is so big. You have to be careful with such things in the future and check the exchange rate before depositing funds. I guess now you have the option to either accept such a bad rate or wait for it to stabilize again on the platform, which can be risky.",

I don't know how favourable the exchange rate is, but you will avoid some unnecessary fees in transactions. For example:https://www.bestchange.com/visa-mastercard-gbp-to-tether-trc20.html",

I would first check the available networks on both exchanges for USDT as they should match. For instance if you wanna withdraw USDT on TRON network, both kucoin and kraken has to support it. Make sure to also read everything on the withdrawal and deposit page as exchanges typically place notices/guides on there e.g. something like \"you may only deposit abc coin on y network in this address\". Do it slowly and verify everything is right: the address, the coin selected, the network. For your peace of mind, you may also send a small amount first as a test.",

A non-custodial wallet will not charge you anything more than what you need to pay (network fees) and it's based on:- Transaction size.- How congested the network is.An exchange on the other hand tends to charge users a fixed fee (depending on the coin/network of course)So for example, Binance and Kucoin charge you 0.0005 BTC (~14$) while OKX charges 0.00032 BTC (~8) but if you were to try a non-custodial wallet then it shouldn't cost you as much:Quote from: https://bitcoinfees.net/Average transaction fee: $0.57 (1 input, 2 outputs, SegWit, 1 hour conf. time.)So if you had 500$ BTC in KuCoin for example, it's better to withdraw everything, and use it from your personal wallet, than to withdraw a small amount each time you want to use your funds. Now, things may not be as bad when  dealing with USDT on Tron, but it's definitely something you should keep in mind.",
