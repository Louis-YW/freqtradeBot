      "body": "I‚Äôm not aware with this button because the edit button is much more noticeable than that small icon. It is indeed useful to edit using this button because it didn‚Äôt change the screen and its perfect to view other post while you are still on the edit mode unlike the edit button which rearrange all the post from top to bottom that typically made me confused on hierarchy of the post.Nice find. This topic might be appropriate on Meta section since this is all about forum feature but I guess its still good to share for newbie. This is not new but I think not many user here notice that icon because it‚Äôs so small.",

      "body": "I don't think I was able to use that feature ever. All I do is click the edit button aligned with the \"quote\" and \"delete\" buttons and do it manually. It will definitely save you time and wouldn't have to load another page just when editing your post. Might have seen it in my peripherals but definitely not used with me lol.Thanks for sharing OP.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on March 10, 2023, 04:57:26 PMThat's not a new feature.Click here and see a post made in 2015, where a user was talking about quick edit button. Thanks for sharing this thread. Looks like a good read. *Tried using the edit now when reading the thread posted by hosseinimr93, and it's cool to use. **It seems that the hidden features thread are mostly disabled now like the \"who\" is online",

This is a visible feature of this forum that everyone sees but maybe doesn't bother to check what it is.There are plenty of hidden features which you may find in this thread - Hidden pages/ features on the forum.

Today I was posting on forum and than I posted my post. And right there was a pencil ‚úèÔ∏è Icon and I clicked there and edir button was open right in there and page do not goes to other window and I think that will save a lot of time for me and just edit and click on save and in this way you can also do the same. Here are the picsSeriously surprised with this post, I joined the forum no quite long so this is my first time of seeing this. One good thing I like¬† with this forum you can't just come and start writing any thing you have to make serious research before posting. Bitcointalk is a home of knowledge once you are in you continues to learn. I have learn a lot with your post.",

Its good you shared it with the public am sure lots of users don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs meant for and newbies and other rank members will surely learn from your post. I think i will use this button more often from now on.Quote from: Maxre on March 11, 2023, 07:50:21 AMQuote from: Husires on March 10, 2023, 06:21:44 PMDoes this require creating a topic?

I thought of that as well and I usually have problem quoting some post because i cannot view previous posts i just see the most recent ones. After reading your comment i just thought of it and i think that would solve the problem.",
