      "body": "1. This is the Bitcoin-only mining area. that means unless you are running USB-based miners there is NO software to set up.2. Bitcoin miners are plug-n-play devices where all you do is fill in the address for mining pool you are using, your user name on the pool, and a password (usually just 'x' is fine). That is about as user-friendly as it gets! Of course you need a wallet to receive BTC but that's a different topic.3. If you are running a USB-based stick or pod miner then ja, you need to setup cgminer for them - just follow the directions given in the topics for those miners.If you are NOT mining Bitcoin then you need to go to the altcoin ares of the Forum and yes, depending on the coin there may be software setup involved.Folks new to mining (any coin) should peruse the Beginners & Help area of the Forum.",

I have a ton of other questions, but these will help. sorry Im such a noob!!!It seems like you are using some sort of transaction, it's fine.There is no coding or any type of special experience required to run a mining pool, it's a simple process.1- Find a mining pool, for example (Viabtc, Binance, f2pool, Slush) and create an account then log in.2- create a mining account in that pool, for example (squirrel3477)3- The pool will give you or tell you what URL to use, for example, if you chose viabtc Code:stratum+tcp://btc.viabtc.com:3333Now left the miner configuration page.1- Find the IP address of the miner and type it in any browser2-log in, and go to the configuration page, you will find 9 fields (3 fields to each pool) like thisPool 1URLUsernamePasswordPool 2URLUsernamePasswordPool 3URLUsernamePasswordyou only need to fill in the first pool, but it's a good idea to have at least 2 pools (different pools, for example Viabtc and Cksolo)URL  Code:stratum+tcp://btc.viabtc.com:3333Username Code:squirrel3477Password Code:xThen hit apply/save. After that the miner will reboot, wait a few minutes and go to the status page, you should see your pool is active and the page shows the miner hashrate, if everything is good, go to your pool webpage and you will the hashrateIf you still can't figure out, I can help you on Anydesk or Teamviewer.",

      "body": "I'm using HiveOS before if you set up your miner properly then it should show the hash rate under overview.If not, you didn't set up the hash_farm properly in your miner.If you don't know how to put hash_farm into your miner check this video guide below- https://youtu.be/I6VEHX88ekQAbout the flight sheet if you properly set up and put the hash_farm it should show as online under overview then go to the flight sheet you need to edit the coin, wallet, miner, pool, and name of this flight sheet if you setup it up properly after clicking the launch icon it will hash and you will see hash rate under overview.Make sure the coin you select is BTC and choose ASIC on the miner's dropdown list.Hive is a good OS where you can remote your miner anywhere by just accessing your hiveon account.",

I have a ton of other questions, but these will help. sorry Im such a noob!!!Did you ensure that your power supply statisfies all the requirements of your S9 asc miners dude?I suggest you to use Bitmain's Apw3 1600 watt power supply, in which was designed specifically for use in bitcoinmining applications, then you must obtain devise ip, and when miner is powered up and normally working, make sure you enabled DHCP in your router's control panel in order to properly assign ip addresses. This is actually a very long tutorial, but I admired the guts you have on this things you've decided to boughta mining machine.",
