This is the second version of the coin from my original release and is far better crafter than the first. The holos adhere to the coin perfectly while being smooth and flat, the textures and finish are much better and much more clear/crisp. I wanted to make an affordable, funded piece to help build and establish trust on the forum. Thanks guys hope you enjoy!",
