So you can just settle it at once, and once everything is settled, let the police, and government eyes be on the countrys forever, and there should be more love among each others, I have read about many wars that has happened in many nations that if this strategy was applied, it won't had lead to that standards that it ended.",

      "body": "Well my opinion is that we can solve and end war through our own selfs in the society before the president even comes for pleading, because we in the society are the future and leaders of tomorrow, any how you react to things around you determine the things we all see around us, we can settle things around ourselves quickly before the president pleading for an end of any on going war, we are expressing a hard  time now in the society, and hard times leads to war and disaster in the society, and if the governments, and the president can look into most of the matters going on in the society, this only can bring to a permanent change among us, and peace, love, for me the only thing that can bring about permanent peace is more love and less ego among our society and the governments, and there should be a change from the government, so they won't dissolve and results to any war.I have seen a situation were the people in the society asking for peace from the government and most importantly the president, the best way to end war is for the president to be among the society always, because togetherness is the best way to a successfully end, and what always brings war in a nation is lack of help and job in the society, if now everyone is celebrating Christmas, have you take time to ask yourself that how will the one's that has nothing feels, the little things that we see as nothing brings and easily bring war in the nation's.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

If you want this fight to stop then you should ask Biden, when he wants it to stop, it will stop immediately. If you want to stop the war, you have to ask the creator of that war.

He could ask that boy who tracks Elon Musk's flight schedules and that boy might track Putin's whereabouts. Kidding aside, it's very impossible to have this in execution. There are better ways of ending it and that's should be civilized talks and I hope that Russia would humble themselves down and will apologize for what they've done.",
