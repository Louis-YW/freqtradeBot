      "body": "Looking at your topic and the content of your post, I will presume you are accepting a KYC proposal or offer from anyone who is scouting for anybody to do KYC on their behalf but I want to ask you this question, do you not see it as very risky to get involved in? Do you have idea what or why the person looking for who to do KYC for them wants to do with that account they want to be verified? What if after doing the KYC and you found out your identity is used for nefarious act which you have no knowledge and idea about what will you do? what will you tell the government or security agencies? Do you think they would accept your stories of what happened on your own path? I will advise you think about it before putting up such advert because anybody who contact you for this would have nothing to loose as their identity wasn't used for anything but rather yours and they would walk freely without anybody knowing or noticing them while you be in a hideout for what you have no knowledge about.",
