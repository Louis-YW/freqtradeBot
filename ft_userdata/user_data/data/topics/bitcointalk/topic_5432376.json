      "body": "Yet another \"London based exchange\" (that should be sign of legitimacy I guess) that is not listed on either CMC or Coingecko (being listed there doesn't mean that exchange is legit, but not being there at all is a huge red flag) and with inflated (~10%)  BTC/ETH/any other coin prices in order to attract users (read victims). This looks like a straight up scam to me.https://web.archive.org/web/20221230133504/https://wafux.com/QuoteDomain: wafux.comRegistrar: NameCheap, Inc.Registered On: 2022-12-26Expires On: 2023-12-26Another thing, like in a recent Kufrux exchange case they copied the same TOS text.
