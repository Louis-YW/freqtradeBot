Masquerader! Charlatan!', false);Basically, if you try to post (or later edit) a message containing nothing but the (case-insensitive, unquoted) string \"i am the administrator.\", you'll (in all probability) be greeted with the following:Anyway, just a small bit of fun that I thought would be worth sharing.",

It's worth mentioning that SMF is a really old piece of software, dating back to the last century, or possibly around the turn of the new century, if my memory serves me right.  No, SMF was already created in the 21st century. If you scroll to the bottom of the forum page, you will see the dates. The year of the first version of SMF software is listed there. The first version of the software was released on December 2, 2006. There is an article on SMF on Wikipedia. You can read it here.Yeah, I missed it by a few years. I recall playing around with some open-source forum software during that time, and it's possible that I mixed up SMF with phpBB, which was quite popular back then. However, based on the information in the wiki article, the first version of SMF, which was SMF 1.0 Beta 1a, was actually released in September 2003. But you're right, the first stable version, SMF 1.1, was released in 2006.But it's still a relic of the past - an outdated piece of software that hasn't changed much since then. It's amusing to consider that most of the current members of the BitcoinTalk.org forum weren't even born when SMF first came into being.",
