But if you have enough bitcoin, you can trade bitcoin which its market is more predictable than some altcoins.Know that some good traders are losing because they are trading shit coins, but you can also trade the altcoins and make money if you get it rightly.",

But there is another trading pair that has no trading fee. I have seen something like that in other exchanges, like Bybit and others.Then another good thing about the trading pair is that when you do a trade, for example, on Btc-matic sell or buy in this trading pair, you have nothing to lose because they both have the ability to give you profit.

When I trade with the BTC pair, both will rise and fall simultaneously. Thats one use of stablecoins like USDT, you can cut down the middle fee.Consider bitcoin is rising and you sell for USDT. Now you have big chunk of USDT at hand and you wait it out, till bitcoin drops and use the same USDT to buy back the bitcoin. End result is that you multiplied the Bitcoin by a factor > 1 usually something like 1.x - so this is how buyback works and how people stash up coins taking advantage of the cycles.Bitcoin-USDT-Altcoin would be another layer to this. I usually dont suggest altcoins, but if you are interested in any, you can use the same strategy to multiply an altcoin.Remember that cycle reversals take months, so this is a long term game.",

When I trade with the BTC pair, both will rise and fall simultaneously.It depends on consumer choice. Exchange only provides facilities in my opinion. There are several options here that traders take. There are traders who like to accumulate Bitcoin, so they prefer to trade with BTC pairs so that the BTC they have increases (they trade this model as a long-term investment because they believe that the price of BTC will always rise in the future) = holder BTC Forex speculators and traders who enter crypto usually use USDT as their trading pair. They tend to like playing using the USDT pair because they have little confidence in the future of BTC/Crypto, they only take advantage of volatility or crypto movements for profit/printing money.",

There are local exchanges where you can buy usdt by transferring to the exchange or if you use Binance exchange you can buy usdt through P2p.

Well if you don't want to trade fiat pairs you will save yourself the spread and commissions. Say you mine ETH but want to keep BTC.

Bitcoin valuation compared to the USDT, I'm not sure about the fees, but in terms of valuation it can be really helpful if executed smartly, It can be the future adoption of many users, just try to analyze the BTC pair with any coin and USDT pair with any coin and now compare the trades profit/loss there will be a huge difference. Stablecoins are risk-free pairs from most traders' perspectives but if you're a Bitcoin the BTC valuation mindset can be your greatest opportunity.Let's understand it properly with the cycling movement.♦️ BEar Marekt (Stable Currnecy ✔️)♦️ Pre-Halving (Bitcoin ✔️)♦️ Halving (Bitcoin ✔️)♦️ Post Halving (Altcoins ✔️)",
