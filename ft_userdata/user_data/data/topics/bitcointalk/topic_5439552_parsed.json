      "body": "I have never been but I would one day really like to visit The Maldives. It feels like a tropical getaway with so many outdoor excursions, where do I begin? I wish I could go island hopping but I'm going to settle for just choosing the simplest. I would start off with embracing the environment, listening to the sounds of no traffic on a secluded resort.  I would relax on the beach and enjoy the beautiful color of the sand and the water of the Maldives, maybe catch the lights of the water under a dark clear night. Then scuba diving or snorkel, to view the coral reefs or maybe encounter a Hawksbill Sea Turtle. Then some watersports on a jet ski to perhaps hang on another island for a day. Take in some of the culture, by trying new food, viewing museums and monuments. This is a sure way to have a good time in the Maldives, I’m sure there is plenty more to research as there are so many islands to choose from.",

But I have never visited any Arab countries eg. Saudi Arabia, Iran,  Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria etc. because I'm not sure how safe these countries are for western citizens (christians) from Europe and Northern America. I'm sure all remember Saddam Hussein and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the Islamic State.",

However, I have a vast amount of knowledge and information about these countries based on data and experiences shared by others.From what I've learned, these countries have rich cultures, traditions, and diverse cuisines that are worth exploring. If I were to visit these places, I would definitely make an effort to learn more about the local customs and try the various foods.I think interacting with locals and immersing oneself in their traditions is one of the best ways to truly experience a new place. It can provide a deeper understanding of the people and their way of life.Of course, like with any new place, it's important to be respectful and mindful of local customs and beliefs. It's also a good idea to do some research beforehand to be aware of any cultural norms or etiquette to avoid causing any unintentional offense.",

Specially night street food in Aluthkade. Also try these foods:Cheese KottuEgg Hoppers With LunuMirisBombay Faluda Drink - I recommended Roots outlet Bombay FaludaString Hoppers with chicken Curry and Pol SambolEgg Parata with a Meat curry and Dhal CurryPancakeTGC Mango with spiesDhal Wade, Prawn Wade (can be find in Galleface in Colombo)They have lot of food varieties from different taste. I miss them so much. Also if you are traveling always use PickMe or Uber. They will not scam you by charging 10-20$ for 3-4KM.",
