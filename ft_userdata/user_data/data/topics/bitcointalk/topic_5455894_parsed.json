Copy Electrum from the online device you have and move it to the offline device. Create a wallet, write down the seeds (you are free to remove the wallet file once seeds are written down or you are finish with a session), get the Master Public Key. May be use a text file and store the Master Public Key in the USB flash drive to transfer it in the device that is online.In the online device restore a watch only wallet using the Master Public Key. You should be able to see same address set for both offline wallet (main wallet) and restored watch only copy in the online device.",

As my experience, I used Electrum portable version for about 1 year before buying a Hardware wallet. I don't have a problem with that, maybe because I used a clean PC and don't install anything there.If you tech-savvy, you can use your old laptop and install Tails OS on your USB drive which I think is enough safety and privacy.",

I would also suggest enabling full disk encryption when you install Linux, so if someone physically accesses your airgapped computer they cannot extract any useful or sensitive information from it.Also make sure to verify the copy of Electrum you download on your live computer before transferring it to your airgapped computer for installation.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on June 09, 2023, 08:53:13 PMTrezorQuote from: sheenshane on June 09, 2023, 11:43:14 PMWasabi WalletAnd subject yourself to mass surveillance and government sanctioned censorship?

However if you're more comfortable with Windows and plan to use it on an air-gapped device, it shouldn't be a problem.In addition to that, I would suggest checking out this guide created by Sowik that delves into securing your air-gapped laptop. It provides detailed information on how to safeguard your bitcoin or even your other crypto. Although the topic may be dated, it remains highly informative at least for me.",

No thanks.Security and privacy are getting attacked from all sides these days, that's for sure.  Just when Ledger announces their \"Shared Self-Custody\" service, Trezor is contracting with Wasabi who's in turn contracting with arbitrary Chain Analyses scammers.It's really too bad about Trezor, they had such a good thing going being among the most popular fully open-source hardware wallets.  Even their app allows for one to connect to a private SPV server for bitcoin (and maybe some shitcoins, but I wouldn't know.)  Contracting with Wasabi is such a slap in the face to their customers who care about privacy.  At this point I feel like my Trezor One is useless, and my Trezor Model T has been relegated for use with my XMR full node only.If Foundation implements XMR compatibility into their Passport wallet, Trezor will be in real trouble.",

Even if you don't touch the Wasabi functionality with Trezor, it reveals a lot about their mentality and their priorities. They also supported AOPP last year, which was essentially a method for centralized exchanges to enforce KYC on your own addresses, and they deliberately sweep their unfixable seed extraction vulnerabilities under the rug and do not warn new users about how to protect themselves against these vulnerabilities.As with Ledger implementing more shitcoin support rather than addressing this Ledger Recovery debacle, it shows that Trezor care first and foremost about profits, with users' privacy and security way down their list of priorities. I would not trust them.Quote from: DireWolfM14 on June 10, 2023, 03:52:44 PMIf Foundation implements XMR compatibility into their Passport wallet, Trezor will be in real trouble.I'm fairly sure Foundation will never release official XMR firmware, but there is a community project started here (albeit with little activity, it seems): https://github.com/mjg-foundation/passport2-monero",
