  "content": "Few minutes to my bed time, few words on the Deloitte research struck thoughts of future adoptions in me. Don't know if it's speculative, but seems like a real occurrence, we can relate to it. First on the \"merchants getting ready for crypto survey\", about 60% of merchants wanted to integrate bitcoin because their customers demanded for crypto payment. But, they required a payment system that can swap immediately the crypto to fiat. No realistic intention of the merchants holding bitcoin. All requirements like in customer and client relationship is entertaining the ideas of clients to retain liberties with them. And raising up such a payment system, according to the survey, would costs merchants $500,000 as of 2021. So as to Cut costs from 3rd party payment processor; fees. Second, Merchants also realized that bitcoin also serves as a big cow, the business will milk profits from bitcoin price increase, for a long period. As of the time of the survey total number of bitcoin users slayed at 220 million around the globe. With young people, the majority. Today it has doubled to 420 million, according to a google search. With young people, retaining the majority.Third, merchants believe that not adopting bitcoin or crypto, will affect a business growth in future. Since the younger generation dominates the market in huge numbers. Looking at the evolution, the younger generations would become older generations. Then their offspring will also have to use bitcoin, because their parents does. It will skyrocket the adoption of bitcoin amongst users, thereby affecting business that failed to learn or integrate bitcoin in their businesses. Finally, one might say that they'll integrate bitcoin when the time comes, but the costs of doing that may have increased too. As of now merchants need about 500k to 1 million dollars to build a satisfactory payment system to suit customers and the business alike. I think, somehow, somewhere, some merchants would be dropped out of the trend. I know of other possibilities of bypassing such payments processors, in form of an argument your ideas are welcomed. Happy Sunday!https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology/us-cons-merchant-getting-ready-for-crypto.pdf",

They with their company sizes surely don't want to take risk with cryptocurrency because they know if they do something wrong with audits, their companies will collapse like Enron and their audit company, MCI.MCI, Inc. (formerly WorldCom and MCI WorldCom)Enron.What do you think about future of Deloitte if they audited FTX and the exchange gone after a few days? Deloitte will go to the hell as well and I am sure they won't take risk with cryptocurrency companies, exchanges too soon.Anyway this report from them is good signal that they are slowly changing their standpoint on cryptocurrency.",

I think it could be at least 3 cycles away. Another thing is that, yes, if in say 15 years' time the price is fairly stable and bitcoin ownership is much more widespread than it is today, people will spend it for day-to-day payments, but that would require something else as well: favourable regulation. As things stand with most regulations today, every time you spend bitcoin you are triggering a potential taxable event. If at that moment the price is higher than when you bought it, you will have to pay capital gains tax or the one that corresponds to your legislation.Without legally considering it as a currency or setting minimum exemptions for small payments, and with the growing KYC it is going to be much less complicated to pay with fiat or its anti-privacy CBCD.",

We can argue good / bad but there are a lot of people who got into crypto with coinbase and never left. Same with square - block - cashapp - whatever they are called today.These places also either provide their own credit card terminals (square) or partner with others (bitpay / coinbase) I see a future where I walk into my local bagel store (like I did this morning) and pay with cashapp (like I did this morning) and instead of it coming out of my BTC balance and going to the merchants it will be batched out at the end of the day. Much like credit cards are done now. For all we know that is what is really happening since some these apps & services to a certain extent are custodial and you really don't know what is going on in the background.-Dave",

Immediate, maybe. Expected to see this question. I thought about it and wasn't sure of what they needed such an amount to build. But, to be sincere, I've not seen a payment processor like that. Even people who offer it as a service, still requires the merchant to withdraw their funds. Don't know actually how they'll want to build the system. Since they don't want to hold the bitcoin, they'll need an asap payment swap; crypto to fiat. If anybody has worked on such a system I can't tell. Weighing the worth of building such, could get to an amount like that. Building an intelligent system, that'll trade their crypto to their bank account.

A lot of transaction go on with bitcoin. Merchants with online services get bitcoin users easily. I know people think of offline businesses, when talking of merchant adoptions. In future, people won't often go to shops, to get some products. The user you mentioned above, could be hodling. And doesn't intend to sell or purchase stuffs with his coins. The users in quote include hodlers. But, when we begin to see fancy bitcoin payment mediums in offline stores, we can easily pay with our devices. LN is helping the growth of making fast payments too. Personally, I use bitcoin to pay for different products online and have seen multiple clients ask me if I take bitcoin for my products. Hence, the responses on the thread is not enough to generalize on the way clients wants to use bitcoin. The forum always send thumbs up to those who don't spend their coins. Isn't it a criterion that can affect the responses of some users in the thread, coming up with impressive responses regarding not spending their bitcoin.",

At the centre of these challenges is the volatility like you rightly stated. Many businesses are not just comfortable with the volatility of Bitcoin as it distort their financial projections and balancing of books like in weekly or monthly basis.

Yeah, considering that bitcoin or any decentralized cryptocurrency is volatile gives merchants hesitation whether to give it a shot or adopt it. The traditional mode of payment is vastly used, and so adopting should not be their priority, but can be their alternative. Totally understandable for business owners, besides not everyone can own cryptocurrencies to pay, the economic of crypto wasn't designed for this.

The main concern against this method is that it's through centralized services; I'm not quite sure if decentralization is possible in this case.
