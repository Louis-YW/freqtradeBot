Unto say halving na next year,  I believe say there is uncertain about the Bitcoin price but however, there are also some people strategically manipulating the market I believe they are taking advantage of the market situations as well selling to drop the price then they buy back and hold till after the halving as usual and expected bull run does come then they start selling to take profit. This happens all the time and in a way people would not understand how it works. This is the reason I don't listen to fud anymore because that is also a strategy by them to confuse people who are weak hands and they end up selling low and the whales buy them all at low prices and hold them to take big profit.",

If to say no be Elon musk cause am, you go still see one influencer go just come talk something about bitcoin. Maybe for example Warren buffet go just wake up from no where say him no like bitcoin and you go see bitcoin price for ground then the build up go start again. Na the circle be that wey still make people see am as manipulation by the whales to make people fear to dump so that the price go drop and it can trigger there buy order.But one thing wey dey real be say the price go recover and hit ATH.
