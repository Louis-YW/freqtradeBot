  "content": "Before, the recent spamming of Bitcoin that leads to the hike of the transaction fee, bitcoin was already having a scaling problem but that didn't move most people to use the Lightning network and this has been base on the fact that the technical aspect of setting up a lightning network is complex for a basic user and so this has affected the growth of Lightning network, but the recent spamming of Bitcoin has lead to many exchanges, implementing lightning network and this makes it easier for a basic bitcoin user to use the Lightning network. So I have been thinking, was bitcoin scalability really an issue in the first place and what have really been affecting the growth of Lightning network. Even paxful, is among the exchange implementing lightning network for bitcoin (one of their reasons was because of the cash shortage in Nigeria)",

They’re lined up for days to withdraw a maximum amount of 20,00 NGN per day (roughly 43 USD) and many are struggling to buy basic human needs like food and medicine—despite having money in the bank.

Scalability of Bitcoin na problem wey to my knowledge start since 2017 infact e ever cause major folk for Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin cash come out in 2017 and they plan to solve the Bitcoin scalability problem but the community no gree accept Bitcoin cash because of many other reasons wey I no go discuss today since nobi wetin we dey discuss. The matter be say many solutions dun come out to solve this issue of high fee but them never succeed fully and na because adoption never too come for the solutions them. No be every Bitcoiner at first support lightening network when e come out, some dey dey say no be Bitcoin self because transaction aren't done on the mainnet of Bitcoin blockchain. Na just recently like few years back people and companies begin dey accept the lightening network well and segwit address integration too as no better options dun come out. I hope you understand how Bitcoin lightening network works, the transaction dey confirm for another layer like dem polygon dem wey be layer 2. Lightening network na layer 2 e be the transaction no dey happen on the Bitcoin mainnet and na why people been dey get second thought about the whole solution. Lightening network na the best solution we dun get so far but I believe in future better solution go come out wey go dey the Bitcoin mainnet directly but for now for faster confirmation na lightening network be baba.",

But those who didn't adopt lightning network before, have been able to cope with the scaling problem before this recent attack on Bitcoin, with this can I say the scaling problem was not too serious before this recent attack?",

Although some exchanges are supporting it too, not that it is so bad to the extent that few exchanges are not supporting it. About your questions, it is likely because those exchanges are making huge profit from bitcoin. They also have their side chains, like the Binance BNB Beacon Chian and the Binance Smart Chain for bitcoin which are actually not bitcoin, but altcoins.Quote from: Amphenomenon on May 24, 2023, 12:42:22 PMThis is what they said in the link on my postI saw it too and I perfectly understood you correctly, but you do not have to agree with everything you see on the news, while you need to read some news in details before not leading to rumour or misunderstanding.

All other networks are altcoins and some people referred to them as side chains. Lighting network is layer 2 like you meant, but not side chain because it is actually bitcoin sent to offchain layer to be used for lower and faster transactions.

Yes, not as serious as this. But it is worth knowing that this is not an attack. It only makes bitcoin to have more usefulness. Something useful should not be called an attack, but I noticed that almost all established bitcointalk members that posted about it all against it except one that I know among them that is a miner. Some coins like litecoin and doge have their own tokens now which their community well accepted and not a problem because they are not have scaling issue. I do not mean bitcoin is not superior and better, but why want to fight what makes transaction fee to be more replacing mining reward.",

I see that people often tackle on things they don't seems to admit or have a take on, to me i see bitcoin lightning network as being developed to help institutions with the ease of performing a bulky transactions at the same time with lesser see and more faster, just like a company will always want to make his staffs monthly payment using the channel, so i don't see it more applicable for an individual use than a collective one for organizations, which means using a layer 2 transaction is by choice if you think it pays but not to now discourage others from the use of bitcoin lightning network.",

The Koko be say the lightening network dey complicate things and although we dey look am like say e no matter, we have some OGs rejecting to accept it and you no go blame them because they have very valid reason not to do so.  So for the same Bitcoin now we get choice to accept am or not, isn't that disrupting the whole concept of Bitcoin not been censored. Why introduced a layer 2 solution that give option to denied accepting Bitcoin just because e no come from your own lightening node. I see why people are even entertaining the idea of lightening network, na because him no come with e own coins as Bitcoincash do because Bitcoin maximalist no dey like use eye hear another coin. The main Bitcoin is the mainnet, lightening network is a sidechain (layer 2) solution and although it uses the same real Bitcoin still it can be censored by wallets, exchanges or a business owner not accepting it because it isn't their own lightening node (you see wetin I do there) but any Bitcoin coming directly from the Bitcoin mainnet can't be rejected. Lightening network takes Bitcoin out of the mainnet which make it's not a permanent solution to the scalability problem. Dem be dun talk say make dem increase the Bitcoin block size so more transaction can be included but I no just dey understand why we no go with dat solution, e for better pass all this lightening network wahala.",

Some people have proposed solutions, such as SegWit and Lightning Network, but these have not been widely adopted. Scalability remains a major challenge for Bitcoin.Perhaps you need to check this chart to see how segwit bitcoin wallet address has been adopted many times. Since the soft fork, not one day has that chart fac decline for once, it has been on its all time high and still growing. To backup my argument, check mempool.space explorer for the pending transactions and comfirm transaction, it contains almost all segwit transaction with address that start with  bc1q, don't forget that we also have another segwit in adoption but that one is taproot it start with bc1pThe adoption should have passed this level but some wallets and exchange are very lazy to adopt this despite the fact that it's compatible in a way that they can wrapped their previous addresses as nested segwit but they prefer previous type of wallet addresses.As LN network I think the reason why it hasn't getting that massive attention is because bitcoin legal tender is very low, how many people use bitcoin for day to day transaction, only few, the rest are happening onchain transaction that is why it hasn't gotten that kind of widely adoption. But people still use it, it will get better with time.",

      "body": "Bitcoin's scalability has been a major issue since its inception. Bitcoin's design limits the number of transactions that can be processed in a given period of time, and this has caused significant bottlenecks as the network has grown. There are a number of potential solutions to this problem, such as increasing the block size limit or implementing off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network. However, these solutions have faced challenges, such as the risk of centralization and the need for consensus among the Bitcoin community. As a result, Bitcoin's scalability remains a significant challenge.Another scalability challenge facing Bitcoin is the issue of mining centralization. Bitcoin is a proof-of-work system, which means that the network relies on miners to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. However, as the Bitcoin network has grown, mining has become increasingly centralized, with a small number of large mining pools controlling the majority of the hash power. This centralization has led to concerns that the Bitcoin network could be controlled by a small group of entities, and it has also raised questions about the network's long-term sustainability.",
