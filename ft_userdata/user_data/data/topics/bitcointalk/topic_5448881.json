Going by your image I think I have read about some it is some what called the Ubuntu Bold Italicunfortunately that's wrong. Ubuntu Bold Italic is the name of the font in the logo were the word bitcoin is spelled out. Ubuntu Bold Italic is the font used in that whole word. but Like I said I'm asking about the font in the Bitcoin B symbol/logo not the font in the word bitcoin spelled out. I'm asking specifically what's the font of the individual solo B in the bitcoin symbol and logo.",

I asked this question on reddit as well and someone linked me to the article https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-history-and-symbolism-behind-bitcoins-logo which led me to Phil Wilsons medium article https://medium.com/@_Phil_Wilson_/bitcoin-symbol-and-logo-origins-5d428d40380 where he claimed he was involved with the creation of all the bitcoin symbol/logos or at least sending the instructions for how they should be created. But now I'm wondering if there's any verification that Phil Wilson was actually involved in the creation of the Bitcoin B logo. He also claims to be Satoshi or more specifically part of a group that he says is called Satoshi so that may put his claim of being involved in the creation of the logo in some doubt.

I asked the question about the font on reddit and other sites as well and a lot of people link me to stuff from this guy called Phil Lawson who claims to have been involved in the creation of the logo. He also claims to be satoshi and he says Bitboy was working with him when the logo was created. He claims to have been involved in the creation of the first logos and then sent Bitboy instructions on how the modern orange Bitcoin logo should be created.He says trebuchet font was used as the font for the B and or the font for the dollar sign lines on the B. It seems I'm going down a rabbit hole now   bitcoin magazine posted an article saying he was involved in the creation of the logo https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-history-and-symbolism-behind-bitcoins-logo and he has his own medium article about the logo here http://vu.hn/bitcoin-symbol-and-logo-origin.html#the-symbol-workspace-with-images as well as his own website where he talks about how the logo was created http://vu.hn/bitcoin-symbol-and-logo-origin.html#the-symbol-workspace-with-images. On that website he also claims to be satoshi or more specifically part of a group that's called satoshi which created Bitcoin. It's really a bit much and I don't believe he's satoshi. But a lot of people are posting his info as a source on how the bitcoin logo was made so is there any verification Phil Wilson aka \"Scronty\" (his online username) created the Bitcoin logo or had any involvement in its creation?",

If he claims to be Satoshi, I think we can safely assume he is lying about other things as well.  I was previously unaware of another significant detail regarding the widely-used and well-known logo associated with Bitcoin (it is worth noting that there is no official Bitcoin logo). The BTC symbol in the orange circle commonly used today was proposed by bitboy. However, it was originally introduced by Satoshi in a thread discussing new icon/logo for Bitcoin wallet. bitboy's version of the logo come eight months later.Unfortunately, the original images are no longer available on the forum, but we can view the thread archive here: http://web.archive.org/web/20130524055823/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.0It is the same icon/logo that is shown on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#/media/File:Bitcoin.png",

Many similar fonts out there you can fund like Avenir Heavy, but it doesn't matter what font you use, because as far as I know, it's just a symbol to just easily remembered, and maybe to more loyalty. And, I am just curious, why do you ask this? are you want make a logo similar like bitcoin?. or for commercial?, because as far I know, bitcoin logo is trademark and protected by the Creative Commons license, but you can use it for free, commercial and personal use. https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/avenir-heavyhttps://www.zenbusiness.com/blog/bitcoin-logo/",

To find out a list of font that look like that on the bitcoin logo, you have to undo the modifications on the logo to just the letter \"B\", take a picture of the \"B\" you have modified with the application on your phone and search on the application.
