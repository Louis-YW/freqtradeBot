Don't you think that's how it happened? and that’s the thing that I'd like to tackle about this topic, Because it’s hard to win at gambling, now if you want to know why? Join the conversation here.  Honestly, I haven't seen a banker or a casino close; the bettor always loses; why is that? And when we win, how do we feel like that? Isn't it the joy we feel, and we still want to win more and more? And when we feel like this, it is called Greed. So, in other words, the real winner is the Banker and not the gambler, so even if you win 30 times and on the 31st you bet on all the results, you lose, which means it doesn't matter what you won 30 times.Now let's not prolong this conversation; what if one of your family (Father, Mother, Brother-Sister, or Wife) or relative (Uncle, Auntie) is addicted to gambling or becomes addicted? What do you do? Here is my answer as follows, - Don't feel guilty- Never ever blame yourself for their AddictionNow, I'd like to know your additional perception of this discussion; let us share our knowledge to grow more here, your opinion, advice, or suggestion is much appreciated.",

I think we have different ways to overcome that addiction and what I discover about myself is to change path from playing gambling to playing games (that doesn't use real money) and some casinos do have demo which works for me. After all, I am only seeking entertainment rather than aiming to win big that's why I think it works for me but just like what I have said we have different ways to avoid gambling one effective thing is talking to medical professionals.",

Of course, who doesn't want to win more? it's just human nature that we are greedy. So unless you don't control yourself, you might end up losing and then become addicted to it. So if you chance, you won some money already, don't stretch your luck, maybe it's better if you will exit and enjoy your winnings.",

I agree it is hard to win in gambling due to the non-stop attraction and pleasure that it gives to us.  We find it hard to stop when we are feeling good, entertained or happy because we wanted to experience that sensation again and again.Quote from: gunhell16 on June 13, 2022, 04:46:48 AM Honestly, I haven't seen a banker or a casino close; the bettor always loses; why is that?

Gambling should be fun, gambling companies are always making profit but gambling responsibly will be helpful for gamblers. Some people just play with low amount and not gambling often, even if they lose, they do not mind and they are not affected or emotional about it but just see it as nothing but another time to play and expecting either to win or lose. Anyone that bet, lose and is emotionally affected should cut his betting amount he is using to stake to avoid the negative impact of gambling.",

For different reasons, in the case of casinos, it is usually because they fail to attract customers. If they have customers and betting limits so that they don't break the bank, they are money-making machines. The thing about banks is that they operate like a legalised ponzi scheme.But I agree with the general idea that you are more likely to make money if you own a casino than if you are a gambler at that casino.",

Specifically concepts like Expected Value or House Edge. To gamble, with the exception of some skill games like poker, where you can make positive expected value moves, means inexorably losing money in the long run. People who don't understand this get hooked by having won a jackpot some times and look for that feeling again, but if you understand what's behind it, you see that the more you bet the closer your results will be to the expected value. That is, the more you bet the more losses you are going to have, regardless of the fact that you win a jackpot from time to time.",

Maybe some casinos close because they lose to gamblers who can get or hit the jackpot and get a lot of money. But it is very rare to see a casino experience this because a casino can still operate even though there are gamblers who can win a lot of money.Now, if one of our family members has an addiction, we must help them to overcome that addiction. But if they don't want to tell us, it will be difficult for us to help them. This requires some discussion between family members and the addicted person so they can find a solution on how to help him.",

Now on the probability side, the chances are always 50/50 and probably gets reduced depending on the settings of the bet you set e.g. in dice, and each chance is independent of the games before it so yes, the minimum chance is always 50% (to win and lose). Quote from: gunhell16 on June 13, 2022, 04:46:48 AM Honestly, I haven't seen a banker or a casino close; the bettor always loses; why is that? It's because they're doing a great job in running the casino. You may argue that house edge is a scam and it steals money from its users, but let's not be dumb, casinos exist to do exactly that. Otherwise, casinos probably wouldn't exist as a business. Casinos would only close down if the owners left it alone and didn't manage it properly or if they did some stupid sht that got them in trouble.",

The chances are you are missing the part of the day where Banker is losing because you are not playing at that moment but try to play non-stop 24hrs while you count the win/loss of banker then you will notice how the game is just changing hands from banker to bettor which almost results to tie or some minor discrepancy. Bettors main disadvantage against banker are only the limited funds and not the game itself. The game is fair and it's up to your luck if you will hit early your winning streak or not.",

Hi mate, you should consider the house edge of a casino. It is normal that in long terms, banker will always win. It isn't difficult to win a bet in gambling, the main difficult is to mantain your results without losing everything, I can ensure you that it is the most difficulty part. If a familiar of mine would be addicted, I'll keep him/her away from the gambling for a long time and will try to explain how to not be addicted and why games burn your life.",
