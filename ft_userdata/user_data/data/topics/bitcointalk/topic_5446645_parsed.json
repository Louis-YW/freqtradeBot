Please give me an advice.Trading is more profitable if you know what you are doing, that is just a trading pair and profit can't be guarantee by such fairing.If you want to be more profitable in trading, know what's work for you. I do trading against the pair of USDT and I can say that it didn't increase my chance of making profit because in trading, it will still depend on your strategy and analysis. Just trade what you have, if you have BTC then go pair it with altcoins but if you hold stablecoins, then that's a good option as well.",

If you are not from a country that is spending USD, possibly as a trader you will still convert your local fiat to USD on calculator in a way you will be able to know the amount you earn in local currency. Stable coins like USDT is better as the profit and loss are easily known and also realistic.But some traders can trade bitcoin if they are not certain of price fall and they convert from altcoin to bitcoin because bitcoin is less volatile than altcoins. Some people choose bitcoin during such time than altcoins. So they can go for bitcoin and also stable coins.",

Does it mean crypto/crypto pairs is only profitable during bullrun?First of all stable coin and Fiat isn't same, stable coin still a crypto but claims to have a value of fiat.Trading cryptocurrencies isn't profitable at all in the bull season, because more you hold the value will be increasing day by day then why we have to spend time and our profits to an exchange?Trading is profitable everyday and it depends on what are the strategies are we using for our trades, personally myself trade with stable pairs because I don't do much if technical analysis so prefer stable coin with BTC whereas some used to have extensive technical analysis over the crypto pair they are choosing so if the both goes in opposite direction and they manage to cash out at the right time then they can make huge margin over others.",

Please give me an advice.Before giving you a suggestion, I would like to ask you that which pair will be convenient for you to easily calculate profit and loss ETH/USD or ETH/BTC?I think your answer will be the same answer as mine and others answer and that is USD. So according to my opion  it will be best to use USD for trading not only just for ethereum it should be used in all cases. Because finding profit and loss is a big factor in trading, and it is often needed quickly so that's why it is always better to use stablecoins.",

It will take time and market is such high volatility it could change its course at anytime. Moreover, always consider one important factor here, understand which pair has best VOLUME. If you are trading then volume plays important role in executing your trade and giving you that buy or sell order. If no volume then you could end up with losses for sure due to that poor wait time.",

      "body": "Trading ETH/USD allows you to take advantage of the fluctuations in the price of Ethereum against the US dollar. This trading pair is useful if you are primarily interested in trading Ethereum against a fiat currency and if you want to avoid the volatility of Bitcoin. However, if the US dollar value is affected by market conditions or other factors, this can also have an impact on your trades.On the other hand, trading ETH/BTC involves trading Ethereum against Bitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency in the market. This trading pair is useful if you want to take advantage of Bitcoins volatility and its impact on other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. However, it is  important to keep in mind that Bitcoin price movements can be unpredictable and can also impact the value of ethereum. So the choice between trading ETH/USD or ETH/BTC will depend on your personal trading strategy and goals, as well as your risk tolerance and market knowledge.",

There's no concrete strategy on how you can trade these to optimize profits.
