  "content": "What happened:: I would like to warn out you gamblers and bettors from gamdom.com sportsbook unfair practice, I made first deposit 100$ there to check their website, unfortulatelly I lost that money on dice and combo bet, some days later I decided to play bigger on sportsbook, I made 2700$ depo in btc, I made 2 combo bets for ~615$ each, and unfortulatelly I lost them too, I have right now 1450$~BTC left in my wallet but what this sportsbook did is hilarious, after these all loses they limited my account to <1$ maxbet I can not place any bets anymore on their sportsbook. How I'm supposed to make my loses back if I'm getting limited to 0 after 3 lost combos? \\I understand that books limits users if they win too much, but I only lost there and they limited me to <1$ maxbet!Also to withdraw rest of my balance that is 1450$ I'm forced to do rollover in their casino, which I don't trust anymore, If they do scam pracctice with sportsbook whoever knows if their casino is not rigged too.

      "body": "Do you consider it a scam? I tried to check PM/Chat logs, and it seems you did not provide any chat logs. Did you try to contact their live support or email support, asking them why they limited your max bet to $1? Some casinos ask For KYC verification to increase the bet limit. It would be best if you tried to contact them and ask what the reason for this limitation is. If they ask you to verify your KYC, You may want to verify since you are a player of their casino. They might have a good reason to limit your max bet. Did they restrict your max bet on sportsbooks only? Or did they limit the bet limit for in-house games and other 3rd party games, too? If they limited your max bet to the sportsbook only, You can still play other games and roll over your deposit if you don't want to play on their casino anymore. Before going through all of this, You should contact their support to ask why this limitation is. You are accusing them of scam. I don't think it's a scam. This is just a miss communication between the player and the casino. However, when a casino limits a player's max bet, they should notify the player why they limited a player's max bet.",

      "body": "Maybe scam is too offensive but for sure it is unfair pracctice of a sportsbook, they allowed me to make deposit, place bets and instantly restrict which is unfair because I wouldn't call betting on 1.28-3.08x combos abuse of any kindI've contacted support what was the reason of this limation,\"Nana (06:11:28): This is their response \"The client has been assigned the status of a cheater, betting on errors that occur in the line.\"\"However this reason is not clear for me, there was no intention of error abuse or any of that. I bet 1 triple combo and 2 double combos before the limited me, all bets were placed pre-match and none of them were any kind of abuse their software like unfair odds/late bets etc. What if these combos would be won? they would refund it for same reason? both cases lead to one, only accepting and not paying out.I did not think about asking them if kyc would help with increasing limits, as every casino claims it is the odds provider decision. however if there would be a possibility I would like to do that.",

However, it is surprising that they have limited your account even though you are losing there. I haven't seen such complaint from anyone against any sportsbook before. Is any other sportsbook using same odds provider of Gamdom where you have played before?BTW, the rollover requirement is 1Ã— before you can withdraw your remaining funds. It will cost around $15 to wager $1500 if you use wagering strategy on dice game.",

      "body": "You probably got limited on the certain sports you are trying to bet. Maybe they don't like the type of bets you placed? If I understand correctly, the provider limits your account, not Gamdom which means they have your fingerprint from all sites you have visited and are limiting you based off of not only bets on Gamdom but elsewhere as well. I might be wrong here, but that's how I understand it. I have won or lost multiple NBA bets over the last month without ever seeing any limits on my account. What sport are you betting?",
