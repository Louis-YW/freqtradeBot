      "body": "To begin with, I can say that your project is not something new or unique, so you will have to invest a lot of time, knowledge and money to make it stand out from other similar projects. I read the part where you write about cryptocurrencies in general and I can say that I do not agree with some statements or that they are somewhat confusing.QuoteFiat currencies are being printed at will, and cryptocurrencies have a capped (limited) supply.It's true that Bitcoin and some altcoins have a max supply, but some popular alts don't have it or at the moment that amount is still undefined. One of perhaps the most famous alts that recently moved to POS also does not have a clearly defined max supply, which in my opinion does not make it much different from fiat that is printed as needed.QuoteThere have been huge cryptocurrency scams in the past, especially when they were still very young. The expert cryptocurrency developers are learning every single day from these happenings, and will develop them in such a way that it becomes absolutely impossible to rig them.When you talk about scams, it would be good to distinguish those that result from poorly designed projects that enable their owners to carry out some scam to the detriment of their investors, from those that have nothing to do with it but are the result of ordinary people who take advantage of the greed and naivety of other people with the goal to make a financial profit at the expense of all these people. If we look at the past, one of the most dramatic events was the hacking of Mt.Gox, but also a few months ago we had a huge scam with the Korean so-called stablecoin and the US crypto exchange.In my opinion, it's hard to give useful financial advice if you don't understand some fairly basic things, but every beginning is difficult and no one is born smart, so don't get discouraged, but try to be better in the future.",

      "body": "Hey Lucius thanks a lot for your reply and feedback!You are right about that, and I will slightly change the text about cryptocurrencies having a limited supply. This is indeed not always the case.I want to make my website as unique as possible by writing about a wide variety of subjects, instead of just cryptocurrencies for example. Although cryptocurrencies are my favorite subject and what I have invested in the most.I'm going to learn more about margin trading and futures contracts, as I'm not so experienced in these fields yet.I will keep writing regularly and I'm absolutely sure that this website will be successful in the future.",

I have 7 years experience in the cryptocurrency markets and have both made and lost a lot of money myself.One thing that I promise is that I do not write about something which I have not personally tested myself. My intention is never to make money on the cost of someone else, so to say. If I recommend someone to buy something, I am almost sure that the reader will make money on it.The current cryptocurrency prices are really good for example, so anyone buying at this point and holding on to their investment for a long time, will definitely make a lot of money at this point.Any feedback is always welcome, you can reach me in multiple ways, also on social media.",

That's just my concern. @OP, Cantsay has a strong point here, for a project like yours that's just developing and which to standout in the big market competition out there you need to have a standard that your users knows you for,  that stands you out among  your contemporaries for you to gain the kind of audience you need to be among the big boys in the industry.Reasons why many persons lose interest in projects like this is because previous ones has misguided them with  wrong investment informations  that brought them to scratch. And hardly would  anyone  just jump in to take into consideration an article from a just developed site that have no track record yet. So OP bear in mind you still have a long way to go",

Design a website with a more attractive theme, you can take a look at the themes on the following website and it's free https://colorlib.com/wp/cat/education/2. It's a good idea to put a pop up disclaimer on your website so that when something goes wrong, people won't blame you for wrong information or the website you recommended is suddenly a scam.",

You have a fantastic website layout, and I hope you continue to improve it over time to make it more appealing. An attractive and user-friendly website distinguishes it and entices visitors to return more frequently. I reviewed the Types of Investment you provided with their detailed explanations, and I must say that it is a job well done by you. Also, include a disclaimer on those investments so that people are aware of the risks involved in investing there.Quote from: Skills to Mills on January 16, 2023, 09:26:21 PMThanks for this reply I will start working on a new theme once I find a better one.

If you take this into account, you won't have any problems with a later effect that will occur in an investment update you posted.",

You already have a clear design, further serious improvement is just a waste of your time (I know that feeling very well). Better focus on the content. For now, I only see some generic content and nothing that would leave the impression that I learned something new.due to the beautiful appearance of the site, I will certainly not return to that page again, but if I find useful information, there is already a possibility to put the site in the bookmark.Isn't this forum the best example, which has a rather outdated design, but we all come back because of the content and potential that we can find here?",

Having said that, which he claimed not to be a part of such practice. I'd say that Op should work with high DA sites on the cryptocurrency niche for guest posts and building back links. It's a long process, but it'll pay off on the long run considering the number of cryptocurrency blogs that shuts down on daily basis. Staying in the market, OP, is your greatest weapon, and even if you don't want to run the site again, it can be sold for a good amount. In addition, I love the simplicity and the speed of the webpages they are good and it'll help readers to stay longer on your site which will help the ranking of the pages.
