You are giving 1k profit which can be a good amount. But the person who will trade should be considered as a big problem if the payment is taken from Binance pay and another payment gateway except payment from a non-custody account.",

Or are you accepting and empty wallet without funds but has transaction for year? Maybe I could reach out to friends if only you are trusted and reliable.",

Hope there will be stupid people who are willing to share privatekeys that contains a lot of balance in it.Not to take sides with either the OP or potential clients, but the OP daringly takes the plunge to front the payment for users who boast a commendable reputation. It's a rather equitable approach, even though a few aspects warrant a second thought before we entrust our wallet to others.Quote from: daniel_james_david on August 15, 2023, 08:13:55 AMWill go first if you are trustedHowever, the unfortunate aspect here is that the OP doesn't furnish a definite proposition concerning the margin awaiting the previous wallet owner. Whether it's rooted in a fixed percentage or pivots on the OP's whim remains undisclosed. For instance, shelling out 10k to receive 11k translates to a 10% margin for the original wallet possessor. But what if the wallet merely houses a modest sum of USD $10? Would it merely culminate in a modest gain of USD $11, or could the outcome potentially exceed that sum?",

But in this case, it will be full of problems as I think OP will take money back after a successful transaction or OP will send hacked funds or will take reverse the payment. So, if you have 10k$ all will be the profit of the OP.",

There are a lot of cases in the forum that the person was trusted but scammed at a time. The amount can very from person to person. Maximum people has a trust level only few might be exception.",
