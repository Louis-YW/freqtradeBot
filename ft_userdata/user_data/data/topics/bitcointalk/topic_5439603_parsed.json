      "body": "Great description, but I have a question. How is the withdrawal or conversion of the Black Money (BM) token to fiat implemented?Without the possibility of interacting with fiat, for the majority, such a system does not make sense, because. you can use quite standard tools available on the market. For example, crypto wallets, which are already enough on the market. I will not list - so as not to create \"unlawful advertising\" But in principle, such wallets already have everything that you have listed, plus there is multicurrency.Accordingly, the question arises - what is the competitive advantage of this system against the background of advanced crypto wallets?",

The question was about getting the money out of your ecosystem, and, more exactly, into fiat world. And you didn't answer that.So, withdrawal to actual fiat out of your system: is it possible and maybe also how?",

I wish you great happiness, health and well-being!!Good afternoon ! Thanks for the reply and congratulations And another question - if there is no connection with the fiat currency - what ensures the value of this token? What forms its cost and provision? Equivalent in bitcoin / ethereum? The thing is that the value of a payment token must be secured with something, have some kind of price \"synonym\", or security. As before, for example, bank notes were provided, for example, with a gold reserve. What is the \"gold collateral\" for the Black Money token here?",

Its not a new token at all. It is just an alias for american dollars, and 1 BM always will be 100$. Why not using, like, USDT? To not to confuse some user about what exactly we are doing.

Now the picture is much clearer!In summary: is it possible to say that your platform is a kind of implementation of a cryptomixer, based on its stable coin, with advanced functionality, for daily financial transactions? I have such a vision about the product after your clarifications. That's right ? Or have I not learned something yet?But even in this version, it becomes a more attractive solution than the primary description Then a couple more questions:1. Mixing takes place by the classical method - \"we put it in one tank, we take it from another independent tank filled with other users\" or some other technology?2. What is the real financial pledge of the token - some kind of fund?",
