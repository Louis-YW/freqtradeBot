I think that is a more suitable board for you to recruit individuals for their services, and also try to offer generous or decent payment so you may attract more valuable team than just BS member that will not contribute better for your plans .",

And it's also nicer if you're going to include the details how much you're going to pay and what altcoins you prefer to.",
