If hypothetically all the big holders linked up and decided to dump, that would have a massive influence on the price negatively, but would not destroy bitcoin. The market would recover and we would have more diversification in ownership.- Jay -",

New humpbacks and whales will appear within some minutes, days, or weeks.",

There are about 19,000,000 BTC in circulation and by calculation humpback and whales wallets constitute about 10% of the circulating supply. If they decide to sell at the same time which is not possible, this would only fuel panic and cause a big dump or steep in the market price of Bitcoin, which would also give other investors the opportunity to buy and hodl but it cannot destroy Bitcoin.",

They are aware that their current position holds significant sway over the market if they were to make simultaneous moves. This would undoubtedly cause the market to shift significantly. The Bitcoin market may dip, but only for a limited period. Prices will recover as the public's demand for Bitcoin increases. These individuals will realize a new fact - that the number of 'Whales' has decreased and they will begin to boost their confidence by purchasing Bitcoin again when prices fall significantly.I refrain from calling it a \"collapse\" as the demand for the Bitcoin market is still sufficiently high, and it seems to continue to increase every year.",

The Bitcoin market may dip, but only for a limited period.It depends on when they accumulate their holdings. Majority of this humpback or whales holder are from old Bitcoin holder that accumulate their holdings when Bitcoin price is a dollar more or less. The wallet became dormant which is why they manage to hold for a long time. This people just get that title by simply forgetting or lost access of their wallet, they can’t be considered as person with financial knowledge.I believe those institutional investors are worthy for these claim but there’s no certainty that they will holding until the end. They can collapse the market when they have a chance to secure profit due to limited liquidity on Bitcoin.",

Even if the holders could dump up to 30 percent of total supply of bitcoin it will not destroy the market rather will cause panic to the Shrimps holders and would results in dropping in percentage. But naturally i don't think if there is a wallet that holds about 30 percent of total supply so bitcoin can't be destroyed so easily. Instead those who missed the opportunity buy and hold would utilized that chance and buy more so the market could quickly gets stabilized again. Have this in mind, there are people who are just wishing for price to dump so that they will correct their mistake and accumulate more volume of bitcoin.",

They can destroy the market if they want. A few days ago, I saw a post in the WO thread and it make me think about it. I found this extremely relatable. Allow me to quote the post I am referring to;Quote from: darkangel11 on April 26, 2023, 08:01:48 PMFunny how we have over 19m circulating supply in Bitcoin, but it takes just 1k to move the spot price up or down by 10%. I'm always amazed by how easy it is to make temporary fake pumps and dumps, the good old bart simpson patterns.We have over 19 Million circulated coins, still looking at the market. Simply 1000 Bitcoin Buy/Sell can move the market by 10%. Isn't it amazing? If a simple 1000 sale can down Bitcoin 10%, a single whale can give you a bear market for quite some time. Forget about other whales and Humpbacks. I kinda believe it's possible to destroy the market. But, eventually, Bitcoin will come back over time.",

With an average ov < 0.04 it would make sense to check for 0.1 to 1.0 and 0.01 to 0.1 and below 0.01 addresses, too.I see it's taken from Binance - wonder why they created these very arbitrary categories.",

It is based on past data from https://hodl.camp/This is something I believe in as well but too many people keep saying \"that was true in the past, you wouldn't know if it will be true for the future\". As in they think that it was a good idea to do that back in the day, but if you want to do it now then it will not be doing that great, it will suck and the result will not be the same. I disagree, I think it was a thing that happens to be in the nature of bitcoin and as long as you hold for 5+ years, no matter when you buy, today, tomorrow, yesterday, none of that matters if you buy and hold for that long then you will make a profit.This is why it is important to make a distinction and just focus on making profit and I believe that I will keep holding even longer than that, probably over a decade at least.",
