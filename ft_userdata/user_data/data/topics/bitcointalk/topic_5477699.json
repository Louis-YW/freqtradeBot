Tagging and reporting anyone new who appears here to advertise that website is the only thing to do for now.  Really, scammers have created a phishing site under the name Wallet Guard, perhaps aware that this extension is indeed excellent in protecting cryptocurrencies. They attempt to deceive people who may make mistakes and fall for the wrong domain. However, the official domain has existed for a year and 208 days, unlike the phishing domain, which is not even 10 days old. Through some quick research, anyone can easily avoid such phishing sites, even if this scammer creates another alternative account in the forum or brings a new domain. I will now report and file a complaint to the domain registrar PSI-USA through this [link], and I hope that their domain registrar team responds as quickly as possible. This domain poses a threat and could appear in search engines if not taken down promptly. Thank you, julerz12, for this warning thread.",

I am surprised why wallet services do not purchase most of the domains and redirect users to one domain or choose a name so that all domains can be purchased from it. their reliance on domains such as .app and ignoring .com makes the task of scammers easier.Quote from: Pmalek on December 13, 2023, 05:00:46 PMThe other positive news is that the fake site doesn't have a high rank on Google to possess a real threat to those searching by the main keyword.

It's not as easy as it sounds. Most quality domain names are already taken. Some of them are for sale and some aren't. You would be really lucky if you found a domain name that isn't expensive and is available for all the popular domain extensions so that you could purchase them all. It would help for your SEO and to avoid phishing scams, like the one in OP. But a startup or non-for-profit could consider that an expensive purchase.",

This why scammers are doing risk of domain, hosting and site burden because they know that there are still people who are lazy to research for real project.
