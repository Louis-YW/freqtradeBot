If you do not believe in this coin, then you should not mine it. The advantage of the algorithm is that it has a good hashrate on old video cards.",

In this post, we’ll explain why Iron Fish, as a USA-based project, is obliged to enforce KYC for airdrops.Because of regulatory uncertainty around US securities laws, we are unable to send tokens to US citizens. We understand the concerns of US users and regret that this is the case.As we’ve already indicated, we will hold the tokens of US users who complete KYC. If the regulatory requirements change and we receive legal clearance to send, we will revisit completing the airdrop. We are not at all guaranteeing this will happen.https://ironfish.network/blog/2023/04/06/why-kyc?",
