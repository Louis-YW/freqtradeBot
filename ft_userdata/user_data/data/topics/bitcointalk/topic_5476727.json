  "content": "Hello there,I have a set of silver physical viacoins done by NattyMind back in 2019. The set was limited to 100 units, mine being number 59. There are 3 coins in the set. The first contains 25 VIA, the second 50, and the third 100.All coins are still loaded and have the certificate with them. The last auction on here a set went for .01 BTC I believe back in October of 2022.I also have a test print Viacoin also done by NattyMind I'm looking to sell as well. It's loaded with 100 VIA and was the first of the 10 test prints NattyMind auctioned off.The last auction on here for test prints 3 were auctioned off two going for .012 and one of the three fetched .014 I believe back in September 2022.Obviously the price of Bitcoin was a lot less around that time but that's just an idea of what these guys go for.Also I didn't include in the header I have 6 or so test print polymerbit via notes still in the sleeve they came in with the packaging. I think they might have been the first viacoin test prints that polymerbit did but I'm not 100% sure. Was a long time ago I acquired them. The outer packaging is a bit rough since they've been sitting out in the open for quite a few years now but the notes themselves have never even come out of the sleeve that they're in.If there's interest I'll probably do an auction for the items or just sell them individually to whoever is interested.Thanks for looking.",

Or buy a copper membership.It's funny, cuz back in 2018 before LN, VIA was used here and on the former Collectibles Slack channel back in the days of Zepher. It was the only way to avoid the high btc fees (like now lol) at the time ,and worked well/quickly.That's the backstory there I guess. Even Polymerbit made VIA notes as well. The lone via Dev back then \"Roman\" (Not sure if he's still dev, havne't checked) seemed to be very honest and hard-working and many supported his efforts.I imagine the 10x rise is just that everything basically got a rise the past couple weeks as altcoin season seems to be starting to bloom early.  I have 3 of these graded coins as well. The other thing is that the 100 VIA coin has hologram deterioration issues. Even mine which is slabbed (Kinda afraid to check it again TBH). Anyhow, good luck with the sale. they are nice coins overall!",

Or buy a copper membership.Viacoin to my knowledge is an abandoned project. I'm surprised that it did a 10x recently.I used to be incredibly bullish on the coin years ago which is why I purchased the physical coins to begin with. They are gorgeous, but definitely a niche.",
