I seems you are mixing the concept of riches and success. Although these two concepts means different things to diverse person, but personally I think acquiring enormous money doesn't mean that someone is successful. This is the problem of our society currently because people see rich people as successful. There are people that are very successful but they are not rich, also many rich people are not successful. Richness is acquiring money which even a criminal can get. But success means for me is attaining a height of fulfilment after achieving a goal that makes not only you happy but other people around you. This means that are successful person always accomplish a task that affects him and his environment positively.I have also observed by experience that although rich people sometimes portray similar character or trait, there are no universally accepted behavior or habit that would make you rich. The truth is anybody can be rich but the main problem might be the ability to sustain the money.",

That is specially correct if we keep in mind there are people who inherit some money during their lives, even thought we are not talking about fortunes, in an important percentage of occasions the first thing that comes to mind is spending and \"wasting\" the money one received. So everyone can receive money, but the management is what can turn 1000$ into 10000$ or 10000$ into 0. It seems also OP does not fully consider there are rich people who reached their status through deplorable means.",

Sometimes many people try, try a lot but never succeed, while many people don't put in too much effort and easily achieve success. There is no specific formula for success because everyone has different ways of being successful. To be honest, I don't want to follow or imitate any successful person because I believe that everyone's life is different, and cannot use a common formula. The best way is to keep trying and always get up after every fall, we will find success our way.",

Success is a mistery, therefore there isn't a perfect recipe to follow with the assurance you will reach there. What plays a big role in successful stories is to be on the right place at the right time, and that is something we can't control or predict.I believe we just have to do our part, putting good will and effort on everything we plan and execute, with the hope we will be rewarded later for our merits.And always aware that not every single person who is successful in life have achieved it honorably and rightfully. These people are dangerous, because they serve as mirrors for weak minds to follow a dark path aiming to reach the same status futurely, but then there is no merit on it after all.",
