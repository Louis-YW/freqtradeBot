Just today I was watching a YouTube video and I stumbled this information that opened my eyes to the mistakes I've been making all along and from my observation, alot of members here have been making same mistake too by using the words Bitcoin and bitcoin interchangeably. These two words mean totally different things.Bitcoin (beginning with a capital letter) is the network or the software itself that runs the system.bitcoin (beginning with a small letter) or BTC on the other hand refers to the decentralized digital currency. I believe this information will be useful to a lot of people, I am also open to corrections if I am wrong on this.",

If you aspire to be knowledgeable in this space it takes time and dedication & you have to constantly be learning and keeping up with the latest trends and events in the space. Its honestly sort of comparable to a never ending staircase heading all the way into the vastness of space!",

I don't really see how it can be confusing except you want to use it in a sentence or something but then again, it won't cause a glitch on the network if the letters are used interchangeably, right?Â  ..just kidding!

I don't think that the added confusion is ever going to help you out in your situation because at the end of the day, you're probably still talking about bitcoin as a whole, and if you're talking about the network, why not just add the network after the word bitcoin and then your audience would know that you're talking about bitcoin network? How's that more confusing than capitalizing the letter \"B\" to denote the difference?",

Bitcoin, beginning with the capital letter Bitcoin, is primarily used in blockchain technology. By bitcoin starting with small letter we basically mean our popular currency bitcoin. However, this is not commonly followed and bitcoin has been used interchangeably with both terms.",

      "body": "Thanks for the insight, but I don't think it really makes a difference to Bitcoin users whether a word starts with a lowercase letter or a capital letter. Such differences may be of interest to academics but make no difference to ordinary users.Most people are looking to invest in Bitcoin and are interested in the price falling or rising, as well as the falling or rising fees, but I think there are very few of them who are interested in knowing the difference between the word Bitcoin that begins with a capital letter and the one that begins with a lowercase letter.Most important of all, in my opinion, is teaching people how to use Bitcoin wallets and how to keep their private keys secure.",

Yes, there is a difference when it comes to the capitalization of the letter, but to the essence or meaning, it's all the same. I don't know why people or users here are creating a topic that doesn't make any sense at all, but anyway, it is your opinion or topic, but for me, it doesn't have a different meaning. Bitcoin is bitcoin; it has the same meaning. If you are the only one giving a different meaning to it, at least you have shown evidence or a link that states what you are talking about. In that way, people will not contest or contradict your statement. You should keep that in mind in your future topics or comments.",

The only thing about this post is that it has existed and yet, there are many people that have never read it that have read it now. I have also seen people that are thanking me for the insight so it is time to lock the thread so, what is senseless about it?I have just gone through your post history and I have observed that majority of what you have to contribute is to attack people and downgrade their efforts in trying to make contributions in the forum. At my level as a newbie, I believe I am trying in making contributions in the forum and I wouldn't want any bad blood like you to talk less of my efforts. Go and sit yourself down.",
