But some people who are not as young as they used to be might harder time to understand what this is all about and might not even be a little interested in crypto.So it’s important still to consider demographics and how likely they are to be interested in bitcoin.

And this social media would be very helpful to that. But that will only happen if rural areas will also have an access to internet, thus having a consistent internet connection is crucial. If it won’t happen, then I should say that bitcoin promotion might not be possible with people living far from the city.",

Many of these areas are not updated with the modern technology that we're having so expect that they have never heard BTC.IMO, there's no need for you to do something with that. But if you're persistent with that then try to start talking with the people in that neighborhood and just try to ask them if they have heard BTC or not yet. With small talks, you're giving them the idea and background of what BTC is and also, you're also having some good talks with the locals there.",

If I can successfully convince one person to invest in Bitcoin and then you on your part can successfully convince another person and then those people, we convince go ahead to convince others before we know everyone around us must have heard about Bitcoins. There is limitation to talking to people about Bitcoin which is that in some countries it is very illegal, and you can put it yourself in a direct risk to even be discussing about bitcoin due to laws and policies.

What is more complicate for many people is actually accessing bitcoin because you need to be a little tech savvy, maybe even more than a little, and be able to properly store your funds. At the same time you must avoid scams.

As time goes on even without people advertising or creating awareness through any of the known means bitcoin will keep prevailing as it is the father of all other cryptocurrencies that are busy shaking the internet for fame as they keep struggling so bitcoin is reaching the remote areas too. Infact in technological advancement it takes just some years before the world advances into it. So I believe in a few times/years coming bitcoin knowledge will reach every part of the world.

From the example you shared about yourself, I will assume that you are a digital literate, meaning you know how to use the internet, also know how to read on your own and probably carry your own personal research. But you and I know very well that not everyone can do this due to several reasons (most especially the inability to read and write). We also both know that Bitcoin is not something that anyone can jump into, which proves that there is a need of learning it's concepts.As popular as mobile devices, it would be very shocking to also know that not everyone still have access to it. There are several things that are available around us, but are uncommon to others due to high level of poverty and other factors. Adoption of Bitcoin would definitely spread wide, but I don't think everyone (over 8.5billion people) would hear about it or even key into it. Just my opinion.",

I know we all also feel the fear, as we know from the start that bitcoin has a risk of losing money, and of course, who will not be cautious about that? But every loss or mistake is part of the development. I mean, if you don't have the will and the mindset to handle the risk and losses, then you don't deserve the rewards that may come. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are not for everyone; it takes a lot of courage and strong will to be able to navigate well in bitcoin or any crypto currency. So every newbies should be able to know and measure risk that they can take they should be strategic and wary of what they can risk and how much they can risk.",
