That’s why ultra-successful founders join Crypto Insider. Get the information, support community, and guidance you need from experts like Tony Drummond who pushed his project past $200MM.Our Concept:Enable high-ticket consulting for an affordable price through a membership model. Members get >$17,000 of value for $450 per month.Who Are We?We are multiple founders of projects that reached a market cap of $200 million and attracted 70,000 owners within three weeks. After starting a consulting company to help founders achieve the same success, we noticed a big gap:Often founders can't afford a >$350 consultant, so they have their tokenomics created by a marketing agency or a few consultants who have never had their projects. BIG MISTAKE. Even the slightest mistake in creating tokenomics can cost the whole project or at least drastically reduce the chances of success. But tokenomics are not the only problem: the entire marketing setup, fundraising process, and all other issues often need to be corrected. We've seen founders with great ideas squander all their potential by choosing the wrong tactics and strategies.What Are We Doing Differently?:We are ultra-successful founders from all areas (especially GameFi) and, therefore, can consult founders much better than all those „self-claimed “ experts.USECASES:Setup your tokenomics the right way - Let advisors who drove 9-figure growth with their project help you create the perfect tokenomicsRaise funds faster. Let people who drove 9-figure growth with their project help you create the perfect investor pitch and use our database to target thousands of VCs and Angels._______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________Gain insider knowledge.
