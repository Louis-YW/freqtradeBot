See this tweet from the official Circle account: https://twitter.com/circle/status/1634391505988206592.Based on monthly the latest Jan 2023 attestation, Silvergate is one of another bank who Circle held the reserves. As we know, besides SVB which goes bust, Silvergate the bank is also closing down its business, but it will come with full repayments of the deposit.Contratry to UST, I don't think it will have the same effect, the market got swayed down is certain, but the degree if USDC going collapses will be much significantly deeper, note that DAI is also affected.",

Probably because of many issues with their other investments and the current movement of the whales, don't panic because USDC can survive this since there's no major issue against them aside from the liquidation news and as you can see its value started to recover after dropping that much. If I have funds right now, I will always take risk to buy USDC at such price, this is temporary and they can solve this one because we can't afford another stablecoin to ended up like UST.",
