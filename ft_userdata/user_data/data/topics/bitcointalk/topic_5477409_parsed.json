      "body": "Yes, at least I agree with you @OP. By limiting gambling time and money, we can also limit ourselves so we don't gamble excessively. We have to do that and stay within the limits so as not to experience gambling addiction. After all, we never know when gambling addiction will come.We can only prevent it by trying to limit gambling games. But we also don't need to force ourselves to gamble every week, especially if we have a lot of activities. We can adapt to all these activities.We gamble only when we have free time and if we don't have it, we don't need to gamble. You can use an alarm to remind you how long you have been gambling. That way, you will know when to stop. This requires strong discipline and you have to try.",

I would rather talk about using that time to do something more productive. I mean if you're spending a lot of time on fun and leisure like gambling then you're basically not doing much. Someone who is busy earning money and building wealth probably do not have time to gamble at all so I can agree that spending less time is better.",

I predict the result to be the similar. Mathematically is should be the same. If we dont look at money and betting, that this short sessions worsen situation, as instead of gambling once, you do it 3 times. Gambling becomes more like a habit, that will increase chances of addiction. Such short sessions might be bad, as a gambler might feel that he did not have enough; not satisfied.",

      "body": "Both? I agree especially for those who already won. Stop it, claim your profits, and start enjoying it. Play the next day or the next week and be sure to benefit from the profits through different means. Not gambling again. I disagree because there are times when casino games do give big amounts in the long term. I've seen it. I played Plinko for a long time and I've seen my balance grow 10x in 3 days. There are some rests of course and I turn off my PC to let it cool down too. Oh, an example of the 10x profit is like this. $10 became $100 while I was just betting $0.01. So yes, it will take some time to make it grow like that.So this kind of question depends on each player. If a gambler has the time to just run the game without ruining his other jobs or works then I think it's good. And there's an automatic bet feature so we don't have to worry about addiction. We don't need to watch it the whole day. Now, if once in a while they will check and make profits that are pleasing to them, withdrawal should be next. There must be a target amount.",

Maybe just create some discipline while gambling since we can still in good shape even if we bet for long time but try always to bet the smallest figures that we can afford to lose since from that we can extend our gaming time and also can get less capital loss. Its just people always have misconception about everything in gambling and they always want fast profit that's why they easily lose huge amount of money. If they avoid to bet huge amount then provably they can avoid regret each decision they made while betting their allocated budget for gambling.",

I'm not sure what the OP is trying to emphasize but this is not the reason why gamblers got into addiction. They have fallen into such situations because of their mindset and gambling intention as most of us think that they will become rich in gambling and spend more money. Addiction comes because we want it to happen, if we just control ourselves and enjoy our time gambling, that never exists.",

There should be proper time and money management when it comes to gambling. Setting limits is a wise strategy and can help maintain control and prevent excessive losses. We know that the longer you play, the higher the chance of losing money. It's true, everyone has probably experienced that—having a winning streak in a short period while playing, and because you wanted to play more to increase your winnings, the opposite happens, and you end up losing your entire balance.",

There is no guarantee that the shorter timing you use will lower your losing rate,  because even you first game can be a lose,  and your last games may become consistent winning,  I am not saying that it advisable to spend more time on bets to be able to win,  but what I am saying is that,  in as much as you spend short time to lower your risk of losing so also you can also increase your gambling time to taste the winning at some point and that how it goes. Maintaining a bankroll will definitely lower your risk ratio in ultimately help you to operate within a limit of financial commitment and that will ultimately save your ass from spending all your reserve balance. QuoteNo matter what time you soent,  the ultimate thing to do is to always bet according to what you can afford to handle at all time and still be in the best position to make effortless gambling in next time,  because most of the gamblers tend to John mggmgn accept Just like the first comment also point out,  if you are gambling for fun,  then you need to use an amount as low as $0.05 which is a good low amount that can give you a long period of game session to keep playing with a lower bankroll. So for a gambler,  you have to first of all decide what you want is it fun or wagering to make money,  each will present you with their peculiar risk and demands and you have to align yourself to them accordingly. QuoteBut that is when you gambling for the fun of it,  bit those gambling for the money won't apply such technique but they will rather stake big amount and risk everything just to hit the jacjFor them it's about your addiction, and that's what brings in more money, and I am here to announce to you that time fixation is also a good way in gambling, spending 20 minutes in casino a day is better than someone who spend 1 hour.Yeah for those chasing the winning,  it all about the money and they can stake any amount of money just to accumulate huge total winning, just like one of the celebrities in my country who staked almost 5 million of our local currency on a 1.5 ods but yet still lost so it is what it is,  the higher the amount the higher your chances of losing so chasing the money comes with bigger risks. Quote1. Have an amount limit you can risk on gambling every week. 2. Choose your favourite day in a week for gambling. 3. Have a time countdown when gambling, to avoid spending too much time.Go back home or close your laptop once your time is up, and wait for the coming day, go back to your daily life and business, chase your goals using your business and invest more money on assets. Do you agree or disagree? Drop your reason why.  These are all the fundamental principles for staying safe in gambling,  by trying to apply all the necessary measures to place your gambling activities under control at all times regardless of the direction you may be heading at any time.",
