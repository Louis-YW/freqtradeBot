You saying many good things that makes alot of sense. *You cannot give what you do not have!  - This is true, people tend focus on things they don't have or can reach and it's just waste of time.* I believe you gotta focus on yourself & spend more time bettering yourself, than focusing on your idols - 100% You need to focus on yourself and see what works for you and believe in yourself and your own results.*be good at what you do, be valuable! So money can gravitate to you other than chasing money. - Also very good, focus on what's your good at and do it with 100% effort and something good will come out from that.Good idea's mate, appreciate this.",

Gain knowledge and self-confidence, that will be your weapon when you are being pulled sometimes by your old self. And for changes to take place, be ready to face new challenges that will help you become firm and would not be easily ruined or broken.And most importantly, be who you are. You don't need to imitate others to see some changes, but improve yourself and be a better version of you. Once you achieved that, it will be more satisfying that what you aimed and goal has already become reachable for you.",

There's no way that you could really be able to make yourself that stagnant if you are really just that mindful in speaking progress or whatsoever things correlated to it.it would really be just that a normal step that someone needs to take if you are really that minding about those things which it is really just that right that you would be doing things for better version of you than on yesterday. We are all striving to become better and having those skills and progress on things that we are dealing with.Everything would really be pertaining on how we do able to make some income source or in speaking in correlation with money making topics.",

Becasue that's the fact that Help & Beginner section is the most merited section due to higher activity. Getting merits in the trading section is rare, especially for the newbies.Haha secondly seems like Op is inspired by the motivation Ai voiced Instagram reel, guiding people for the rules of power and having power rules haha, because I've encounter 80% of the OP's points in those reels, it means that Instagram is not complete shit haha.",

The person who are ready to live their life in the discipline manner had more chance of success in the real life.So it applicable one to the trading,the negative things should be avoided in the way that to success in the trading carrier.The trader may need of funds often for their expenses like enjoying their life with their friends.But if they avoid of that expenses,it may help them to make more money in the trading of crypto currency mainly in the bitcoin trading.The regular enjoyment should be skipped to keep the money safe in your wallet.Quote from: batang_bitcoin on December 20, 2023, 08:54:39 PMThe tips are not actually for trading but it is, in general, our lives to become better.

Is it to get an information about them, and easily defeat them in some kind of match? But, they can also do the same thing to us. Agree on you that it's still better to be unique but in his 1st and 2nd items, I believe he is saying the same thing? Then he shouldn't gave the other advices that he lists there .I think it's normal that some or most won't give you a clear/proper guide on what they are currently discussing because it's already what you called as spoon-feeding. And for it, it may not be free anymore, if in case they are also preparing a guide for it.",
