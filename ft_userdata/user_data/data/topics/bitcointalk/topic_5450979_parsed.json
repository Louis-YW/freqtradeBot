If anyone get access to your finger print or device password, or the password of the email used, the person will be able know the the passwords. There are also some malware that are capable to steal password from your device. Anything online is not safe. See what happened to LastPass, how online password managers are not safe at all.",

      "body": "Password manager extensions are very risky and it seriously frowned upon because they are very vulnerable to attacks and someone who can get access to your computer can just easily click auto refill which will display your password saved. As for applications for password management they could also be hacked thereby exposing your password. Even those non financial sites you save there passwords I think it is also a bad idea because someone could actually detect your other passwords guessing from those saved online. Most at times once two or more password is known they others can be found out",

      "body": "Does it even require an external extension, while this is also almost a built-in feature of browser apps?The obvious risk is when someone else is able to access your device because you're used to sharing devices or it is stolen. I'm not too familiar with subtle attacks on extensions, but I'm sure they also have security holes sometimes.You're certainly right that this feature is discouraged for saving login data to wealth accounts and even don't use it at all.",

Choose only reliable open-source solutions such as Bitwarden password manager or KeePassXC because they are approved by the community and are actively supported and maintained by core developers and contributors. With these password managers, you can generate cryptographically secure passwords and passphrases, and store your logins and other credentials in an encrypted form so that no one besides you can access them. Unlike browser in-built password storage, password manager usually offers strong encryption for all your information, which is why malware potentially sitting in your computer can't access it without a decryption key. Of course, it is not recommended to store sensitive financial information online in a cloud, even in an encrypted one, but it is the most convenient and secure way to interact with your passwords for most other use cases.",

Extensions may contain vulnerabilities, phishing or collect user data, better to rely on a solution like bitwarden and if you can do self-hosted even better or keepass which saves your passwords in an encrypted local, remember however to make a backup for both.",

      "body": "I would recommend you to not save any of your passwords on cloud because it is vulnerable to hacks and you can get hacked when an hacker gets access to your cloud account. Sometimes even without knowing your Gmail or Hotmail password the hackers can still get access to your cloud data by stealing your browser cookies.With the stolen cookies your account can be logged in on their system as soon as they import the cookie with an extension named Cookie-editor. They can easily get access to the cookies and logs by installing spyware and malware in your system, and unfortunately sometimes those hackers can take advantage of outdated software whose vulnerabilities are found. And, they can penetrate your system with vulnerabilities. That's why it's very important to not save your passwords on cloud and instead write them on a notebook so you can enter them when they are needed. Also keep in mind that you should never use same password on multiple websites because sometimes hackers can hack an whole website database and your all accounts will be vulnerable to further attacks when they find your account detail on that database. It's wise to use different passwords on different websites.",

      "body": "Maybe I am just being worried with this but I do not choose to do this with passwords. If my passwords is stored somewhere like in a password manager or cloud there is always that chance it can get hacked. It maybe just a small chance but I am going to be worried someone will gain access to my information and then it will be a very big problem to recover it.What is even worse is to do this on my mobile phone. I have lost it before and it was not locked. It would make me so paranoid if a person then would be able to access all my passwords for my emails accounts and other personal information. I do not think it is a good idea even if small chance this will happen to you.",
