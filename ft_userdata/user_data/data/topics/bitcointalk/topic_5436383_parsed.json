It seems your casino is a new one though. I checked your website and I can not see any of you terms and conditions, policy but you have a good and attractive user interface. I think you should look into it as that is one of the important features every potential customer would want to see before identifying with your platform.  And if I may ask you as the first commenter said , are you the rep of this casino? If so then I would advise you to hid to his or her suggestion so members could be interested in your casino more as the see your pictures of your casino because that also speaks for itself too and another, getting relevance on this platform would need you to run a campaign in this platform by seeking the expertise of a good campaign manager who has a good reputation and large followership and I would also suggest you to be constantly  able and available to respond to inquiries, reviews and suggestions by members as your casino is a new one so as to get the attention of participants. This would let us know your casino has value for customer service.",
