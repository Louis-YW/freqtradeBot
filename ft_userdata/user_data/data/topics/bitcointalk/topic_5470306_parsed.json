  "content": "I perceive that most of us have forgotten or should i say don't understand the concept and the primary purpose of Bitcoin. I had to made this conclusion after reading several post from different communities including Bitcointalk. Most post I read were meant to promote the use of bitcoin, but failed to apply the primary concept.Interestingly, almost every bitcoin promotion article we see today contains HODL, Investment, Bull Market, 2024 Halving, etc, but only few talks about the basics.You must be wondering what the primary concept is all about ?. The bitcoin white paper which was released far back had the answers to what bitcoin was primarily meant for. The heading of the white paper  stated Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. While reading through, the writer's primary intentions was to fix the issue of third party transactions, by making Bitcoin another form of transaction entirely. The most interesting part was how the writer explained vividly how the transaction would work in relation to security matters.HODL, bull market, etc isn't bad, but how many of us still talk about using bitcoin as a regular medium of transaction ?.Don't get this wrong, I am not against HODL or others because everyone deserves to make profit. but if everyone chooses to hold, then how do we promote ?, Just by using our mouth ?, Who believes what is not seen ?.I think we are very lucky with satoshi's brilliance, but sadly, majority now consider bitcoin as an investment only, which makes me wonder if Bitcoin is still a p2p electronic cash system.My opinion...",

Read below, satoshi itself isn't forcing the user to use it as a currency, then why you need to care about that?Question to you: do you have Bitcoin? how frequently you use it as a currency? Quote from: https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/427/#selection-33.0-37.37Bitcoins have no dividend or potential future dividend, therefore not like a stock.More like a collectible or commodity.",

But as I have said, throughout the years, when it been traded, it became an assets and so majority now used to buy and sell them in exchange. Or even hedge their wealth on it as a store of value.It even considered as a safe haven during the pandemic, as people started to buy or put their money and just HODL and make profits once we hit the bull run in 2021-2022. So still depends on us, on how we treat it or how it will benefit us.",

That also means that you can do whatever you like with your coins. Bitcoin is a P2P means of making payment, but it has appreciating value as its price is increasing as there are more demand. That is bitcoin by design, even if not included in white paper, and that has been one if the reasons people adopted it.In my country, to use bitcoin for transaction is almost nonexistent, but you can easily convert your bitcoin to fiat and spend and  you can easily convert your fiat to bitcoin. I have only been able to use bitcoin to make cross border transactions. I have not used it locally before because I do not see people accepting it.",

      "body": "This can be seen as a deviation from the original intent, but with the introduction of this new function as an investment, Bitcoin has gained recognition among a wide audience and garnered global attention. Unbeknownst to many, this can also be regarded as a unique branding strategy. Imagine if Bitcoin had remained stagnant, as it did in 2010, with no change in its value – it might have gone relatively unnoticed.Bitcoin has become known for making significant moves in the unpredictable bullish and bearish markets. However, this has also had an impact on Bitcoin, making its use as a peer-to-peer currency less popular.It's essential to note that Bitcoin will continue to have users who employ it as electronic peer-to-peer currency, even if their numbers are not substantial. If the adoption of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer currency is a cause for concern, it would be even more worrisome if Bitcoin remains obscure, and the peer-to-peer user base does not expand; that would be truly disheartening.",

Either way you look at it, Bitcoin still has popularity and while there's those who invest in it, hodl, there's still folks out there using it for payments. Don't know if you've come across this post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5467712.0, but it shows that there's still people who don't just hodl Bitcoin like a trophy. Even Edward Snowden advises that it should be used more for spending rather than investment or hodling. All this goes to show that it's a personal choice of what one should do with his Bitcoin.",

We are still not really on the path of the real BTC Concept.Of course, this is because government regulations do not fully support Bitcoin as a legal payment asset. P2P transactions between Bitcoin users without a third party are certainly possible, but it is still not efficient with the costs and time needed to make transactions. The best way is to p2p using the Bitcoin Lightning Network, but some people don't like the Lightning network. Now p2p is still dominated by third parties and this can be done quickly. But it is centralized and controlled by a third party.",

The deflationary quality of bitcoin is very important and gives it more real world value. Currencies are difficult to displace, more difficult when it is a decentralized one trying to displace a legal tender. Having multiple utility means bitcoin will not wait until adoption grows incredibly as a currency for exchange.Even the wallets attributed to Satoshi are still hodling.- Jay -",
