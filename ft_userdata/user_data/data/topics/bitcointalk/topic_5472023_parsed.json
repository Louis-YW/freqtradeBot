Gambling is fun and I deposited little amount that made me to forget. But this is not what this thread is all about. If I win any free bet, I will withdraw it immediately. If not up to lowest withdrawal requirement yet, I leave it until I accomodate more money to withdraw all. But sometimes I can try my luck to either lose it all or make it up to require minimum withdrawal. If I am lucky, I will have a nice weekend with it. It is gambling, either I win it or lose it. It is free bet.",

Besides betting on both sides it sure is but you know the math of it.No ither choice but to put it into bet. Of course, casino providers won’t allow players to get free money in the first place. Betting on both sides won’t give you huge profit ‘coz one would be losing for sure, you’d suffer small loss from fees as well and odd differences. The only way we could do is to just use the free bets as is and hope for luck to be on our side. Result will never be assured simply ‘coz this is gambling, should be an enough statement for us all to understand.",

      "body": "Good questionIf you bet on both sides, you'll lose part of the bet for sure, unless the game is very eneven and you're lucky enough to win the bigger odd. In this type of bet, you'll secure part of the money, even with a \"loss\".Bonuses are a good opportunity to place some riskier bets that pay very good odds, at least in my opinionTrying to play it safe, but not 100%, you can still place bets that have a VERY high chance of happening, bets of 1.01 or 1.02 odds, in a soccer match for example when one team is winning 2x0 and the game is almost overIt's just important to check the rules of the bonuses, as some of them require you to bet at higher odds to be validI'll follow this thread too see another opinions, I'm curious",

I am glad I did try to reach that rank but it was taken so fast that I didn't even notice all the balance was gone. I don't think they will let you win from free money or I am just having an unlucky day. It's not like every gambler will double the money that came from a freebie but I do assure you that I had fun using all the money that came from just wagering enough. I mean, I didn't even waste up to $100 to wager $10,000. $1 can make me go far to almost $20-30 wagered amount and if I get lucky I can win it and withdraw some of that funds. But the next level of wagering is higher so it becomes expensive, then the winning chance got lower unlike the time when I was a non VIP player.",

If you use them there is a chance that you‘ll make something if you are lucky. The big question here is, does the casino let you withdraw your profits without depositing first? If that’s possible then it is good news. If not, depending on the size of the profits you’ll have to make another choice. If the casino is a trusted one then there will be no harm done.",

I can never go for bets of 1.01 and 1.02 odds ever in my life. The chance of winning is high but it is stupidity. When the person lose money would be when he will know that. I prefer to go for high odd like 1.5 or more but not far from 2 odds if it sport. I will prefer casino than bookies is another thing.",

Besides betting on both sides it sure is but you know the math of it.Betting on both side with lower EV is really the best thing to do so that you can guarantee profit on your free bet. Use arbitrage calculator to determine what’s match is the best will give you positive EV or a minimal -ve. You can use this website https://oddsjam.com/betting-calculators/arbitrage-hedge-bet to calculate it easily.I usually bet on a 1.9 to 2.1 odds bet whenever I get freebet since I have nothing to lose here and all the freebet profit is still subject to wagering requirements so I do the normal betting when using the freebet then use the arbitrage to farm wager.",

That is you may not have the leverage to bet on all the games like real money. Also, like if you have free bet in sportsbook, that is where you are allowed to wager and not visuals and if you have free bet in visuals, same is applicable.Generally, I believe the winning from free bet is calculated in exclusion of the free bet value and mostly that is the purpose is also called stake not returned, the company is only interested to pay you your winning.",

What I can say is that you can be reading the rules applied. Gambling sites have different rules about the first time free bet. The ones that I was able to win after reading the rules applied, I was able to withdraw my money. This has happened to me two or three times before. There are some that once I read the rules, I will not bother myself of using the free bet to gamble if the rules will only make the free bets to yield little or no return.",

This is the best way to clear wagering requirements especially the use of french roulette since it refund 50% bet when green win while you bet on both red and black. Other type of roulette 100% when green win.But there’s some casino that find this kind of method unacceptable on claiming the bonus due to there tricky ToS. I stop using this method to avoid potential conflict on claiming bonus once cleared and just focus on blackjack using basic strategy using the standard table matrix.",

Although depending on the casino, they may limit you to wager few times on the free bet so that you can exhaust it fast. Actually so, you may still have to take bigger risk like you said after all",

But I am the type of gambler who just registers, makes deposits and would rather have a big winning before considering supplying my other details,  it could be because of this that I have not had the privilege of free bets.",
