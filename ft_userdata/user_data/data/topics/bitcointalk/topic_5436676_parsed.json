      "body": "But this is the first time this comet has ever come close to the Earth. Why? Because the Earth of this age is only about 7,500 years old. About 7,500 years ago God split up the material of the universe (known as 'earth' back then) into the material of this Earth globe, and the material of the rest of the universe.Quote from: https://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/1.htm6And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” 7So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. 8God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.Then God transformed some of the things in the vault of the sky into stars and other space objects, and He talked about them in this way...Quote from: https://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/1.htm14And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 15and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so....19And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.Some people will say that the days talked about in Genesis were simply periods of time that might be millions of years long. But the Hebrew word for \"day\" in the creation story in the Bible means a simple, 24-hour day.There are so many people who make excuses for God, trying to fit Him into their understanding... when the thing they should be doing is to simply believe Him rather than trying to understand things that are not provable. Stop denying God His position of being God. If you don't, you just might deny yourself out of existence.Regarding the present age of the Universe having been created 7,500 years ago, consider the Septuagint and other early Bible manuscripts, along with what Flavius Josephus says.

      "body": "I became very interested in Comet C/2022 E3 ZTF when heard about this. 50,000 years ago is the time of the neaderthals so I cannot wait to see this. A magical burning ball of green light in the sky.  I am just in awe that a comet will be green and can be seen through a telescope or binoculars so I cannot wait for this. I am just hoping that the night sky will not be overcast and low pollution.",
