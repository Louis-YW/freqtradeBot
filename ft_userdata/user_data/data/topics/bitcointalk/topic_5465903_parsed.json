  "content": "I wrote this Poem sometime ago concerning politics and its ravaging storm in the Society,and would like to share to the group.Oh! PoliticsRoaring like a lionThat is as hot as ironOh! PoliticsYou bring conflictsYou make rivalsTo be on trialsPolitics of great confusionTo our great nationYou cause the erosionYou gave us blind vision and decisionThe masses of great peopleWe lack perfect peaceWe lack good fertilityBecause we are not worthy.The future awaits the fewThat will make the nation newOh! But the wind blewIt took them and forgot themWe forgot our landCause we don't standTo claimBut we blameThe soilIn which we toilBut what we need is UnityTo conquer our country.",

      "body": "Good poem and it really says a lot about what the whole politics entails. The politics we are facing today is blinded by selfish interests and not for the interests of the people the leaders claim to be governing. It has become a place to come and steal, a place to cut National cake as to what people in my country call it most times. The notion of what true politics means have been clearly defeated. Oh politics, I wish it can be defined and practiced for the purpose it was meant for all nations practicing democracy system of government.",

      "body": "Your poem really nails the chaos of politics and how it affects us all. I love how you describe it as roaring like a lion, creating conflicts, and blinding us to the truth. It's like we've forgotten our roots, right? But you're spot on about needing unity for victory. Thanks for sharing this powerful piece with us!",

They use politics as game and only think of keeping themselves in power with their children inheriting them when they are gone, such does not bring true democracy.",

      "body": "Nowadays, the word politics is used as the most ugly word, those who are doing politics are not coming to politics to use their interests and politics is the only method through which all the interests can be realized goes Today politicians are playing politics like a game like tides.Politicians are using the state like robots robots for good and for evil if you use robots for bad things robots will do bad things if you use them for bad thingsPoliticians are using the state like robots robots for good and for evil if you use robots for bad things robots will do bad things if you use them for bad things If it is used for good work, it will do good work, just like the state is being used like a robot now, what the politicians say, the state administrations are doing what they say, as a result, any state is going to a bad end day by day and Some truths are being used in group work. Your poem is very relevant to the modern situation.Finally, I can say that politicians should have the knowledge to do politics and not look at their own interests and their own interests Use all your knowledge, hard work and knowledge for the good of the country then we will see a healthy politics and the country will be well run, and we will get good quality leadership and beautiful leaders will emerge We want the people of all the world to share our hopes and aspirations, we don't want dirty politics, we want healthy politics in the world.Through healthy politics the country can be made beautiful by eliminating hatred and hatred and as an example it can be presented as a role model on the map of the world, but leaders should be honest fearless brave patriots Political qualities such as leadership ability should be One thing we should note is that leaders should not be son leaders, the hereditary path should be eliminated, then politics will become healthy.",

A better suggestion for a topic for a post like this is to be more specific, like \"A poem about politics\". Nice creative effort you have put to write the poem, with more practice, you can be a really good poet.",

Well, I don't know if I can judge with the first year of their service but it seems that many are dismayed with what we're dealing with right now. I know that inflation is a global thing and almost every country is dealing with it. But there's just more than that and despite the call of unity, it seems that it's not turning out what it should be.",

      "body": "Great poem... This fosters me to ask what country has the most peaceful politics and elections so far, and how did they practice the politics that it was so peaceful and free from ills?Oftentimes, when we talk about politics, it's all about the ills and broken bottles that comes with it. I rarely see the best part of it where it's positively described.Especially in Africa where I come from, it is more scary to describe politics without talking about chaos and so many confrontations from both the people and the government or with the government instruments and I continue to wonder if this is what politics will offer to us.Yet we are still surviving some of the most difficult economy downturns, insecurities, crimes, injustice amongst many other ills. I still wonder if that's all politics can offer to us?What about we stop this politics and just go ahead to create polls and bring contestants to compete with one another through technical quizzes while the highest winner leads us? Why can't it be strictly intellectual engagements and proffering of solutions to peculiar questions thrown to them while you allow the constituents or citizens to make their choices through us engagements. It could be phase by phase.",
