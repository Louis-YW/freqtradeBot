  "content": "I want to move my bitcoin off of an exchange into cold storage.I currently own a old laptop that actually was never connected to the internet and never used, its still brand new.I know I can create an electrum wallet on that laptop while offline, the issue I have is that I want to make sure that the coins are actually in the wallet and I am able to see and also send them out of the wallet. I know I can see them easily, but I also want to make sure I can send the coins to make sure I don't mess something up here.Â My question is, how would you go about keeping my bitcoin offline, but connect the wallet a few times to the internet to check to make sure my wallet works as intended?Like, should I create the wallet on the offline laptop, recreate it to make sure the words are correct, send money to it, then put the wallet on USB (so I don't have to recreate it on my internet connected PC) and see if it works on my main computer with the secured password or something?Thanks for any advice here.",

The watch-only wallet will be for tracking your transactions (instead of depending on third party, blockchain explorer), and to make unsigned transactions which you can transfer to the cold wallet through QR code (preferably) or USB stick.Once the unsigned transaction is transferred to the cold wallet, you will be able to sign it and transfer it back to the watch-only wallet to broadcast it.To set it up, follow this guide:https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.htmlMake sure the device is perfectly airgapped, with the removal of Bluetooth and WiFi card.",

Besides, if you don't trust the bitcoin company you're buying it (which is little to no trust, again they can't rip you off if done properly) then just buy the hardware devices yourself. That's what I did. I bought a Raspberry Pi 4, not a Trezor. That's better for your privacy as well.",

If you have the seed phrase in a safe place and you are sure that that's the correct seed phrase, there's nothing to worry about.To make sure everything works as expected, create a new wallet. Select \"I already have a seed\" this time and enter your seed phrase. Go to \"Addresses\" tab and check if you see the same addresses. (If \"Addresses\" tab is not available, click on \"View\" at top of the window and select \"Show addresses\".)You can also create a watch-only wallet on an online computer to see your balance.For creating a watch-only wallet, you need to import your master public key into a new wallet.In the watch-only wallet, you can see your balance and all your transactions. But it's not possible to spend fund from it. Note that in the watch-only wallet, you should see the same addresses as your cold storage wallet.",

ThanksIf all you need to do for now is verify that your wallet works and you can send Bitcoin out of it, then the first reply you got is your first option. Extra bonus cause you can send out of it without connecting your private keys (seed phrase) to the internet. Taking things slow helps prevent information overload and allows you focus on a task at a time.Multiple addresses do not really matter when using your creating a address using a seed phrase, it's more of a privacy feature which you can figure all about with time.",

You can import the private key from one of those addresses if you want to spend bitcoin [for example you have bitcoin at 2 different addresses] while you don't touch bitcoin at other addresses.

But for every wallet you make from electrum then I think it will work as it should even if you are not connected to the Internet.

But I don't like the idea. If your online computer is infected with a malware, your fund can be stolen once you import the private key. For security, you should sign the transaction offline, so your private keys and your seed phrase don't connect to the internet at all.

Would any of those allow you to spend all of your bitcoin in that wallet?In Bitcoin, the data that can spend your coins isn't the address but its \"private key\" which usually in the care of the user.An Exchange and Electrum work differently.In Exchanges, the private keys of the users addresses are in the Exchange's custody.In Electrum, the private keys are stored locally in the wallet so the data that you need to spend is exclusively in that wallet even if it's offline.By creating a watching-only Electrum wallet, you're basically only copying the addresses to the online PC; it can't spend, only \"watch\".Take note that the above is an oversimplification for you to understand,technically, there's a \"master key\" stored in each of those wallets which can reproduce all of those two wallet's addresses.A \"master private key\" in the cold-storage and \"master public key\" in the watching-only wallet.Quote from: edward500The thing here is that I need to verify that my wallet works, and I can send bitcoin out of it in a test before I put my bitcoin into it. Send a few satoshi to the watching-only wallet and successfully spend it by following the tutorial in the first reply, that's the assurance that you need.If you want, you can click 'save' right after signing the transaction in the cold-storage to update the displayed balance but that wont improve anything.",

      "body": "I think we need to take a step back here and re-read everything through the eyes of a semi-newbie like OP. He's asking some simple questions about how to safely set up a cold wallet, and instead we are confusing him with talks of gap limits and hardware wallets, which are completely irrelevant to his first post.Here is the question OP asked:Quote from: edward500 on September 05, 2022, 07:32:32 PMMy question is, how would you go about keeping my bitcoin offline, but connect the wallet a few times to the internet to check to make sure my wallet works as intended?Charles-Tim has given you the correct answer in the first reply. You do this via what is known as a watch only wallet. This means your main wallet which you create on your offline laptop stays permanently offline and never connects to the internet. Then you take the addresses or public keys from that wallet, via a QR code or a USB drive, over to your internet connected device and create a watch only wallet using these addresses or public keys. The watch only wallet does exactly what the name suggests - it lets you only watch the addresses for incoming funds, but you cannot spend anything from the watch only wallet. To spend the coins, you must use the full wallet on your offline laptop which contains the private keys necessary for spending.Quote from: edward500 on September 05, 2022, 07:32:32 PMLike, should I create the wallet on the offline laptop, recreate it to make sure the words are correct, send money to it, then put the wallet on USB (so I don't have to recreate it on my internet connected PC) and see if it works on my main computer with the secured password or something?Almost. Instead of putting the full wallet on your USB, you just put the addresses or the master public key and use that to create a watch only wallet on your internet connected PC. This lets you view all your addresses and transactions, without risking the private keys every being exposed to the internet.The process of spending coins from this set up is a little convoluted, but is the process required to maintain the security of the wallet. From the watch only Electrum wallet, you first create a transaction as you normally would. Instead of signing that transaction (which you can't, since the watch only wallet does not contain the private keys necessary for signing), you instead save the unsigned transaction to file, and then move that file via a USB drive over to your cold wallet. Open the unsigned transaction in your cold wallet, sign it, save the now signed transaction in a new file, and then move that file back across to your internet connected PC to be broadcast to the network.",
