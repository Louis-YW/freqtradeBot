  "content": "- Â Good day to all my friends here on this forum, based on what you can see in the picture the two @Dave Portnoy and @Elon Musk had a short conversation about their Bitcoin holdings. And Elon Musk did mention that there hasn't been any bitcoin for sale since he bought it. Is the question true that Musk mentioned that he posted on the Twitter platform?In addition to this, many of us in this industry community know that the price of bitcoin will increase by around 100k$ or more, there is just no certain day and year when it will happen. Also, we don't even know how many bitcoins Elon Musk holds, but he is one of the biggest holdings of bitcoins in the world today.Do you think Elon Musk is one of those who will push the price of bitcoin up to reach 100k$ each when the bull run comes?Your opinion is much appreciated Source : https://cointelegraph.com/news/i-have-not-sold-any-of-my-bitcoin-elon-musk",

Bitcoin can reach 100,000 dollars regardless of what Elonmusk does with his bitcoin and what says about bitcoin. Elon musk could do some manipulations in the market with his tweets in the past. But I doubt his tweets has any more effect on bitcoin and I don't think he can affect the market significantly even in the short term. I am not saying bitcoin will reach 100,000 dollars and this is not a financial advice. Everything is possible.",

If Elon will announce something about Bitcoin that highlights the advancement of crypto that can hype investors to invest again in bitcoin then it will be a big help to increase BTC price diring this bear season but not that high.",

Influencing the price or not then depending on the perspective of each bitcoiner, Musk is just a solo \"player\" only relying on the power of news. Because all transactions are not carried out on the spot market, it means that it does not actually affect the price directly. But it's a surprising fact that many people still consider this person's decision to be important.",

      "body": "are you not exaggerating by saying Elon Musk is the key to reaching ATH $100k. Even Elon Musk doesn't fully support bitcoin. Just look at how Elon Musk suspended Bitcoin payments for his Tesla car. Elon Musk is an entrepreneur who certainly has a strategy to enliven the Tesla Car and Rocket market, so Bitcoin or cryptocurrency is a good bridge. But not completely. Elon Musk is indeed one of the most influential crypto enthusiasts, but there are still many factors that factor into Bitcoin being able to reach the new ATH. So Elon musk is neither the key nor the only person who will make Bitcoin hit the $100k price tag.",

Bitcoin price is organically grown with halving cycles and each deflationary cycle. Elon Musk, Jamie Dimon, Michael Saylor or anyone else is only additional factor to bring Bitcoin to new all time highs. They are not decisive reasons and they are only supplementary reasons for Bitcoin growth.If it is not Elon Musk, there will be another person or other people will mention about Bitcoin in next bull run but as said, don't believe that is real reason for Bitcoin growth.The Bitcoin Treasuries list will be expanded more seriously.https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/",

(extreme skepticism here.)I'm saying that because Bitcoin price increases are supposed to be carried out by gigantic increases in demand (more users), and a single person can't supply that demand all by himself.But maybe, just maybe, if he manages to beat Wall Street and cable news and convince the majority of people to own bitcoins, then yes, he would be a factor in Bitcoin's charge to $100K.",

Let me tell you something when people invest because of someone's influence, they are quick to sell when uncertainty occurs but someone who does his or her research before making a move in any investment doesn't shake out when there is any bad news, the fundamentals they learned do keep their judgement intact and don't usually sell. Just look at the Bitcoin chart for a minute, with all the negativity, bitcoin has remained in that zone he bought most of his bitcoin($18k), this shows that most people who bought above those levels were influenced and all sold as soon as he sell the bitcoin entrusted on the company and pretends to be as a result of illiquidity. We need Bitcoin growth to that $100,000 but if it will take 6 years to achieve it without the world's richest people toying with its movement, we will be happy to wait to see that happen anytime.As for the link, here is the main link where they announced they sold most of their bitcoin. the one you posted is very outdated with the company findings.https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-tesla-sold-75-of-bitcoin-holdings-in-q2",

Elon Musk doesn't have as much power as he used to have over the crypto market, and the majority of his power was over Dogecoin and similar, not over Bitcoin. Thanks to his influence and billions at disposal, he did have impact when Tesla invested in Bitcoin and then when Musk announced that Tesla will stop accepting Bitcoin as payments (followed by eventuall sales of the coins themselves). But the impact was, like, 15-20%, I believe, and without a big long-term effect.I do believe Bitcoin will reach $100k in the foreseeable future (within a year or two from now), but it, thankfully, has nothing to do with Musk.",
