I mean how are they going to know who to invite in the first place?Seems like some country wants their taxes paid.",

On the consumer front as well, if i am getting instant conversion of my bitcoin at a market price while doing real time transaction it's obviously a win win situation. So it's really a good move by VISA.",

Then there's bitcoinblack they keep mentioning, and I'm unfamiliar with it. When I googled it, I found some sort of Bitcoin Black crypto and people on quora saying it's a scam. Also, from other news on the matter I see it's about a card for UAE. And there's another thing that bothers me: I see no major outlets writing about it, which to me is an indicator the news might be untrue or misleading.",

If someone is holding a good amount of wealth in cryptocurrency and looking forward for ways to spend it like traditional currency, this kind of cards will come pretty handy. But it's unfortunate that Visa is making is super exclusive by just making 10,000 pieces of it. Which should have really been an instrument for the commoners. Such exclusive products don't make much sense because these are usually outside the reach of the commoners. Visa is probably trying to create some user case before launching a similar global initiative linked to cryptocurrency. Many countries do not have such facilities available where they can spend their cryptos just like traditional payment method.",

So I can't take advantage of that 'No limit'. The expanding network is more important than extending the limit which would be a revolutionary decision. I am not saying the current decision isn't helpful. But I just express my opinion. Visa doesn't have any country restrictions. So issuing a card shouldn't be restricted as well. Either they would use a third party, or they could manage themselves to reload the card with cryptocurrency. That would help expand the network.",

Not to mention that using centralized proxies defeats the whole purpose of Bitcoin.Yup, the purpose still remains unsolved here! Moreover, there is no point VISA getting involved into something like bitcoin as long as they are not going with the data integrity principles of the blockchain. VISA already has its huge set up across the world followed by MasterCard. Its become so easy these days, any small finance company can launch the visa cards and process the money. However, spending bitcoin just like fiat on open channel is invitation to the intruder, crumbled policies of anonymous nature and what not. Im also not much triggered with the news. Better off they should launch their own tokenomics and challenge the existing projects.",
