  "content": "This particular nursery rhyme has been ringing in my head for days now, precisely 3 days. EvoBridge which is a common multichain swap has been illiquid for quite some time. Swaps don't work, especially from Emerald Oasis paratime to other blockchains like BSC, Ethereum wouldn't get stuck for days, of which the team eventually added a cancel button on the UI. My 8k USDT is stuck on Oasis chain which I framed in ValleySwap(who have been fingered in the accusations)The puzzling aspect is there is silence from the team. Both Valleyswap and EvoBridge has muted their groups for days, and of course, speculations of a slow or soft rug swirling. All backed with evidence of movement of funds out of EvoBridge walletsWhat do you guys think? Soft rug or hiccup",
