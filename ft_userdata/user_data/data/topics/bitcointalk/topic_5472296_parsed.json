  "content": "Hello, please I need some assistance. In 2016, we used python to generate a Bitcoin private key and then imported the key into the electrum Android app, sent btc there and forgot about it. Now, for the past one year, I have been trying to recover that address but the private key doesn’t generate the same address anymore. I have used python to generate 5 different legacy addresses but all are different from the very first one.I am very sure it’s the right key because there are multiple backups. Is it possible that the address format is no longer supported and hence difficult to recreate with modern tools? Does anyone have any insight into this and what may be the possible problem???To reiterate, the addresses are legacy addresses and the key I have is presumably a compressed key starting with L.Is it possible that electrum android app uses a different architecture to generate a public address now or it had a bug that generated a wrong address for then?",

Most of the times, people are embedding their input data inside the script instead of as a command-line argument.To OP:If you imported a single private key inside the Electrum app, then that means you don't have to worry about fancy things like derivation paths and stuff - you just need to get the private key you have and use correct software to generate the address, like this one.",

Go to electrum, in the derivation path, tick legacy and put m/clientid (m/489) underneath or2. Use iancoleman.io/bip39 listed above(beware, using this may compromise your seed)put the seed in the mnemonic box and change the derivation path to bip32, select custom path and put m/client id (m/489).A private key can generate two addresses and since it starts with K or L (Base58 Wallet Import Format), then inserting it into Electrium will give you the correct address, or the private key you are using is for another address.based on above quote you already know iancoleman.io and derivation path so I think you know this",

If you generate a seed phrase offline on an airgapped device and you backup the seed phrase and some addresses and delete the wallet. That is just a paper wallet. If you are looking for something related to BIP38 encryption, you can use BIP39 passphrase. HD wallet gives you everything needed to generate a secure paper wallet.What is a paper wallet?",

Likely because you have other means as bitcoin/bitcoin wallet developers gives many secure means that you can go for. But we know how secure it can be if done appropriately.If use wallet like Electrum to generate the paper wallet, it is just nothing more than a wallet on a airgapped device, but not a wallet on an airgapped device because you deleted it and backup the seed phrase somewhere like on paper in different locations. While generating the wallet, only what I can feel not secure about the it is if I do not use BIP39 passphrase with the seed phrase to generate the keys and addresses. If I use passphrase, the wallet is safe and secure and and I can hold huge amount of coins on it.",

Just as you said one thing I will always tell someone not that tech savvy is to just go for hardware wallets not that it is better than airgapped wallets in my opinion but it save you the trouble of not making a mistake. One key mistake some not so tech savvy people do while trying to create an offline wallet is they go offline and as you said delete the wallet and app so as to avoid not coming online but that still defeats the purpose of airgapped wallet. The device should be use should have never come online before, because if it has been online before even just once then there is a chance even though so slim that it might have a malware that could compromise the seed phrase or keys in future. The other mistake is the transfer of the unsigned transaction from to that device. This two things make me advice newbies to just go for hardware wallet first as a means of cold wallet",
