Also 5% chance that they paid but don't expect to get good pay cuts because mostly if they got listed on shit exchanges the value shrunk down because many of its early investors or words the devs are dumping it to secure their profits.",

      "body": "It depends on how you consider the \"pay\" is.I'd say many bounties do pay their participants, but the payment they got doesn't always 100% like the beginning promise. Many projects promise the token is worth for $1 at the distribution rate and they will pay you for 75 token every week, so technically you will earn $75 for every week. But the shitcoin price drop to $0.02, so it's mean you only earn $1.5 for every week. Does it's worth to spend one week to earn $1.5?",

Most likely, the things they tell you to do, like translating, spamming forums and social media, are a waste of your time and effort. You would be better off using your free time to develop technical skills that could lead to employment or perhaps a freelance job so you can DCA BTC.",

Some will become successful and will pay those eligible participants and there are much more bounties that becomes unsuccessful and there's no essence to them to pay their participants since they are already a failure, a failed project. That's why they're just assigning and allocating a certain amount of their token for that bounty so they wouldn't release actual budget on it and just as said, if they become successful, they'll release the tokens and if not, they'll still release the tokens but it has no value.",

Because Maximum Bounty Campaign Managers do not pay their Bounty Campaigns. As a result many went to various Telegram groups and presented their complaints. But because the market is a little bad, the bounce campaigns are refraining from paying higher rates. Â There are many bounty campaign users who complain that even after paying some amount from the bounty campaign, they cannot be sold and most of the tokens are not available in the market which is really a problem for every bounty hunter.",

A bounty campaign taken up by a reputed member has more chances of being legit than that is taken up by some less known manager. Remember that you are trusting the manager's experience here to select a worthy project and weed out the bad ones. But in general a bounty campaign is not bound by any laws to pay its participants, they can cite a hundred reasons why they might decide to not pay and you cannot do anything about it but swallow it.I would suggest you to change your telegram privacy settings so you are not added to random groups like that.",

All bounty campaigns on this forum are published here. Some pay participants, some not so much, others - tokens will not cost anything. Here is how lucky and how you choose a campaign manager. Usually, old and trusted managers get all the rewards, because they value their reputation and cooperate only with reliable projects. Even with a newbie account, you can earn something, for example, in a twitter or facebook campaign. In general, there are opportunities, but you should not count on getting rich on this, but evaluate it as a way of a small additional income.",

In most cases I exited from the groups immediately I find myself there because I feel they are prone to defrauding people.This makes me to wonder if bounties really pay.There are definitely good bounties out there that are still paying their participants regularly. I am part of one of those bounties for around a year or so now and there was not one payment missed so far. If you want to join a bounty campaign of a new altcoin project though, then there definitely is a pretty big risk of not getting paid and/or that the tokens that you will receive at the end of the bounty are worth absolutely nothing.So in order to make some money with a bounty you need to do your research before. Don't just join the bounty that is offering the highest reward, because that is usually a bad sign. If they are paying 500k$ worth of tokens to bounty participants, then you can be pretty sure, that the token will get dumped to zero.",

Scammers are now using bounties to scam people where they will add you to their telegram group and will ask you to perform different tasks with the promise of getting paid yet you will still end up being blocked on their dead channel. It's rare to find legit bounties these days so you really have to research so you will not get scammed.",

If it is tht they pay, of course most of them do but, it never matters regardless as your often given tokens that have got zero worth. In essence, you've been paid but, you just can't use it.

It's not often that bounty hunters get paid by new companies, even on this forum. Bounty campaigns previously started as signature campaigns, there were almost no other campaigns. Now the situation with bounty campaigns has become very difficult, and there is no need to talk about the amount of remuneration, they have fallen so much. But sometimes you can still get a good profit by participating in them. But this happens very rarely.",
