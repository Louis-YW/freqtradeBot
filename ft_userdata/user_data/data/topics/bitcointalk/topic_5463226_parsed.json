  "content": "Hey everyone - I set up a pruned node (20 GB max). When I connected it to my Sparrow wallet, I got an error that says \"Error: Wallet birthday earlier than Bitcoin Core prune date\". I understand why I'm getting this error, but curious if this affects transactions going forward? If I'm just using the Sparrow + Core setup for privacy vs. a public server (i.e., I don't need to search the blockchain for txns), is this set up ok?",

      "body": "Your node will continually prune blocks as time goes on, so the earliest you will be able to scan for transactions will also advance in time. Therefore any other wallets you create or import in to Sparrow will need to have later and later birthdays, or you will be unable to view their transactions and balances.As long as Bitcoin Core has the Sparrow \"cormorant\" wallet, then it will continue to scan incoming blocks for transactions relevant to your addresses. If for any reason the cormorant wallet is moved, removed, doesn't load, etc., then you could miss transactions in blocks that are later pruned.",
