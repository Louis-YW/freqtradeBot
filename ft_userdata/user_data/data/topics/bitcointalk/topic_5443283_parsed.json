  "content": "War is one thing that no society should engage themselves into as its effect is devastating and unforgettable upon generations. When two or more countries are warring it is said that there are other countries that benefits in one way or the other from the war as it prolongs and intensifies, especially economical benefits is one of such. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine which has been on for almost a year now and the effects of the war between these two is not only on the two warring countries alone but has gone so far as affecting the economies of many countries of the world that have no involvement or interference in the said war. countries of Europe are experiencing a fall short in gas supply, while those of Africa and other continent suffer from economic downfall as a result of certain products and services that are no longer in-coming due to the war effect.With this Russia Ukraine war which the effect is felt in almost all parts of the world directly and indirectly, I want to ask are there beneficiaries to this war and in what ways are they benefiting from it.",

      "body": "Those who produce and sell weapons always benefit the most from war, because during wars the demand for weapons increases. The data show that in just one year, Ukraine consumed as much specific artillery ammunition as the US otherwise produces in even 5 years - and now, of course, production must be significantly increased in order to satisfy the demand to some extent. Another industry that profits are those that produce medical supplies, especially those used on the battlefield such as bandages, infusions, painkillers and the like. In addition, the war creates thousands of disabled people who need prostheses and various other medical aids.For most people, war means death, serious injuries, loss of apartments, houses, cars and more or less serious psychological consequences in the form of post-traumatic stress. However, for some it is really a time of great profit - and in my area there is a saying that says \"war is a war for someone, and a brother for someone else\".",

Besides, because of the war, the world fell into an economic crisis, also when they exported inflation to the countries that were their debtors.",

      "body": "Quote from: Lida93 on March 05, 2023, 02:04:40 PMI want to ask are there beneficiaries to this war and in what ways are they benefiting from it.It depends on the scale of the war, the region and how many or who is involved in the direct armed conflict. The chaos large scale wars like the two European Wars also known as World Wars 1 and 2 create benefit those who stay far away from that chaos like United States. In WW2 for example, US benefited the most since it was far away and wasn't impacted as much as say Europe itself which then led to giving US tremendous amount of power which they abused in the past 80 years.The Russian-NATO war is a medium scale war at best since it is focused in one small area of the world and the impacts are different depending on the distance and involved in the actual conflict for each country.For example US like the WW2 is benefiting the most since they could successfully rescue their failing economy for the time being by creating more market for their exports (eg. LNG to Europe or the massive increase in weapons sale) that couldn't have existed without this war.Other countries like Europe (different countries in the region with different degrees but all the same) are negatively impacted since they are being abused by US (ie. selling much more expensive LNG to Europe instead of the super cheap Russian gas they used to receive) so the impact is huge and negative. Like the ongoing deindustrialization in Europe.Other countries that are also far from this conflict are seeing a range of different effects depending on their involvement and level of independence. For example a country that lacks independence like Japan is being forced into suffering negative economical impacts while countries with more independence like China are taking advantage of this situation and are expanding their economy (China is actually reporting high growths these days!) by having access to cheaper energy, taking over markets that were left by Europeans, attracting investment and industries that left regions like Europe, etc. With the rest of the countries being in between like Turkey, India, etc. that are experiencing both negative and positive impacts. Like Turkey taking advantage of the chaos to seek benefits geopolitically speaking.That's just a summary though, your question can't be answered any better due to the broad nature of it. It is best to analyze the situation per country not as a whole. For example even in a region like Europe there are major differences between each country like Italy seeing a different impact than France for instance and they are both different from a country like Latvia in Eastern Europe.",

One of them is a country that produces sophisticated war equipment, and sells it to countries that are at war. I did not specify which countries benefited, but some understand this. If war is not something you want, why should sophisticated war equipment be developed?Of course, for the goods to sell, then there must be a bigger war.",

I can't say it's not necessary because if Russia won't be aggressive, Putin will be overthrown and replaced by a US government-friendly president which basically means colonized. Powerful countries have been colonizing the smaller ones, it may not be the way like 1500 AD but it's all the same as colonizing.  Falkland is very far away from the UK but why do they own it? They colonized it the same as Hongkong a long time ago. Once China becomes bigger, they may also do the same to Africa, put up a president that will make China thier world leader, and may even educate the African kids to speak Chinese. I believe they already are doing this.But you can also say the US is getting weaker in the economy and has no manpower to go to war and the stronger countries like China and Russia is challenging their dominance.",

It's just a show of tyranny. There is no way the involved countries can benefit from the war, they will always lose resources and souls to it. In the case of Ukraine and Russia, though Russia is not destroyed, they have lost thousands of souls and billions of dollars to this senseless war and will continue to lose more.Ukraine on the other hand has lost more, including the destruction of the country. However, there are companies that would benefit from this war, they are the weapon-producing companies, and this will benefit the economy of their countries.",

It appears that military related companies are set for a big boom after they've struggled in some countries for a long time with shrinking armies in places like Europe. Even more civilian companies that you might not think will benefit are getting a big boost - like aerospace manufacturers. Then there are others like oil and gas companies, who have made huge profits due to the fear of supply interruptions and the imbalances that happened early on. Certain mining companies will be big winners if they are able to sell their product for more after supply was limited from Ukrainian and Russia sources.",
