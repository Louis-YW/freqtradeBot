There are some p2p services that even offer more limits than that without KYC.Q: do they allow direct sending of bitcoins to personal wallets on purchase, considering they have their own centralized wallet?",

      "body": "Good to know.  Welcome to Bitcoin Talk.Mind mentioning what the current threshold for Know Your Customer is?  Is there a cumulative limit or do they not care if you go there every day and exchange without surpassing the limit?Do they require KYC for selling?  If no, what is the limit?  Is it an ATM or do you send the Bitcoin at a desk and get the cash in hand by an operator?Please, if you can create a post detailing the process it would be very helpful for anyone currently looking to exchange Fiat to Bitcoin or the other way around without being questioned.  I can help you out by sending you a Personal Message with a list of questions you can answer in detail.  In fact, I think a more detailed thread can be submitted to a more visited board like Bitcoin Discussion.-Regards,PrivacyG",

OP, did you experience hidden fees / big spread when you've used this service?All in all, at the first glance it's not too bad, but imho not that much non-KYC either.",

I had to send a satoshi test from the bitcoin address I wanted to use to receive the purchased bitcoin, to prove I have access to the wallet. I think they support direct sending to hardware wallets. This was not tested by me.",

Living in EU, I am interested. No KYC is interesting. Does the platform accept stablecoin? This could be a solution for acquiring BTC without KYC with a trusted company based in Switzerland, where financial legislation is rigorous but fairly permissive.",

I have no experience with Mt Pelerin selling bitcoins.Their threshold is good, but their crypto list isn't so good/ big. Even if they don't have KYC within their limitations (which they do because it's your name on any card/ bank account), they need a full and complete reference. As they stated in their ToS section 9 (last paragraph), and I quote: \"When trading within limits, it is mandatory that You provide us with the full and complete reference as indicated in Bridge Wallet or in the Widget.\" By that, I guess they are talking about the wallet addresses, which isn't so good. Or no? If you have experience with it, let us know. It will be helpful for all to know.",
