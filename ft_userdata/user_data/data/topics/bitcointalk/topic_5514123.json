Thanking Satoshi or posting a message anywhere is way easier compared to trying to tell government officials what we want, especially when we’re not that well-versed in the law. Talking? Yeah, I’ll pass on that. But if it's just about sending a message, then I might give it a shot.",

I would emphasize that Bitcoin can help include millions of people in the financial system, especially those who do not have access to traditional banking services.Pretty much the same with the addition of trying to make a plan of how the government can integrate crypto to our daily lives. I would ask them to first define what crypto means in the country and for the country. In my country, crypto is quite a gray area and I think we will only truly progress once there are clear laws and regulations about crypto. This also makes it official and gives recognition to the community. It should not end there. I would tell them ways to possibly make crypto more accessible to the ordinary people and how they should spread proper education re crypto. The education obviously will include smart financial decisions, technology advancements and how can crypto be used for our benefits. The government should not just focus on holding but also mining so I will tell them that.",

If you had the opportunity to speak to members of your country’s parliament or legislature about Bitcoin, similar to what Samson did, what would you say?I would say bitcoin is the simplest investment that anyone can afford, it is an investment that both the poor and  the rich can benefit from. Their are other investments which only the rich have the opportunity to invest and since bitcoin is an investment that everybody can partake in it, irrespective of one's financial state. If the government can grant free accessibility for people to invest bitcoin it will have a good financial benefits and in the this time inflation is skyrocketing it can be consider as a store of value  for those who want to go into longterm investment, better than when money is being stored in the bank.",

      "body": "If I'm given such opportunity to speak about Bitcoin on such stage, first of all I will start by clarifying them about some certain things about Bitcoin because not all the people sees and like Bitcoin as others do, so I would ask those that are always skeptical or sees Bitcoin differently to explain their reason or point why they think so because sometimes starting with a question with the audience is very important because it enables you to understand the areas they like or dislike about Bitcoin and from their you will find the opportunity to address that matter because it could be that such person needs an explanation to make them have a proper understanding about Bitcoin. So actually in as much as is very good to explain and show them the milestone Bitcoin has gotten to but that may not be important to explain to them because even after having such explanation to them and their question or wrong narrative they have about Bitcoin is not inclusive on the explanation that means that the person has not done anything or solve any problem and that will be contrary to my purpose of being there, which is why my centre of the discussion will be on the question and answering so that I would really know how they feel about Bitcoin through their questions because we all know that somebody who have not invested or take a little minutes of their time to read about Bitcoin can just wake up one morning based on the things they heard or saw and start saying bad things about Bitcoin so perhaps those are the similar kind of things I would loved to solve and addressed if I'm privileged to.",

If you had the opportunity to speak to members of your country’s parliament or legislature about Bitcoin, similar to what Samson did, what would you say?Let's say I'm standing in front of the powers that be, the people who make the laws and set the rules of the game. I smile at them and give the following speech. \"Ladies and gentlemen, you have a lot of power in certain areas, but you do not own the world. The globe is divided into individual states, but these individual states are, in fact, abstractions. All people belong to a single human race, they mate with each other and the result is healthy offspring. You are representatives of different states (abstractions), but at the beginning of this millennium, a new supranational entity was born - global cyberspace. It was created by people, from different states, but it is something greater than each of your states. I proclaim the Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace. (Noise in the hall.) I demand a separate representative for cyberspace in the United Nations. (Noise in the hall increases.) I demand recognition of the status of Bitcoin as a global decentralized protocol for the transfer of value in cyberspace!  Individual countries have no right to regulate Bitcoin because it is no longer under your jurisdiction!\" (Indignant cries, gendarmes with carbines run to the podium. My further speech is drowned out by the noise of the hall....)",

I will also let them know that, just like every other investment there are ups and downs, however this does not cancel the fact that there will be no growth, letting them know that there are sessions attached to this investment, it could be the bear market or the bull run, however it all depends on which part of the divide you're coming from and how best you want to approach the market.",

This is because now many projects are in the name of crypto and many people are entering, but it turns out that the project is only a fraudulent project, Ponzi and Money game.
