Just go to https://bpip.org, enter your name in search field and you will find bunch of info, including merit count in the last 30/90/120/150 days.And no worries about your question being odd as I also manually counted merit when I started applying for signature campaigns since I didn't know about the existence of bpip.",

      "body": "I also recommend the BPIP extension. It has a lot of nice features, not only nice stats in your Merit page.It shows who is DT, it shows who is inactive or banned, it adds quick links to helper pages (ninjastic.space, loyce.club, bpip), it helps quoting from locked topics, it offers (if you want) even dark themes.It's of great help.Yes, it tells that it's beta and sometimes show inactives that have just became active again, but the glitches are small and few.",
