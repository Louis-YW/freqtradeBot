IndiaThis is quite  true , most of us  ( 90%) among others understands English even if its not fluent we aren't speaking it though , although it  might not be accurate while expressing them in words just as the owners.  However, I found  the use if pidgin much more useful in the aspect of sensitive  stuff in which we don't want majority to quickly understood our statement,  it could be very useful though as most of our pidgin could be translated sometimes with  patience and careful reading of pidgin contents.  Nigeria is a different ethnic country itself, so if we are to speak our native languages  o guess we will have to divide  the board into group and sub groups  as the major language still have sub languages  .  Nevertheless, I guess the pidgin is almost understood by individuals and its more of a scattered English   so we could twist some Content we feel like we don't want someone who is just glancering through our posts to understand  quickly , I guess I'm a fan of chipping in pidgin at some areas of my content but English  is more satisfactory",

Having said that, i don't have a problem communicating in the two accepted languages in this local board (English and Pidgin), right now i am using English, another time it is pidgin, it basically depends on my mood and what i want to say. I think we've had enough discussions on the language of use in this our local board, let's move on.",

I no blame Loycev for discouraging you from translating his thread,  his decision may have been born out of many past experiences with many of other Naija local bord members who had translated his threads before,  who have followed almost similar pattern of writing which make their work look like copy of each other works,  and that is what many Nigerians are doing,  once they see one person do a new pattern and it got attentions,  everyone will jump on that pattern just to grab whatever reward that os available,  but if you put in extra efforts you will always stand out. So based on the thread,  if there is no law that mandates you to seek the original thread owner of your intention to translate the thread, you can go ahead with your translation and let see what you have to offer based on your claim of bringing in a pour pidgin version here,  and I can see that from the way you write in this thread.",

Also, to some authors e dey mandatory to get their consent before translating their topics. An author don complain to me before about a user wey translate him topic without him approval and for that reason, him no appreciate the translator effort.

And for those wey dey do di translations dey use different words in many of their choice of words. Dis use of pidgin English in dis our local board, we don talk tire so we just let everyone to use anyone they can. Everyone dey bring different different ones. Some say make we no dey use abbreviations and Nigerian pidgin English e dey full with abbreviations so we no even no where we dey for nowTo use abbreviations for pidgin English na the worst thing to do especially for forum like this where one go need to express himself so that others go understand. I no really they bothered about whether to use pidgin or not because to me once a true Nigerian see the pidgin English words used, e go relate immediately and follow suit for the matter wey they for ground.",

      "body": "If is about maintaining a traditional language as a culture, you are right but the truth is that Nigeria does not have a traditional language rather we technically adopt the use of the pidgin English intended to be a unifying general language which yet not everyone in the country could flow with it but doesn't mean those who can't flow with it doesn't have their own local traditional language.I will doubt to who so ever to say that pidgin has a dictionary proper way of spelling. What the pidgin does is recognize is to just spell the World with which ever alphabets as long it can be understood by those who speaks the language (pidgin).Remember this is a borrowed language collaborated with some local traditional languages English language and the slangs.The best part of writing in the pidgin is to atleast make your alphabets pronounceable at when creating word (s).The essence of this local board is not a compulsory of breaking down or mandates that we must communicate with the pidgin language here rather it was approved and created because * It is a cordial respect to recognizing the citizens of Nigeria in the sense that they have been in much qualitatives and has contributed effortlessly to the reasons why this platforms existed* An encouragement considering the volumes by which Nigerians has speculated the Bitcoin technological systems and the appreciatable number of Bitcoin users in the country Nigeria in a global comparison.* Also as we could have enough privileges to argue, deliberate and discusses about the occurances specifically about our governments, individuals, societies and globally. So, it is assumed that we merited it and honoured that we are liable to communicate relaxingly and comfortably communicate with our pidgin English language (that is willingly to those who chooses to go with the pidgin language).On the other hand, there is nothing to be made secretive in this board and not even in any other Local board as long it is translatable.Bet me, a lot is us has visited other local board sticking to their traditional languages but yet we could be angle to read and understand what they are talking about through the use of translator technology.I have come across a thread one of the merit source @CryptopreneurBrainboss made making it clear about that the pidgin language is being comprised in the local board in the sense that some members doesn't make clear and readable in their contexts so, it is likely not mandatory that the use of pidgin language must stand in use.That is to say if you mak constructive words with the pidgin here, there is an alternative to flow with the general English everyone can relate with.So what is most important here is that for we to make constructive and quality discussions that would render positive measures to the platform as a whole and not where we could just catch fun.I sincerely don't mean to oppose.",
