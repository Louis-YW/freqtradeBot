Like I said, try using the Preview button. It literally solves what you want to do without posting the thread. It doesn't limit you at all.",

Drafts are deleted after 7 days.It's not really reliable for saving your work though. I expect you'll lose some draft if you frequently click \"Preview\" button.I'm not sure about on mobile but you can hit control+s after pressing preview on PC browsers and they'll save everything for you. Maybe a screenshot and a copy and paste is best for mobile (you can then import that into notes).I think the limit for posting in archival was hero member accounts plus, not sure if it's still the same (it's likely mods moved anything for people under that rank).",
