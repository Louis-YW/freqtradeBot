Sirius' last post on the forum was in 2014, so he isn't active, he was one of the creators of this forum, but i do not know if he still has some control over it now. From his last seen, you'll know he still comes to the forum to maybe read posts, but not active anymore to make posts, and there are many old members like that.",

Sirius was admin till 2012 and later theymos took it over. As far as I know, Sirius don't have access to anything now.

Are there any other old users who are still active? In my very opinion I will prefer to characterize oldest (older) members exclusively to those who have been in the forum for over a decade and more in the likes of @Theymos, @Welsh, @OgNasty and many other under this category. Many of these members may not be active anymore probably for the past one year or more but am sure the likes of Theymos, Welsh and OgNasty is pretty active till date.",
