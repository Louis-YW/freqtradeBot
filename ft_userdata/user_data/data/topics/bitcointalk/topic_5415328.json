  "content": "Showing off one's money and accomplishments has suddenly become socially acceptable. People nowadays, particularly on social media, display their wealth and extravagant luxury. My uncle's friend, a crypto trader who primarily trades in bitcoin, was ambushed and kidnapped by unknown gunmen. He was released after a few days; they never demanded a ransom from the relatives; they thought he was missing and were praying and looking for him after reporting to security personnel.He was a wealthy young man who made his money through cryptocurrency trading and invests wisely in it. He was the type of person that is constantly pompous and flaunts his riches and online wallet savings. He stated that after they apprehended him, they took him to an unknown location and instructed him to unlock his phone and transfer all of his cryptocurrencies to them, after he had moved everything from his trust wallet to a centralized exchange. He exchanged his coin for fiat and was instructed to transfer all funds to another account, the account of another kidnap victim with them. They withdrew all of the monies sent to them using the victim's ATM card. They were both released after all this, after spending three days in captivity with them.People nowadays flaunt their wealth online, with no idea who is watching and tracking their every step. Not all of your close ones like you because you are wealthy; they may be looking for a method to take advantage of your wealth. Keep your wealth hidden from the public; you don't have to brag about how much money you have and how well you live. It's also worth noting that some people flaunt their wallets in advertisements in order to entice people to invest in certain projects. They do this to trick individuals into believing they have made a lot of money after investing in the project. When you see one posing as such online, check for a red flag.Cryptocurrency investment has gone widespread, and even people who do not invest in them are aware of its profitability. Even if you presume the person doesn't know anything about it, they can still inquire and be told how it's done. In today's digital world, be cautious and security mindful with your wallet and everything you do.",

I don't support the idea of flaunting one's wealth so others can see, the human mind is always corrupt that your friend that's always smiling with you might also have some ill thoughts toward you, so you flaunting your wealth might stimulate more jealousy. Your wealth is for you so you should keep it to yourself. And for him to have been moving with his phone that contains his coins is also wrong though it happened unexpectedly. For me the devices I use for trading or to hold my funds have never left my house I have a separate device that I use to reach out to people. I hope he learns from this experience not to flaunt his wealth publicly and also he should tighten up his security or he could also consider getting a hard wallet. ~Valar~",

The truth is that it is never a wise idea to flaunt your wealth anytime. Keep your riches to yourself. For one, others won't be happy for you that you are becoming wealthy. And, of course, others would only think of ways to get that wealth off you. So whether this story is true or not, the lesson is there.",

Did this person have a large enough sum for anyone to worry about it? Nevertheless, in 2017, I witnessed how a guy who was engaged in cryptocurrency successfully improved his financial situation. But out of his vanity, he began to behave very pretentiously, buying clothes in very expensive stores and leading a completely immodest lifestyle. What happened next? He attracted the attention of the tax authorities. He was not bothered by the militants, but the tax company found big violations, and the guy went to jail. Our parents teach us to be humble from childhood; why do some people not learn these lessons?",

And it took them even 3 days for all that?Not only that but they kidnapped another person and had the funds from the exchange sent to that person's bank account and withdrawn from it.Why? Why lose more time with this second bank transfer when it's going to be fairly obvious who were the guys that sent the money and who used the second victim's ATM card, even for the donut police to find out? Ok, I know some robbers are just stupid but here we're supposed to deal with ones that at least know a thing or two about currency exchange and everything else, it's just that, l mean, If I were a robber, I would just point a gun at him, make him unhand his smartphone, unblock it, send the coins to an address, and just to make sure smash the phone and the sim card so he can't do anything in the next 10 minutes. The most important thing in all of this is that if I ever get caught I would face only a robbery charge, not a kidnapping on top of that.Quote from: Asiska02 on September 29, 2022, 04:15:05 PMThey withdrew all of the monies sent to them using the victim's ATM card.

They can't withdraw large sums of money from the bank instantly, which is why they did it day after day.Ok, OP, help me figure this out.QuoteFollowing the recent circular issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria, in collaboration with the Bankers’ Committee, placing cash withdrawal limits of N150,000 for individual account holdershttps://financengr.com/nigerian-banks-atm-transfer-limit-2020-2021-withdrawal-limit-inclusive/150 000 Niara a day is a 350$ limit, which means in 3 days the robbers would have managed to get 1050$ from that ATM, does this make any sense for a band of kidnappers, maybe three or four to kidnap 2 guys for what, 250$ for each?They would get the same money by robbing a random guy working at Vodafone on his paycheck day!And with this we're back at the part about robbers being stupid!",

If the victim had separate phones/devices and kept the one having the 2FA at home, they would've been protected from theft somehow.Now, the issue of bragging brings me to that popular saying that those who have act like they don't have while those who don't have act like they've.
