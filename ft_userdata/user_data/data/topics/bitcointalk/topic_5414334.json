      "body": "The trendline diagram is a powerful trading tool and simple at the same time. I was surprised not to have seen it here until I started using it on the BTT. I hope the popularity will increase because many are solely relying on the indicators to trade. However, anyone using trendline should not use it alone, as many other confirmations are needed so that the trader will not look like a fool at times. What you had written might or mightn't happen, it is the market that has the final say. You didn't also write the breakout level of the trendline, so how are we supposed to know your breakout point to comment on whether it will or will not break the price? As for me, my bias toward Bitcoin remains bearish this week. But this would be reversed if 20483.67 and 21818.75 are broken upward.",

I think all these is bit messy and can only be use for a short term trade. For a long term all this looks too much complicated. What i believe is btc will test more bottom because miners still in profit. They will keep selling till btc price reaches their break even points of mining cost. Right now that price is around 13k and whale could take it further down to eliminate big future position. So my expectation is btc will probably test 10k or below that level once before gaining upper momentum.",

There is a lot going on in the world that is significantly affecting the economy which in turn has caused panic in bitcoin market. On top of that we have a massive FUD campaign (most of it well funded too like the $5 million Ripple paid Greenpeace recently to spread FUD about bitcoin) and market manipulation (the obvious sell pressure where they keep dumping to break the supports).Market has shown good potential for a big jump up and pushing it lower than $20k has proven to be extremely difficult. But if they don't run out of bitcoins to dump or not reach their maximum acceptable losses during this market manipulation we could see that support break and we could head towards $15k and lower too.",

It is not going to go up that easily. We could see a big accumulation zone from the whale and then a sudden dump to buy more from the last of the remaining diamond hands. In the bigger picture I am always bullish about bitcoin but this year it will be a hard one for BTC holders. I will not put in more money until the end of this year.",

Because if you look at bitcoin's past history and unless the cycle has change, then the bear market will continue up to 2023. I'm not trying to scare anyone, but that's what the market has been in the past.So as far as October 18th, still 50/50, it might and might not happen. There could be some events that will invalidate this TA, or it could really be that we might see lower lows.",

The major political events taking place today affect the economy in a bad way, and this will in turn reflect on the price of Bitcoin for sure, so given the current conditions I see that the trend will be mostly bearish.",

Even trendline can justify a plausible outcome, indeed it can be affected by market sentiment especially if we are in the midst of recession whereas more people are afraid that value on stocks and even crypto could go worse and the safest one to hold are fiat and stablecoins. Few days left on your trend timeline and could be something everyone is expected (hopefully something good maybe).",

And at some point, it's true as it holds from further going down. And when it went below that price, we will regain in back in just 24 hours.But now, it's very different, we keep on sliding on that support line that it became the resistance.
