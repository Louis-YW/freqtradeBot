This is interesting, finally I can make something on these shitcoins I guess ¬† Yes, it all happens automatically, you just set your price and our system does the rest. You will just need the contract, everything else is handled in auto-mode. Any delays, deadblocks, honeypots, delayed taxes, just high taxes, other hidden tricks etc. It will analyze everything in real-time and pick the right time when to buy for you, in fully anonymous mode. With speed that no sniper has. Also you in full control of buying price. You can set it up to buy at max +50% of initial launch price for example. If conditions is not right or launch is highly botted or pre-bought - our sniper will cancel tx gasless, even if it was already sent. Users not paying gas, fees or loosing anything. We also have a buying schedule so anyone can schedule as many launches as he want. Completely stress-free experience. ¬†We have a token on BSC already, launching on ETH on 26 August 20:00 UTC. More info here: https://revolution.def.cafe/You can join our super easy 1000$ Twitter repost giveaway as well, just repost this tweet and come up with a joke about our Alternative Sniping System (ASS). More here: https://t.me/defcafe_main/149931/150015Let us know if you have more questions!",

Extra funds reserved for possible price fluctuations in BSC CAFE's price during the ETH presale stage.

Whitelist spots will be distributed among PRO tier members and trusted communities.‚ùáÔ∏èToken Rate: 1:1 to BSC at launch on ETH. Means if you contribute 0.1 ETH, you will receive as many tokens as you would by buying 0.1 ETH on the BSC side at the moment of launch. Current rate: 8000 CAFE/0.1 ETH. The final amount will be fixed at the moment of launch.‚ùáÔ∏èTokens to be sold on Presale:¬† ~4-5.5 million, leaving ~4.5-6 million to be excluded from the total supply of 10m for staking rewards, thereby increasing the revenue share. Any excessive tokens will be deducted from calculating of staking rewards and used to provide initial liquidity to bridge0, for the price balancer and for possible CEX listings.‚ùáÔ∏èWhen and Where: 26th August, On https://revolution.def.cafe/ website. 20:00 UTC",

Please visit our staking page at http://stake.def.cafe and follow the straightforward steps provided.‚ó¶ From now on, staking rewards will be paid in their respective native BNB and ETH currencies on each chain. You can stake, unstake, and claim rewards. Remember to switch chains in your wallet accordingly after ETH launch. ‚ó¶ For those who wish to import their staked wallet into FTT and manage staking without switching chains, FTT will soon offer this feature in upcoming updates.‚ó¶ The first batch of rewards was converted to BNB and has already been automatically distributed to everyone's staking wallets. At present, there's no immediate action required on your part, other than re-staking. ‚ó¶ It's worth noting that the rewards displayed in the calculator represent projections for 2-3 months of growth. Rest assured, we are on track to meet this projection!üì¢ Stay tuned for next updates!",

The number of tokens remains exactly the same; only the symbol after the number changes.üíéHow can you benefit from that?Let's say that $CAFE on ETH is now more expensive than on BSC. In order to profit from this, you buy 10 $CAFE on BSC and bridge them to ETH. Your 10 $CAFE are now on ETH. The number of your tokens remains the same, but the price is different (since $CAFE on ETH is more expensive). Now, you can sell $CAFE on ETH and secure your profit! Such an action is called arbitrage.üíéBRIDGE0, our near-instant and cost-free bridge, provides users with the best arbitrage opportunities possible.Please read more about price balancing features, whale protection (as shown in the screenshots, the larger the amount of funds, the more time required) and other Bridge0 features here.If (https://docs.def.cafe/what-we-do/bridge0/#topnav) you are still have questions (or don't want to read) we are happy to answer here in TG @defcafe_supportbot",
