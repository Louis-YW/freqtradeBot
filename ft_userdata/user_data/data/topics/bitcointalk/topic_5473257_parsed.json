He also describes the scalability problem that existing privacy-preserving blockchains have run into and the thought process that lead to the design of the mutator set.Alan Szepieniec has a ph.d. in post-quantum cryptography from KU Leuven and is co-founder of the Neptune Cash blockchain which aims to bring mutator sets into real-world use to deliver a blockchain that achieves scalability, privacy, post-quantum security, and brings ZK-STARKs to layer 1.Presented at Hackers Congress Paraleln√≠ Polis 23.",

I believe Peter Todd suggested to include an MMR of the UTXO set in the Bitcoin block header? This data structure does something very similar but adds privacy by cryptographically hiding the link between removals and additions to the mutator set.",
