Microsoft ditched support for Windows 7 a long time ago. That means no new patches or security fixes, leaving your system vulnerable to potential attacks whenever a new vulnerability is discovered. If your hardware cannot handle newer Windows versions, I recommend migrating to a Linux OS. It works well on older hardware, receives regular updates, and is generally less susceptible to security threats.",
