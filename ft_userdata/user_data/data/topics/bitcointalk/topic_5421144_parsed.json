Nobody really wants to get a hold of that token right now so it's a normal response by exchanges since FTT has been devalued the last few days. Delisting it was probably also a way of \"helping\" the token's price not to drop even further hehe.",

With FTX probably going bankrupt, there is a high chance that all the FTT tokens become completely worthless and therefore it is a good measure of those exchanges to just delist the trading pairs of that token. I mean even though they were warning not to buy and sell FTT token for a few days now at least people are still doing in in the hope of a quick profit, just like they do it with Terra Luna classic.I just hope that the whole topic now slowly but surely cools off and that the rumors about other big exchanges also having financial trouble turn out to be untrue because if we see another big crypto company collapse then we are in for way lower prices than we are already having them now.",

The actions of the exchanges this time, I think they have been more drastic than the collapse of Luna, currently Luna is still trading both versions on the exchanges. And with this action can be considered as the real end of FTX, investors will no longer have the opportunity to get their money back.",

They should go first with delisting to protect users and their exchange reputation. Later if things are better, they can re-list FTT token again, it's not a big deal. They already have code packages for that and just turn it off or on depends on what risk they see.",

Exchanges are just being careful here, most probably they are already selling their holdings to avoid further losses, we should do the same thing.",
