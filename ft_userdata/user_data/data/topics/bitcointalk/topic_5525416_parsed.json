Have you read or heard of how bitcoin came into play? if no! then you need to read about the 2007/2008 global financial crisis which Satoshi to create bitcoin. And of course I will give you a better example of how bitcoin can serve better in every situation. during the hit period of Russian and Ukrainian war, someone wanted to leave Ukraine but has landed property all over the place hence couldn't travel or leave the country with them hence, she resulted to selling off everything and transferred all her wealth in bitcoin and had only a small hardware wallet to move with which has nothing to be questioned while leaving the country. (this is just an example) perhaps with this I think there is other money that can with stand such pressure much more than bitcoin, imagine having the fist currency during global crisis how many bags of it can you run with? I think this questions are the past of bitcoin, it's over 15 years and the world has been experiencing recession so what other recession can we talk about?",

How do you think bitcoin's market behavior will change in response to economic turmoil and can it withstand the pressures of a global recession?First we need to ask... What causes economy global crisis? Of course it is the governments. What also causes a monopoly marketing system? Same governments of course.How do succeeds on these manipulations? Because the above are centralized ventures and commodities which is being controlled by the governments amidst them having rivals against one another.So how would Bitcoin succeed not being affected on this crisis or regulatory scenario? Just as it maintains its decentralization potential which it can not be controlled by the governments.So apparently Bitcoin has been able to obtain economy valuables which investment expert's, countries and entities foresees it future respondents and had adopted it for economy reserve while still valuably optimistic since it digital potentials has been figured a most dominance globally across global crisis in both wars and economy shedding.",

      "body": "Recession is not always caused by the government, or any entity people are linking fiat to. Central banks are responsible for enacting policies which can help the economy to get out of the recession. This means when the global market is in a decline, people are more likely to save which means people are more likely to purchase precious metals and assets, like Bitcoin! However, depending on what caused the recession, this may not necessarily be true; several downturns or FED policies has similarly caused a decline in the price of Bitcoin.Now, people who are claiming fiat = bad and crypto is the solution + drawing comparisons to Cyprus’s crisis do not reflect the definition of a ‘global’ recession. Such incidents are largely localized and they’re probably of a huge concern if they were to happen globally. Should that happen, Bitcoin would be the best medium of exchange. Else, Bitcoin will survive, like any other asset but whether it goes up or down in price depends on how the market sentiment really is.",

Bitcoin is still BTC and will never be anything else, meaning Bitcoin has weathered a difficult phase in the world economy.After that phase occurred and the world economy entered a new phase until now, people slowly began to realize the function of the importance of having Bitcoin and they continuously tried to increase the volume of Bitcoin in their wallets as savings.This shows that the minds of intelligent people are already being put into practice, even some public figures have suggested that a large country needs to ditch other asset reserves and switch to Bitcoin.",

How do you think bitcoin's market behavior will change in response to economic turmoil and can it withstand the pressures of a global recession?Bitcoin has proved to be a safe haven during some poor economic conditions. Some countries have faced drastic drops in the value of the local currency and hodling Bitcoin instead of fiat has proved to be valuable at that time. Some people who kept fiat in banks during this period gradually lost a large part of it since it lost so much purchasing power. But people who decided to hodl Bitcoin during this period didn't only hedge their funds against inflation but also made good profits. This is the reason why even when the government is discouraging its citizens from engaging in Bitcoin, its adoption keeps increasing.",

How do you think bitcoin's market behavior will change in response to economic turmoil and can it withstand the pressures of a global recession?You can use the black swan event with Covid-19 in 2019 and its announcement by WHO in March 2020, as an example. Bitcoin was dumped on that pandemic announcement day, but after that it recovered well and the full bullish market continued very sharply.In future global financial crisis, perhaps Bitcoin will not be immuned against short term dump, and you must prepare for its dump, but if you can survive through dumping time, you will have good profit later with market rally.Bitcoin adoption increase with time is a very good support for new demand on Bitcoin, and supply of Bitcoin is limited, so new purchasing demand and new capital in this market will help Bitcoin price. Global financial crisis won't be comfortable time for all, but if you have reserve money for it, and you have bitcoin in your portfolio, after several years, I believe you will have very good investment ROI.",

How do you think bitcoin's market behavior will change in response to economic turmoil and can it withstand the pressures of a global recession?There is no such term as safe heaven during a global financial crisis. Whether Bitcoin is ready or not, depends on the severity of financial crisis. If there is a severe crisis, then no one has time to invest in Bitcoin and hodl, I even think that during severe crisis, people not only actively start selling of their coins but there will be a significant growth of crime rate and financial crisis can quickly turn into a much greater crisis.By the way, if countries save some part of their strategic reserves in Bitcoin, then it worth thinking. In that case, I would try to not touch my investment as much as I can unless I'm starving and there is no other hope for the moment. Overall, I think that during financial crisis, it's better to think about what business will rise and put all of your effort into that business instead of investing in stocks and cryptos.",

Global economic and political conditions affect the price of Bitcoin. But just as you have said,.the price will always recover after sometime. Long term Bitcoin investors don't care about the global instabilities because it will only take time for the market to recover. If I am keeping Bitcoin for one circle and above, I wouldn't give much attention to short term political or economic conditions because they are sources for FUDs. In some countries, you cannot compare the drop in Bitcoin with the loss of value of some currencies. I know a currency that lost almost 80% of its worth in two years.",

As I have said, we have been tested and pass with flying colors.Not only bitcoin, the entire stock market as well as gold also increased sharply during covid and the reason is because the government printed tons of money to pump into saving the economy. But for that reason along with the war between Russia and Ukraine caused inflation in the economy and inflation peaked in 2022. If I remember correctly the entire stock market and crypto market were selling off heavily at that time, only gold continues to rise in price because it is considered the only safe haven, the rest are considered speculative assets and suffer the same fate. And that's a small challenge compared to the great recession of 2008 or what World War I and World War II caused.",
