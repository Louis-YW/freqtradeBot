Who's asking you to do this?This is usually a scam trick!When somebody asks you to send the money using an irreversible method that's semi-anonymous in order to get money from them, alarm bells should start going off.Compare it to fiat money: if you meet a stranger you've never met on the corner of a street and he tells you to give hem a $100 bill and walk away with the promise he'll meet you at the same corner one day later and give you your $100 back + $500, but you have no way of identifying him or making sure he keeps his word... Would you do this?if the answer is no, then why would you give a stranger on the internet money on a vague promise you cannot enforce in any way?",

It's just not how this works, and the person asking you for money is 99,999% certainly trying to scam you.So, i guess it's a good thing you asked help before sending money... Usually we see people that have already sent money and now ask if there's a way to get their funds back (the answer is: no).",

It sounds like a scam, but it also depends on the amount. If you want to withdraw 1 BTC and they ask you to deposit a minimum of 0.0001 BTC it doesn't sound so bad, depending on who is asking you. If it's something you've supposedly \"won\" like a lottery prize, it's a scam, and there have been a number of them around here recently.",

To verify your (external) address with your account, you need to make a deposit from this address. Deposited amount will be added to your current balance amount and will be available for withdrawal at any time immediately. More information you will find on Deposit area in your profile.

In certain casinos they only let you withdraw by a method if you have deposited with that method, so there are cases where depositing is not a scam. In this case it is very clear that it is a scam. Well, truth be told, i'm not a gambler... I did test the tech side of a couple casino's in the past, and i do know that some casino's have some requirements when they give out free rolls or stuff like that... So, i have to agree (somewhat) that if a reputable casino gives you \"free money to gamble with\" but they do require you to deposit some of your own money in order to play with the free money, it might be legit... But i don't think this falls into the \"pay me money in order to withdraw money you already own\" category @OP: i know it might feel \"wrong\", but i guess you'll probably have to write of the $7000 anyways. If somebody is trying to lure you in with the \"pay me money to get money you already own\" scam, odds are very small they'll pay you anyways.Just avoid giving them any extra loot... Really, even if it's only $5, for you it'll be the difference between losing $7000 and $7005.If you want to protect the community and hurt the scammer, you should probably file a police report and open a scam report in the scam section in this forum (if you have any proof, like screenshots from the conversation). Bad reviews on review sites might also be a good idear....These things probably won't get you your money back, but it'll protect others from falling into the same trap AND hurt the scammers in the meantime...",

It's as simple as that. If a person starts the oldest scam attempt in the book ,the $7000 is already gone forever. The only thing you'd be doing is giving them another $5 out of your pocket.Really, you should open a police report and open a scam accusation in the correct subforum, tell us the url of the site  that scammed you (or their facebook, twitter, telegram, whatsapp,...) and provide screenshots. If we know the url, and see the actual text written, we can conclusively categorise this as a scam (eventough i'm actually pretty sure it is one, like >99%)But the bottom line remains that, in your mind, the $7000 should be written off. It's painfull, but that money is already gone. Everything you give them now is extra net loss for you.I have seen dozens and dozens of these cases over the years, the modus operandi is always the same (and it's exactly what's happening to you). And in those years i have seen nobody actually getting their money.",

Quote from: https://keetticoin.com/terms7.2 Withdrawal of funds is carried out from the cryptocurrency wallets of our exchange to other cryptocurrency wallets, which are not part of our exchange and are in operation of other payment systems after the procedures of confirming the ownership of the corresponding cryptocurrency wallet from the corresponding user About the right of ownership and synchronization of our exchange with the cryptocurrency wallet to which the User wants to withdraw funds. That they didn't mention in their ToC what that process of confirmation consists of may seem very suspicious, but that they require you to make a deposit before you can withdraw is a clear indication of a scam. After all, there are other ways to prove ownership without prior sending any coins. For example, they could have asked you to sign a message with a private key corresponding to that address.",
