  "content": "Hello everyone, I came to this forum seeking funding for a new business I am creating. I know a bot developer that is creating a very effective crypto gambling bot that people can use to deposit. They will be able to play various games like blackjack, towers, mines and can coinflip against other players. I have already invested around $1.5k of my own money into this, I have a few graphics being commissioned and I paid the bot developer to do some more work on the bot. I am seeking more funding for marketing and to continue this and to get a lot more people interested. A few months ago me and the bot developer ran a test with his bot that only had blackjack, we spent around $1k on ads through Discord dm advertisements and we were able to get around $30k in deposits and $10k in withdrawals profiting around $20k total. We closed it, split the money and went our separate ways. I can show proof of this, happy to explain further about anything but please add me on Telegram if you are interested.https://t.me/ronal64",

You still have the opportunity to finance your project by returning back the 20 thousand that you have already shared with the developer.",
