That would be a huge market cap, though one can hope.As has been suggested already, this is most likely squeeze by whales based on the recent improvements to the network. At least you got in relatively low, so your risk should be largely mitigated, especially if you take some profit.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on September 05, 2022, 11:21:33 PMI am fairly new to crypto and in July I took a gamble on terra luna classic when it was 0.00009 and it is now pumping.

This kind of growth is going to be impossible to sustain, I'm happy that your gamble is paying off but that is all what you should think about it, it was a gamble and you were able to win it, you should not get so greedy to think that Luna classic is going to reach those kind of prices, be happy with the profits that you got and move on, now you ask why is this happening? But most likely there is not a specific reason for this, and this is simply the result of speculators pumping the price.",

If you really dont want they why not remove only the capital you invested instead. In that way, you are not in loss or any potential loses in thr future since you out your money. That way, you could see if your decision is right after some time. Its always best to stay safe on cryptomarket. This is highly volatile especially lunc is a product of a failed platform.",

Months or years?I also noticed recently that LUNC is in the focus of a lot of traders at the moment. I recently tried out the Kucoin trading bots for the first time and there i noticed that Luna Classic/USDT trading pair has the biggest volume of all trading pairs on Kucoin which is pretty crazy to me as the project is pretty dead in my opinion. A reason for this high trading volume is also that most trading bot users are running it on the LUNC/USDT pair now because of the high volume and the high volatility which is great for trading bots.I would be very careful though with investing into Luna classic. With the current we are already at a marketcap of more than 2 Billion $ so prices like 0,01$ or even 0,1$ are completely unrealistic if you ask me. I expect a dump pretty soon.",

As for the common folks or those who don't have any idea and they just riding the trend, they better watch out and be careful because they cannot pull out their capital back once massive dumping occurs again.",

I can't say it was realistic but the pump can be possibly a trap. If I were you, I don't wait for the price to be that high, if you already have in profit at its current price, sell them.

Just be careful though, sometimes the dump will happen when you sleeps so chances are you are going to miss the profits. So if you have made profits already, there's no need to be greedy, just saying, as you might learn a very expensive lessons here in crypto specially that you are new.",
