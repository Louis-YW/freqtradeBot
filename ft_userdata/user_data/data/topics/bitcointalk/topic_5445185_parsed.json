  "content": "From time to time I get a subscription offer from EasyNews on my email... I wonder. Are Newsgroups still alive ?I think Newsgroups were good for the anonymity and speed... two of the things Blockchains are known for. But .... what aboutthe content ? Well, many of the webpages I used to follow have for some reason , disappeared ! Others are just impossible to find...google search does not help either, it takes you to fake spam sites that are potentially harmful. So after some months of waitingand thinking ( my fav site never came back ), I'm almost ready to try Newsgroups again. Full disclosure here, I'm looking for a specific version of Edius ( Edius 6 ) which is available for free to registered users on the Grass Valley site.Â  I did register my details on their site more than 2 weeks ago, never heard back from them ( my registration data needed to be checked and processed )I did try some free alternatives to Edius which did not work on my laptop, either my GPU was not supported or some other issue.So I guess Newsgroups are my last resort... if I don't find what I'm looking for, it's only a $5 subscription fee anyway.Thoughts ?",

      "body": "No man, Newsgroups were never about \"News\". It's basically anonymous file sharing. Much faster than webpages if you know what you're looking for. I think I will try it for the reasons I explained in my first post. Webpages sometimes die and never come back, old programs get discontinued, etc.But it's true that for the most part Newsgroups have been replaced by better ways of sharing content.",
