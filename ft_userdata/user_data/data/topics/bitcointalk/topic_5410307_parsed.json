Need help from forum.On 15th August I was trying to download the crack version of Spider-Man Remastered from some torrent site.

And on this night my trust wallet got hacked and transfered all my fund(around 80$ coins). Second day my Epic games email was changed and today I saw my instagram email was changed and my telegram Id have required a verification password. I lost access from my mobile but  luckily it is still there on PC . On the other hand, I used some airdrop bots to contract with the owners of some projects and from bot links went to their groups. I really don't understand whether my problem is from airdrop or from this cracked file . I think It's not supposed to be from the bot because I don't participate in any airdrop, I just used the group link.I am really afraid about my forum account and also for my Binance exchanger. What am I do now please help me . Should I take new windows setup on my computer and reset my mobile? If my google keep is hacked then it will be all over for me now what are my initial steps? Please help me by your valuable advise.ThanksCrypto Library@cryptolibraryofficialI feel really ashamed for doing this foolish workafter changed the email post that pic",

By the way, you shouldn't download torrents on the same PC where you have crypto related stuff and even if you have to, at least start using reputable private trackers to reduce chances of downloading something harmful to a minimum.Quote from: Crypto Library on August 18, 2022, 05:33:45 AMI am really afraid about my forum account and also for my Binance exchanger.

It's pretty stupid to use a computer, download torrents, and combine some kind of financial business. Any hacked version of something can't just be altruistic help for those who don't want to pay. This always carries viruses that will wake up the user at an unexpected time.O.P. Split your computer into two systems if you can't afford two devices. I will not be smart about antivirus.

I have a good fund on my Binance.Although it is not smart to use CEX as storage, it actually saved you this time because you obviously did not access your exchange account while your computer was infected, most likely by some keylogger or even a remote access trojan. Considering that you only lost $80 and that some of your social networks were hacked, I think you paid for this lesson very cheaply.Bitcoin and pirated software do not go together, because it is one of the attack vectors that hackers use, so you will have to change your approach to the way you use your computer and what you do while you are online.",

Once opened, the shortcut executes a number of PowerShell commands that infect the system.You must scan all the files after downloading them from any torrent site as most of them are attempt to gain access of your data with corrupted files so you must be safe on your end.Quote from: hugeblack on August 18, 2022, 11:24:47 AMAs far as I know, Trust wallet is available on the phone, so no matter what type of virus it is, it is difficult to hack your phone, but let me guess that you did the following: - You keep your seeds in digital form or in an unencrypted file - for example, a .txt file. - Kept all passwords in a file or used the same password. - You copy or type the password after downloading that app.The last one seems to be the case as first thing malware do is install keylogger to your device and whenever your type something they have the access of your wallets and this might happened with @OP and there are risk associated with these pirated sites which should be avoided at any cost.",

Need help from forum.Yes, most probably those cracks you downloaded have downloaded some more \"tools\" that have helped the hacker.After the cleanup I recommend:1. Consider making a small linux partition only for crypto stuff (with a browser, maybe a wallet too); Linux Mint is very easy for Windows users, many other flavors of Linux are not that bad either.2. Consider buying a hardware wallet for your funds. You seem to not be knowledgeable enough with your computer security, so it may be a very good direction.3. Stop using cracks / hacked software.

You are lucky that it was just $80 and not your entire life saving on crypto, else it would have been a very expensive lesson that you have learnt. There is also an important lesson for everyone to learn, so as not to make same mistake as OP. The solution to your problem has already been given OP, plus forum members have been extra kind to give extra tips for you not to find yourself in this problem again. If you have not faced these sort of problems, It is in your best interest to also take note of the steps to take so you don't find yourself in same problem OP is facing, you may have a lot more than $80 in your possession.",

You seem to be doing many things wrong when it comes to crypto but also basic computer/internet security. Luckily, you enabled 2FA on Binance, which prevented the hacker from accessing and emptying your exchange account. Bitcoin is all about self-custody and being in full control of your money. This incident proves that you are not ready for that. I would never recommend keeping crypto on exchanges, but if you can't protect yourself from malware and you are easily tricked to download and run potentially dangerous files, maybe it's best if you leave your coins on Binance and allow them to store them for you. We can recommend hardware wallets or cold storage, but are you going to start using those? I am curious: are you using a genuine or pirated OS right now?",

Until maybe 2-3 years ago, I used pirated W7 and until I had HW I kept everything in hot desktop wallets and I traded on some exchanges and I was never hacked because of that.Of course, this does not mean that the danger does not exist, but it is much more likely that malware/viruses will be picked up just as the OP did. In addition, W10 can be used without a license with some restrictions, and the license itself from legitimate sources sometimes costs less than $10 - which is still a lot of money for those who live by the philosophy \"why pay when you can have it for free\".",
