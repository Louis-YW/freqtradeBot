  "content": "Shaker.financeTrusted and safe bitcoin mixing solutionsAfter around half year of development our team is proud to show finalized project. Official project domain is https://Shaker.finance Mixer has two options: standard mix with 1-1.5 % fee and clean mix with 3-4 % fee,you can choose either one . Minimum mixing amount is 0.005 BTC, maximum - 20 BTC per transaction  Standard mixThis mixing mode is made for crypto holders who are looking for fast, reliable and inexpensive mixing.  In this case you will receive money of people who used mixer before you. Choose that mode if you  want to save on transaction fees but still remain anonymous and safeClean mixThis mode allows crypto holders receiving completely clean and anonymous Bitcoins that come from cryptocurrency exchanges and/or miners. Choose this mode if you want to receive completely clean  coins with lowest available AML score percentageWhy Shaker.finance ?   -  Two mixing modes: standard and clean, choose either you prefer   -  User-friendly interface: website UX and UI are thoroughly elaborated   -  Step by step mixing process: user can see at which mixing phase he is in   -  Open statistics: in the mix monitor section you can see chart & latest mixes volumes   -  Small min amount: only 0.005+ BTC is required to start mixing!   -  No limits for max amount: Send big amount and mixing will go smoothly even if it's 10 BTC!   -  Each address is active for 7 days: users can send coins for mix to each address for 7 days   -  Possibility to recover session using only link that is unique for each session   -  Forums topics: we are open for real feedback from real users and have topics on forums   -  We don't store logs! logs are deleted after mixing process has finishedHow to use Shaker.finance mixer ?   1. On the main page choose one of two mixing modes: standard mix or clean mix   2. Input from 1 to 2 addresses that will finally receive cleansed bitcoins   3. Send from 0.005 BTC to the service mixing address you've received   4. Wait for 1 confirmation for the mixing process to start. Mix will take up to few hours   5. Get cleansed bitcoins to the specified address/addresses, you will be notified in the  website interface as wellIn case you have questions related to mixing pm or write to jabber shakerfinance@exploit.im (preferred jabber, not always on forum)",

In the standard mix mode user will receive coins of previous mixer participants, in the clean mix mode - clean coins from exchangesQuote from: SFR10 on July 07, 2022, 02:22:13 PMQuote from: Shaker_finance on July 04, 2022, 01:58:16 AMIn this case you will receive money of people who used mixer before you. Choose that mode if you  want to save on transaction fees but still remain anonymous and safePersonally, I wouldn't label it as \"safe\" if it's going to create a bridge between someone else's previous history and the other user!Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 04, 2022, 01:58:16 AMThis mode allows crypto holders receiving completely clean and anonymous Bitcoins that come from cryptocurrency exchanges and/or miners. Choose this mode if you want to receive completely clean  coins with lowest available AML score percentageI had a brief experience with a few analysis software tools in the past and IIRC, \"most\" exchanges returned with medium-risk ML scores!Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 04, 2022, 01:58:16 AM   -  Open statistics: in the mix monitor section you can see chart & latest mixes volumesIf I were you, I'd remove that section completely [it's not that hard to connect the dots if everything you've listed in there is accurate]!Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 04, 2022, 01:58:16 AM   -  Unlimited max amount: Send any amount and mixing will go smoothly even if it's 10 BTC!A signed message would be nice For the standard mix mode it's relatively safe, you won't get your coins but will get someone else coins that's the idea[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

Essentially, it'll lead to fusing two different digital footprints together [even if there's a single hop in-between] and that could go wrong in various ways [e.g. when an analysis company traces those transactions, there'll be collateral damage].",
