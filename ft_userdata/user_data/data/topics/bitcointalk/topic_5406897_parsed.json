Bitcoin added about 72% of its value as it  increased drastically before it eventually started falling back in May till September. I don’t really know how this year is going to turn out now because of the present dip.

The market is favoring bitcoin upside, but we do not know what will be the next, the price may continue to increase, or maybe decrease further. I read in a news that bitcoin miners are not selling and if more people are not selling, this will favour bitcoin price to increase, but we are all just predicting the price, which will favour long term holders certainly.",

What should users say? Ask yourself, and you will not be mistaken, because you have been right in the past.Otherwise, these are banal answers that have already been advised thousands of times here. Of course, bitcoin will grow. Of course, it is worth investing in it. What's new you said?The question is different; no one knows the exact time, and even this question already looks somewhat obvious.",

We do hope Bitcoin price will reach new ATH, there's no certainty - especially for when will that happen. In theory, the 4 years cycles still look good... but, again, there's no certainty. That's why I advise you be careful with the financial advises to others, since sooner or later some may blame you for their loses.",

If bitcoin goes up, we could see it go to 50k in a week, 100k in a month or so, its not impossible, so its never \"too late\", but if its not going to go up, it can stay at 20-30k range for another full year. So there isn't a reason why we should think we could figure it out, we can't. Just realize you can't, buy as many as you can afford, and wait until it inevitably goes up \"eventually\".",

You are asking a question that can't be answered. The crypto market is very volatile and no one knows what is going to happen next to the price.You said that you accurate predicted the price of bitcoin and when it will reach the all time high. Did you just randomly guess it and got lucky? Or was your guess based on some facts? If it is the later, then why not \"predict\" what the price of bitcoin will be by the end of the year?",

I expect a global recession to strike in the second half of 2022. This means that the crypto winter would most likely continue for the next year and a half of maybe 2 years. The BTC price might increase temporarily to levels above 20K or even 25K, but there won't be enough bullish momentum to push the price up to 30K-40K. The greed and optimism on the crypto markets cannot reach the 2017 or 2021 levels. Just HODL and enjoy your life.

So the sentiments is very much negative, but just like in 2018, and if my memory serves me right, we have a few occasional rises leading to December. Not huge but enough to see the price going up right after and before Christmas and then New Year as well. So of course, if we are going to look long term, at least in the next bull run, the price is still very cheap and good buying opportunity.

Yeah right  It would have been nice if you were able to predict to us again where the Bitcoin price might end up for this year. The only prediction everyone already knows is HODLing for the long term and you will surely make profits, other short-term predictions have mostly turned out to be inaccurate or is there anyone that predicted that Bitcoin's price was going to spike yesterday? and besides, I believe that this is not a reversal.",

It seems you have a good feeling for the crypto market, why not trust your own intuition this year again? Listening to other people can be helpful sometimes but it is still only a prediction, and if it goes wrong than we hate ourselves for listening to other people. I prefer to take other people opinion into consideration, just not to trust blindly other people. To me it seems that the bitcoin is already in a recovery state, the price recovered a lot since his lows this year. Right now BTC is up 15% within the last 4 weeks. I would still advice to hold bitcoin because the price will likely keep rising after the summer break, and it's still cheap to buy bitcoins compared to last year.",
