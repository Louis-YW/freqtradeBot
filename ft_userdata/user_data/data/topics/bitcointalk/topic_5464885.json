Nah to help spread the Bitcoin message to all nooks and crannies. Them say the best way to spread gossip nah to use the pattern of \"tell a friend to tell a friend\" , and while the government of the day dey use all their might to stem the growth and widespread adoption of Bitcoin by introducing strident rules and even passing out FUD, people still dey make use of the media to counter their efforts. Even if no be everybody wey go start to use BTC dey pay for goods and services, at least I believe say time dey come when nah majority of the population go use.",

As good as it is, there is also a bad side of it, which is advertising fake exchanges that we don’t know about, so I will encourage everyone who sees a new thing talking about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to try to DYOR before using it to avoid being scammed.",

But however, I understand how O.P must have felt to see BTC which he/she just got introduced to been promoted by content creators, which have always been the main promoters of Bitcoin within and outside the country from day one on all social media platforms. So it's okay for newbies when they see Bitcoin been promoted outside the regular Bitcoin environment to be excited, which I'm sure that's how O.P must have felt.",

One thing is for sure, when something is trending, comedians, actors/actresses, musicians tend to use them for their craft more to get the attention of people to their content at that moment. This shows how important bitcoin has influenced the society and the need of it that it is been used for making online videos already.",

And the way the word is spreading the embracement of Bitcoin is also increasing which is the goal.",
