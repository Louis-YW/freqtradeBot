If you want people to trust your exchange, make it listed on Coinmarketcap and other sites exchanges are listed.As for now, I can not advice anyone to make use of your exchange, it is still of high risk. Your exchange is not yet reputable and not safe more than it to be seen as one that can lead to scam.",

Your best partner!all this sounds like just another ordinary advertisement. I did not find anything about who is behind it, only some text on the website that you are from Lithuania. I am not convinced that you are legal.You started in 2022 year, but you are for sure the \"largest and most unique\" in whatever. do not think it is pointless to exaggerate in such banalities that are very easily verifiable.you must emphasize in capital letters that KYC is mandatory for using your service.I saw on your website, that you present yourself as a BestChange partner, but I can't find you on their website. is there an explanation for that?Quote from: Charles-Tim on July 21, 2022, 08:32:35 AMWhy is your exchanges having similar name to Crypto.com exchange? I don't think crypto.com has the exclusive right to use the word \"crypto\" in the domain.",

There are hundreds of exchanges and yet having distinctly different domain names just like Binance, Coinbase, OKX, Huobi, FTX and many others. Before any of the exchange will arrive at a particular name, they will try and check if the name is similar or not to other competiting organizations and only arrive at a in unique name. New sites that are having almost similar name to existing ones are usually scam sites.",
