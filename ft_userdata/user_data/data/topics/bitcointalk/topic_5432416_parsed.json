Best,Andrew minerjones telegram is \"minerjones\" the problem with telegram is that there can be many accounts where the display name is \"minerjones\" you have to look at the profile to see if it is actually the \"@minerjones\" username.I am pretty much 110% sure that minerjones would not scam you.  I can also tell you that the legitimate \"minerjones\" account is still active and not deleted - having talked with him just this morning.it could also be that the bitcointalk.org dm you sent to \"minerjones\" and received a screenshot of on telegram was not from the real minerjones.",

Did he receive funds from the buyer? did he send the coins out?",

Best,Andrew Any chance you'd post the screenshot of the DM you sent (that he sent to you) here? Or BTC addy/ TX ID? Also curious like the other user said how you went from selling something for 40btc to sending someone 26btc. Super interested in how this all happened, hope you keep us up to date!Thanks,Jambo",

In this case I think there is no way @minerjones was in any way involved in the communication you had via Telegram.In any case, sorry for your loss.

Best,AndrewWell, that sounds a bit arrogant to say even if you are a billionaire, half mil$ is not an amount you can disparage. something here sounds fishy for some reason, 1. MJ responded to you on the 25th saying it's an imposter so why did you finalize the deal afterward? 2.  who the hell is shipping cas25 by mail? that's the most outrageous and irresponsible to do. 3. how come you can't intercept the package and retrieve the coins?",

If you have a transaction you could share as many people on the forum can do their magic. If the loss is because both coins were shipped to scammer, then probably police can track better and is going to be very difficult for scammers to sell these coins as they are \"marked\" as stolen. If this is case, I hope you recover them soon!Regarding scammers having access to minerjones account, my opinion is they dont and used some trick to make you believe that. It would be interesting if you could share all the details, but I guess as they removed their telegram accounts all data is wiped?? In any case, if they have access to PM is just as \"read\" because otherwise it would be easier to scam just sending PMs and they wouldnt need telegram... Thanks for sharing",
