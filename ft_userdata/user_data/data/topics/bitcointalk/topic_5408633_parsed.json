  "content": "Crude oil has dropped below $100, the first time in months after touching the highest level since 2009, at $130/barrel. Oil prices have dropped the past two months, with both Brent and WTI Crude trending below the $100 level ($91 for WTI and $97 for Brent oil). According to Oilprices.com, consumers have already seen a slight relief in gas prices, dropping from the historic average of $5/gallon down to $4.16. Haven't checked in other European countries, but in Greece it has only dropped a few cents till now, I'm expecting it to drop within the next week though (from €2.45 to €2.20 in my area at least). It is believed that oil could fall below $90 if inflation persists, something which is highly unlikely to change since it simply keeps rising, driving leading to large price increases in basic necessary goods.Have you seen any significant drop in gas prices in your area? Will oil drop even further, despite the ongoing war?",

If the trend for oil goes down, I'm sure that there will be a massive domino effect and hopefully it goes to the other industry players that they'll have a roll back as well.Since with all of the rates have went high, I know that when it comes to roll back prices of goods there's a slight difficulty. But, if the trend goes on, I hope that most of these companies will have a consideration and follow the trend as well of decrease in price.",

I'm not expecting a miracle to happen anytime soon, since the exchange rate of EUR/USD is almost 1:1, but a slight relief is better than nothing.The main concern is the rising inflation, which isn't going to stop anytime soon, everyday goods are seeing major price increases day by day.",

One is in China then American Mississippi Delta and finally, Niger Delta in Nigeria, China and America Developed their Deltas to the standard level but Niger Delta in Nigeria is left over to decay. In fact it is a squalor in Nigeria and crude oil is found and exploring in this dark area of the country. If I wish there is no crude oil in Niger Delta.

Here common people need to make protests and several other contempts, only after hard opposition we'll experience a small drop in the price.When we make such efforts and lower the price, once again the global price per barrel increases and the same will be imposed on the price.

As of now, the government owned refiners such as BPCL and IOC are incurring losses close to $0.20 per liter of gasoline, because the authorities have refused to increase retail price. The cost of production remains at around $1.40 (including taxes), and they are selling it at around $1.25 per liter. The government has refused to reduce the taxes any further. Some of the losses are offset with imports of discounted crude from Russia, but it is not enough. The three government owned companies (IOC, BPCL and HP) are estimating their losses at $1.35 billion just for the first quarter of 2022-23.",

Because if out of those 2.45 50% are taxes there is no way even with oil at zero for gas to be under 1.40-1.60 with all costs. Just checked for Greece and the cheapest gas ever was at 1.28, during the lockdown.Quote from: Ultegra134 on August 03, 2022, 07:50:49 PM It is believed that oil could fall below $90 if inflation persists, something which is highly unlikely to change since it simply keeps rising, driving leading to large price increases in basic necessary goods.It could fall even further and not because of inflation alone but because demand destruction starts to crawl in.Once people are afraid of spending or can't afford to spend, there goes the demand so down with the prices but of course, it's not a complete circle until some providing the goods will go bankrupt or shutting down as they have no customers, squeezing offers and then the matter starts to get in somewhat of an equilibrium. That is if not some other shit happens somewhere in the world.That's why things like the barrel at $300, like some doomsayers think, can't really happen because once the price hit that there will be nobody affording it, nobody buying so the prices will go themselves down, it's basic economics.Quote from: DrBeer on August 04, 2022, 11:37:51 AMUrals $93.31 per barrel everything depends only on ruZZian oil Yeah, $74.74 as we speak, and that's the price that some pay, most buy it well under the price for hefty discounts directly at the source.So much for the billions in extra profits, they are on the same level as 2018 now.  LE:One hour later, and WTI dropped below $90, for the first time since February 10th.",

I recently sold my 4 liter Toyota Prado, I am going to buy a hybrid car for long trips, and an electric car for city trips, exclusively for the home-office-shop-home cycle, which is 90% of the total trips.
