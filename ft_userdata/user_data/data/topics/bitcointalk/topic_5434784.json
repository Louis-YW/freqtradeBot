  "content": "This does exist via several plugins but it is all centralized meaning the provider of the plugin would setup a service where they collect the USDT charge a % lowest I found was 0.28% per transaction and then keep it on their wallet till you request a withdrawal. Which kind of beats the purpose of decentralization. Only thing I found out which allows own wallet connection is BTCPayserver using their free host provider sites to propogate transaction and auto deposit the amount to your electrum wallet. The problem being electrum does not have USDT acceptance, while besides this BTCPayserver accepts connection of Cobo valult, Coldcard, Wasabi, Specter desktop, Passport not sure if any of these wallets are similiar to electrum which runs on your laptop but can accept USDT deposits??I also saw another thread about omniwallet & coinomi but not sure if they support automated checkout with verification if coins recieved and mark order as completed once it verifies on wordpress website? Also not sure if they have any intermidiary charges and centralization as the other services I described earlier?",
