      "body": "So let's ignore for bit the website and the discussions on who you are and just do math In your FAQ:QuoteWe offer standard hosting for .08 per kW/h fixed for up to 4 years. For a limited time, you can \"buy down\" your rate to as low as .06 per kW/h for a small surchargeFirst offer is:QuoteAntminer S19J pro+ 120TH/s$2,205.00PriceLet's take the worse, 8 cents kwh, 80kwh a day, that's $6.4, 120TH/s at 6.1 cents per th/s according to viabtc, it's $7.32.That's 90 cents so we're looking at 6.5 years of ROI.It gets better with the promo, $4.8 costs, $7.3 income, ~880 days of ROI, way better.For the S19xp we're looking at  $4.3 cost and $8.5 income, so again under 1000 days.My humble opinion, find a way to make the limited time permanent otherwise nobody who buys and hosts with you can find a way to make money!",

      "body": "Hey thanks very much for your comment and feedback! .08 is for clients who want fixed long term rates, our biggest clients have a long term perspective and want 1 less factor to think of so they choose to pay a surcharge upfront and secure .06 for up to 4 years. They are looking at minimum of 3 years of mining and they believe in BTC and the price going up over the next few years.Lets be honest, you do not buy BTC and HODL nor start mining if you don't think that the price of BTC will be worth more in the future than it is today. If a client wants a 12 month hosting agreement we offer .07 with no buy down payment. So the miner price is $1950 (updated today) +170 for hosting so $2120 total. This includes all fees, shipping, power cables, tariffs, customs, set up and installation, you name it. You will be paying $170 per month to have hosting at .07 per kWh. Hosting is not for everyone, if you have free electricity or a personal hydrodam in your backyard you are certainly better off mining yourself, but this isn't reality for most people. Most people have electricity rates of .10- .50 cents which is very unprofitable for mining. We have a client from Czech Republic who switched to hosting with us because of very high electricity prices and he is very happy now. He is mining with L7s. This is also what I recommend to people until the S21 comes out next march-april. Although we still have large orders for S19J pro+ 120th. The halving will be a big factor in profitability for bitcoin miners. Thanks for your time and for contributing! BTCBTCBTC",

Okay, so let's do it BTC way.$2205 buys you a contract for the S19J or 0.0816858 BTC.Before electricity costs, the S19J at 120TH/s will earn you 0.00000229 BTC x 120, that's 0.0002748 per day.Those are 297 days of earnings in BTC without power.Now let's assume the price will go up in batches of 100 days of x2 to x16, that's $432k....... so common!Batch one, current prices:Electricity prices are 0.0002370, you earn 0.0002748, so you make 0.0000378x 100 , 0.00378Batch two, bitcoin x2 upElectricity prices are 0.0001180, you earn 0.0002748, so you make 0.00001568x 100 , 0.01568Batch 3, bitcoin x2 but the halving comes so you earn fewer coinsElectricity prices are 0.0000600, you earn 0.0001374, so you make 0.00000774x 100 , 0.00768Batch 4 , bitcoin x2Electricity prices are 0.0000300, you earn 0.0001374, so you make 0.00001074x 100 , 0.01068Batch 5 , bitcoin x2Electricity prices are 0.0000150, you earn 0.0001374, so you make 0.00001220x 100 , 0.01268At the end of 500 days, you have earned 0.0505, if you had bought BTC you would have had 0.0816!It will take you an additional 300 days to gain the rest in BTC.And you know, we assumed the hashrate so your share in BTC stays the same, which at 400k pe coins it's impossible as people will resurrect S5 to mine.QuoteWe have a client from Czech Republic who switched to hosting with us because of very high electricity prices and he is very happy now. He is mining with L7s.I already told you the numbers are not that bad for other sha256 deals, what I was pointing was the money pit of the s19j at 8 cents kwh.",

      "body": "I agree that the S19J pro+ 120th is a riskier investment then the L7 for example, which I highly recommend. Or waiting until next year when the S21 comes out, but we still have investors throwing large amounts of capital into these S19J pro+ 120th by the hundreds. At the end of the day, my goal is give self miners that are paying .10, .12 or higher per kWh a better option by offering a trustworthy hosting experience.Because even .08 kwh is better than .10 kwh.Thank you for taking the time to write, I appreciate it.
