Be it exchanges or gambling sites, any coins that you want to hold or save, do not leave it on any centralized site. The money that you want to use for trading should only be left on exchanges. Also only the money that you are using to gamble should be left on your gambling site account.",

It's happening all the time, arguably at the same rate that it happens in regular exchanges. The thing is that people are just not that fond of hearing about exchanges losing millions of dollars in 10 minutes due to hacking than a couple thousands of accounts from different gambling sites losing all their funds through a hacker attack. It's literally just easier to fetch data and scoop about exchanges than it is to gather news about gambling sites crashing due to hackers. It's not a matter of what's more secure and what's not. It's all about which one's going to make more clicks in the long run at this point. And since exchanges are a hot topic in crypto right now, they are getting the brunt of the work.",

They both have their own threats and risk they are prone to and that is where they strengthen accordingly. A casino may be bothered by hackers or scammers, but am quite sure it would be harder to bother much bearing in mind the physical nature of their modus operandi. They may be more concerned with theft, vandalism. For hackers they got these days too and the best is who they hire.It is not same as an online exchange that one might find it hard to track down the individual, mostly in the decentralized network. The security measures will be more strict inorder to dicepher bugs, AI , human, hackers.",

Im aint saying that exchangers doesnt have but since to those lots of possible holes then maintaining could really be a pain in the ass.Comparing the number of exchange hacks and casinos then there's really those differences but come to think that if im a hacker then i would definitely be targeting exchangeplatforms knowing on how many millions been circulating on this platform rather than on a gambling site.

And for obvious reasons, and even if there are like thousands of gamblers around at a certain period in a casinos, I doubt think it can beat the numbers of crypto traders in a given hour or even in a minute.^ This!First, the number of users plus the amount being held and that is the reason why gambling often hack more than exchange.Because the potential financial gain for hackers in breaching a cryptocurrency exchange can be immense due to the large sums of cryptocurrency held and traded on these platforms in exchange. Plus another reason could be, that crypto exchanges handle a massive number of transactions within short periods, potentially creating more opportunities for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities. Probably that was a reason and I think it is not all about security.",

But that's not the case. Anyway, what's the point? Do you mean crypto exchanges do have poor security compared to gambling sites? No. It's just that when exchanges got hacked, they received more attention as they were an exchange platform, having more users than gambling sites and playing a factor in the price behavior in the crypto-market. If gambling sites are being hacked, the news isn't that big that's why you end up thinking that exchanges have worse security compared to gambling sites. Overall, based on my own view, gambling sites are more prone to be hacked since then than crypto-exchanges. Again, it's just that when crypto-exchange gets hacked, the news about that is big in most cases.",

I even believed that security in crypto-gambling sites is much more breachable than in exchanges. If you don't see casinos got hacked then maybe you are staying only at the one side of the internet. Generally, there are also lots of crypto-gambling sites being hacked, and at most cases, that situation will just come and go and then will be forgotten.",

The most major exchanges, such as Coinbase or Binance, are established financial institutions that deal with transactions worth billions of dollars on a daily basis. Of course, they take security extremely seriously, which sometimes makes it tiring and annoying. Binance requires two separate 2FA authenticators just to log in to your account: one code from your phone's authenticator app and one through your email. I had once requested a 2FA reset on another reputable exchange, and the whole process took over 2 to 3 days to verify my identity.Both industries have suffered from exploits that are almost impossible to prevent, as hackers keep finding ways to penetrate the top-notch securities of these institutions. Fortunately, I don't recall any major recent hacks, but I might be wrong as well.",
