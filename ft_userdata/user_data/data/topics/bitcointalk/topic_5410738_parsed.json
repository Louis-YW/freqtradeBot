  "content": "Recently I decided to take a work around my neighborhood since I am on holiday. I have just walked a few distance when I saw an inscription on a particular wine shop. It reads Bitcoin Accepted Here. It was like a dream come true because I have never seen a physical business accepting Bitcoin. I have come across some online, but never seen something like this wine shop in my whole life. I quickly rushed into the shop and asked the cashier if what is written is true and she told me that I can buy any wine with Bitcoin. But the she has to call her boss who was not around for us to carryout the transaction since she knows nothing about Bitcoin. I was not happy because her boss have not taught her how to receive payments in Bitcoin. I had to take these memorable pictures and promised to come back later to buy maybe a bottle of wine. Although some countries have Bitcoin ATMs and countless businesses that accepts Bitcoin. But in my country such businesses are rare and I have never seen or heard of any Bitcoin ATM in my country. Maybe it might be because of the restrictions placed on Bitcoin by the Central Bank, but I am glad that businesses are taking advantage of the opportunities that Bitcoin offers. Gradually my area would have more Bitcoin friendly businesses.     Maybe if you are visiting Nigeria, just note that you can buy wine with Bitcoin from a physical wine shop.",

Every shop or store that starts accepting Bitcoin contributes to the overall success of Bitcoin adoption not just as an asset or store of value but as a real currency. The store owner should have just left a QR code or an address for customers to make payments with. A simple instruction to the employees could been enough even if he is not around. But maybe it was just newly offered. So there will be those information in the coming days.",

Maybe only in terms of investing and not in payments.",

From the tune of everything been said here, this seems to be Nigeria (if am not mistaking) and am happy that such businesses have started accepting Bitcoin despite the central bank restrictions. But however, business is always a step by step process, and one has to start from somewhere, because in as much as you couldn't find a Bitcoin ATM machine or POS been put in place by the owner for transactions. The wallet address is actually still an option to be use for transactions, and it works perfectly",

Support that business with regular purchases and also encourage your friends to support it to, because if you do not do that... the owner will decide to remove that payment option. We had a few businesses in my area that also decided to do that, but he got almost zero transactions and he also struggled with BitPay and then when I visited the shop again... he stopped accepting bitcoin as a payment option. Also ask him to give a small discount to people that pay with bitcoins, because that will be the incentive for people to rather pay with Bitcoin than Fiat currencies.",

In my country as well, there are small businesses accepting cryptos as mode of payment but unfortunately, some of them stopped because they are afraid of the idea that the continuous 'downfall' of the price would lead them to bankruptcy ( which is quite sketchy on my end, like why?). But my take on this is that, those owners who accepted and atopped might probably be new ones in this industry, who are still not resilient with tokens' volatility. Quite sad, still a long run for sure. Let us hope for the better.",

One improvement that they can do though for the owner of the shop is to educate at least one of his staffs how to accept btc payment. Because it will be a bottleneck if someone wants to pay btc and his boss is not around. Even if the address is owned by the boss, he can surely see the incoming tx even if he is not physically present in the shop.
