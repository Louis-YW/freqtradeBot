  "content": "Innovator Fair Launch Overview: Â The Innovator Fair Launch is designed to ensure a transparent and equitable distribution of INOV8 coins on the Innovator blockchain. Here's how it works:Initial Coin Release:A total supply of 6 million INOV8 coins has been minted on the Innovator blockchain.The distribution of these coins will occur in a series of trenches, with the first trench serving as a \"price-setting\", releasing coins into the chain supply, consisting of 500,000 coins.During this initial release, users can deposit tokens into a designated contract (a list of which will be provided).The funds raised through these deposits will be immediately used to create liquidity for the INOV8 coin. This liquidity will be matched 1-1 with the amount raised, establishing a true value and market cap for the coin.This first trench is expected to last approximately one month, and by the end of this period, there will be around 506,000 coins in circulation.Subsequent Trench Releases:After the initial \"price-setting\" release, further trenches of 500,000 coins each will follow.These subsequent trenches will be offered over-the-counter (OTC) with vesting conditions. This means that users who wish to purchase coins from these trenches will have to agree to lock up their tokens for a specified period, from 2 weeks to 2 years.Vesting Discounts:Each vesting period will come with a corresponding discount and the coins will be released per block over the vesting period and the longer you agree to lock up your tokens, the higher the discount you'll receive. The maximum discount available will be 50%, but it will require a longer vesting period to access this discount.Continuous Staking:Importantly, users who participate in the new coin offering and agree to vest their tokens will still have the opportunity to stake their coins. Staking allows buyers to continue benefiting from the Innovator ecosystem even though their tokens are locked up.Benefits of this Fair Launch:Transparency: The initial \"price-setting\" release ensures a clear and market-driven valuation of the INOV8 coin.Equity: Offering discounts based on vesting periods aims to reward long-term supporters of the project.Liquidity: The use of funds from deposits to create liquidity ensures an active market for the coin.Participation: Users who vest their tokens can still engage with and benefit from the Innovator ecosystem through staking.The Innovator Fair Launch aims to provide a balanced and accessible opportunity for users to participate in the blockchain's growth while fostering a community of long-term supporters.for more details visit the Innovator website and join socials. https://innovatorchain.com/Don't miss this one big partnerships on the way",
