It is good to list down your skills and create an announcement thread. If you keep posting a single liner, you would get banned easily from the forum. We have a board called Services, you should use it and use it to the best of creativity. Almost all services on that child board doesn't go unnoticed.",

For someone who has plentiful knowledge about many things, hacking should also be part of such knowledge, and this work looks right for him as he can even earn more than he has ever imagined. I never even knew such Bounties existed on this forum until I came across your comment and then checked through the link. There are indeed lots of things for anyone who wants to try their coding skills and see to what length they can bridge a system security.",

I am waiting for an answer from youYou can't do all the work that's needed to be done because it's literally impossible for a human to do all the needed work. There are many fields which require educational background and experience and everyone can't just do those type of work. The only work you can do is the skills that you have acquired either via video tutorials or via practicing those yourself.It will be better if you share some of the skills that you have and you should also try to share some samples of your previous work so that the client may pay you for your services. If you are good at programming then surely you may get programming related work and if you are good at writing then you may get clients who are looking for writers. Additionally, you can also try your luck at freelancing sites as there are so many clients who want to have their work done by a freelancer. There's literally need of work in every field but they need only those workers who have the skills to do the work according to their specifications.",

Do you want to tell me now that you have all the skills required to do everything here. It can not be possible that you could do everything as it relates to work here because you can not tell me that you can be a developer, Web designer, programmer etc. all of these at the same time. Let us be realistic,  it is not possible to do everything even genus are fully specialised in a particular field were they can excel properly without mixing up any things for themselves. Nevertheless, you do not sound convincing from your post as it lacks facts. You have no portfolio, no past experience and you are a newbie that has not yet seen the four falls of the platform. I would advise that you put up these items I have mentioned if you are really looking at working here. People who hire job here do nothing but looking into your portfolio and past performance to know Your work skills before getting you on their team and if not nobody would see you as first impression matters here.",

I am waiting for an answer from youThis isn't the way to ask job from the potential clients or employers from the forum. You should incident what you can do, what skills you have and how much you're asking for. It's all about how you're going to sell to them and if somebody needs a help from you, they're not just going to give you a job but also going to hire you because they think that you fit with the criteria that they set for the job or task that needs to be done.While it is easier to apply these days, take that advantage and sell your skills and make everyone impress and regret if they don't hire you.",

You need to provide more details like highlighting your skills and experiences for you to find the relevant job you’re seeking, and showcase them. Employers can’t guess what you can do though, they don’t have any idea what kind of you’re interested in. If you have any specific jobs in mind, you should let them know and you are allowing them to match you with the right job opportunities.Have you already searched other platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor? You can search there for job openings that can match your skills and interests.",
