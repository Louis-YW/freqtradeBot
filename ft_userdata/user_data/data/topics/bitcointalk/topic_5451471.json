That's because, one day, the wolf actually comes to town and in this case, the most we could have  is a bearish market.It becomes a needed skill to distinct between them both and take necessary precaution if you must.That's for those that can't handle it when the market drops and your coin lose value.",

Their emotional turmoil easily sways them as the reality in front of them doesn't match their expectations.Everyone has their own pleasures. I'm certain that someone who has already gained immense profits from Bitcoin would not pay heed to any ranting from an anti-Bitcoin individual. For those who remain uncertain about Bitcoin, they simply haven't delved deeply enough into its intricacies. Associating with those who thrive off Bitcoin could be a solution to someone's doubts.",

The first decision to take if you want good profits.1. Investment should be long-term.  Bitcoin is always profitable when investment is long-term, buying in lower amount,  hodl till when the market rises. This may take time and this can only be achieved by exercising patience.Bitcoin can be short term, medium term and long term, depending on the situation of the market.  A short trade when market is crashing is an instant profit for the trader, he can then easily increase his Bitcoin portfolio by buying at a lower price.  We must always be on our toe to take advantage of the opportunity given by the Bitcoin market.Quote2. Not making attempts to time the market.  Timing the market is the biggest mistake any investor should think about,  this can result too much desperation to make profit that will make investment end bad. It will make sense to invest and not think to about when to make profit from the market. Lol, timing is crucial in the market especially when you are doing short trades.  I think people who will listen to this advice will lose big time.  Profit can be seen when you close your trade.  So without selling or thinking your profitability, what is the sense of investment?Quote3. Do not give attention or listen to anti-bitcoin. This can mostly have influence in the investment of young investors,  listening to people who are against bitcoin can make you feel you are doing the wrong thing.Always pay attention to news, Anti-Bitcoin even though against with Bitcoin investment, they also provide precious information.  So do not negate any information that is related to our investment but obviously, we should verify them before making any action.Quote4. Do not get worried about volatility (decrease). It is only for a moment,  it comes and go. It is just a distraction or threat to make people to take wrong decisions. bitcoin is highly volatile, I do not think the volatility of Bitcoin will decrease any time soon.  Btw, Volatility is the fluctuation of price, price decrease is equivalent to down trend or price dump while price increase is equivalent to a price uptrend or price surge.  Quote5. Top your portfolio when money comes in your hand. This should be with the amount you can afford to lose and not necessarily all you just earned.Don;t just buy randomly, you should choose when to buy, buying when the price is at its peak is proven to be catastrophic.QuoteThis is what I belive for profitable investment,  you can also add to what have here if I'm missing anyone.I do not think you will profit by suggesting not to think of the profit in an investment.  Profit is the main factor why we invest in Bitcoin.",

This may take time and this can only be achieved by exercising patience.Long term investment in bitcoin is just considered the safest or more less risky as this would save one from losing most especially by investors who have little or knowledge about it. But this doesn’t mean that short or medium term holding or rather trading is not profitable. The short term is even more profitable sometimes than long term holding for experience traders. But for those that have basic knowledge and are just look to save their funds against loss either by inflations then holding for long is the best option. Overall the best way to get profit off bitcoin solely depends on you, just DCA and take profits off when you feel it is worth it. Aside it just leave off your coins and don’t jump into trading because people are making profits off it.",

It is upto their understanding and the experience that makes them go in favour as well as against the innovation.Along with all the mentioned suggestions it is a must that you go with your own decisions. You've got good number of choice to make use of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, one shouldn't limit themselves with holding, people should try to find and utilise all opportunities. This gives better understanding as well as gives positive hopes on using cryptocurrency.Never look upon the charts when your plan is long term holding, because looking the charts will let you think of different factors that are moving the market. Just believe and go forward investing regularly with atleast a small amount.",

You can see how Bitcoin usually makes its new all time high after each halving and a new bull run.

Investment should be long-term.  Bitcoin is always profitable when investment is long-term, buying in lower amount,  hodl till when the market rises. This may take time and this can only be achieved by exercising patience.That's true! Bitcoin is profitable as an investment for those who can hold it for longer durations. Although, no one can actually predict the intensity of profits that comes from Bitcoin but it's still profitable for the long term investors. The duration of profits can't be known as it could be from few months to few years.Quote2. Not making attempts to time the market.  Timing the market is the biggest mistake any investor should think about,  this can result too much desperation to make profit that will make investment end bad. It will make sense to invest and not think to about when to make profit from the market. That's also similar to your first point. Holding for good amount of time is profitable for investors and buying at the right time is also important because if you buy late your returns can be less, but if you buy at right time you can have good returns.Quote3. Do not give attention or listen to anti-bitcoin. This can mostly have influence in the investment of young investors,  listening to people who are against bitcoin can make you feel you are doing the wrong thing.In any field of life we have those skeptical people and they just want to dishearten us. Those skeptical people who oppose Bitcoin and are against it are illiterates  who have less knowledge about its potential. And, with that limited knowledge they dishearten others from investing in it. Some people do that willingly for the marketing purposes as their main goal is to misguide innocent people so they might fall prey and buy their products.Your points are valid and you have definitely learned something valuable as a Bitcoin community member. I appreciate your efforts of sharing the tips with us as they can be helpful for many newbies. I found them interesting and true at the same time. Keep it up my friend and share more knowledge with others. The knowledge increases by sharing.",
