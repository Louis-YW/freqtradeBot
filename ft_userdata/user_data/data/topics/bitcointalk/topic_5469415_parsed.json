I spent $5 to purchase a seemingly worthless movie or music subscription, and I fall into the lower middle class category myself.I've begun to realize that I may be losing touch with the value of money due to exposure to the vast sums and high salaries of people online.

You don't have to restrict yourself from spending on things that are like for entertainment as long as that amount isn't going to eat a lot of portion of how much you've got. But if you're in that shoe where you barely afford to earn that amount, you must really tighten your pockets. Just remember the hardship that you've dealt with before and how far you've come now. It is okay to help other people to stand on their own when they're in need. Not everyone is fortunate as you at this time and I think that's enough motivation for you to be careful and remember how you should spend your money wisely.",

However, now I find myself spending more without a second thought.That is the answer to your question. Nothing is permanent in life and that is why they say the only thing that is constant is change. So you have moved from the other side to another side where you can spend without gnashing of teeth, your needs are now well taken care of, to sustain it you have to reduce spending frivolously and channel spare or unused or needed money into investment. Try to diversify your source of income and by that you can still meet up with the kind of life you want to live, you can extend hands of gift without thinking twice.So build a source of income outside from signature campaign earnings, remember nothing last forever but if you have sustainance outside the forum then you are good as building good economic growth for your self.Unfortunately, government still has to be blamed for not providing the less privileged with good life but to turn them into beggars and leaving them on the mercy of themselves. It is the struck of luck and working smart that you are able to live the life you are living.",

If, for example, $5 is enough for cooking needs for several days, use it to spend it because the income in those few days can be used for other needs and when it is sufficient, the proceeds from the next income can be used for savings.",

However, now I find myself spending more without a second thought.A glance at the value of money or fiat when you used it in the past was called the Time Value for Money, meaning that the value of fiat will continue to decline due to inflation and inflation is the source of all diseases. So to cover the value of the past the government creates interest. The value of $1 In the past you could spend it on various goods, but now $1 has no value whatsoever to pay for.If we discuss more broadly the emergence of Bitcoin, its supply is limited, even if it is mined until it runs out, the maximum amount in circulation will still be 21 million BTC minus the number of people who have lost Bitcoin in the past because they forgot to recover it. seeds or because they die, etc. With limited circulation, Bitcoin is the only asset or currency that is free from inflation. Compare $1 BTC 10 years ago and what you still have today to $1 US 10 years agoCan you afford to buy goods at this price now?

For the lower middle class, they do not have sufficient shopping options because to fulfill their daily needs they need to sacrifice other needs. In this way, there is no shopping wisely unless the shopping costs are still low.",

Just like what I mention above. It’s very hard to control yourself to not spend once you saw item that interest you that you can purchase online. Convenience is what makes people spend more. Or just do proper budget management so that you can only have limited budget that you can use to purchase miscellaneous things.",

This can help you in monitoring your spending habits and increasing your awareness of where your money is going. Another excellent idea is to practice delayed gratification. When you have the urge to make a purchase take a day or two to contemplate whether it's something you genuinely need or simply a passing impulse. However don't be overly harsh, on yourself if you occasionally make mistakes. Striking a balance, between enjoying life and maintaining responsibility is crucial.",

Remember that your salary can not just increase unless your task increase as well. Meaning as you begin to earn more, you must work more. Consequently, you need to spend more to keep good care of yourself by eating enough healthy foods and proper health care to keep you strong so you can do more work to earn more money efficiently.It's not possible for all to become rich and limiting yourself to average lifestyle by not spending enough when you have the means is wickedness to self and stinginess.

Because sometimes we won't be able to control our waste when we have too much money in hand.

If you saw that woman begging for 1$ then you should help her with $10 because God has given you the money. In our religion, we have this belief that we are not being tested by God when we are poor, instead, we are being tested by God when we are given wealth or fame.
