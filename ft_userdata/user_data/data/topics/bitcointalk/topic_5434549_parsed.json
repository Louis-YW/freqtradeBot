  "content": "IntroductionSparkFi is like a mutual fund powered by decentralized blockchain technology. SparkFi raises capital by issuing tokens and uses the capital to generate yield for investors / token holders. To generate yield SparkFi uses various strategies such as trading and investments in financial markets. SparkFi team is highly experienced in financial sectors and with their expertise in market analysis, capital is invested in various markets such as FOREX, Stocks, Commodities, Metals, Cryptocurrencies etc to generate yield. The yield is distributed among the investors / token holders using smart contracts on public blockchain.Deflationary TokenomicsSparkFi‚Äôs native token $SPARK has a total supply of 100,000 tokens. $SPARK has a 1% fee on every transfer and the fee is automatically burned. This makes $SPARK token deflationary, total supply keeps decreasing over time and it makes the token more scarce and valuable. It also encourages investors to hold the token rather than trading / selling it.Official LinksWebsite: https://sparkfi.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/SparkFiOfficialDiscord: https://discord.gg/dmDJkHNMFrTelegram Channel: https://t.me/SparkFiTelegram Chat: https://t.me/SparkFi_io",

      "body": "Dear SPARK community,We are happy to announce that our official $SPARK token contract and $SPARK Staking contract have been deployed on BSC. üî•üîπ$SPARK Token Contract: 0xAA5B4246c442b5DdAEc6AbAef25e35f3BC68433düîπStaking Pool Contract: 0x078Ba63B94EB9643db950344F2B8f431E4590dC5Our Token contract holds an auto burn function which burns 1% of the total transaction value made. For example if you transfer 100 $SPARK then at other end you receive 99 $SPARK and 1 $SPARK will be burned forever.In case of depositing in the staking platform , the 1% burn is not effective. So when you deposit $SPARK in the staking platform there is no fee collected from you. But when withdrawing $SPARK from staking platform 1% burn is applied.We have also added a switch function to control our burn function. This will allow team to turn off burn function on special occasions and cases. For example, during distribution of $SPARK tokens. In future we will deploy our cross-chain bridge to enable $SPARK in other chains such as Ethereum and Polygon. For now this is all. Once again welcome to SparkFi Community. Get the opportunity to earn USDT just by staking $SPARK . Thank You and have a great day!",
