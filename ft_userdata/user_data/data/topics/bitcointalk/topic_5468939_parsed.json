The topic is really about nothing. By the way, exactly your post in this thread is an offtopic that has nothing to do with the subject of the topic.Here's a link to the topic in ninjastic https://ninjastic.space/topic/5467560",

As far as I remember, this is the first topic I deleted while I was moderator of this section.Well good job on your first action as a moderator, right to the point, I don't know why I am destined to argue with P&S's moderators. 😂 if you only deleted one topic, then that's it, also why are you going to other threads threatening people to delete their posts if they don't stop something? Lol, you are a moderator for God's sake, not a morality police.You should either post a sticky topic or edit the existing one to set your rules first, then anyone reading it would know not to post there at all.Since when do moderators need to make their own rules to remove offtopic from profile topics?  Offtopic is forbidden by the forum rules (point 2). And the morality police had absolutely nothing to do with it, they were breaking the forum rules.Further, I did not threaten anyone, but warned these users to stop off-topic, going to personalities with mutual insults. Insults are not prohibited by the forum rules if they are present in thematic posts. But if there is just mutual insults that have nothing to do with the topic, then such posts should be deleted.Have you read these posts? No? Then I will show you some of them.Quote from: https://ninjastic.space/post/62935384BADecker-Fuck you.Quote from: https://ninjastic.space/post/62935352BADecker-Go take a shit down your ugly mother's throat. Hitler loves you. Satan loves you. You are a piece of shit. And when you go to Hell, you will revert back into an infant where the demons will do the most heinous things to you that you can or can't imagine? Have you heard of the brazen bull? That is where when you go to Hell, you in your infantile state will be shoved inside a bronze bull and a fire will be lit below the bull. Your screams and cries will be converted into bull noises, and your punishment will be completely just. You will deserve your punishment because you have been completely and utterly consumed by evil. Oh. And before you pass away, there will be another pandemic caused by your species' unwillingness to implement the bio-safety protocol that I have been advocating for in the past but have been discouraged from supporting because fuck humanity.Quote from: https://ninjastic.space/post/62933000All of you fuckers are fucking stupid and worthless pieces of shit who deserve to suffer and die in the next pandemic. Oh. And the next pandemic will come because I have decided to no longer make sure that biological laboratories are actually safe. Nobody else has enough understanding of anything to realize that we need this. You all therefore need me. You have not been grateful that I have advocated for this so far, so I have decided to stop advocating for this. I guess this means that we will certainly have another pandemic. And after you die in the next pandemic, you will go to Hell, and in Hell, you will revert back into infants and after you become infants, the demons will do the most heinous horrible things to you.-Fuck you you fucking fucker. Go fuck your dead mother at the cemetary.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.I think that's enough.Quote from: digaran on October 02, 2023, 07:22:41 PM...don't worry too much.Oh, I'm not worried",

Lol, you are a moderator for God's sake, not a morality police.That is literally what a moderator does. You should let Xaolex do their job without this much drama so early on. You're complaining about a thread being deleted and still complaining about the mod using a different approach to get users to stop going off topic and explaining why some earlier posts will be deleted.Quote from: digaran on October 02, 2023, 07:22:41 PMmaybe my last post was off topic to you, but it's not off topic to the previous member, and in general is 100% on topic.  It's about politics after all,The are the mod, and interprete cases based on their understanding of the rules. The fact that you disagree with that does not make them wrong.",

Is he dead now?No so the old clip is fairly worthless as is your topic. But if you find a new clip less than a month old. You could  do a new thread sayin Biden is still waving his hand in the air just like a crazy old man. At least then you would have  an up to date thread and not a thread reffing to an old YouTube clip.I get the I hate Biden group and I get the I hate Trump group.  In my mind two old fucks with a foot in the grave asking for my vote.Hey better yet try that for a new thread.",

Yes, he’s a liberal, but he didn’t delete posts because he didn’t agree with the politics (conservative stuff), he did because of stuff like “low value” of kinda “off topic”.  He would tell me how stressful it was dealing with people making false accusations about being biased.  I knew him well enough to know he legitimately was just trying to do what he felt Theymos would want out of a mod/what was best. People are too quick cry wolf too. Give the new mod some time, there’s a learning curve. And have some compassion, imagine having to read BADeckers posts daily.",
