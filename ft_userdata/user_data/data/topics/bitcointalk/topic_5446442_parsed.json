  "content": "Guys today all on twitter we can see that there are rumors about Metamask is going to give an airdrop for their users. So as I can see they will give it to users who use Metamask ages ago. And also these points will be consider too as I can see, So my advice is as ARB airdrop they will definitely consider the activity history and wallet created history.As points we can consider these things;Those who did number of transactions at least worth 1000$+Use their bridge number of timesWho staking/staked Eth in their platformPeople who buy or sell NFTS using MetamaskHolding assets in their wallets and etc..So what do you guys think about this? Am I missed anything? How about your transaction history value in Metamask and are you ready for their airdrop?",
