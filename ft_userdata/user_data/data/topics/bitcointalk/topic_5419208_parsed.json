If they offer the same services and dispute the same public, all of them should follow the same regulations, otherwise, what incentive companies will have to follow the rules and pay taxes to the government?In my opinion every businesses should be allowed by the government to start unregulated until they become profitable and solid. Only then they should start following the local requirements. Anyway, inevitably it would happen at some point, being impossible to stay informal forever.",

      "body": "The problem is not POGO itself but the implementation of the law or prevention of the operation of illegal POGOs in the Philippines. As you said, there are ways to legally operate POGO in the Philippines that will benefit both the POGO and the government of the Philippines. The government acknowledges the money they can earn with taxes and everything coming from POGO can help the economy of the country. They are good sources of funds if they work legally. The benefits for both parties are overwhelming if only the POGO is operating legally. The problem only arises when POGO is not legally registered. Most often as well, illegal POGOs are the ones that bring in illegal workers through tourist visas. MOst of the problems are from illegal POGO.I think the Philippine government should not declare it illegal but be more active and vigilant in preventing illegal POGOs to operate in the country. Illegal operators do not only affects the country but also other POGOs that operate legally. They pose a danger in their own niche. If the Philippines is capable of tracking down and closing illegal POGO in the country, then the legal ones can continue operating.",

Of course the government will not want to miss out on profits from the legal side of this entire scheme but they should also find new ways to regulate and protect the online gambling because there are too many vulnerable groups which need to be protected. So instead of declaring it illegal (which I very much doubt they intend to do since this is a cash cow for them), they should be exploring new options. Usually I am not the guy who is on the side of regulators but sometimes it is needed.",

However, as time goes by, there are a lot of negative connotations with Philippine POGO, and if I'm not mistaken, some of the Chinese are illegal with no documents whatsoever and then again, correct me if I'm wrong, there are kidnapping of Chinese nationals and it points out to those who are involved in POGO. It could be legal in a sense, but the government will have to gauge if they want to continue with it or not at this point.",

Many countries are doing that, they're allowing tourists to gamble and don't allow their locals to be the customers so that income would just come in to them whether it's online or offline/local gambling. Next, if they've taken a license and they've been through with authorized agencies and applied for it, there's nothing wrong with that as they've been through the process and complied with requirements.Lastly, a government that's earning a lot from it legally just have to raid those illegal ones that are operating into their jurisdictions to remove those competitors and that will also force those illegal operations to be registered and apply for their licenses to become legal.",

It's better to be legal than to operate illegally because many of those workers are also Chinese folks that have tourist visas and are considered also illegal immigrant workers.

But this is something where only government can intervene and stop such activities from being carried out. Because at the end of the day, it is affecting the tax revenue of the government itself. They can easily monitor and block the offshore gambling platforms in their country by installing a firewall just the way China is doing it. I believe that will help the country in scoring more gambling revenue from their own licensed entities and its effect will be seen and the benefits will be realized in an immediate basis. Unlicensed gambling is indeed a problem in the crypto sector as well.",

Instead of focusing to those which are not registered to PAGCOR, they chose to consider removing every POGO firms in the country which I think is unfair because there are those who complied but they were also caught by the tension to those who illegaly operates. Indeed there would be families to be affected by doing so, and I hope things would be balanced. But on my personal viewpoint, Philippines cannot really forcefully stop POGOs because the government benefit from it. That's how simple it is; things could be worked out as long as it generates money, sad to say. So maybe, bias would go to those registered POGOs to continue operating in Philippines. In my opinion, it is like with vaping and cigarette industries in PH wherein even if government are against it, they cannot stop its production because it has the largest contribution with taxation. And I believe it could go as well with POGOs.",

If the government will declare it illegal and ban it in the Philippines, surely, a lot of Filipinos will go unemployed which will make the unemployment rate higher, making a higher percentage of individuals relying on the help of the government aide alone. There are legally operating POGO in the Philippines already. What needs to be done instead of banning it is imposing strict regulations on POGO to determine which ones are the one legally operating their business and which isn't. Of course, if POGO has a permit to operate legally speaking, they must have the documents that allows them to do so such as business and tax permits. Tax is one of the revenues of funds of the government as well so they really must look thoroughly so other can't evade taxation. In addition, POGO's should be monitored closely because there are some POGOs which conducts illegal activities such as scamming and phishing as their bread and butter. In illegally operating POGOs there are even human trafficking happening and some of the employees are not compensated well which makes it a nightmare instead of a blessing.",
