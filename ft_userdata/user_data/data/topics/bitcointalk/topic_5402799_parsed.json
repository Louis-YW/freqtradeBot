This was stated by Pavel Durav, the founder of Telegram in his blog. It was claimed in a report about a month ago.If Netflix is ​​used in telegrams, then mobile users are really sad. Netflix is ​​usually run on a monthly subscription basis. As a result, the day of relief for netizens is over. The matter has been rumored for so long but Pavel Durav has sealed it.What did Pavel Durav say?He said that paid subscriptions are being introduced so that users can make better use of the most popular features of Telegram. This paid subscription allows telegram users to chat extra, not just share and upload high-quality media. Other benefits will also be available.According to the data provided by Telegram, the company currently has over 500 million monthly active users or monthly active users, and Telegram is one of the most downloaded apps for myLsks worldwide. This app is very popular among netizens. But unlike WhatsApp, Telegram does not have end-to-end encryption, so there is always a question about user safety. But why is Telegram bringing paid subscriptions?Telegram does not want to walk the same path as other companies. They want revenue from users instead of advertising agencies. I have a question for experts.If paid subscription is being introduced in Telegram, will it also be introduced in WhatsApp this time? Can you see the ad there?",

Only some new features will need to have paid subscription. And I think that the average user doesn't really need those. So I think that the paid subscription will be more like if you want to support their company, really.The most important part I've read is:Quote from: https://www.dignited.com/96300/telegram-premium-everything-need-know/All existing features will remain free: Current users have nothing to worry about. There will always be a free version. All current features will remain freePS. Please move this out of Meta, since it's not at all forum related.",

That sounds a lot like Discord. You can search up Discord nitro if you want to know more. I think the main differences are things like: being able to use different channel emojis in other channels, being able to have a different profile picture on your user account for each channel/\"server\" and better streaming quality - I doubt any of those really matter that much and the last one requires reliable internet upload speeds which most people won't have anyway..
