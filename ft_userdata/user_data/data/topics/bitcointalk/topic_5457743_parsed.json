  "content": "In Russia, there is a demand for digital deposites in pawnshops. According to information from forbes.ru, up to 100 requests for money secured by cryptocurrencies are received monthly. In this regard, the pawnshops asked the Central Bank of Russia to clarify the possibility of accepting cryptocurrencies as collateral on a par with gold. To which, the regulator didn't find grounds for banning such activities. For now.I remind that in Russia the legal status of cryptocurrencies has not yet been clearly defined. Most likely, the legislative framework will be finalized and transactions with digital assets will be regulated so that they receive the status of a full-fledged liquid collateral. And now, it turns out that pawnshops in Russia can accept currencies as collateral, and there are no laws prohibiting this.Currently, digital currencies are recognized as property only for the purposes of the laws \"On Combating Money Laundering\", \"On Insolvency\" and \"On Combating Corruption\", in other cases, \"legislation doesn't establish the legal basis for the circulation of digital currency\", says Central Bank of Russia.Also, in that article (I warn you, the text is not in English), a probable problem is voiced when it is physically impossible to transfer cryptocurrencies to a pawnshop for storage. It seems to me that this is solvable. It is enough for a pawnshop to create its own crypto wallet, to which the client's cryptocurrencies will be sent for temporary storage (until the borrower's debt is repaid).P.S. This is a slightly loose interpretation of information.Now let's move on to the question posed in the topic title.- Would you approve of the possibility of leaving crypto as a deposit in a pawnshop?- Has such a service not yet appeared in your country of residence?- How do you feel about the emergence of such new trends in the service sector?I think that this service in a pawnshop will not be possible without the KYC procedure, which few will like.Ready to discuss this topic?",

It seems that the deal would be heavily skewed in the borrowers favour. There would have to be adjusted terms in order for this to work.I suppose the above answers both of the other questions in the OP.",

So if you can use your bitcoin as a collateral on exchanges, on lending services, you can do it at pawnshops if they accept bitcoin. Pawnshops somewhat are similar to lending if I am right.If you ask me when I am a person who wants to use my bitcoin as collateral at pawnshops, I don't have rights to approve it. I am not the business owner/ operator.If I am a pawnshop owner/ operator, I will have to consider risk of Bitcoin volatility. If my taste is accept risk, I will accept bitcoin as collateral. Obviously, I will only accept it if my pawnshop's Terms of Service has a liquidation term.With a liquidation term, I might get benefit when I liquidate the collateral like buying a discount bitcoin. It is double benefit if I am a real Bitcoin investor too.",

      "body": "For me, every service in which someone gives its BTC for this or that reason is essentially wrong. Most of those who are active on the forum know what happened to companies that offered tempting interest on BTC deposits, and yet they were companies that operated at least somewhat in accordance with the law - while on the other hand, a pawn shop can literally disappear overnight and you can easily lose everything.Of course, there is also the issue of KYC and the protection of this data, but also the problem of personal safety if it were physical branches - which leads me to conclude only one conclusion, and that is that this is a very bad idea no matter how someone presents it.",

Or do they give you some back.If the price plummets back to $15000 and you walk away do they have any way of going after you?They don't have to go after you, they will do just as all those platforms when the value goes close to what they lent you then they will liquidate it and that's it, that's why they ask for regulation on this:QuoteYury Fedyukin, Managing Partner of Enterprise Legal Solutions, recalled that under the law “On Pawnshops”, the borrower transfers things to the lender for storage and his right to freely dispose of the pledge during the term of the contract is limited. Besides, some pawnshops even go as low as 30% when they give you a loan for gold so in crypto it might go down to 20%.Checking the website they offer in rouble $532.24 for something value at $925.30 so they might have enough coverage even with Bitcoin volatility!Quote from: BenCodie on June 27, 2023, 10:15:48 AMI thought about the same thing. It seems that the deal would be heavily skewed in the borrowers favour. Think of the situation when the coins go down 60%, you get liquidated and the next day it shoots back up to the original value and you end up with the $7k you got as a loan for you BTC. Not so favorable anymore, right?",

Generally, they pawn items they never expect to get back anyway. Pawn shops here only accept gold or expensive items with a resale value. I guess the problem is not so much people willing to pawn BTC but pawnshops willing to accept BTC volatility.It could even be a gamble. Pawn 1 BTC for maybe 30% value now, and buy it back when BTC is super high? You end up making money",

My decision will depend on the laws if me(pawner) will have some protection from doing so but if not, I'll choose to do it with some of my altcoins but not with bitcoin. Is it just me that I've got a different treatment for the altcoins that I hold than of course, Bitcoin? And if I've got really no option, I might just sell a little amount of my btc holding than pawning it, paying the interest and there's the volatility that the value might not be in my favor.Quote from: m2017 on June 27, 2023, 09:54:02 AM- Has such a service not yet appeared in your country of residence?Not yet but I think if it's with individuals that are also in crypto and I know them personally, maybe they'll agree.Quote from: m2017 on June 27, 2023, 09:54:02 AM- How do you feel about the emergence of such new trends in the service sector?This is inevitable, anything that can be attached to bitcoin and integrate it with financial services is possible.",

However, ensuring proper security and compliance measures, like KYC, would be crucial.Depositing your BTC's into a pawnshop is kind of similar to every other service in which you must give up custody of your keys, it is similar to lending and earning platforms and centralized exchanges, though these platforms are regulated differently and the purpose of depositing is different, but the risk is the same, not your keys not your coins.Customers complied to kyc in all of the centralized exchanges and crypto companies that have collapsed in recent events, but it didn't stop them from losing their money when the platform bit the dust. The message is simple, don't give away the custody of your BTC's for any reason, you may never get the coins back.",

Not so favorable anymore, right?Okay...but at what pawn shop does liquidation even occur? If a borrower pawns $10,000 worth of Bitcoin (let's say rate is $100,000 for argument sake, so, 0.1 BTC) for $6,000 cash, then the price tanks by 60℅, the borrower doesn't get \"liquidated\" they still need to pay the $6,000 back plus interest to get their 0.1 BTC back. Which, if they truly don't believe in Bitcoin at that point' they can abandon the loan for a $2,000 profit at this point.If the BTC goes up, repayment is obvious in order to get the higher valued asset back. Regardless of value fluctuation of the Bitcoin, the amount of cash to be repaid is all the borrower needs to worry about. 0.1 BTC is always 0.1 BTC and as far as I know - \"Liquidation\" is not a common term when pawning something.",

This serves as a proof, and the interest for the money borrowed with the gold collateral will be calculated. This is the procedure followed everywhere and the same gives trust on the service provided. In such a way if the pawn shop have the proper documentation, then it is good that we submit bitcoin as collateral and borrow money. However it has the highest risk than other forms of collateral as it is easy to destroy the trace of transactions using different mixing services.
