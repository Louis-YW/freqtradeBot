TODAY.. about an event that didnt happenheck he didnt even listen to the word of the video apart from a few snippets he took out of context to form an opinion today about a worry he then manifested in himself. that is meaningless todayweirdly he praises duplicitous actions that happened 5 years ago.. but thats just his usual game. emotional over the social drama of his favourite fan club vs those that whistleblow his fanclub.. and yea..

If only a few blocks are rolled back, it shouldn't be too disruptive for the ecosystem, because people are supposed to wait for 3-6 confirmations anyway.I personally think such arrangement is not likely, because miners wouldn't want to undermine public confidence in blockchain permanence, even for a big reward.",

CZ responded to say it wont do it for multiple reasonsif you want a better time line.. incase YOU forgot7th: they stopped trading for \"maintenance\"https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/11258393108910530578th: he done a AMA to explain why the maintenance event happenedwhere someone proposed TO HIM to do a roll backhttps://www.pscp.tv/w/1mrGmvjpbqBJy\"this morning alot of people have offered us support, and there is a few topics i will discuss in this regard\"\"the idea came from the community and i did not know that we could do that\"\"To be honest, we can actually do this probably within the next few days. But there are concerns that if we do a rollback on the bitcoin network at that scale, it may have some negative consequences, in terms of destroying the credibility for bitcoin.\"note: alot of people forget purposefully the BUT part. and the later \"decision to not pursue it\" within hours of the AMAnote: he had been contact by miners and exchanges prior to the AMA about them supporting him either in funding or doing a re-org try to put the conversations INTO CONTEXT he said he had funds so didnt need funding support and said he would not do a re-org that same day. listen to the entire conversations and also then do real research on who asked who what.. same day 8thQuote    After speaking with various parties, including @JeremyRubin, @_prestwich, @bcmakes, @hasufl, @JihanWu and others, we decided NOT to pursue the re-org approach. Considerations being:— CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) May 8, 2019https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/08/binance-considered-pushing-for-bitcoin-rollback-following-40-million-hack/..yep done and dusted in one day.. no activity... thus no eventjust social media drama between 3pm on the 8th of a AMA and hours later a \"we decided not to pursue the re-org approach\" the SAME DAY!!!how i have reminded you of the facts. have a nice daythis is not about taking sides. this is about seeking the facts and making sure people like idiots such as this topic creator dont try 3 years later twisting things.. about events that did not happen. and were just a few hours of social media FUD that should have died the day it started",
