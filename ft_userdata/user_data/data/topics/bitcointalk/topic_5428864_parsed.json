Probably not yet.By 2030 most likely will be true that it will be over that amount of 150 dollars,this coin had its all time high last year I think in 179 dollars so chances are as long as it can run smart contracts and be mineable which it is,chances are high for this coin to do well in the long term.The only problem which I believe is a major problem for all the cryptocurrencies in general is that in short to mid term they will fail to go to good levels in price,we have to be patient.",
