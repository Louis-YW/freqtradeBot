  "content": "https://i.imgur.com/zR2DZDe.pngGM everyone! We are pleased to introduce to you Uroboros. We are preparing to release a product that will be useful for experienced users and will be the starting point for many newcomers to the world of Defi.We want to give the user back the right to manage his money again by giving him a very simple tool to access sophisticated technology.Product OverviewThe Uroboros team plans to release two versions of the product — Version 1.0 with base functionality and Version 2.0 with extended functionality.Uroboros 1.0 will act as a DEX aggregator. The main features of Version 1.0 will consist of a farming protocol that entails the aggregation of farming facilities in DeFi space. The purpose of the DEX aggregator is to procure the most profitable farming and fixed offers, as well as to provide cashback for transactions (it gives you an opportunity to make money swaping using our swap2earn protocol) on the network while bypassing the need to purchase native platform and liquidity pool tokens.Uroboros 2.0 will act as an extension of the functionality of Version 1.0 with the addition of functions inherent to CEX platforms. Version 2.0 will take a step away from classical network features with wired bridges in wallets and exchanges (accessing multichain liquidity with our protocol and using our permission-less and chain-less wallet). Simplification of all transfer and browsing operations, as well as the expansion of exchange functionality for professional traders, are the main distinctions of Version 2.0 from Version 1.0.Uroboros Version 1.0 Key Features● Unlimited cashback on Transactions — The Swap2Earn model allows users to earn a certain percentage of cashback on the transactions they conduct. The cashback will be paid in the token that was exchanged. The larger the exchange amount, the more likely the user is to receive cashback. For example, when exchanging BNB for USDT, users will receive cashback in BNB as the original exchanged asset.https://i.imgur.com/NTAOzmF.png● Gasless Swaps and time saving — The lack of any gas fees on Uroboros saves users from having to buy native exchange tokens to facilitate the swap procedure. Commissions are paid only when exchanging tokens across networks. The fact that many centralized exchanges profit from their userbase using native platform tokens is not in line with the spirit of freedom; it is not what decentralization blockchain was initially intended for.● Farming Aggregation — The given function provides users with an understandable, high, and stable APY. The aggregation of farming across DeFi platforms provides a transparent view of DeFi space players and allows users to select the pools and instruments they deem suitable based on their own risk appetites.● Clear Pricing — Users can see the rates when exchanging and buying cryptocurrencies since they are aggregated across networks on Uroboros. Such an approach saves time on having to look for the best rates, thereby facilitating operations.● Convenience — even a grandmother will be able to send her grandson some bitcoins on his birthday.● Portfolio Management — The integrated portfolio management functionality will allow users to view all their assets and manage them across DeFi protocols directly from the Uroboros interface.We will tell you more about the functionality of versions 1.0 and 2.0 in the next announcements.Uroboros governance tokenThe Uroboros Token will act as the main governance access instrument, allowing holders to vote on proposals and introduce changes to the platform.Part of the profits generated by Uroboros will be distributed in the form of monthly dividends among users who hold the Uroboros Token for more than 30 days.Join us on social networks! Yes, they have no followers yet  and instant messengers — there you can learn more about our project and explore its roadmap and whitepaper. Keep your finger on the pulse! New announcements coming soon.Discord | Twitter | TelegramDiscord | Twitter | Telegram",

At the same time, we now see a lot of names on the market with cool funds behind them, but almost no technology.Stay tuned! Thank you!",

We are happy to get your feedback on the product we are working on.\"No-chains\" conceptYou will receive a multichain wallet that looks like a single crypto storage that combines coins from all blockchains. No matter where your crypto is scattered, you will be able to manage a single amount of each specific asset as if you were transacting on only one blockchain.For example, you have 500 USDT, which are stored in different ratios on 5 blockchains: BNB-chain, Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum. In Uroboros Wallet — you will see them as one asset worth 500 USDT. And you can also transfer all 500 USDT not separately from each network, but with a single click.Gasless transactionsThe Uroboros wallet allows you to pay fees in any asset that is convenient for you, and can also work without buying any native token at all.A simple real-life example: You want to transfer 100 USDT from your wallet to a BNB chain for a friend, but find out that you don’t have BNB to pay the fee. What are your next steps?• Buy BNB on DEX/CEX and send it to your wallet to pay commission.• Transfer from another BNB wallet to your current one by paying a fee.In both options you are wasting your time and paying extra money. In Uroboros wallet you simply pay the fee in USDT or any other token.Read the full article here: https://medium.com/@uroborosdefi/uroboros-multichain-wallet-announcement-a-game-changer-in-the-defi-space-c1519415d46e",
