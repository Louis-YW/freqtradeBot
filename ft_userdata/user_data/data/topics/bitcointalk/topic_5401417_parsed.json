  "content": "LUNA which was a well known name.  And more or less most people were investing here. But LUNA fucks everyone.  it put everyone down on a kind of road. Here is the launch of luna 2.0.  And has a total supply of 1 billion LUNA. It is listed on many exchanges, including Binance at the moment. But it turns out that the price that went up when listing LUNA has now come down to half that again. And it is decreasing day by day. What do you think about it? Can LUNA return to its previous position? Can it reach up to $100 again? And how reasonable it is to invest in LUNA now?",

Now listing on exchange, is a part of them taking their losses through fee same with other exchanges. Since even luna got fucked up bigtime. There are lots of traders who seem to think that it could go up like before and hoping for a fortune win there. Its still 50% chance that it may happened provided that luna team still trying to do things here. Im not saying Im pro luna but miracles can happened sometimes.",

Despite LUNA fucking my $17k. I am again interested in investing a little in Luna.  Hoping to recover that loss. It seems to me that this would be a futile attempt.  Again sometimes it seems like it could recover my previous loss. I am floating in the ocean current",

      "body": "highlighting luna 2.0 I had scraped a few days ago on the MXC market. at a price of around $5/unit, it also had time to pump. I am optimistic at that time that bearishness will be prolonged and successful, even though it is difficult to repeat, at least I can get a 30% return from the Luna 2.0 token.and I have sold it looks like scalping for Luna 2.0 is prone and risky. I only budget 20$...highlighting that the stock exchanges that participated in the emerging listings cannot be separated from cooperation.it's difficult to build an image maybe some people have lost confidence with all the innovations that teraform has to offer. That's not always the case.maybe the magic will come if the majority of coins and tokens win again.and if the uptrend has come.",

And how reasonable it is to invest in LUNA now?I would categorically state no, anyone still investing in this project does so at his or her own risk, isn't it pretty obvious that all of these attempt by the Luna team to try and save the coin is going to be more or less futile/fruitless. Investors on this project would be considerably low at the moment, for obvious reasons actually, thus how is the coin going to pump/rise again when demand is going to be at its lowest.Having said that, people should understand that the root of the problem is not just Luna, but altcoins, and what happened to Luna could and in the future can happen to any altcoin, majority of altcoins are short term/pump and dump coins that have no real utility, other than hype and fake promises backing them up, sooner or later such coins are bound to lose their hype and dump out of the market. The thing is, investors should never forget to take altcoins as short term projects, meaning once you make profits, you pull out, do not hold, doing so would only accrue you losses in the long run.",

The trust is lost and the only reason why retail was into LUNA in the 1st place was because of UST and it's ridiculously high APY. There's no UST anymore and it's market share is being eaten away by TRX and their 30% ponzi.",

Some scammers lured many people into the project by offering stablecoin staking at 20% per annum, other scammers committed actions that destroyed the UST stablecoin. Stay away from such projects.",
