TRX Holders can now stake their assets while maintaining the liquidity of these assets.Holders of TRX tokens can stake their tokens on the STRX.FINANCE platform to mint staked representation assets known as SFI Token.STRX.FINANCE freezes the underlying deposited TRX tokens with a group of Super Representatives. STRX.FINANCE also leases TRON Resources (Energy & Bandwidth) to customers in need, generating extra revenue for all SFI Holders. SFI token, which represent the userâ€™s staked position, accumulate staking incentives in the background and may be used by users in DeFi to produce more income.SFI/TRX Pool on SunSwap or SFI/TRX Pool on JustMoney Exchange are the current examples. Providing liquidity in stable pools has no impermanent loss because the token price is always the same.We have contracts deployed and are already live on the Mainnet. Initially, 400K TRX worth of liquidity has been made available on Dex platforms such as Sunswap and JustMoney, allowing holders to exchange STRX for any token at any time. This will act as a hedge against waiting three days for unstaking and will also provide users with arbitrage opportunities.Docs:https://docs.strx.financeMainnet Contract Addresses :StakingPool : TGrdCu9fu8csFmQptVE25fDzFmPU9epamHSTRX Token : TVGiaML3hJE7sv9NEEVjqLbF5DcXJgHSfyMainnet Dapp : https://app.strx.financeSecurity Audit report :https://github.com/strxfinance/audits",
