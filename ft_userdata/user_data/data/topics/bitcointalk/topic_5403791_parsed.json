  "content": "Ladies and Gents, We have all seen the price drops, the news articles, the videos and just straight chaos in the global markets. The politics have been especially entertaining to watch. Its like we're in the middle of the best TV show ever called life in 2022, haha. I mean seriously what a shit show. I walk into work each day and all my coworkers ask me & hound me on bitcoin or tell me why it won't last, but most of them have no clue. They'll ask me if I'm still buying or holding or if I sold any, and I always tell them of course I keep buying. I just can't help but laugh at all the people who think Bitcoin is dead, when the markets are this crazy and the inflation is up this high and you can get bitcoin at a discount its always a smart decision to get more. In time all of this will pass and we will see new ATHs for years and years to come. If you're in this, then be in it. And if you're out of it and spreading crap all over this forum then please GET OUT! HODL has lost its meaning in 2022, most people seem to be completely jumping ship (besides the majority on this forum). Now is the time to dollar cost average and accumulate while its getting cheaper. Even if it falls back to 3k or even to 1k who cares. Long term vision has always been set to the sky. WE ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. Stay positive, do not be dismayed and discouraged. Remember why we are here in the first place. It takes a little while to reach the top of the mountain from the gondola, but only a minute or two to ski all the way down the mountain! This is what is happening with Bitcoin right now. We are almost at the bottom of the hill about to get back on the lift and continue to rise. Me, i'm just enjoying the ride! All the people who never get back on the lift will never know the feeling of that fresh powder in the back bowls (sorry for anyone who doesn't ski in here w/ all the lingo). Today I'm feeling just fine and dandy, i'd say peachy! Lets stack these chips, get your coins! Nobles didn't become nobles miraculously, they took it!!!! Hold your sword steady, and fight with poise knowing full well that we will end up on the right side of history.All the best, All the time, TREAD",

BitInstant? CAVIRTEX? And how everyone reacted after all these incidents? 4chan/biz was flooding with \"it's over\" memes. This crash is nothing compared to what's about to come   Right now people(and HEDGE FUNDS) are treating it like another stock market(and they are right to do so), it's yet to be used with its intended purpose. As more and more people learn about bitcoin and its potential benefits, its value will continue to increase. And when this happens, it won't be just another \"inflated\" asset. Hopefully we will be alive to witness that day(yes, it's a long road ahead)",

Buying cheaper is the key to make more returns so if you feel this is the cheapest price then buy and stack it until your desired price range happens which may take a year or two but make sure you have enough backup funds in the meantime, don't expect to reap the profits very soon because you may lose the actual potential of your investment with short term trades.",

Then you have a better chance neither FUD nor market changes scare you.Reading the news, staying informed.. this is important. Afterwards, based on your knowledge you decide whether those news are worthy to act or not. Indeed, in most cases they are not worthy unless you have trader material and can get to multiply your funds only by paying attention to the market (of course, it's risky!).Being positive is indeed a good advice. Bitcoin has a history of crypto winters and fantastic recoveries afterwards. We can surely hope this is yet another one that'll be followed by recovery.",

The one who makes the final decision to buy or sell is you. Let's say in the worse possible situation, Bitcoin got a compromise and everyone rushed to sell the coin, how would you feel if you don't know about it and missed the chance to cut loss?

That's already put him in the right place a bit. But we've been through the long process of getting Bitcoin to the $20K point in a few seasons. Whether it's to treat a sense of concern or not, the OP is sure to try so he feels confident Bitcoin will reach its highest point in a short time. After a long process, it's time for a bear market to move through a vulnerable line.",

But, I get the idea, I am not really staying away because seeing all those people who do FUD really helps me love bitcoin even more. Makes me feel like I am seeing something that others can't see and that is why I love it so much.I mean it is like there is this hidden gem that nobody appreciates, and you know it is true value, and when it goes up in value and everyone wants a piece of it, you feel validated and relieved that it wasn't something crazy and you really did know what the real value of it was and you were the one that made profit from it the most.",
