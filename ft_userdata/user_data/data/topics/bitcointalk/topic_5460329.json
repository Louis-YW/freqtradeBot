  "content": "What is Kaspa?Kaspa is a GPU mineable coin with the kHeavyHash algorithm, experiencing over 100x growth in a year and ranking in the top 100 by market cap. It stands out as the fastest PoW Layer1 based on blockDAG. Its active community continually crowdfunds for exchange listings, market-making, and development.What is Hacash? Hacash has the following unique features: It is the first PoW coin on Layer 1 to achieve both decentralization and adjust the money supply to maintain purchasing power stability. Hacash has 3 PoW coins: HAC, HACD, and BTC. HACD is the first ever PoW NFT, while BTC can be one-way transfer to the Hacash layer 1, and these two coins are used to adjust the supply of HAC. Currently, HACD has burned half of the circulating supply of HAC.Additionally, HAC is one of the most fair PoW coins in terms of block rewards. It follows a Fibonacci-based increasing and decreasing pattern, rather than the gradual decrease seen in other PoW coins. HAC utilizes the X16RS mining algorithm, which, despite its similarity in name to X16R, is actually a completely new algorithm with high randomness. Therefore, developing ASIC rigs for X16RS would be very challenging.Why Hacash is the next Kaspa?1.More innovativeWhile Bitcoin's innovation lies in achieving decentralization and preventing double spending, Hacash's innovation lies in achieving decentralization and adjusting the money supply to maintain purchasing power stability.Kaspa's innovation lies in achieving high TPS Layer1 based on DAG. While it brings innovation in the PoW DAG field, a faster Layer1 alone cannot achieve the same level of decentralization as Bitcoin and Hacash. Hacash's innovation has not been achieved by any other PoW or even non-PoW cryptocurrency, whereas Kaspa pursues high TPS, a goal that numerous crypto projects are innovating on in different ways.2.More decentralizedYou can directly download and run a full node for Hacash on any devices, while it may not be immediately feasible for Kaspa. The ability to run a full node on any devices is the best criterion for judging decentralization.3.More fairBoth Kaspa and Hacash have no pre-mining or ICO. The total supply of KAS is 28.7 billion coins, with nearly 70% already in circulation. The emission plan reduces the supply by half every year through monthly steady reductions based on the formula (1/2)^(1/12).HAC has an unlimited supply, but it follows a Fibonacci-based increasing and decreasing pattern. In the first stage, the quantity adjusts approximately every 100,000 blocks (around 0.95 years) with gradually increasing rewards. In the second stage, the adjustment occurs approximately every 1 million blocks (around 9.5 years) with gradually decreasing rewards. In the third stage, it stabilizes at a constant reward of 1 HAC per block.In the first stage, the block reward starts at 1 HAC and increases to 8 HAC, and then it enters the second stage with a fixed reward of 8 HAC per block for ten years. Afterward, it decreases to 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 HAC until it reaches 1 HAC per block for the next ten years. After two stages, a total of 22 million HAC will be produced over 66 years. After 66 years, it enters the third stage, where the block reward is permanently fixed at 1 HAC.Currently, 1 million HAC has been mined, but due to HACD burning, the circulating supply is around 500,000 HAC, accounting for 2.27% of the total circulating supply after 66 years. This makes it still fair for those who start mining HAC later.Additionally, the X16RS algorithm makes developing efficient GPUs extremely challenging, making the development of FPGA and ASIC unlikely. This should be the most fair PoW distribution mechanism currently available.4.Relationship with BitcoinKaspa claims to be a faster version of Bitcoin, but its economic model and decentralization cannot surpass Bitcoin. Hacash's goal is to enhance Bitcoin's capabilities. For example, A company called Hacash.com proposes to achieve Bitcoin's scalability through Hacash and has introduced Bitcoin's first ever multi-chain layer3 infra.5.Investment opportunityHAC currently has a circulating supply of 500,000, a price of about 0.7 and a market cap of only $350,000. Meanwhile, KAS has already reached a market cap of over $600 million, a difference of over 1,700 times. Currently, HAC is only listed on two small exchanges, and the community is crowdfunding for listing on Txbit.Who we are and why we stay with hacashWe are Hacash.Diamonds, the first HACD trading platform and also the first GPU mining pool for HAC.GPU mining pool:https://www.hacash.diamonds/poolHACD & HAC trading: https://sea.hacash.diamonds/Explorer: https://explorer.hacash.diamonds/Discord: https://discord.gg/6wH9KJeDFCTwitter: https://twitter.com/HacashDiamondWhy do we choose Hacash?1.Hacash provides a more sound monetary system by achieving decentralization and adjusting the money supply to maintain purchasing power stability. This makes Hacash a promising digital money that may gain more acceptance and use in the future, potentially even replacing Bitcoin in daily payments.2.Hacash is still in its early stage, which presents more opportunities for participants. As part of the Hacash ecosystem, you have the chance to contribute to and shape its development direction, and potentially gain more opportunities and rewards as the ecosystem grows.Other Hacash links:Site1: https://hacash.org/Site2: https://hacash.money/A scaling company: https://hacash.com/HacashDAO Twitter: https://twitter.com/HacashDAOHacashNews Twitter: https://twitter.com/HacashNews",

The technology has been ready for years.Hacash's white paper covers privacy: \"We act with transparency, but still prefer to remain discreet. The greatest concern lies in the lack of privacy, as the 'fungibility' of currency is greatly affected. This leads to the same unit of cryptocurrency having different market prices due to its historical records, ultimately reducing the efficiency of the entire monetary system. Moreover, businesses that illicitly acquire consumer data will analyze past purchasing behaviors to determine an individual's acceptable price, which can significantly harm our interests, particularly if the offered products are monopolized.\"There are already two privacy techniques in the white paper, one of which(Mixing) is already available(No client yet). More privacy techniques will be supported on L1 in the future.",
