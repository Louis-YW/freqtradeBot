  "content": "Hello everyone!Recently I see a lot of questions being asked on this forum like \"Is it the best time to buy Bitcoin??\", \"should I buy Bitcoin right now?\" etc. So I thought that it would be a great time to give a simple answer to these questions.I already have topics when I talk about when to buy bitcoin, but here I want to simplify it for everyone who still wondering about the timing.So, first of all, bitcoin is a GREAT technology and we all agree that it WILL go up and will cost much more in the future. That's why any time is actually a good time to buy Bitcoin. But if you want to lower the risks of investing in the wrong time, consider DCA. I still believe that DCA is the best method to invest money in Bitcoin.So the simple answer: if you don't want to risks and you belive in Bitcoin tech, then go and start DCAing right now.But for those who want to time Bitcoin, then right now is probably NOT the best time to buy BTC. Many people who say that Bitcoin has got up to 29k so it will keep going down just because, are probably wrong, cos they just ignore all macroeconomy statistics.I said it the last time and I will say it again: The economy is STILL in a bad place. We should not forget that high-interest rates are destroying an economy to lower inflation. So we are not done and it's not over yet.So when to buy Bitcoin then?Personally, I still think that we should follow what FED is going right now because they decide what to do with interest rates. I think the best time to start buying Bitcoin will be the moment FED will start lowering interest rates. After that (now immediately) economy will start getting better and, obviously, bitcoin will go up too.And I also think that when that will happen, bitcoin will be much lower than right now. Because statistically speaking, FED won't start lowering interest rates until something will go completely wrong and something big will collapse. Only that will be a good signal for them that it's time to stop.So, to recap everything I said here: if you just don't care about timing and want to buy Bitcoin, then start buying it right now (but only by DCA), and if you care about timing and want to take a risk to get bigger gains, then wait for the FED to start lowering rates and for the economy to become better.",

People should buy bitcoin after the FED starts to reduce interest rate when the price of bitcoin is still low? It is not necessary to buy bitcoin at once, you can use DCA strategy instead to just buy weekly.This is another good advice, as the price of bitcoin becomes to decrease again, you can use the averaging strategy to continue to buy more. Just know that bitcoin will be $100000 or more one day. Buying now will be in favour.Edit:People that should be concerned more about interest rate are traders, not holders.",

If we take the 2022 excess increase of the interest rate for example we could all see how bitcoin reduced to 16K. Below is a chart that shows the correlation. One of the reason bitcoin is facing an upturn movement now is the failure of banks like silvergate and Silicon Valley, as this has made people to run a bit away from centralized entities to avoid any further occurrence. As it stands thereâ€™s no clear indication of the government will lower the cost of interest rates and also with the recessions lurking the market will be highly unpredictable and that is why the easiest way is to accumulate bitcoin now using the DCA method.",

Bitcoin does its mission and you must understand it market cycle that is about 4 years with bull and bear years. When you understand it, you will know when are best months to DCA.Because it has bear and bull years in 4-year cycle, it won't go up forever in each big bull market and will have about 70 to 80% correction from all time high. If you can wait till that price, you can confidentially do DCA in many months and wait for a next bull run.People who did DCA at $69,000, $65,000, $60,000 or $50,000 would feel regret recent months.",

What it all comes down to is personal preference be it due to time, budget or whatever. For me though, when it comes to my portfolio for long term hoodling, regardless of the type of coin it, I only buy them with my extra money or with the extra profits from winning spot or futures trades. I don't over buy with every opportunity I have. I do this for the sole purpose of having peace of mind. I already have the short term and mid term trades to worry about. Not to mention occasional futures trades and hedging. lol",

Even if this happens and money becomes cheaper, it means that the demand for BTC will increase and that will push the price up - and then what logic is there in waiting to invest?

Which is better so far in terms of profit, to DCA or to buy Bitcoin in bulk following the Fed's decision? Personally, I don't care so much about what the central bank of a faraway country is doing. Especially when it comes to Bitcoin, I'd rather just acquire when I have the money to spare and hodl. After all, I don't think that Bitcoin's price is really in correlation with whatever decision the Fed makes about its decaying currency, notwithstanding those moments when there is seemingly one.",

You have made a good point already, @OP. Bitcoin is an appreciative asset whose value will continue to increase, and with such an asset, there is never a bad time to buy, unless you think that when a person buys at a very low price, it also opens them up to a higher profit compared to people that will buy at a higher price. The truth is that everyone will definitely make a profit.For someone who is gradually investing in Bitcoin with their job earnings, like mapping out a particular amount to invest either every week or month, they may not even get worked up with the price because they are absolutely investingin funds that will not affect their budget for the month.",

However it was soon proven that the change in price observed because of peeps finding it easier to invest in bitcoin rather than keeping money in the banks for shitty interest rates. For me, simple formula to invest is, just keep buying bitcoin at various entry points and make it DCA investment.
