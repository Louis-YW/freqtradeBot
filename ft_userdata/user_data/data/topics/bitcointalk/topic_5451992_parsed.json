If you have proposals on how the creation of the platform should be for greater security or greater trust, I would love to read them to be able to satisfy your demands.BTC",

      "body": "Not sure how you get the idea that a mixer (what you're trying to build) is hated in this community. If you take a look around you'll see many users wearing mixer signature campaigns. Also, not everyone uses mixers because their money is tainted, some of them just like privacy. If you do want to build a mixer and want some input, I believe you need to at least propose your own approach first. IIRC, Chipmixer and the latest Whirlwind did this. Nobody would willingly give you suggestions to improve your platform if you don't even know how you're gonna approach it.",

As it is being picture as mixer being used by criminals, i.e. terrorists, gun smugglers, narcos and drug organization etc.Quote from: Sparrow1997 on May 08, 2023, 07:51:43 PMWhat drives the use of cryptocurrencies are the cool projects that can be done with them and that is why i am proposing to the table to create this open source platform so that the BTC community can use it if it is willing.It offers a service that mixes potentially identifiable or \"tainted\" cryptocurrency funds with others, so as to obscure the trail back to the fund's original source anonymize where the BTC comes from since bitcoin is not completely anonymous but pseudonymous.

So I'm not sure if you will hear proposals here, the infrastructure is already set up for us, we just have to use the mixers and then see how it goes.",

If so, then there are mixers already existing on this platform from  which you can get clues from them but from what you explain, i will need to get things straight with you.  From all indications i could understand that your are trying to do a mixing between chains. For instance, mixing from bitcoin to  ethereum something of that nature. Then i will suggest you take out time to do your own research.  However, i see your idea as bridging ie    Efuubut uoudwj if dream",

If you want to build your own mixer, you can, but you need to face many competitors in this forum.Quote from: Ronsbit on May 10, 2023, 02:00:05 AMFrom all indications i could understand that your are trying to do a mixing between chains.

Then i will suggest you take out time to do your own research.Exchange your Bitcoin to Ethereum or Ethereum to Bitcoin aren't mixing and can't be traced because you're still use an exchange. The blockchain analysis only need to pay attention with the transactions which have 1:1 value of ETH and BTC, they will know your original address.",
