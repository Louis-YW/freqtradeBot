  "content": "The majority of the investors and traders have misconception on investments because they think that they will easily become successful by putting their hard earned money in bitcoin and other assets without understanding that it is just the foundation and they need to work really hard and follow the other steps to beat the market and able to have gains in their portfolio. Don't get me wrong guys because I really promote investing but majority do not understand how it works, they think that there will be a guaranteed profits oncethey put their hard earned money but in reality, it is very harsh because outcome is not guarantee which means that there are thousands of outcome that can happen and what we need to do is to be prepared on what ever situation will be. So what are the outcome? they incur losses. They do not understand the risks associated with the asset and if the rewards are worth it or not. I read a past research and they conclude that only few percentage of investor are consistently making money and majority of the investors keep losing their money because of lack of knowledge. It is the number 1 reason why investing doesn't guarantee you to be rich.So the question is how can we make our investing career to become successful? These are the steps that I personally formed and I think it can help you in some ways.1. DESIRE: You should have a desire to be rich! Most of people wants to be rich by they do not have desire to become one. They simple say it but they do not put work for it. There is a big different on saying you want to become rich and you will become rich. Be sure that you are one of the people who have desire and consistently saying that you will become rich because desire is energy. And if you do not have energy, you cannot put work and effort for you to become one.2. INVESTING ON MIND: Invest in knowledge before putting your hard earned money on bitcoin, the opportunities in the market is unlimited. Do not fall for the Fear of Missing Out because the opportunities always existing in the market especially if you train your mind to see it. People do not see those opportunities because they never invest in their knowledge. You have money to make investment but why don't you have spre money for your education? Lack of knowledge will lead you to incur losses and the only one to cure it is to make an investment in yourself. The investment that you will do is not for short term only, but it can help you to achieve a lot of great things in life. So what are you doing now? Don't hesitate and make sure that you should invest in your mind. This is one of the greatest decision that you ever made.3. RULES: Creating rules for yourself and following it is the next step. The reason why there are a lot of people who wants to be a trader and investor because of the FREEDOM that they can have when they are doing it. It is the freedom because there are no specific rules that they should follow. The know that they can buy whenever they want, they can trade whenver they want and they can make money whenevery they want but it doesn't mean that you will not experience lossses. This is where the rules will kick in, You should have rules on what type of investment you will make, when you will entry, what is your cut loss percentage, when you will sell, how much you will allocate and knowing if the RRR is good or not.4. ACCEPTING THE RISK: You cannot be profitable if you do not know how to accept the risk, majority of people ignoring it and that is why they are keep losing. Be aware on how much money you can incur before the trade and in that way you can have an idea if the investment is worth it or not.5. PLANNING : Do not just put your hard earned money on some investments or buy bitcoin immediately without having a solid plan, organized planning is what successful investors doing. They have steps that they are following because they trust that it is the best way to achieve their goals.6. CONFIDENCE : Trust yourself, trust the plan that you created and do not ever hesitate, in this way you can perceive the market information correctly and you will not experience any fear, panic and many more negative emotions.",

You have invested with risk and you can expect to earn a lot of profit from this investment very soon but those who have not invested cannot expect to earn this profit even if they want to. Investing is a much better decision than hoarding your money. However, there is no substitute for risk taking when investing.Quote from: DevilSlayer on May 08, 2023, 05:01:42 AMDESIRE:INVESTING ON MIND: RULES: ACCEPTING THE RISK: PLANNING : CONFIDENCE : Every investor has willingness to invest, investment mentality, and risk but those who are real investors must plan well before investing, know the various investment rules and have confidence.

Go to an older more experienced and successful person and humbly request that they take you under their wings and mentor you. They should acts as role models whose footsteps you should follow. You should sit with them during investment meetings, you should go with them conferences, you should observe them and ask intelligent questions. That's investing in knowledge and in experience.",

These are the steps that I personally formed and I think it can help you in some ways.The points that you submit have represented everything that must be done by people who want to invest, but I want to add a little about the consistency where we must be observant in seeing opportunities under any conditions. If people do not have large capital, then make an investment scale using the purchase method as suggested by many people in the forum.Investment must be carried out routinely in order to increase the amount of assets owned and the last should never think of getting wealth in a short time because there are many processes that must be passed and pay attention to every risk that needs to be minimized so as not to get caught up with panic in the condition of prolonged correction in the market.",

You don't need any complicated education to hold your Bitcoin, and by just holding you have invested which can then give you riches.",

However, looking at the way in which we invest to get back the values ​​​​in life such as material, spiritual, reputation, ... then this can be very broad and can be looked back at right from the point of view we start with it. I understand some things don't come naturally but by luck, how everything turns out is a reflection of what we've done before, we're in an environment that is so full of joy, so to speak. Due to the chaos of different knowledge and values, aiming for balance in life will be seen as a starting point for success.",

Be aware on how much money you can incur before the trade and in that way you can have an idea if the investment is worth it or not.Those who are interested in investing are advised to invest as much money as you can afford to lose. This is a very big money risk. Because there are many chances of losing money. That is why the term risk-taking is associated with investment in this way.

In fact, this should be the hard nut to crack for anyone who goes into business. Sadly, this is the part a great number of people don't even want to contemplate or find out. They want to assume that the path to profiteering should be easy and smooth. For me, the first step is even to think of loss before profit taking. The first thing I ask about any business I'm getting into is the risk and loss aspect before the \"mouth watering\" ROI which is often the one pushed forward. There's no business without risk, investors should seek the risk and loss out first to avoid unplanned outcome later.",

An investor should consider the factors that you have shared and also consider various things before an investment. We often see frustration among investors. There will be no shadow of disappointment among those who invest knowingly about Bitcoin. Maybe they are in loss but at some point they will come back to profit. There are many things to consider. An investor has to have confidence along with the plan as well as develop the mentality to accept risk otherwise the investment is not possible to be successful.",

Perhaps many of them have already sold at a loss and are now frustrated with investing in cryptocurrencies.To make a profit from any investment you need to have good knowledge in the field in which you are investing, otherwise it can be like a lottery. Those who buy bitcoin now and those who will buy it at 100k (I assume that there will also be such) will get completely different results, although both will invest in bitcoin, but some will make a profit, while others may suffer losses. Therefore, no one can guarantee you profit except yourself.",

The purpose of investment is to make a profit and not necessarily for riches.Please don’t get me wrong, Investing can make somebody rich and at the same time can make one poor. This is why portfolio diversification is always advised. If one investment goes bad, others may not because all investments can go bad at the same time. We should also note that not all investments are risky so choose wisely when investing. Sometimes, the higher the risk, the higher the return so before considering any investment, it is important that we carried out due diligence.Research before investing cannot be over-emphasized. Bitcoin as a financial market is not predictable so whichever you choose to invest in, be ready for the outcome.In conclusion, investing doesn't guarantee riches because you may lose or gain. The gain may not even amount to wealth.",
