Most people reading a forum like this will \"scan\" the text much faster and easier than listening to an audio file.While an image can be very useful, while it's said that an image is better than 1000 words, while a screen capture can show easily what problem somebody might encounter, the use for audio files is limited, so I'd guess nobody cared.Quote from: Agbe on August 08, 2022, 06:43:48 PMListen to the audio that I uploaded in this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407508.msg60624586#msg60624586.You didn't upload any audio to that thread.

Ok, what the community is looking at with your OP is if it has a direct audio play here and not a link that takes someone to another site which is the case with what you've shared here. We are looking at the same thing that happens when users share pictures here. It's a direct view here. Can you get the audio to play here without taking us to another site?Quote from: decodx on August 08, 2022, 11:49:16 PMQuote from: Agbe on August 08, 2022, 10:38:03 PM~snipped~I think this is a useless tutorial for Beginners & Help board because it has absolutely nothing to do with the bitcointalk forum or cryptocurrencies.

But if I, for example, now create a topic with the title \"How to Upload Video in Bitcointalk\" and describe the process of uploading a video to YouTube, will you consider it useful material for the B&H board? @Agbe, please don't be offended by my comment. It is important to keep in mind that most people who visit this forum are generally interested in Bitcoin or related topics. You can see from the comments of other members that most agree that your topic lacks usefulness for forum members, and some even object to sharing links to unknown services due to the high number of phishing and similar attacks in this industry. The Beginners & Help board was created so that anyone who is new to Bitcoin can ask the most basic questions and get answers, but primarily related to Bitcoin in general.
