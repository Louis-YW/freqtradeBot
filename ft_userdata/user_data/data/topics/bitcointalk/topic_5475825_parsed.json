That will lead you to success and success attracts people. If you stay on your path, many will come and go but those who are gonna stay will bring more success. And when they are putting their efforts into making you more successful, you should try to adjust to their needs and decisions. If you don't, then those who took you up will be the reason for your downfall. Being a visionary is not the problem, but you need people around you who are the same as you. The ability to shape the future is not easy and not a job for average people. But it is also true and I agree with you that visionary leaders do not make great CEO. When you are dealing with same-minded people, you will gain success. But when it comes to a huge industry, it's a whole different story. But this is what makes them unique and despite having a bad reputation, they are at the top of the world. Visionary CEO will give you ideas and work, it is up to the employee to figure out how to do it so that they can do it in an efficient way. If you can't do it, then leave. There might be other people who are better than you. And no one can deny that fact.",

Then boiled down to what your title and content saying, I will say it depends on individuals boldness and there are people who are born with the mantle of leadership they always appears to be the head of family and in every meeting be international and national. While making a good CEO required a discipline, whomever that is not discipline can not make a good CEO this could be someone whose discipline is in financial study & department and or that has acquired lot of degree in business and finance.",

      "body": "It mainly depends on the team you gather as a CEO. There are different personalities in every field. Some people like being told what to do, others don't. There are people who accept jokes, even when they are a bit inappropriate, while others will take everything to themselves. If you're a psychopathic slave driver CEO who makes a lot of money for the company, you need a money oriented team that doesn't care about the atmosphere at work and can take a lot of punishment as long as they walk out of there with a full pocket. That's why stock trading companies are full of these psychopaths because they're there to make a lot of money in a short time and leave it behind them. Most stock traders resign from their jobs after a few years and they admit the job is for young people because you get burned out fast. I'd prefer a boss who is a leader we look up to, treats us good and stays calm under pressure than a screaming nerve ball of a boss who pays more, but makes you feel like shit.",

Do you support this argument?People don't become \"visionary leaders\" overnight, it takes a large mix of the right ingredients and a lot of self determination to achieve this position. That's not to say that visionaries are necessarily good leaders either, there are plenty of people out there who had grand ideas and were in a position of management over people, but failed to successfully convert it into productive outcomes. However naturally people who reach the level of CEO in larger organizations will have the ability to combine a lot of successful traits together. Charisma is a key ingredient most of the time and it can often be a honed skill, as people move up from the lowest rungs in a company or move sideways after achieving success elsewhere.",

But there are chill CEOs that are also making productive employees that want to go to office everyday because they're pushed appropriately and they're praised according to the tasks that they finish. A visionary leader and a CEO, we can distinguish these two. There are CEOs that are just standing there pretending to know a lot of things while a visionary leader sees the potential of everyone and directs everyone that shall give out the potential of one employee.",

If you want to be a great leader, you should be ready to accept suggestions from others and add to yours in order to make the company a better one. One attribute of success and good management is paying attention, and one can also be a brainstormer about a particular idea and still not end up being the CEO of the company because they might lack all the skills to make the business or the idea explore.

Do you support this argument?Actually in this case being someone who is visionary is very good but to be a good leader then they must also be aware that sometimes there are other situations that require them to look for teammates who are in the same ideology with them. This can indeed be used as an ideal leader if you have a visionary leadership spirit but in the world of work visionary alone is not enough and those of us who have jobs must be aware of this because in the end we also have to build good chemistry to bring our team to a better direction and this is where we must realise that looking for colleagues is also important so that visionaries can be more effective. Looking for colleagues is also important so that visionary or not when colleagues understand what we (leaders) want then the spirit of visionary leadership can run very well but on the other hand relying on visionary alone sometimes it will not be enough because we cannot stand alone considering there must be a team support behind that integrates well.",

Do you support this argument?Success do not come by single effort but certainly by teamwork and that every member of the team contributes to the success of the group or company. However, I don't have issue with visionary leaders as long as they are also capable to put in application all their positive visions that will bring asset to the company. But being authoritative is another story. If there is no healthy relationship with the superior and the employees, then the success of the company will never be achieved. It's important that leaders should also go down to the level of their employees, and not to degrade them but to keep uplifting them.But if you are trying to point in general that visionary leaders do not make great CEOs, well I have to disagree on this. In fact, their brilliant minds could be their asset in the company, but if they are mixed with negative act of superiority, that is one big factor that will threat the company's success and progress.",

That's why, for me, it's not a question of whether a CEO is great or not, because the issue here is how a company can be great.",

      "body": "Visionary leaders are expected to be good CEOs, but not all would become one, due to individual differences. A leaders works with his team to build a company and doesn't stop easily on an idea because of his thoughts and visions. Working with such a person is tiring, as they hardly succumb to new ideas from team members or co workers. Like in the example of Steve Jobs stated on the thread. He has the ideas and sees before hand what the outcome of the project would be, and workers always try to chime into what they don't understand, in form of correcting the CEO. Don't know if you've managed people, one of the hardest duty in any business. Therefore, in the process of being ignored by the visionary, they tend not to work peacefully, but keep up stressing themselves, convincing the leader to do things their own way (the team member's) or the method applied by the society. I think it's one of the problems workers do have with such leaders, and they forget that this person owns the business and invited them to work alongside him in achieving the goal, not changing his vision. Also, somebody like Fords, had a vision outside the original method of manufacturing cars. He had multiple disagreements with the engineers due to numerous errors, yet he continued until he achieved what he wanted. When you try to do different things, those close to you or team mates will be your greatest problems. They don't want to be part of a project that'll be a complete failure. Visionary leaders careless about their opinions. Not that they're not good CEO, the vision shouldn't be altered.",

Because usually they have much more forward thinking. or what is usually called having thoughts that are one step ahead of other people. But sometimes their overly demanding characteristics also make subordinates uncomfortable. But if you get used to it then I think it will be fine. In the context of general thinking, in the technology industry and the like, it is these visionary leaders who can answer all the desires of technology consumers.
