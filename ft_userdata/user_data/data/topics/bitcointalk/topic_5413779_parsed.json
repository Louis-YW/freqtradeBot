  "content": "Why looking for aliens or foreign creatures from other World or Existence when most people on Earth already have the creatures inside them driving them like drivers drive vehicles?Well, the truth is that Earth was made for humans live, to rule over the world and be top of other earthly creatures that were created with them but humans lost their position when an alien deceived their ancient parents and took over their position and the World. Humans have been living like slaves ever since. The CREATOR of our World finally gave humans and the World a MESSIAH to free them from the alien that took over their World. HIS name is JESUS. Believe in HIM and be free. Stop looking for aliens, they are in you if you are still their slaves. You need to be free from them.",

You will find some other Nephilim videos. Rob will explain how you have pieces of Nephilim DNA in you, who might be pure-ish without much, and what you should do about it.",
