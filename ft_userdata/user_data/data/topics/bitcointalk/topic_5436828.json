      "body": "4th word released is \"monkey\".Note that this is a 12 word seed phrase plus a passphrase. It's not entirely clear if the passphrase is going to be released as well, or what format it will take. It might be a word from the BIP39 word list as well to add additional difficulty, as then you have 13 possible words for a 12 word phrase.Still, there is no point even trying until at least 8 words have been released, and even then it will be incredibly difficult, especially if there is no more clarity on what the passphrase is.",

Well good idea and good luck",

This would now be in the realms of being brute forcible if it weren't for the passphrase. Given that we still have no idea what the passphrase is (is it another BIP39 word?), then we probably need at least one more word released before someone is able to crack it.",
