Mayne you are not yet aware guys that there is airdrop of evmos token, mostly users who had some uni tokens got this as well dont try to miss this. Its maybe few tokens but depend on your interaction before the amount of tokens.Check here.https://app.evmos.org/Ive staked my evmos airdrop via delegation and earning a decent tokens daily. For an airdrop, I think this is not bad especially you can only just stake whats free and who knows when bull run knocks it could be worth a fortune.",
