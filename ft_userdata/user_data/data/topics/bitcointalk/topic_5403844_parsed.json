Some also even still accept both fiat and cryptocurrencies.From the ink, read the conclusion:Quote from: https://cryptogeek.info/en/blog/btc-eth-casinosWhen it comes to choosing the best cryptocurrency for gambling, it all comes down to your preferences. If you want cheaper transactions and more casino options, go with Bitcoin. If you want to try out unique games and Dapps, go with Ethereum. It depends on preference, as for me, I will prefer bitcoin, but ethereum makes smart contract gambling possible which provide a means you can connect directly to your noncustododial wallet. Ethereum is not totally decentralized, it is centralized is some ways, like having a centralized body if developers.",

I think that making a distinction between casinos based on what cryptocurrency they are using is wrong.Almost all online casinos accept both BTC and ETH and there's no point of comparing them based on that particular factor.The article is about blockchain gambling, but blockchain gambling isn't mainstream and it won't become mainstream anytime soon. Most of the crypto casinos are pretty much centralized. AFAIK, blockchain gambling games are slower than the traditional online gambling games, which ruins the overall player experience.",

The different Alt coins are used for different reasons, for example.... people will use \"stable coins\" ...if they want more stability in the price. (Your balance will not drop drastically with volatility) or they will use coins like Litecoin or TRX with faster confirmation times for their deposits. There are reasons why you would want to use Ethereum for Smart contracts for specific types of casinos, but the most common practice is to cater for lots of Alt coins.",
