If he is strict and if it is difficult to understand what you are trying to say, he may delete it as a spam unless you create a separate topic dedicated to your desire to learn that language.I tried to do this with the Chinese language. I had a transaction that required me to travel there and I started to learn some words, but I did not find active members here, so it may be good for those who have the ability to write and understand sentences, but the wording remains weak, but it is understandable.",

Having an opportunity to read the same in English makes it easier.The same about speaking in other sections. I'd posted more often in some boards of which I know the language more or less, but it takes too much time and posts are still very short. If you understand the language, have not too many problems with its grammar and don't veil that you are not a native speaker, then why not to try to get to the board on this language? Locals will say if they are disappointed with your visits, but usually people are not against it.Stay respectful, try to improve your language skills and everything will be okay.",

But it's nice when you read a thread in another locale and find a unique discussion and then you create a thread in your own local board. It's like finding ideas in other people's homes and sharing them with your family. Visiting is fine but if you want to get involved in the discussion, do you think you should master their language instead of just translating from your language to the other person's local board language because every term, gist, and some vocabulary will have a different meaning? It would seem strange because I have also found members from other local boards entering my local board in Indonesian, the language is even too stiff.",

If you genuinely want to contribute, I believe the moderators would understand even if your translations aren't perfect.In fact, I've observed some users who like to post in the general boards where English is required, and their grammar isn't always correct. The key point here is that we are in a forum designed for sharing information and where anyone can both help and learn.

If someone tries to veil that they are not local, it looks suspicious. But if you say so openly, what's wrong? If you know some language enough to talk in it, I doubt that you'll meet with hostility in any local section just because you are not from a country or a region where this language is widely spoken.There are problems only with those who don't understand the language at all, pretend to be local and uses some online translator or bot for that. I don't know for other local sections, but those ones who try to do so in Russian sections are making obvious mistakes, because some phrases formally can correspond with Russian grammar, but no one who even starts to learn Russian will never use. So if the one doesn't speak some language but pretends that he does, it looks that he has some dishonest intentions.But if you understand the language and not hiding that you've learned it as a foreign, then it's okay. When people who learned Russian as a foreign language come to a Russian section we are glad to see them.",

It's difficult if not downright inconsistent to learn a new language and the alphabet alone is different from our local language. Japan and Korea seem to be quiet on the board, with not too many activities going on.Trying to learn a new language and tell the truth that they are from another sub-local, rather than having to lie. Remembering the past when the bounty campaign was still quite crowded with translators many claimed that they were local members of Russia, Korea, Japan, or from a quiet sub-local. Even though they came from Indonesian or other sub-locals in order to get a quiet sub-local translator campaign. Many members disguise themselves as if they are local members in order to get the opportunity to become a translator.",

Of course no need to habe perfect or proficient French. In the past, theymos shared his opinion that if a member can post in English as a second language, not good in vocab, grammar but if content is understandable, no big problem with him.I think again it can be applied for your posts in French local board too.Another issue is pointed by Halab. If this style is exploited to fill campaign post quota, it is wrong and will be detected. I don't imply you want to do this.",
