  "content": "So in few months bull Market....but wait minute Fed dont pivot...? So where the money come from ? I see connections here FTX So the ftx money will used to fund bull Market becouse fed dont print they said....maybe they pivot but If they don't only explanation Are that they Will use Stable coins.We can understood that crypto Are controlled by the elite ftx team Are world leaders and bankers now we see who created crypto as long as they keep funding in profit the smart ones then they got nothing to worry about nobody dont rise up against them but If there Will be money missing then smarter people who can connect the dots Will be problem for elite rulers anyways AS long as elite keep funding going on nobody never ask questions that's for sure Even i see unjustice and corruption i don't mind as long as markets Will make me rich.So that's why elite people can be rich they keep smarter people rich too and dumb ones Will just pay for everybody",
