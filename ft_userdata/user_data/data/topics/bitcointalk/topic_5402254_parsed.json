  "content": "This is probably a belated recognition of the threat posed by blockchain analysis companies crawling all over the user data of Wasabi Wallet, and specifically transactions, but their announcement of a signature campaign has caused a public uproar on this forum (thanks especially to PrivacyG for warning everyone).The situation map is currently thus:- The Wasabi wallet itself is still clean and uncompromised.- But the default CoinJoin server used by Wasabi wallet (zksnacks) is now blacklisting \"tainted\" coins, an action which is intolerable to the community.- Ignore the signature campaign for now, it is irrelevant to remedying the situation.This thread exists to gather open source software on Github/Gitlab/etc. which allows the running of a Wasabi-compatible CJ mixing server. Software that cannot be plugged in to Wasabi should not be listed here. Since this battle is being fought against their main CJ server, and not analysis companies/exchanges/governments, we still have a chance for winning this, even if we are 3 months behind schedule (the announcment for the blacklisting was made last march).Discussion on how to make such CJ software work for Wasabi (as well as the other way around) is also welcomed. Special attention should be given to getting these to run on low-powered Linux servers (think 8GB of memory or less).",

Wasabi is an open software project funded by zkSNACKs. This same company appeared to run the default coordinator. Having a “default” choice for coordinator was a good choice for privacy, as this maximised liquidity to an “honest” coordinator, but was a poor choice for the resilience of the system to legal threat. This trade off was very clear from the beginning both to the developers and zkSNACKs (Riccardo Masutti confirmed that on a live cast in the outbreak of the news). Wallet developers, were in any way agreeing to the implementation of those techniques which are a “choice” of the coordinator. The wallet itself, as a front-end do not implement any of those. So, while I condemn zkSNACKs, I cannot blame no para and the other developers who gave us such a great product for many years.",

Run your own JoinMarket client, connect to other JoinMarket clients peer to peer, and bypass any centralized coordinator with the power to blacklist your inputs.According to https://www.bitcoinkpis.com/privacy, Wasabi coinjoin volume averages around 700-800 BTC per week, while JoinMarket volume averages around 1000-2000 BTC per week. And as an added bonus, if you are in no rush to coinjoin and are happy to be a maker providing liquidity, you can even earn some fees doing it.Downsides are you need to run your own node, and it is more complicated to set up for the average user than opening a Wasabi wallet.",
