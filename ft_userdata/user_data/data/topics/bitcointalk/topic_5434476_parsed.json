Quote from: Poker Player on January 12, 2023, 02:06:32 AMI forgot to say a couple of things.In his self moderated thread he realized he will not allow me to post but he is okay to speak anything about me. Since he does not have the courage to have a liberal discussion and trying to frame me with his one sided argument in the thread. I realized I need to re-post the deleted posts from his topic.Archive: https://ninjastic.space/post/61578933QuoteQuote from: Poker Player on January 11, 2023, 02:25:04 PMYou deserve more tags and you have not received them because many people have been paid, are being paid or expect to be paid by you in the future. Does it make you jealous. Perhaps.  Quote from: Poker Player on January 09, 2023, 06:28:25 PMI saw the campaign and applied precisely because Royse777 didn't manage it. For that I prefer to stay working for icopress for less than half.What a loser. Was it a compliment to icopress or insult to him and the campaign betnomi?You seemed to be dishonest to the brand you are promoting. Shame.For the record, do you really think I am crying? Just look at the number of campaigns I am managing, it's because the forum loves me and value my work. I don't think you will ever be able to earn such respect and love in your entire life. Financially, you will always be the $50 to $100 signature spammer. To conclude, thank you and your boy JollyGood for making me so popular around and helping me receiving all these projects. Don't get surprised when I will have a million dollar in my possession as an escrow.Such a loser to waste my time.Archive: https://ninjastic.space/post/61579041QuoteQuote from: LoyceMobile on January 11, 2023, 03:26:22 PMQuote from: naim027 on January 11, 2023, 02:48:08 PMI would like to see @LoyceV's Point of view here.If it's handled by Mods, it doesn't require feedback. I've seen bigger names receive temporary bans.Maybe Hhumpuz deserves a tag from Poker Player as he was once temp ban for the same reason too if I assume. Maybe not because that will lose him another campaign manager to be able to apply his campaign. After all icopress may not have spots available always. Hack icopress should also deserve a ban if I report one of his unsolicited PM to the Casino Critique account. In that case, is Poker Player going to tag iconpress?This brings us DarkStar_. Have he ever banned for sending unsolicited PM? I don't think with the budget he works he will ever need it LOL. Maybe one day our Poker Player will be in CM if he is able to keep an ass licking relationship with DarkStar_. What do you think DS?Let's keep yahoo62278 above of all these. Let's pray for his recovery first.Edit to finish with this topic.Poker Player and JollyGood, you both became a joke for me. Keep entertaining me clowns.Can anyone answer why Poker Player is such aggressive to me? It's obvious, I am too good to others and I am not much careful separating people based on liking or I would never PM Poker Player from Casino Critique, or would get a temp ban for sending PM to users inviting to join a campaign. Maybe my heart is too naive to separate friend and enemy. There are many people who like my hard working attitude, align themselves with alike thinking, give their supporting hand when I come up with an idea and ask them to join it. In many occasions together we helped many forum members both financially and by providing information. The history is too long to describe in a paragraph or even few pages of article. It's not just my history, there are many members like me who are in the forum from decade and contributed positively and thought positively.How unfortunate today users like Poker Player who joined not even two and half years ago, thinks they are fine to insult me. Poker Player doesn't stop just insulting me but he is picking up my clients and telling them not to hire me because he thinks I will scam them. Do you think this is acceptable behavior?",

We can but the forum will start becoming a ghost town.  Life is too short to waste it on negativity. I think that need to direct energy in a constructive direction, especially when you communicate on the forum. What kind of example are such disputes and dramas setting for newcomers and guests of the forum? Certainly not positive.I don't know all the details of the internal conflict between @Royse777 and @Poker Player, but why couldn't this be settled between them without resentment and malice? I perfectly understand the desire of one to punish the other for a past mistake, as well as the desire of the other to restore his good name and reputation. But guys, continuing all this is not good for anyone. Try to communicate peacefully and come to an understanding. I call you to this.There is enough evil in the world as it is. There is no need for this to overwhelm our forum.Trust me, it's not worth it.",

Maybe only PP...It may be you've done (willingly or not, in that nefarious business or not, I can't tell) something that either offended him badly, either spoiled some business for him or somebody he knows.Or it may be just a bad impression he got on you, which got worse with that mistake from last year and then also because of his \"initial\" view on you and the fact you didn't stop engaging into businesses involving money. Plus, if we're brutally honest, your next business idea had its own communication and misinterpretation related issues, which, because of misunderstanding the reasons, was for him another proof he is doing the right thing (I don't think I could've done it much different or better, don't take me wrong, I'm just stating the perceived result).Then, the fact so many people still consider you trustworthy may be angering him even more. ...Or not; he may be even doing it for some odd sense of fun (who knows?).However, these are wild guesses. I can't tell what's going on PP mind, only he can. Human mind is... complicated...As said, grow a thicker skin, you have no other choice for it. From what I know aggressiveness and (cyber) bullying are not against the rules.Quote from: Royse777 on January 12, 2023, 01:42:01 PMbut he is picking up my clients and telling them not to hire me because he thinks I will scam them. Do you think this is acceptable behavior? This is unfortunate and can get him easily from distrust to negative tag.Just you have to properly and publicly prove / document this, else it's just your word against his and that pretty much means nothing for a more or less impartial viewer.Quote from: m2017 on January 12, 2023, 02:58:09 PMLife is too short to waste it on negativity.That's correct. But since Royse777 has paid some consistent amounts of money from his pocket to handle the mishap from last year, I expect he wants to recover that by working for it. And PP negativity has the potential to harm. If it would not be that, Royse777 could just go on, but as it is ... it can be a problem. And most probably PP knows this and may be also doing it on purpose.",

While I don't think PP should have done that, you need to realize that the client didn't drop you because PP told them something, just like you didn't get banned because someone reported you. You got banned because you broke the rules, and the client didn't want to work with you because of how they perceived your role in the BitLucy story. You can deal with that by not breaking the rules and by being upfront about your past issues, which I would have thought was made blatantly obvious by the CC fiasco.",

The difference is whether the person is able to learn from those mistakes and change to try to improve in the future. Analysis should be done, whether the user has learned and changed or not. If we don't like or support a user, there is an \"ignore\" option that can be used. I see a lot of people giving value to people they don't like.Don't focus on the problems, focus on the solutions!

The Royse777 account was created in 2014 but it changed hands at least once (maybe more) and the allegation was you purchased the Royse777 account in 2017 so clarify for us all when did you end up taking up ownership?Once you state the fact we can work out how much longer you were here than him and after that you can explain how you think his length of time here versus your length of time here means he cannot challenge you and your comments when he feels you behaved improperly.And out of curiosity how much did you pay to purchase the Royse777 account? Quote from: Royse777 on January 12, 2023, 01:42:01 PMPoker Player doesn't stop just insulting me but he is picking up my clients and telling them not to hire me because he thinks I will scam them. Do you think this is acceptable behavior? Has Poker Player confirmed he contacted prospective clients to advise them to avoid you as they could end up losing their money?Regardless of what the screenshot shows or claims to show, did he ever confirm he contacted businesses to avoid hiring you for their campaigns? Until he comments to confirm or deny I will not comment on it but as far as insulting you is concerned that is your opinion. In your opinion you did not insult him but in the opinion of others (including him), maybe you did.",

I saw no aggression on his part but I saw a determination to not give in to you by changing his negative feedback when you started a thread after you managed to get a couple of new campaigns. You wanted the negative feedback removed and he will not do it at the moment and your ego cannot handle it.Quote from: Royse777 on January 12, 2023, 01:42:01 PMIt's obvious, I am too good to others and I am not much careful separating people based on liking or I would never PM Poker Player from Casino Critique, or would get a temp ban for sending PM to users inviting to join a campaign. Maybe my heart is too naive to separate friend and enemy. There are many people who like my hard working attitude, align themselves with alike thinking, give their supporting hand when I come up with an idea and ask them to join it. In many occasions together we helped many forum members both financially and by providing information. The history is too long to describe in a paragraph or even few pages of article. It's not just my history, there are many members like me who are in the forum from decade and contributed positively and thought positively.Quote from: Royse777 on January 12, 2023, 01:42:01 PMHow unfortunate today users like Poker Player who joined not even two and half years ago, thinks they are fine to insult me. So when exactly did you purchase the Royse777 account?Royse777 account changed hands in 2017How many other accounts do you have? I am curious, naim027 and all his alt/farmed accounts are they operated by you too?

In your opinion you did not insult him but in the opinion of others (including him), maybe you did. Pathetic. Do I need to repeat it again? Let me just quote itQuote from: Royse777 on January 16, 2023, 01:25:26 PMDo you think I need your suggestion/advice? I don't. Do you think I need approval from you before doing anything? I don't. Do you think I bother to prove anything that you demand? I don't. You need to understand, you have no importance for me. Stop inviting me to response for your demand, to read your suggestions, to consider your approval. By now if you have brain then it's clear that I treat you same as the waste in my bin. How am I not in your ignore list yet?Quote from: JollyGood on January 16, 2023, 12:53:09 PMInitially I thought about staying out of this thread because it is not been self-moderatedSo what made your mind to change?This?Now I have no doubt for your waking up after long days again.It's because of this : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5434857.msg61602255#msg61602255I ask you again, how am I not in your ignore list yet?",
