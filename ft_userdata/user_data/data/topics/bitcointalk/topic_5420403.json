And the price of Bitcoin at $17,000 does not scare the miners.",

So what you called that as average miners? I can't deny that since the price of bitcoin was moving down and miners revenue might go down but the problem is since so many countries were facing crisis and there are so many new small miners came to the bitcoin as the valuation of bitcoin tied to the USD. There are so many things need to be calculated whether mining bitcoin is still profitable enough or not. You can at least provide link where did you get that statement.",

This mean Bitcoin miners didn't shutdown their mining rigs, but it's either there's new miners who want to start mine Bitcoin or the old miners bought new mining rigs.I think even though they're loss or gain low profit, but their main intention to mine Bitcoin is for long term purpose.",

      "body": "It seems that this news is not accurate as we could see hashrate continuously hitting all-time highs this year. But there is some news that miners are also selling bitcoins to cover costs as rising energy prices and falling bitcoin prices cause their profits to plummet. Maybe the news you read is talking about small-scale miners like individuals, this is completely normal and has almost no effect on bitcoin mining. Like we invest, there will always be people leaving the market and there will always be new entrants, positions are always filled and the number of participants is increasing.",

I think it must be better to hear it from the one who are doing an actual mining with rig set up.If this is true a lot of articles or viral links posted already on social media like it was trending but I didnt see you attached any source link, so it would be your assumption.I doubt the earning is lower than the expenses cause if it was, a lot have quit already.",
