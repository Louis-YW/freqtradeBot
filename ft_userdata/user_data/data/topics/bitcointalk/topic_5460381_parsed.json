Although staking is less risky but on centralized platform it seems same. So it is matter of choice, if you feel you can afford to lose the money then nothing bad about it.

This is very wrong. Because any day coinbase gets compromised then your funds will go with it. Also staking means your account been freezed for a certain period of time means you can’t sell whenever you want be it during bull run or during emergency period",

It means that it will use that stored liquidity in exchange for annual returns to its owners.The issue is that this program has a degree of danger because it is imperative for the user to have complete confidence in the platform, and the staking system encourages investing in the largest amount of money to ensure a greater percentage of returns.17.66% sounds so tempting that I don't think it's true. Some platforms set attractive rates to attract the largest number of users and encourage them to invest more amounts. Therefore, we should not blindly trust any platform that offers very attractive offers.",

Its true that i dont really that like that idea on having that staking considering those tokens/coins would be locked on a certain time and there's no way that you could be able to withdraw it out if its needed until it would be reaching out that timeframe. If you do, then there's unbonding period for you to wait up specially if you have decided to unstake it.Its true that those returns annually is really that good looking or interesting but with the risks involved and the things attached to it which it do makes it not really that ideal at all in the end.",

You shall remember when so many exchange sites experienced various hacks and the amounts drained from the hot wallet. This can happen with coinbase too but it has been approved by US regulator. It gives it more guarantee for the staker for not to lose their money easily. People are much more preferring to buy stable tokens and then stake it. Even though APR will be far smaller compared with using altcoins but you will not be affected by the dump except once the stable coin become depegged. I think that there are so many considerations before you buy tokens that can be staked. The greater you stake, the more profit you get. Remember that staking potentially banned by SEC too.",

Know that staking might not be worth it if you have a small capital, and you are just wasting your time doing it. If you're into trading, learn its concept so you can trade effectively. With this, I suggest to think again before staking, if you still insist then do it on a wallet where you have the control, exchanges are too risky.",

I am ready to lose my annual income of 17.66%, if only I had crypto currencies in my custody. Although the same, bitcoin, in the future of several years, will more than overtake this figure of 17.66%.Another disadvantage you mentioned is the freezing of your money. If you urgently need your assets, then you will not be able to pick them up. This limits your financial mobility. Also, I don't like being restricted from using my own money. This looks absurd.I can assume that people use staking services, using the example of a Coinbase, because of banal greed and a desire to get more money. The side effect of this is most often lost money. Not 17.66% received as annual income, but all 100% of the amount in the stake.",

Both are coins that have native staking because like you i really like the idea of getting some nice extra rewards by just staking those coins because i plan to hold them for a long time anyway. One drawback is that for example Cosmos has an unlimited supply, which is obviously not a good thing for the price development of an asset but that is where those staking rewards are coming from. So if you are holding Cosmos then you should definitely stake them because otherwise you are diluting the value of your assets because the total supply is rising and therefore your share of the total supply automatically goes down.Also you can stake Cosmos not only on Coinbase. You can also stake it on wallets like Atomic Wallet. There you are in control of the private key. When you stake on Coinbase then you are not in control of the private key. Don't forget that.",
