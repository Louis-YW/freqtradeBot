  "content": "QuoteAccording to the latest report, Bitcoin adoption among merchants is expected to increase by 50% in the next three years. This result is from a survey conducted by Ripple and Faster Payment Council, which involved 300 payment leaders in 45 countries. A Growing Interest In Bitcoin Payments GloballyThe report indicated that blockchain technology has emerged as an alternative to costly payment systems in recent years. Transaction volumes have increased remarkably in the crypto industry, with more than 5.5 million crypto payment users in the U.S. alone in 2023.The top four use cases of crypto payments include remittances, cross-border B2B payments, card payments, and digital payments. Remittances take the lion’s share of this, with foreign workers taking to crypto to avoid high transaction fees when sending money home to their families. In addition, the growing adoption of Bitcoin payments by PayPal and Stripe has also boosted adoption significantly. Beyond Bitcoin, stablecoins like USDT and USDC have enjoyed significant adoption due to their low volatility. It is reported that using stablecoins for cross-border payments is 80% less expensive than traditional payment methods. Around 97% of the respondents in the survey believe that crypto payments will have a major role in faster payments within the next three years. Over half of the surveyed leaders expect most merchants to adopt crypto payments within this period. Middle East Leading The Adoption RaceAccording to data from Ripple and FPC, most payment companies believe that merchants globally will use more cryptocurrencies in the near term. As seen in the graph below, the survey results show that 64% of representatives of payment companies in the Middle East believe that more than 50% of merchants will start accepting cryptocurrency payments within the next three years.  Image link:  https://i.ibb.co/XpGHsKC/mass-adoption-poll.jpgEurope follows this with 58%, North America 51%, and Africa 51%. In contrast, about 17% of the Latin American representatives believe adoption would occur within this period. This is despite the growing adoption rate in the LatAm region among formal and informal businesses. The regulatory issue was also discussed in the Ripple and FPC survey. For the majority of the payment companies consulted (89%), the lack of regulatory clarity in the crypto-asset sector is a “barrier” to using blockchain technology as a means of payment.  However, it must be remembered that in recent months there have been advances in regulating the cryptocurrency sector in several countries. Countries like Venezuela and El Salvador have established a comprehensive legal framework for crypto assets.In addition, countries globally, like South Africa, Brazil, and Singapore, are advancing in their regulations. The survey determined that the “optimism” of companies for this market could respond to a “growing appetite” for “access and inclusion to broader financial services.It also highlighted that other payment methods based on blockchain technology, like central bank digital currencies (CBDC), would improve global payment systems.  https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-adoption-to-grow-50-by-2025-this-report-claims/....The concept of bitcoin mass adoption growing 50% by the year 2025 is quite a staggering projection.According to poll data the middle east could be the region with the highest crypto mass adoption growth. I wonder if it could be related to prohibitions of islamic banking and finance?:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_banking_and_financeThe poll claims europe the united states and other nations of the world are also expected to exhibit high rates of cryptocurrency mass adoption growth over the next few years.South america is an exceptions with major residents in those regions preferring to use gold or silver coins rather than electronic means of exchange. This trend helps to explain why el salvador has had difficulty achieving higher rates of bitcoin mass adoption. Unfortunately, I could not find a sample size for how many poll responders there were. I like that they acknowledge crypto's role as a cross border means of exchange, not only for consumers but in some cases with large institutions like banks:QuoteIt is reported that using stablecoins for cross-border payments is 80% less expensive than traditional payment methods.How do people envision the future of crypto mass adoption, outside of this poll?",

Also, I would have expected them to highlight a bigger projected adoption in Latin American in comparison to Europe and the United States, since there are countries in the former where using Bitcoin and altcoins can provide very appealing advantages against inflation, crime and oppressive government. It seems this study does not consider the impact that CBDCs in Europe and USA could have on the adoption in a few years either. The government of the United States is already hinting they are not going to tolerate a major stable coin to compete against their digital currency.https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-lawsuit-against-paxos-over-busd-baffles-crypto-communityTime will tell.",

      "body": "The creators of this poll consider stablecoins to be \"crypto\". I don't think that the stablecoins can be viewed as cryptocurrencies. Anyway, 50% growth seems way too much on a global scale. Maybe in some regions the growth of Bitcoin/crypto adoption would be significant, while in other regions the growth would be relatively small. I would say that 10% annual global growth of crypto adoption is a more realistic expectation. That doesn't necessarily mean that the cryptocurrency prices will skyrocket.I'm not sure about how accurately crypto adoption could be measured. We still don't have verified data about the exact amount of people and businesses around the world, that are actively using cryptocurrencies on a daily basis.",

It's kind of laughable to claim that a Bitcoin transition will make payments faster - banks can move money around almost instantaneously already and depending on the country you live in, will offer this ability for free too. It's not ground breaking and is no reason for it to receive more usage. The only major benefit that really exists with Bitcoin is cutting out middle men, both across borders and at various banking layers, for countries where the consumer is still getting overcharged. Foreign exchange fees are also more negotiable and it's overseas workers sending money home via remittances who will benefit the most from these things.",

The technology you are talking about really has great potential, but in the wrong hands it is nothing more than a tool for even greater mass control.But today, with good marketing, you can sell anything, even the idea that CBDCs are some kind of government version of Bitcoin, and if millions of people still believe that the earth is a flat plate, then I have no doubt that hundreds of millions will be delighted when their governments offer them tokens backed by central banks.",
