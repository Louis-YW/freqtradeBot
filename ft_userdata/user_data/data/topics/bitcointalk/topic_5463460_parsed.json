I see you can earn as validator but who the hell can invest 32 ETH. I'd love to here your thoughts about what is more profitable now: becoming a validator or continue mining?Ethereum developers want to raise validator limit from 32 Eth to 2048 Eth. I think it's just not our game anymore, only big guys will be able to earn through it.By the way, mining is not profitable anymore unless anyone unless you are a big corporation with very cheap electricity and manage to avoid income taxes and mining equipment import taxes.But still there is a way to earn profit via mining. For example, Bitminer often creates new miners for coins that weren't mined via ASIC before. If you manage to become one of the first buyer of that new miner, you'll be able to profit a lot for a limited time but long-term, you'll still manage to profit from your bought equipment. Bitmain's recent KASP miner is a great validator of my words.",

I'd love to here your thoughts about what is more profitable now: becoming a validator or continue mining?The profit in the mining of altcoins is still higher than the profit of the ethereum validator. Mining equipment will pay off in 1-2 years, the validator will need 10 years if the rules with 32 coins do not change. I think it's better to do what you know best.",

I'd love to here your thoughts about what is more profitable now: becoming a validator or continue mining?Stake ETH of Over 50K USD just to receive very little rewards?Using that amount of money, I would rather DCA or buy the dips of different high market cap altcoins with very good potential. Far better returns when a bull cycle eventually comes around.",
