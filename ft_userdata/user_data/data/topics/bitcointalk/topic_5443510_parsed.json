If so, IMHO, because it's probably a centralized coin that's being marketed attached to banks and other remittance companies.Quote from: cryptoknightt on March 05, 2023, 07:32:19 PMEspecially their problems in America. How do you respond to XRP, is there a bright spot in the future?It is passed with its ATH and it didn't move up a lot with the last bull run. Those that are actual holders of it would say that there is still a bright future for it. But for someone who just speculates on it and doesn't hold it, I'd say that if there's some chance it will be just a very little chance to see it go ahead on its way to the top. Because there are still a lot of people that use it for transfers and how like the cheap fees and speed of it in respect of its usage.",

How do you respond to XRP, is there a bright spot in the future?Basically the probelm can be solved easily but XRP foundation has decided not to use the easiest way to fix the problem against SEC. I think that it could be the same like KIN token which makes XRP needs to pay fine to the SEC caused by running an illegal token sale. The bank itself was choosing R3 instead of XRP. XRP is still alive caused by billions of money that gradually poured by the creator of this coin or XRP foundation.",

How do you respond to XRP, is there a bright spot in the future?My response is neutral. If people still want to invest in XRP, so be it because it is their decision. Even though I still have some XRP, I'm just waiting for the pump to come back so I can sell my XRP at the highest price it was before. Other than that, I'm not interested because I'm only interested in making a profit through every coin on the market.Maybe XRP has a chance to scale up, but that could be due to the pumps and dumps in the market. So you don't need to think too far and just enjoy a market like this.",

How do you respond to XRP, is there a bright spot in the future?XRP works with the bank and its very centralized, this is the problem with this coin though since they are able to attract big investors, probably that is the reason why they are still on the top 10. With their SEC issues, whatever the result is for sure it will influence the price of XRP, so if its a positive one the hype will begin and you might see XRP on its peak again but if its negative, then expect more FUD. I’ll remain neutral on this since I start to hold XRP for a hope that it will rise in the next bull run, so let’s see.",

I like XRP as the transfer fee is cheap and you can trade it in most trading platforms. But holding it long term is not advisable.I think some traders have the notion that it will go up once they got away with SEC, but hard to trust as we don't know the plans of their team.",

Well, probably XRP expanded its business outside US SEC and many banks are also using this technology, it became more centralized which is a problem to many as well. XRP will rise eventually, despite of the hate I think it will find its rhythm again and for sure hype can still happen for XRP.",

XRP is still under battle with SEC. People keep learned it caused by XRP can also be considered as a coin that is worthy to be speculated by them.

I guess for our safety, we should avoid investing with the coin for the long term. It doesn't have to be XRP because there are still other coins out there which are also centralized and has a high volume (if we like these two characteristics).A good example would be Ethereum. XRP was nothing compared to ETH. It also had some anomalies but it doesn't have any ongoing issues with the SEC. This can give us an assurance that ETH can stay much longer which makes the coin ideal for the long term.",
