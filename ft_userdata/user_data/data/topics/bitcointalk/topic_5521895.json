Your family which includes, your wife and children can or may know your bank details which you already outlined but your old school friends can't have such access to you. Therefore, if you are talking about privacy we can talk of your family whom you trust or even if they used it you wouldn't be mad at it than external person or old time friends have their way to it, remember the reaction and action wouldn't be as that of your family.",

If you can share important details like passwords of bank account or safe, or grant them access to important documents, should we not also be able to trust these people with access to our bitcoin wallet?Interesting question, but I think we have to understand that everyone has their own definition of privacy, but there is definitely one universal definition of privacy, which is how someone control and access their own information at their free will. Now, the reason why I actually feel that everyone has different definition to privacy is because people tend to share sensitive information to trusted parties like the bank related details that you mentioned, but do you know why's that?, It's very simple, the organization behind these banks is what we call central authority (centralization), so it would be easy to meet them up for assistance whenever anything goes wrong.For example, in a case where just you and your partner have the passcode to a bank account, and all of a sudden, you got debited of a massive amount, if your partner eventually denies not spending the money, you can definitely go to the bank to make proper confirmation and ask about the transaction. But with Bitcoin, it's quite the opposite. Your Bitcoin related matters (phrase and private key) should be kept as safe as possible because there is no central authority to consult. Don't even think about the police, because the last time I checked, they don't work for a Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not have an head office. You should know by now that people's Bitcoin gets stolen even under their nose. So, it's not just a good idea. You might feel that a forensic research might help right?, But is it not better to be on a safer side by keeping your details to yourself, rather than becoming a victim at the end of the day.",

Regardless of how \"close\" you are to another person or just in general a group of people, you'd still have some things that are a level above of what you can share with them, and that's generally what private means. Now I wouldn't deny people who want to share their private stuff to others, but in that case it's not that it's not private anymore, just that this \"shared\" item or concept isn't a top item for you to be kept secret. Simple as that. In this case, it's your Bitcoin wallet.",

Not everyone betrays each other for money, just because one man was betrayed by another and told you, doesn't mean the rest will be just as bad. Furthermore, if you can't trust anyone, not even your wife or mother, then don't expect anyone to trust you, and basically, you're not someone worth trusting either . A person who never trusts anyone does not deserve any trust in return.Honestly, money is very important and the most important thing in society because without money, my family and I would not be able to survive in this world. But between family, husband and wife, children...I will choose them because if I lose them I will never find them again. For bitcoin, money...they are all physical and they always exist in this world and it is not too difficult to get them back if I lose them .",

But there are individuals who prefer to keep it to themselves, not a matter of individualism or what, but he feels that money can cause relationships to be strained, for example he gave access to the wallet to his wife, but his wife said that he should sell the Bitcoin when he found out its value, but he was adamant about holding it, and without him knowing his wife sold it at a later date. This is one of the many risks of entrusting the private keys of one's Bitcoin wallet to others, and therefore one should be more careful with their private keys and not entrust them to others.",

It may not be stupid to you and some other people. If nothing happens to me, my spouse and children can not be able to access my coins. But I would have taught them and let them know how they can access bitcoin wallets and exchanges. And I may even be sending them some money in coins for them to exchange it to fiat themselves.

So I can't completely agree with that even though it is very possible for some people if they can be sure that their life partner will never run away from them again until the end of their lives.But if that is still not certain because of the estrangement of the husband and wife relationship due to something or due to differences of opinion, of course there is no need to share everything with our life partner even though he or she is the person who is always in our house at this time. And actually I would rather share this with my child when my child is old enough to know everything and I would direct him not to give it to anyone including his own mother if that is possible for him.",

Otherwise, you are only creating a very strong threat to the contents of your \"wallet\", be it a bank account or a crypto wallet.As one literary detective character said, spouses are the 1st suspects in a crime.

If your spouse can be trusted (deservedly entrust) with your crypto wallet, then this is wonderful and even correct, from the point of view of risk diversification (if an accident happens to you).",

If someone steals money from your safe, you also might get it back but with Bitcoin, if someone steals it, there is a very low chance to get them back because there is no way to stop the Bitcoin transaction and if the thief doesn't tell you keys, no one will be able to get access to the wallet but this depends on the person.Anyways, I'm against trusting someone when it comes to sensitive information like that. Yes, family members might be loyal to you to the death but you can't be 100% sure. There are many cases when things went wrong between family members. I think you can trust your mother and father more than wife or kids. I know many of you might tell me that this is the other way but today, men have less rights and wives don't care about divorce. Kids are kids and they aren't reliable.",
