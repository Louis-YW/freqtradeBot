Without trying, you can’t make money from anything. Moreover, if it’s about Bitcoins, then do all the possible things and try to buy the coins. You are getting an opportunity to buy these expensive coins cheaply; hence, buy as many as you can. Bitcoins have always shown a significant increase in 4 years tenure; hence, buy and hold it for good time. I am sure you will see a great amount of profit in the future.",

That will be worth to buy at the dip reminds of Bitcoin price can rise so high.But it is better you don't borrow money to buy Bitcoin especially if you don't have an income because you need to pay the money back in some term. Even if Bitcoin will be future profitable prospects, you don't have to take the risk of borrowing money from others because that will gives you problem when you can not pay back the money. That is why you must be careful allocating your money that you will use to buy Bitcoin. Many people think that is worth to buy Bitcoin at dip price. That is right because when Bitcoin increase, they will see their profit. By holding tight Bitcoin in this dip and still accumulating more Bitcoin, you will have a chance to make a profit in the future.",

I just consider that one as my investment already since I'm just holding it for the long run.Because of that win, I decided to put the money that's supposed to be for investing into Bitcoin for other important ones. The Bitcoin that I got from that contest is the one that I will add to my long-term portfolio that I will be selling once the bull run peaked. Is buying Bitcoin dip worth the risk? Definitely, and there's no need to question that one because if you're an investor, grabbing these opportunities will give you such a huge profit in mid to long run. We just saw a few weeks ago when Bitcoin dipped to as low as $50,000 but a few weeks after that, it jumped to $60,000 again. That's an immediately 20% profit if you took the opportunity. This dip that we saw will just be one of those opportunities that we as investors must grab.",

The point is, no one knows for sure.

I have maybe 2% of my movable assets in cash and the rest is in bitcoin. I also have some immovables but I'm not ready to sell a house to buy bitcoin. It could be a good idea, but I feel like keeping all my money in bitcoin is crazy enough. I don't need to overdo it. Yes, buying the dip is a good idea if you're not all in already. Think how much bitcoin you have vs cash. If you're 90% in fiat money with 10% bitcoin, it's a great idea to buy some bitcoin, maybe go into 50%? If you're over 90% like me, don't do it. You want to have enough fiat money to feel comfortable, not worrying about every dip because it can delay your spending.",

And to be honest, I think that am going to buy this dip as well. Although I might wait to see a bit if we get down to 52K.100k is still waiting for us in the near future. I believe this.Having said that, you should have a steady income of which you invest a part into whatever you wish to invest in.

I don’t think it’s what you should be asking really if you’re actively using the DCA strategy. Although there are more than one means to approach Bitcoin investments. Having to invest huge at the dip speaks more of risk because, you’ll find yourself investing more than you can afford to lose and that breeds expectations.Having to DCA completely notifies all that and your good no matter the trend at the time.",

That way you aren’t betting that you picked the perfect time to buy and can enjoy long term stable accumulation while adding regular buying pressure to the market. to OP:ognasty's advice is just to pay in an allotted amount of fiat no matter the price.. which is a even worse gamble.(bet everything on red always red)however if the price has decreased/dipped then yes buying a little more at the time of the dip, which ends up getting your more sats rather then the buy at any time any price methodhere is the thing...if you are willing to just do the ognasty method. you might as well deposit fiat at start of the month, see if the price does go down below price at the time of deposit. and if not then before end of month just do the ognasty method and still buy coin per month. but atleast giving you an opportunity to maybe buy cheaper inbetweenwhat some people do is if they have a allotment they want to invest per month, they skip the first month. and then invest the allotment per month in following months. and if the price has gone down compared to previous then they use the spare(first) amount thus buying even more for even cheaper pricemost people spend the first month investigating/researching and learning about bitcoin so they end up keeping a months worth of money aside anyway. so use that amount on the dips to maximise coin accumulated at the better pricesalot of people can see by looking at the price chart that the price at deposit time is either higher or lower than a previous week/month to know if its best to buy in instantly or wait for chances of a dip.. and if no chance turns up, you are still buying each month using the \"any price\" method ognasty promotes",
