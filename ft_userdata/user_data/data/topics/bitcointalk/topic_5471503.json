  "content": "Till now my parents are bearing the cost of my education, I have recently completed my college education and my parents wish me to complete my graduation by studying in a private university. We have a small cow farm and we have some cows in this farm out of which some months ago my father sold one cow and deposited about one and a half thousand dollars (I said the value in dollars for everyone's understanding) in the bank for my education. It will take about four to five months to get admission in the university. I didn't plan to do anything with the money I saved for my education but recently the price of bitcoin has increased by about 10 thousand dollars and seeing this increase I think that I should invest in bitcoin now instead of leaving the money in the bank for these four to five months. Although I think it's a bit late for me to invest. Maybe I should have invested when Bitcoin was 26 thousand dollars then maybe I could have made a good profit at this point but there is no point in regretting what I didn't do Of course I will think about the present now. I think the price of bitcoin can cross 40 thousand dollars so investing in bitcoin now will not be a wrong decision for me at all.",

But I am going to say you have to be very careful, since the money you're talking about here is a money that your parents have raised for your education, and God knows how hard it was for them to raise that money and keep for your education, so don't ruin their plans of getting you to school by investing that money in a risky market. If the market happens to go down after all these things, you would regret it badly.The best thing you should do is to try and raise money through other means. The five months that you have to wait for admission, you can use the time to look for something doing, look for work and stay busy, then raise money from there and you can invest in Bitcoin. Don't touch the money your parents have kept for your education.This is just my own opinion, you still know what's best for you. You can as well discuss it with your parents.Good luck.",

Your money has different purpose and you have only 5 months before you use that while Bitcoin can be volatile downward that might lose value to your college funds. You are just saying this because Bitcoin price is already pumped now. Don’t invest money that you can’t afford to lose. On your case, this money is precious to you so just focus on your goal and invest only the money that you don’t use.",

Read this book: https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861When you read it, you will have a solid understanding of what bitcoin really is. Once you have this understanding, you can (if you want) buy Bitcoin and save it in cold storage. If you understand Bitcoin properly, you will realise the price doesn't really matter.",

Having a four-month investment plan is not ideal for a Bitcoin investor. It is too short to make a profit. 2. The money was for your school fees and shouldn't be risked because the Bitcoin market is unpredictable. You and your parent's priority now is your education. You have to focus on your studies and come out with good skills and grades. 3. Hopefully after your education you will secure a job and start earning. Bitcoin will still be around, with your earnings you can buy as much as you want. Note: Never use a fund that is not your own or budgeted for essential needs to invest in any sector because you might not be able to foresee the outcome.",

Many that are still holding back their tears will still let it out when Bitcoin hits $40k, $50k and so on. Without the sudden rise in Bitcoin price, I doubt we would have seen topics like these. I will advice you to be cautious so that you are not caught in FOMO. Bitcoin can reverse and go down a little before continuing the rise, when this happens won't you sell at a loss? There are many factors that will come into play when you buy Bitcoin with money kept for something else... you will not be able to manage the investment properly because you will be dealing with greed and fear at the same time. The best would have been buying small amount and accumulated over a long period of time since when Bitcoin was in consolidation.",

I think the lesson you need to learn from this is to take the risk, without risks you cannot gain from something. I know we all did regret on how big we missed investing on bitcoin back then, this is the same feeling you had when it crossed $34K, imagine there are people who sold their bitcoin for less than $100, $500, and $1000. Investing now might be a bad idea, I'm speculating that it won't reach $40K by the end of this year, and you badly need the money for your education. Learn to time your risk taking.",

There's no way on telling on where it would be moving. What if the price on the time that you do need the money is on bear mode or bearish sentiment and make that capital of yourse become thatnegative? For sure you would really be hindering on the decision you would be making.This is why always consider out first for the risks involved and if you are that someone who could really accept those risks then this is the time that you would really be putting up such investmentbut if you are really that minding about those money to be that intact or complete in preparation of something then taking up risks would really be not your optionto take.",

Cattle are also included in investment because they sell when the price is in line with the target.Cows are bought when they are still small at a low price, and over the next few years as they get older they are sold at a higher price.Cattle farming is not included in this type of investment because people consider investments related to real estate, gold, etc. including Bitcoin, which is widely used as an investment asset.In my opinion, not investing in Bitcoin doesn't need to be regretted for now because you still have the opportunity to do so after you start to understand the importance of Bitcoin.The message that I mean is to immediately take the opportunity to do so because the price of Bitcoin is approximately half of its previous high.It's not too late as they say. That's right. In my opinion, you are ahead of people who don't know about the benefits of investing in Bitcoin.",

So if that money your father has saved for your college education, don't invest that money into bitcoin. If you really want to invest in bitcoin, start small and use DCA method. If you have any source of income, use that money to invest in bitcoin in small amounts over a longer period of time.  Don't rush in the crypto market.",

The money was given to you for educational purposes and if anything happens to it, questions will be asked and answers demanded. So I suggest you shouldn't use this money to buy BTC, save your personal money and then you could use it for investment in BTC.",

So those people who don't see this potential when the market is red, they will never be able to see the potential when it's green. There will never understand the market.Bitcoin was $15,000 in this year. Not many people mention it because they did not invest when it was red. They only invested again when they see the market returns to Green. Right now, you are doing the same thing saying that Bitcoin was 26,000 and you should have invested back then.As I see the chart, Bitcoin is moving around $32,000 right now. It could go to $40,000 or $50,000 in the future. And why stop there when it could grow more. Even surpassing all the previous records.There are no perfect times for Bitcoin investment. The moment you put your money into Bitcoin investment, your times start from there. Bitcoin is a long-term investment asset and for that reason just invest whatever you can and hodl. That's it.",

It's a good thing that at an early age, you develop the love for bitcoin investing. It just proves that you have a great plan for your future to achieve financial freedom. However, know that bitcoin investment has its own risk, so it will never guarantee that you will always make profits in the end. This is why only invest what you can afford to lose. And in your case, I don't think investing at the moment with your money that will be usable after a couple of months is a good decision. Prioritize your education first not because it's the right thing to do, but also because your parents are working hard just to provide that huge amount of funds. And they are expecting you to graduate from a prestigious university so you need to make it happen.For now, the best thing you can do is to continue studying about bitcoin. When you have your own source of income and you have spare money, that's the best time to invest so you can invest for long term without worrying if you lose your funds in the process.",
