Mining pool or miners that mine a block can include any transaction of their choice. If you are a friend to a someone that is operating a mining pool, the person can decide to include your transaction in any block that the mining pool mines, even if you pay a very low fee or no fee at all. That is how mining pool is, they can include any transaction of their choice.Assuming the mempool is congested up to 200 sat/vbyte, and your transaction used 18 sat/vbyte. If your txid is submitted on ViaBTC free accelerator and it is successfully submit as the transaction is not more than 500 bytes and the fee paid is more than 10 sat/byte. You transaction would be included in a block and be confirmed anytime ViaBTC mine a block.",

When a transaction remain long in in the mempool, is because the transaction fee they use is less than what the miners are asking for that particular time and it has nothing to do with PEPE tokens and other meme coins, they are shit coins that are independtly on another blockchain like Ethereum and Binance smart chain.However, we have some meme tokens are ordinals inscription on the bitcoin inputs as metadata. Since bitcoin is an open source, people are allow to create meta data in their transaction as file and this input files are so heavy that you need to pay high fees to get this transaction confirm from miners and you know people love quick returns. This ordinals are the new meme in town, they are been pump with averagely making of 20x, so people are sending in and out of this ordinals with high transactions and it is also affecting ordinary bitcoin transactions, the mempool is full of high fees ordinals transactions that are competiting with transaction confirmation and hence we it is congested.So when you see PEPE ERC20 pumping, the ordinals also pump as some people see them as meme on Bitcoin but they are not the same, it might serve the same purpose for the meme lovers but they are not the same, one is disturbing the other chains while one is spamming the bitcoin blockchain.",

The ordinals which have increased transaction on the Bitcoin Network. Even Binance listed ordinal few days ago and that played a part in the market explosion of those Bitcoin Network Powered NFTs. The trend around the Ordinals actually injected new money into Bitcoin transaction and that may be part of the reason for the congestion. Like someone already stated, a solution will be found around it anytime soon as I don't see it as something that will last long. The fee is just outragi",

If you use NCA for buying bitcoin, likely weekly, I will advise you to just wait until the mempool is less congested. We saw 2 sat/vbyte several times before this recent high fee rate began, it is possible again they such fee rate would be a of high priority. You can be consolidating high UTXO counts into just 1 anytime the mempool gets to around 2 sat/vbyte which I think it is still possible. This thread is only good for those that have low input and output in their transaction in a way the size of the transaction will not be more than 500 bytes.",

One of the questions I have to ask is that, after the free submission of 100 has been exhausted, the client would have to use the paid service if they choose to continue to use their service. Correct? Second, does this accelerator in any way reduce the current transaction fees we are experiencing now? And lastly, why do you think that signature campaign managers not use this service because the last payment into our wallet took over 24hours for arrival?",

It should not also be less than 10 sat/byte, tt can be more but I am just explaining how you can take advantage of low fee is the reason I said it should not be more. Also do not let the transaction to be more than 500 bytes (if you are not sending to more than 1 or 2 addresses from 1 UTXO counts).Quote from: Davidvictorson on November 11, 2023, 07:29:17 PMAnd lastly, why do you think that signature campaign managers not use this service because the last payment into our wallet took over 24hours for arrival?Because campaign managers are paying to many addresses (outputs) which makes the transaction size to be more than 500 bytes.",

I have known the  Bitcoin lightning network as the sole solution to this problem of congested transaction as the lightning network is actually a third layer in the Blockchain that allows transaction to be confirmed faster and with advantage of reduced fee. So this ViaBTC  accelerator is like a tag given to the transaction that is broadcasted through it means so that miners can work on them faster?",
