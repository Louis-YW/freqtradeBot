  "content": "With food prices still on the rise. Many of us would enjoy some way to recoup rising food liability costs, lost to increasing market inefficiency.We need not look far to see oil companies like shell and exxon reaping record all time profits off of rising oil costs. While it is difficult to find a good entry point into stocks, bonds or investments. Which would translate into consistent gains that are able to offset losses caused by market inefficiency. The general trend for oil stocks has been in an upwards direction, due to rising fossil fuel prices.Old time stock investors typically recommend stocks like campbell can foods during times of inflation and recession. Based on a principle of consumers spending less on food as purchasing power declines. Leading to greater consumption of microwave dinners, canned foods and cost effective rations.Image link:  https://i.ibb.co/ww4jv2m/campbell.jpgAbove we see the traditional investment wisdom of buying canned food stocks prior to eras of inflation or recession might be true. As disposable income of consumers shrinks due to rising food and gas prices, more of us are forced to resort to microwave or canned food dinners. This drives demand, translating to higher profits and higher stock prices on average.However, it could be a little late to be buying campbells foods.Do we have better options? What is a good investment strategy to recoup losses attributable to rising food costs?",

Apart from buying shares it would be a good idea to try to earn more. Some jobs have raised wages by about the same percentage as inflation or even more, although most have not. But focusing on earning more rather than just investing seems like a better idea. Regarding stocks in the food related industry, there are several that are a safe bet in the long term, such as Pepsico (which is not only focused on beverages) or MCD. One is a dividend king and the other is on its way to becoming one, that have not stopped paying dividends and raising them annually as a minimum, while at the same time they have given a great return to their investors as for stock price. They are not a good healthy eating option, though, but I see global demand for their products only growing.",

In my country canned food is expensive and people are also discouraged from using them because of its health implications. Growing your food if you have the time might be a good economic strategy. It might not be a bad investment to get a few plots of farmland and grow some crops you spend money on. You will be surprised that the cost of buying food might reduce. Many people in my country are engaging in substance farming and it is really helping them cut costs.",

Both producers and retailers. Mainly because, during hard times you can postpone the purchase of a TV set, car, house or trip until next year or two but you can't put off buying food until next year. So food companies should have the lowest income decrease compared to other sectors if not increase due to smart management.

Investing in a company like Wilmar International is very attractive, especially for the long term, because this company is a leader in agriculture in Asia and Unilever is one of Wilmar's regular customers and continuously uses Wilmar's products. However, even though Wilmar International has attractive investment prospects, there are several things that need to be considered from this company, especially the problems surrounding its founder Martua Sitorus. Cases such as deforestation, human rights abuses, and environmental damage are some of the problems that are often faced by Wilmar International. And in particular Martua Sitorus the founder of Wilmar Internasional, several of his staff have been named as suspects due to the export of crude palm oil in Indonesia. Also, Wilmar's image in its place of origin in Indonesia is also not very good, because the company often has disputes with the community due to illegal land grabs. So investing in a company like Wilmar International is very attractive in the long run, but it's important to note that these companies are often in conflict with communities and governments which can affect their shares price.",

Thank you very much. I pick all this companies because of strong fundamental data (good p/e p/bv etc) diversification across many jurisdictions and market position in relation to competition. I didn't know that the company is so badly seen by the locals. How bad it is, in your opinion, in terms of impacting on expected future income? Is your knowledge based on research or direct experiences with the company or local communities?",

I guess until the war ends between Ukraine and Russia, most of the ingredients in the food industry will hide in the shadow of that war for their reasoning of shortage and increase in prices. One traditional way that I can think of is to acres or hectares of land and be the one to make those crops and be the source of food although this won't be easy and will take a lot of time.",

Although, I think such a transition could take years. It takes time for people to learn, adapt and change. It may have taken more than 10 years for sailors to accept the explanation of citrus fruit being a legitimate treatment for scurvy. Perhaps people of today are smarter and more adaptable. Accepting fruit as a treatment for scurvy might only take 3 years today, partially due to the world being more connected through smartphones and the internet. Agriculture requires space and a good climate. We need good options for those who lack the space and climate to engage in agro. Years ago, there was an investor who bought, consolidated and centralized the world's supply of cacao beans. Which are used to make chocolate. Then raised the price to give himself a nice profit. This was before Martin Shkreli did something similar with pharmaceutical products. I was trying to think of a similarly effective method of investment to offset rising food costs. I guess put and call options might also be a good method for those who are good commodity traders. But that isn't an option available to everyone. So, I'm still trying to think of a good method but not much is coming to mind, unfortunately.",

(Price to sell could include shipping cost, price to put the product together, marketing, etc.)It's why this concept of \"corporate greed\" existing is so ridiculous. It's as if there is industry wide collusion in every sector to collectively raise prices on consumers when the reality is operating costs increased dramatically even if raw materials cost don't necessarily increase.",
