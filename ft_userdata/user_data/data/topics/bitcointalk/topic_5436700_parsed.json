Most of them that have permanent voters card would not even step out an inch from their houses on election day with the fear of electoral violence. This is a very funny situation just like you praying for a job and you saw an advert or you are being called for an interview and you fail to go for it what will you say about that situation? That is the current state of Nigeria and Nigerians. I pray for God to open our eyes to see, ears to hear and the knowledge to know what to do when the time comes.",
