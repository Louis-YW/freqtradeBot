  "content": "Depression starts from the society we live in before getting to us individually,  when a society lack the basic amenities we need , things like quality education, quality health care services, good markets and a health living environment then we can say that society is depressed and a depressed society can make and individual depressed, becos we the basic things we need no dey provided, then life becomes tiring and constant pains and sadness causes depression and if depression is not properly managed it can lead to suicide. For Nigeria today many people dey hungry based on waiting they happen currently and with the way things dey if not properly handled crime rate go increase as we done dey see for some parts of the country.",

An evidence of a depressed society is a very high rate of suicide. Suicide rate is not very high in Nigeria even with the hardship that our government is putting common Nigerians through. The fact that Nigerians can easily just adjust to any situation is both a blessing and a curse in itself. A blessing that no matter the situation we always survive and find ways to  find joy no matter how little, a curse because dem dey use am take advantage of us well well because them know say their idea of we go survive no matter how go ensure say people nor go too take things seriously to the extent of massively protesting like some other countries do at the slightest unfavorable policy or hardship.",

Just take a look at what is going on around we country, young girls and boys going into gee or abi na HK they called it self. I have never heard of suicide anymore in our country for long as a matter of fact it has turned to a cruise country where everyone does things for a joke. I know too well that government are to be held responsible for what ever we are facing but we don't have to entirely lay eggs on them rather strive our best to proffer a solution to our dying nation.There is a says that said \" Don't look what your country could do for you, rather think of what you could do for your country\". Anyone here can drop the right quote if I am wrongly quoting it.",

I agree with you, an ordinary Nigerians is self motivate and whatever hard condition that comes their way we dey always adapt to them sharp sharp, so no time to check the time, we move regardless of what happens. -Depression no dey our DNA, we be sef motivated and always prepared for whatever come our way on daily basis, we may see a few extreme cases of depression,  but that is on an individual basis, and not on national issues such as cash scarcity.",
