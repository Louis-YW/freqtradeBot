Are you from Bestchange company and if not then you have to provide the exchanger's website for the tester to see what he is she is about describe. There is no hidden agenda in the forum so you have to open up and drop everything here for interested users to see and apply. As it is now. It is blinded application. Nobody knows what they are applying. Please put more effects on your Op. The test is too plain. First of all you describe what they are going to describe. For someone to describe something he has to see the thing first. Therefore, drop the exchange site.",

Money is needed in marketing. Because of lack of money, many project failed. I hope OP can understand what I am talking about. He wants people to review a site for him, he needs more reviews and needs to do things in a way that people will know their efforts to increase traffic into their website.",

Instead of selecting two persons to review the site why can't the op create a ANN thread for discussion and later, when there is money, he can create a full review campaign thread for his project. Only two users will not give all he needs in the project. At least you need more user to tell you their opinion about the site. Even you pay $15 each for like 10 to 20 users is okay. Op if I were you, I would have restrategize the plan.",

I love reviewing applications and websites and I give my honest opinion about the platform that I review. I write comprehensive and detailed reviews by giving enough time to test the platform deeply before writing my review.Following is the review that I completed yesterday:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5418423.msg62401705#msg62401705",

Your topic for a campaign is missing a lot of things and details, if you’re willing to start a good and successful exchanger I’m telling you this is a very bad start in my humble opinion.If you willing to publish your exchanger’s website then I’m ready to share my review about it freely and all what i know about exchangers as a user",

If I am approved, let me know and I will send you my Bitcoin address before trying out.If you want a higher quality review, please include some extra BTC for transaction fees involved with using the service. For $15, after network fees and service fees, I expect only coming out with $10. Then to transfer that somewhere else will incur more fees. So $20-$25 is more fair, and I will compensate with a higher quality, in-depth review.Looking forward to working with you!",
