Now it looks like that it will finally came to reality thanks to Binance's partnership.Before the pandemic, I was so passionate about educating the students and teachers about Bitcoin in a few universities where I was invited as a keynote speaker. Now I am excited even more because of the latest developments that we have and the future is bright for Bitcoin and crypto here in the Philippines.What are your honest thoughts and insights about this guys? Would love to hearing it from you. Thanks in advance.",

If more Universities have bitcoin and crypto courses, this will increase the intention of people to be towards having something to do with bitcoin, like learning about it and holding it.",

Already Binance is much involved into spreading awareness all around the world. Earlier the prime focus was on African countries and now moving towards Asian country is really good. Earlier Binance organised a tour around Nigeria and few other countries. The same hasn't ended.",

This is a good chance to spread the good news about cryptocurrency to the public to easily adopt as part of coming digitalization.",

Still, I guess this is better than nothing.",

      "body": "Just yesterday there was news that a Binance representative was one of the invited resource persons in a senate committee on banks, financial institutions, and currencies hearing.[1] As a matter of fact, CZ himself earlier expressed his potential approaches on how to conduct business in the country.[2] However, all this is happening amidst SEC itself investigating Binance for possible illegal operations in the country.[3] And then there's also our central bank governor himself who publicly issued statements against Bitcoin, even calling it as something that is based on the greater fool theory.[4] So there's still a mixed feeling. I wouldn't go as far as saying that the \"future is bright for Bitcoin and crypto here in the Philippines.\"As a matter of fact, how do we even discuss Bitcoin and crypto here? If we discuss the technologies behind them, the technical aspects and not matters pertaining to its price value, trading, potential as an investment, and so on, it would be better since we're talking here of academic courses. But seldom do we actually appreciate Bitcoin in terms of its Proof-of-Work system, how it addressed double spending, how its network actually runs, how its security is unquestionable, and so on.It is a good development, however, that some universities here have already integrated underlying technologies of Bitcoin like blockchain to their curriculum. In the University of San Carlos in Cebu City, for example, students have been reaping awards in international blockchain competitions.[5][6] I guess this is the kind of approach that's best suited for our youngsters in the universities.

      "body": "Can we please include a proper introduction to general financing first or something?Â  Pretty sure it's skipping a few steps which may make it rather difficult for students to suddenly enter crypto-related courses. Are there specifics to how they're going to implement this or is it still on the works? Hoping for the best for this though. I think a lot of the younger generation are rather interested in crypto but are afraid of actually entering it since you'd originally think it involves money, which it does, but only when you're investing. There's so much more involved in it in terms of development. Quote from: Darker45 on August 25, 2022, 03:40:57 AMHowever, all this is happening amidst SEC itself investigating Binance for possible illegal operations in the country.[3][I think this decision was made in the first place since CZ went to the Philippines to handle the issue of the SEC? Iirc after the issue went up he tried to immediately fix it by applying for a license.",
