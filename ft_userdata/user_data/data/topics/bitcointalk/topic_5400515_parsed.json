Yeah, he price might be going up after the news, but this is going to be short term though as this could be used by manipulators to give us false hope, then pump it as hard as they can and when we think that it is a safe investment again, suddenly it will be dump. So personally, I will stay away from it as I have lost trust on the project and the people behind it.",

They think that this will backfire that can make people no longer interested in investing in LUNA. I think the people who dare to come back to LUNA are those who gamble with their money. It must be remembered, minimizing is our choice to keep avoiding their project.There are many other crypto alternatives that we can choose from. Personally we would avoid their project. After all, after the problems experienced by LUNA, they rushed to make a decision to change the old LUNA to the new LUNA. Meanwhile, the victims are still stressed and crazy.",

For now, most retail investors can't recover their loss they will have to hold and wait patiently for the price to up to the level where they can recover their loss. This project already lost credibility so they will really have to work hard to regain trust from the community if ever it will happen.",

Who in the hell stupid people that keep buying that shit. There are also vesting period. UST whales are using this token as their exit liquidity to recovery the lose.",

Of course, it is very difficult for investors to believe in this project again and they will waste their luck by continuing to sell, however Do Kwon in his statement it will really be bullshit so even with Luna v2 now it has fallen deep.How do those who bought Pump when it was $17 and now it's $4 I think it arrived twice after the first luna became the second trap too.This is a risk when our finances are in the Luna project.",

The Luna team has already de-pegged TerraUSD and I think this was one of the main issues for the crash of the two currencies. As for the creation of a new chain network, this came after the developers voted, which was included under the Terra recovery plan and I think they did that in order to revive the new Luna to compensate investors and keep it away from any collapse that might occur in the previous chain.We do not know what will happen to the new LUNA, but I see that there is an adoption of the LUNC by exchange platforms and influencers, I do not know frankly whether the investment in the new LUNA was worth the risk or not?!",

Maybe it could score an even higher ATH than the old luna none of us know, but there is a big chance that it just gonna go down",

LUNA can drop to below $1 again since that’s the value before the update, so be careful and this is very crucial for them since if they failed again, there might be no more 3rd chance for them. I won’t buy as well, I’m ok already with my small holdings on LUNAC, not expecting anymore for a pump.",

There will be no real investors here because they are afraid to lose the money again. This is more on a speculative coin where it can pump and dump anytime, manipulators will also stay on this coin so be careful because you might get trap again. If you don’t want any stress, stop looking for LUNA because the drop can still happen and that could be the start of another FUD which can lead into a bad trend for LUNA.
