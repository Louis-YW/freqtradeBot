Does anyone actually use this wallet? no I didn't get on this occasion but thanks for share  I was completely not aware  personally no. I have some hardware wallets (also from other brands/model) but I am just taking as \"collectibles-sealed\" and not for \"real usage\"edit= if you take in account international shipment fees the price is \"similar\" to this \"cyber monday sales\"",
