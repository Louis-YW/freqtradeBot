Do you have your bitcoin address, right?Just paste your bitcoin address (the one you sent your bitcoins to) in any blockexplorer, as suggested by hZtiLike this: https://mempool.space/address/1zgmvYi5x1wy3hUh7AjKgpcVgpA8Lj9FAReplace with your public addressIf they have been transferred from your address, you have been hacked (someone got access to your wallet) and they are lost forever.

As others have already suggested, you can copy your BTC public address and check it in one of the online blockchain explorers. You should be able to see your balance unless there was a new transaction that sent the coins to another address. If you can see your coins in the blockchain explorer, than your bitcoin core wallet is most likely not syncing properly.",

And how do I get them back? Bitcoin Core wallet needs a lot of time and a lot of free space on disk in order to synchronize. So the first and most important questions are:* did you ever see those coins in your wallet?* did you wait today for Bitcoin core to fully sync?If the answer is yes to both, then you should look on blockchain explorers like the others said, but if it's no, just have patience and wait for it to sync, maybe it's a false alarm.",

And how do I get them back? So many possibilities...Lets start by getting a better understanding of what actually might have happened.Where did you purchase the bitcoins?Were you holding the bitcoins at the website/service where you purchased them, or did you send them to your own wallet?If you sent them to your own wallet:What wallet software are you using?Did you initially see the bitcoins arrive at that wallet, or have they never shown up there?Do you know what bitcoin address you used to receive them at that wallet?Have you looked on a block explorer to see if they have a record of bitcoins being sent to that address?If you were holding the bitcoins at the website/service where you purchased them:Have you contacted support for that website/service to see if they are experiencing temporary technical difficulties?Do you have more than one login account at that website/service, and if so are you sure you are logged in to the correct account?Is there any chance that you accidentally clicked on a phishing link that was designed to look like the website/service that you intended to use, but which was actually a fake copy?Do you know anybody else that uses that service/website? If so, have you checked with them to see if they are having a similar problem?",
