I no know why we always push these messages to the newbie, because for me no be only newbies dey make all these mistakes. Anyone can make a mistake but if you get experience w go hard to fall for small trick. To add to watin you don talk op, 1. I go advice say make we still try confirm the transaction well first before we release funds. That one be say make you quick try use the funds buy airtime like 1k or 100 naira sef. This one go tell you say the money really dey there.2. Make we try dey use exchange wey people dey use and e go dey trusted. E.g binance na this one most people dey use for we nija. And then, no share any personal information with the traders for any reason. Just your bank details finish.",

This pattern fit dey good to use if you no get money for your account. For example, you get 10,000 naira for your account, and you come go do a P2P trade of 5,000 naira, and your buyer come to do a transfer to you, you come say make you confirm the money done enter your account by recharging card of 1k. If the transfer is fake you no go know because as you recharge the 1k card your bank go debits you for that you already 10,000 naira way dey your account. The best way is to use a bank app to check if the money really enters your account.",

      "body": "One of the best measure is to use a very reputable exchange to use there P2p because the rate at which fake transfer are very common this days is something else.For me I don't use anyhow exchange for p2p because of security reasons but however the exchange I normally use is binance p2p because they are very high in times security of there users but scammers always still manages to scale through by sending a fake alert and at the same time clicking on the payment button, and what most of them does it that if they are to pay you 55,550 they will send you 5550 and if you didn't check very well before you release your funds, you lose your money.",

Scammers dey use this PROBANK to send people fake transfers.This one na very wrong way to dey verify if you dun receive money from any business wey you dey do weather na P2P or any business wey go involve your verifying payment. No dey rely on sms but check the transaction yourself directly from your bank app. Even though you get Nokia touch light, we have banks codes that can be used to verify weather you dun receive the money or not. No even believe sms wey come from your bank because men dey work dat one too. With bulk sms messages headers can be customized to look like those coming from your banks so no dey use that means dey use verify money. Also just because person send money with bank wey no dey Nigeria no mean say the person na scammers. We have many banks wey dey do international transaction and men wey dey do this P2P business dem plenty outside the country as they get more enlightened when they go oversees and dem go get enough opportunity to make dem get better revenue to dey use run the business.QuoteHow to know say the transfer na fake?Make unah no dey use phone way no fit download the banking app of bank way you dey bank with to receive alert.

E better you use this microfinance banks because immediately person send you funds you go receive am for the app and dem dey hardly get network issue and no be our banks wey he say dem dun receive the money but to credit your account so you fit verify the payment na war. Scammers dey everywhere dey find new ways to defraud us so we need dey careful or na we go fall mugu.",
