Good thing if you follow a user here that has a good percentage of winning, not with a heavy heart but can you name who you followed? Of course, it's optional.Quote from: Ninsalsa0.org on June 02, 2022, 05:53:10 AMhow about you, since getting to know the gambling thread or getting to know the bitcointalk forum?Not following any, but getting their predictions as well to prove who should I bet on or just to have an idea. I always take my bets on my own instincts.",

He's probably aware of it but I guess what OP wants to point out is that you can find some helpful information here in the gambling discussion board that you can't find somewhere else since you rarely see people discuss their predictions and we usually see tipster services that barely offer any analysis. Sometimes you can find threads that provide more insight on matches that you bet on even though it's not guaranteed to win you money it still saves you a lot of time from looking up stats, reports, and other information before locking in your pick.",

It is good to make more research most by yourself and do not be addicted to gambling but it is indeed that this gambling thread can be very helpful, but for me in prediction, I do not follow what people are predicting, I follow my decision after making some analyses.",
