But by the end of the video, everything was clear that if localbitcoins.com had blocked your account, they might have verified it. Because in the middle of the video you said that your wife goes to university every day, on the other hand she can't take photos with her ID in her hand because she is pregnant! It's as if you've created confusion here. Your excuse doesn't seem to work.",

Better to include the amount on OP so we can also know if this is true or just an allegation.

But I have seen crypto exchanges do that as well. They reply to you and if you don't respond back in 24 hours, for example, they close the ticket and mark it as solved.You can't be the person holding your wife's ID for the verification of HER account. She has to be the one holding it. They have to make sure that the person on the ID is the same person holding the card. It's only logical that the verification will fail if you do it. Her being pregnant isn't an issue or an excuse. She doesn't have to run a marathon, she needs to stand or sit holding her ID card close to her face. That's it. I can't comment on the accusation that she has traded on Localbitcoins before. Maybe she had a different account. Is that her first Localbitcoins account? If she is accessing the account from her University and maybe a shared IP, other students could have used Localbitcoins in the past. They could have used the service to scam other users. That could have triggered red alarms in their system when they noticed matching or similar IPs.",

If she is bed ridden due to pregnancy then again she could have holded the ID while you take the picture. If you donot do proper KYC you account gets blocked instantly.
