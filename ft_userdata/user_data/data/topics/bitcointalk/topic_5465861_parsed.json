The thing is, I was reading posts as usual, and I came across this post: [TOP-200] The most generous users giving merits. There was a user at 95 named Bitcoin Forum. The name was unclickable. What is that exactly? Only 95 was black and all the others were blue. Is it a user or an admin? I'm both confused and curious.The Original Topic: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4523027.0",

      "body": "That’s really an internal forum \"account\", corresponding to user_id=0. As such, the account doesn’t seem to exists on the forum’s user base (try placing the url https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=0 in a browser).All 335 TXs correspond to TXs sent on:2019-12-02 19:46:30.000 -> 281 TXs -> 281 Merits -> 281 Recipients2019-12-02 20:14:23.000 -> 54 TXs -> 436 Merits -> 54 RecipientsSince the date of the TXs is the same for each of the above TX batches, it looks like an update performed via backoffice, using ID=0 as the user_from.I can’t recall the reason of the above TXs right now. (*)UserId=0 also has 17 additional TXs that sent -148 Merits to 16 Accounts, used in the early Merit System days to counter some positive TXs performed by others (valid user accounts) that the forum Admin rolled back in this manner (i.e. hacked account that had sent Merits). -> see this post.Edit (*):Found it:Quote from: theymos on December 02, 2019, 08:27:26 PMFor the forum's 10th anniversary, forum members could submit and vote on captions for notable historical posts. Here are all of the top captions:<…>Thanks to everyone who participated! If you voted in this event, you received 1 merit; if your caption appeared in the first table above, you also received 10, and if your caption appeared only in the second table above, you also received 2.Associated TX distribution to the above mentioned caption proposals:Code:nMerits nMeritedUsers10 412 131 281",

      "body": "It's just a name that someone has selected as there username. There is nothing to be worry of. Because the moderators and Founder of this platform has registered with their own preferred names like theymos and satoshi etc. Point is there was no need for the moderators or staff of this platforms to register with the username as Bitcoin Forum. Anyone would have write this username and will be registered. As I selected my username as Faisal2202 and you have selected your username as dying-soul. We both could also use some other version of bitcoin Forum as our username. Because one username can not be chose by another member. Made mistake while interpreting the post and now understand the real query after corrected by a member thanks to him. Made mistake and apologize for that. I did not meant to make post abruptly I did not make that mistake till now it was just a simple mistake and kinda feel embarrass too I don't know what I was thinking while writing it.",

Well, it has noting to do with that Moderator deleted messages because they appear when a moderator of a board deletes someone's posts. I think the account has been deleted by admins because such username can be used to scam other members easily as the other members will think that official account of Bitcoin Talk Forum is messaging them. I'm sure that the account was deleted for betterment of the forum.",

Once again you're posting bullshit for the sake of posting bullshit. Cue tearful excuses of how I'm being unfair to you.",

You should read people's reply to learn from the more experienced forum members on topics you have poor knowledge on, instead of rushing to just comment.

I was just observing what the hell was going on. What's the real deal here. & thank you for the suggestion. I will try to read and learn more as I am still a newbie. To be honest, sometimes there isn't anything to reply either. Some seniors are so knowledgeable they can just explain the situation with only one comment.",
