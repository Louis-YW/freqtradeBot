We can't know i the next few months it could go lower, I wouldn't rule it out, but we are definitely in a clear buy zone if you plan to hold bitcoin for the long term. Uninformed retail investors usually do the opposite: they bought above $60-69k and sold recently.",

I understand that it is a buying zone, because people that buy now and hold for like 3 years will make significant profit even if the price of bitcoin still decreases further this time. I agree with this.",

While most people are grabbing this dip as a great opportunity to invest in Bitcoin by buying more and holding some persons have lost a lot of money and cause they are scared of holding they sell out. l believe the best we can do right now is to buy and hold on to what we have before the dip.",

I think this is something most of us forget.The sell-off is mainly caused by the instability in the economy, but what people will come to acknowledge with time is that Bitcoin should be the safe haven in crisis times. Due to the lack of liquidity in the market higher interests might be at play now --> big players want to accumulate more at lower prices so that they drive the price down through different techniques.",

I say you are the strong hand because thats not an easy thing to pull. A lot of courage is needed to sell at times when the price was near the ATH because many are expecting more. I just took a slice of the pie but never pulled it all out. I was scared, and was part of the investors who expects more. Unlike what the OP shared, I bought at a higher price and I am happy with it. Now the patience part where we wait and this might take longer if the economy won't be better.",

      "body": "Personally, I'm not surprised that this is happening. As history shows, every time the price of BTC drops significantly, there is always someone who buys BTC on the market, thereby replenishing their portfolio. However, this does not mean that right tomorrow the price of BTC will go up again, no, on the contrary, the price may continue to go down. But then why are strong hands now buying BTC on the market when you can wait and buy later at a lower price? The thing is that just waiting for the minimum price for BTC is not a good option, since it may not be possible to buy it at all, since there are always other strong hands that will not wait for the bottom, but will buy, as they say, in parts. So they simply buy back every time the price goes down, thus after that they will sell in parts when the price goes up. So this strategy is obvious and understandable.",
