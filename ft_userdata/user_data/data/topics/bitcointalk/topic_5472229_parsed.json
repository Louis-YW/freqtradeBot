  "content": "Giveaway scam is evolving everyday on different social medias, with cybercriminals coming up with great ideas. Which ideas, I think are no longer financed by human brains, but AI. Hence, they'll never run out of AI generated Ideas, on how to con cryptocurrency investors. I found a very real looking tweet of Elon Musk promising a party to users and a link under the tweet. Such tweet, when not looked into, one may think Elon tweeted it. Newbies should be careful of 4000BTC giveaways demanding for 1BTC to be eligible to win the giveaway. The scammers only play with people's fantasies. And when I thought their ideas, came to a halt. Chatgpt was birthed. Scammers took advantage of the AI, by asking it bad questions and earning ideas in return. Although the admins of OpenAI claim to be working on that, but new research shows that, even if the AI is trained not to give answers to questions regarding scam ideas, and terrorism in English, bad players can ask with alternative languages like Zulu. And the AI would respond using that language. Thereby increasing the rate of Giveaway scam ideas. So, newbies and everyone should stay careful of phishing emails, tweets etc promoting a giveaway. It's unlikely to get a genuine crypto giveaway. It's better to stay clear of it, as the few information required of you to join the giveaway can be used to sweep your cryptocurrency. Most of them are now equipped with AI generated Ideas, from what I understood from this article Image from a crypto giveaway article by coinbase https://www.coinbase.com/blog/crypto-giveaway-scams-and-how-to-spot-them",

If not greed/naivety why would someone expect something like 4000BTC, Elon Musk is a business man so why would someone just think he will just wake up and just do something like this when he is not getting anything from you. The only way he may give freely is through philanthropy  and making a single individual rich is not philanthropy.People can be just foolish at times and is hard for them to break out of their fantasy (if only they can just wake up to reality). AI scam will continue and its can't be stop because just like how others are using the Internet for good others are using it for evil. All that glitters ain't gold especially on the Internet.",

This is very unfortunate and the invention of this have just been hit by another big disadvantage of using it as it promotes and enhance scam. They better have a way to control this because it won’t mean we’ll fit them for the intention they created it for. I never liked AI since it was already prohibited in the forum, if you don’t depend on AI, it will only make you think more vastly and put your ideas into good use and improve your English here if it’s not your first language.New scams keeps coming everyday, and it is a bad sign for the modern technology we are embracing already. With time, they should be more solutions to most of this and it will help make the internet more cleaner for better use.",

The article also mentioned the YouTube giveaways that are playing some background like Elon speaking at a conference as well as such giveaways where the instruction is about depositing a certain amount. Those channels that have been hacked with hundreds of thousands of followers to millions make it also look legit, and it can easily get targets and victims.",

This giveaway scams in cryptocurrency doesn’t seem like something that will die off soon or even slow down because of the bounties run by upcoming Altcoin projects. So many of the people new to the cryptocurrency ecosystem and some greedy folks will fall prey to it. Another thing is the new blue tick rule on X (formerly twitter) before it was actually given to not just anybody but now just a subscription will grant you that. This has made scammers to create celebrities catfish account and use it to scam the followers through this giveaway of a thing.

Giveaway scams are always going after people who are greedy or don't know much about crypto.  They make big promises that you know can't be real, but some folks fall for it anyway.  The scammers know we all want easy money and so they try to trick us with things that look amazing but are really total scams.  It just shows that we have to be really careful in crypto and watch out for deals that seem too good to be real.  If it looks like a totally crazy giveaway or whatever, take a step back and double-check it and  the scammers are hoping you'll be so excited you dont think twice.  We've all gotta keep our eyes open so we don't get fooled.",

You should also keep this in mind, there's no such thing as free money. Yes, there are some people or a company that will give free money but not all the time or they give free money during their celebration.

And there are always those who are clueless, greedy, etc., and fall for the scam. Logically, scammers are now using AI leverage, taking advantage of the technological tools at their disposal to achieve greater success, so you need to be more aware than ever.",

It's important to help victims as a way of sympathizing with them by sharing methods or contributing to threads like this, as nobody can be too careful enough. Even an admin can fall for scam. Although, they're multiple ways these things happen, and I understand nobody would sympathize with a victim of a scam that promises them 3k BTC. But all form of scam still falls under the same category. And also gets us sad along the line. Since it's not the fault of some, calming them and helping out wouldn't be a bad idea. No such thing as free lunch, look at the new method Twitter is paying influencers to participate in the revenue generated on the platform. Recently, I saw a fresh update regarding the kind of posts influencers have to make to be eligible for the funds. You'd notice that they'll begin to tighten it and make it more difficult for influencers to reach the earning threshold. I'm saying this, in line with your Idea with Axie infinity, which are not scam projects, but when it comes to money it's never too easy to get. That's why people must stay clear of easy money making methods as It could be a scam method. Since, many newbies think of the internet as an easy place to make money, the market for scammers will continue growing. With enormous different ideas. These ideas also make it possible for them to gain recurring victims, as not every victim gets wiser after getting scammed the first time. Hence, awareness can save a newbie.",
