      "body": "You should move this on Altcoin Services board because you are paying in altcoin while this board only allow job offer that paid in Bitcoin.Also please indicate the exact website of your token to make a background on the project since you are paying on your native token that doesn’t guarantee any value in the future to pay the initial services from the user that will apply for this moderator job.I’m confused on the job description. Moderator typically moderate community and not promoting to various channel. I think you should be looking for an ambassador of your project rather than a moderator if the main task is for promotion.",
