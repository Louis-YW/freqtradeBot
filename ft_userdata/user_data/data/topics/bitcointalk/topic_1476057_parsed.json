  "content": "Disclaimer [This is a satire card set, I can neither confirm nor deny that any of the information contained here is or is not factual]Welcome Bitcoiners,The Bitcoin ecosystem was built by a great variety of individuals. This deck seeks to give props to those who have stood out. It is by no means complete and I'm sure some have been missed, so I apologize if some of you didn't initially make it.This is a Bitcoin card set based on the VS System cards. This is an open source card deck, anyone can add to it. In fact I've never even played VS before, so I have no idea if the cards are balanced correctly. And most of the cards need to have powers added. So any and all suggestions for powers will be used. This was done using Magic Set Editor for anyone who wants to get creative and show me up Individual card downloads coming soonThis was all inspired by this threadhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=654861.msg7350820#msg7350820So without Further ado.....and in no particular order, except alphabetical..Tips:1J7QzjdzVtV7meR82eK2ByZUFL4fBUs3he",

I see a lot of potential in this satire, i.e. you can make it for 'known/trusted' community members of the forum.Oh, and my cat is disappointed that you've left it out.",

Aah, I see... Indeed that's appropriate. Giving him some nice effect would also be great though. Maybe something like being able to decrease the opponent's ATK and DEF (yeah I play a lot of card games.).",
