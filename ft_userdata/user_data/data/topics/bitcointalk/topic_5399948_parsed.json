Why couldn’t I find him on google, seems to good to be true.You will only find scammers if your target price is 85$ for an S9, the average price for S9 is almost always it's monthly profit (before the power bill) * 3, right now it nets about 45$ so you are looking at about $135, but that's usually with an OEM psu, for APW3 you need to add 20-30$, to get the i or j version you are also looking to add a few tens of dollars on top, this has been the average way of pricing S9 since 2018.If your order is large enough, you might get a bit more discount, also, the x3 figure drops a bit when it's a bear market and people have less desire to buy gears, and it goes up a bit when everyone is fomoing, but you can use it as a solid average, anyone selling far below that price is likely a scammer, anyone selling way above the price is just too expenisve.",
