This news caused a dump in the crypto market, bitcoin is again trading near the $29,000 markI thought Bitcoin is the greatest hedge against inflation ever? The last year's bull run happened because companies declared that they will buy BTC to protect themselves against inflation. So why isn't Bitcoin growing now?My theory is that Bitcoin simply moves in speculative cycles - when a critical mass of investors buy, it creates hype and the price gains momentum and grows incredibly fast, then when the market runs out of new buyers, the process reverses and we have a bear market. The news don't really matter, they can be interpreted to fit either scenario. If Bitcoin goes up while there's inflation and turmoil in the world, people say that Bitcoin is a hedge and a reserve asset. If it goes down while those thing happen, people say that Bitcoin is a risk asset and it's normal for it to be also bearish.",

I think they are trying to deny the obvious, that the printing of huge amounts of money and all of the policies for covid-19 control and aid is the major cause of this extremely high inflation level, it is obviously not the only cause, but it has a major role to play.

The yearly low was $1700 and it’s still below that figure.8.6% doesn’t differ too much from the last 2 results but the fact that it rose 1% in a single month when the normal rate is 2% for the entire year is very worrying.

Well... it is not rocket science. COVID presented a perfect excuse for the central banks around the world, to print unlimited amount of money. A small portion of this money ended up with the ordinary people, just to make them happy. But the vast majority of this money was distributed among the most unproductive sections of the society, such as the unions and pressure groups.",

Core inflation excluding food and energy rose 6%. Both were higher than expected.- Surging food, gas and energy prices all contributed to the gain, with fuel oil up 106.7% over the past year.- Shelter costs, which comprise about one-third of the CPI, rose at the fastest 12-month pace in 31 years.- The rise in inflation meant workers lost more ground in May, with real wages declining 0.6% from April and 3% on a 12-month basis.Monthly inflation instead of the forecasted 0.7%, reached 1%. This news caused a dump in the crypto market, bitcoin is again trading near the $29,000 markWhile it is a shock to the system and is going to be very damaging for the average person if it persists over many years, it's easy to forget that other countries like Turkey are claimed to be suffering something like a 50% real inflation rate. The longer such rates stick around the worse things can get because people seek raises of the same amount which pushes the cost of goods and services up even higher. It becomes a vicious cycle, but the world economy is looking very dysfunctional right now - the Ukraine war is really not helping.",

There are two side to the story:1. Bitcoin is supposed to grow against inflation due to its limited supply. And it has happened and used to happen. People who noticed that their assets are depreciating due to inflation tends to move to Bitcoin to fight against inflation.2. Inflation affects all sector of the economy including Bitcoin itself directly or indirectly. In an economy where the inflation rate is very high, people will only struggle to survive and might have nothing left to invest. This affects Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But in the above scenario, an announcement from US stock is not supposed to have an immediate impact on bitcoin, I could not relate that. It could be a fast decline to colorate with the news or a mere coincidence.",

Most investors don't know where to put their money so you need to give it more time before making conclusions.Seems a bit unfair IMO that Bitcoin is taking so much critique as if during a period of stagflation crypto should be the only asset to rise in a market where every asset is doing poorly.",

First of all, it doesn't directly translate into the same price growth. Secondly, it can be a bit corrected by increasing salaries. Thirdly, you are unlikely to notice a change like that, not unless you're already from a very vulnerable group and barely made ends meet.The pandemic hit the economy hard, the economy which was predicted to get an economic crisis around 2020-2021 before the pandemic started. Then the sanctions, tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine are of course also impacting it. But I think the question should not be about the economy growth declining and inflation rising. It should be about the moral responsibility to stop a crazy genocidal war that brings pain and suffering to so many people and is likely to affect even more people due to things like Russia blocking the sea and Ukrainian grain being unable to thus reach the countries that heavily rely on it.",

Did you stop drilling or something? Are Exxon, Shell, Texaco speculating with these near 6$/gal prices for ther sole benefit?
