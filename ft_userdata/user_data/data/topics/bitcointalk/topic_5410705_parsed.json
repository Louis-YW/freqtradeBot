Hope the experienced will tell.Sorry to burst the bubble but we are not in a bull market yet.  The recent rally of Bitcoin is just a relief rally that was long overdue, meaning we just experienced another lower high where the price of Bitcoin has some recovery but not enough to reverse the market trend.  The reason why the bitcoin price is decreasing is that there is not enough demand to resist the selling side.",

If you look at past history, bear markets last for a long time, around 2 years. And we're not even one full year away from the ATH.But this is good, because bear market is the time for buying Bitcoin. Just don't forget to sell when the bull market will come, otherwise you will have to wait again for a bull run.",

Hope the experienced will tell.a few years ago when I met bitcoin the price was 400$, then the price went up to 3000$, I remember many people were happy but the price later dropped a lot, after some time the price went up a lot to 5000$, then the people were wondering if the price would be able to break the 10,000$, there were people who even said that the price would never break the 10,000$, but the price managed to reach 20,000$, and then it dropped to 3100$ and it went years without reaching again at 20,000$ that even people said it would never reach 20,000$ again, incredible that the price reached 67,000$, so you are still asking this question?",

Hope the experienced will tell.A few days ago the market went down from $25k to $21k. But now the drop seems to stop, there is no bleeding, and we are now on the $21,500. So that is a good sign that we will not go down to a price that we don't want to see, that is below $20k.I guess the decreased in the price was due to the announcement of United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce regarding bitcoin mining as it might contributed to the demand of fossil fuels. But then again we have heard this argument before and this seems to be no data that can back this up.",

Hope the experienced will tell.We’re not in a bull market yet, the last pump was not a bull trend it’s just the start of recovery and unfortunately we failed to stay on that level and that’s why we are down again. The price dumps because of the strong resistance and it’s not time yet for a new up trend, beside there’s still a lot of economic issues that can affect Bitcoin directly, this is why dump price is still possible to happen.",

Hope the experienced will tell.$21,000 to around close on $25,000 if that's not sustained, there's no bull run. It can be considered though as an attempt but got spoiled. Nothing we can do about that and it's even good that it doesn't happen right away. It's risky to experience again those huge jumps in price with only the hype as the reason.Will the price of Bitcoin rise again? You should know the answer already given its past performance. The only question is \"when\".",

Hope the experienced will tell.I hope that you understand too that the market is unpredictable, no one knows when the bull or bear market season. I tend to agree with the comments above, sorry but we're not yet in a bull trend right now Bitcoin still struggling for the price to pump up.  Every time when there's a resistance, it will not hold it longer there's always a correction. But we're on the same side, hoping that Bitcoin will have a bull market trend within this year, I suggest you not look at Bitcoin price daily in a chart, instead, invest for a long-term purpose.  Or, it's time for you to invest since there's a correction happening on Bitcoin price.",

Hope the experienced will tell.There's no confirmation of bull market, what you have seen is just an uptrend that tries to break the resistance but failed to do so. Bull market is not just a simple pump, because the whole market will be pump by that time and for sure it will be an expensive pump. Bitcoin will rise again eventually, you just need to wait patiently and invest wisely, this is the only thing you can do for now so you can win more once the market recovers and pump into a bull market again.",

Hope the experienced will tell.The lowest that bitcoin has reached after the recent bull run was $17k and we're at $21k and it has reached likely the highest of $24k. It's still not that far from the lowest. So, if you're telling us that we're already in the bull run, then that's likely just a trap. Whenever we see the price of bitcoin goes up, we're already speculating that it's the actual bull run. But in all reality, it's not yet.As it decreases now, it's a normal fluctuation of bitcoin so, if you think that we should be that high already then you're wrong with that speculation.",

Hope the experienced will tell.What we experienced few days back is not the perfect transition of market trend. It is just the relief rally that took the price increase. Soon after that we've been experiencing downfall in the price. This can get continued for some time period. Probably it'll test the $23k market, and if things didn't go good it'll drop again.",

There could be several reasons, the war is still looming in the background, inflation is also at a all time high in most of the countries, the effect of Covid still lingers and then other news that will come up from time to time. So we will have to see, short term or at least at the end of the year, maybe we can be in the range of $30k.",

So there are no special things that I can explain to you now for you to understand further.
