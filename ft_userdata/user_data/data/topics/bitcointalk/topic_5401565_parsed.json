      "body": "There is no price to open a new thread here, you can post freely anywhere except in a couple of boards that require you to rank up to make posts there. This is a thread you opened, and you didn't pay for it.There's also no minimum number of threads per day or week. There's just a cool down time between post based on your rank; so after posting or any action like searching, you would need to wait for a few minutes or seconds before you can post again. For your rank, it should be 360 seconds.This would encourage you to read more than you write.About information on the forum, try to focus on pinned threads at the top of different boards. Best to start with Beginner's & Help board stickies and then check other boards like Meta etc",

In addition, if you have a business much better to purchase a paid membership or a copper membership, in this way you can bypass those basic restrictions that a newbie has, like posting images, restrictions regarding sending a private message and the last one is wearing signature ads in under your profile.",

I cant found were is information about this forum , i want to know what is price to open a thread with a new product and where i can do it.Also i want to know how many threads i can post per day/weekThese questions are a bit concerning.  Personally, I'd be more excited if you asked questions like, 'how many threads can I read per week?' instead of how many you can create.  I'd urge you to not look at this forum like some sort of pay to post arena and instead think of it like an interactive dictionary.  You can learn so much here, but it's sometimes difficult to sift through the nonsense because anyone can start their own threads and as many as they want until moderators have to step in.  I think the right answer to your question might be, \"as many as you want,\" but the proper answer would be as many as you find necessary to share all the different information you have that would be of benefit to the community.",

Your concern should be about getting more useful information about bitcoin I believes that is the main reason why you are here unless the revise is the case, you can also learn from other members who have gained more knowledge on how to make quality post I believe reading their threads will be of help to you.",

Meanwhile, opening a thread on an offer is best done in the services sub-board of the forum and its absolutely free. Same applies to posting in other boards on the forum too if allowed and you should do well not to spam.Just a little observation for you to take note of; privacy is everything in a crypto platform. There is no point stating your actual name as you did. Your username would do just fine. Take note and less I forget, welcome to the forum.",

For gambling, there's Gambling board and for altcoin or nfts, there's altcoins to it's respective board. Just explore the forum and you will know where you should post your thread with the product as you have said. My guess is you are selling something. Good luck with your product by the way.",
