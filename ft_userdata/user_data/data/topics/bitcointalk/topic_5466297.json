Because it is part of the history of Bitcoin and this community!Do you erase the history of your country because it is already old? I do not think so. Why delete or hide the history of this forum?Attention, this is not just the history of this forum, it is the history of Bitcoin itself. Because no matter how many communities there are about crypto and Bitcoin, Bitcointalk will always be the central point of Bitcoin.You could say that the sub boards could be merged, and bring everything together in the same place. But doing so would only cause more confusion in busier locations, and in turn make accessing the history more difficult. The way is not to reduce, but to increase. For creating more child boards, in order to start gathering historical information. So as not to get mixed up with new information. Will this be necessary? It really isn't something important to do. But, it might be something to look into in the future.Therefore, each board in this forum has its own story, which combined makes the history of Bitcoin and the forum.",
