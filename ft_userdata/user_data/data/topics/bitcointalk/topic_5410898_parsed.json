This is just an assumption, you can't speak for all Africans especially Nigerians, especially since you cannot tell all our preferences exactly. If you make this claim, you should have at least attached a source for your data.Quote from: odunybiz on August 23, 2022, 07:27:23 AM Asset or liability?The debate between what exactly we can call an Asset and Liability will continue for a while as I believe that some things that some people may consider as liabilities may be assets to other persons, it all depends on usage IMO. A car for instance which may be considered a liability to some, can be a asset to a business person who uses it to facilitate their business in form of logistics or transport services to bring profit, which is also in line of what an asset is.Quote from: odunybiz on August 23, 2022, 07:27:23 AMI'm not saying buying expensive phones and cars isn't good but shouldn't be priority over ones investment. Phones and cars maintenance in some countries are expensive. You spend majorly on maintenance and repairs when you buy a fairly used or not too good item, in this case a phone or a car. If you can get a good one in very good working condition, it will be a while before you talk maintenance and repair, it would have served you already a lot and possibly made you some good returns already.",

I have seen young people's habits and I have noticed that they are so very much attracted towards latest electronics rather than building a habit of savings. People even buy iphone using loans. I am not sure about Nigeria but I believe this issue is everywhere. Young people should start saving money early in their life to get the advantage of time. But alas!

Acquiring assets can only be done by those who have their basic needs covered, and have money to spare. So, instead of squandering it or spending it on superficial things, he decides to save and invest it. But then I imagine it would be easier for people to acquire assets in Germany than in Somalia. Regardless of financial education. In richer countries there are more people who could acquire assets by holding back a little from consuming, and they don't do so because of poor financial education or other reasons.",

In simple terms, for most people around the world, the only good form of debt is possibly buying a house - which tends to have a low interest rate and in most areas goes up in value over the term of the loan above the rate that is paid. There are certain scenarios that might spur people to borrow money and it may be a necessity, like buying a car because you have to travel longer distances which might be the most economical way to do so. Generally though there are a lot of frivolous purchases made which should be scrutinized and avoided if possible, along with wasting too much money on vices like drugs or alcohol.",

Although this happen almost everywhere but I have chosen Africans especially Nigerians because I can easily check their way of life. I have friends in some other African countries like Ghana, Togo and Morocco. I have taken my time to compare our ways of life together. Nigerians love fashion. Most time they hustle hand to get this things. I even have an example here around me. A lady who have saved almost 70% of her 8 months salary to buy a phone of #140,000+. That means she had worked for 8 months to get a liability.

But most times they make savings from this little amount to buy irrelevant things. Here now in Nigeria, even though there is a claim that things are hard but almost all households uses an android phone. Imagine a household of 5 chaiming they are poor but all including the last child have an android phone which they use.",

Asset or liability?You did not add a source so that we can view which organisation carried out the statistics. Or maybe you were just estimating based on your experience or environment which would be very inaccurate. There are still Africans that are tireless investors and you can find them everywhere both in the slums and the Government Residential Areas. Haven said that I want to state that Africans also love liabilities. This is a cultural and historical defect that has kept many people in abject poverty. Africans like spending money on unnecessary thing or events. Even if a poor man dies, the community would force the family to sell lands or borrow money to give that man an expensive burial. It is only in Africa that someone must eat in a burial even if it was hunger that killed the deceased. African traditional marriage is very expensive that people sometimes become broke after getting married. We like celebrating everything in Africa, chieftaincy title, child naming, child dedication, birthday, are all avenues that African waste resources.When I see some of my relative come back to Nigeria from the West or the US, I am humbled by their simplicity. Their phones, clothings, cars, lifestyle are modest. Africans culturally like to be flamboyant, you can attest to that by the royal apparel of our traditional rulers. But it is time we cut all these unimportant expenses and focus on investing other profitable ventures.",

If 70%- 80% of your income goes to liability then one is preparing for a poor life.I would say the #1 difference between the rich and poor is.The rich read books and learn as a lifestyle.While the poor believe no good can come from either reading and learning.Its the mentality, lifestyle and attitude that is responsible for producing results. Although it definitely is becoming harder to reach wealth from a starting point of poverty. The goal isn't necessarily wealth. But rather learning things that are worth knowing. Which produce an abundance of wealth, inevitably.Not all poor people have thought that they should not be reading and learning.But sometimes due to forced circumstances, if you are born into a rich family, and do not have to worry about eating, living and daily expenses, then you will have more time to study and read, books on how to be people, books on how to get rich...On the contrary, if you are born into a poor family, you cannot afford to eat 3 meals a day, you have to work all day to cover daily expenses and you will not have time to read or go to school.In my hometown, there are many poor families, and parents have to work hard all day, but they always encourage and try to send their children to school fully. Because they understand that only education can give them a chance out of poverty.",
