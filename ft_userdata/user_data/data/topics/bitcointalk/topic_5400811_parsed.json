I just saw a forum that contains an exact question to mine and it has a special tag on the bottom part of the post that indicates the link to the solution same as the image provided below. Then I notice that on our own search feature, There's a specific post showing on each thread result of my search which contains the words that I'm searching for. But when you go directly to the post, It didn't answer the question due to the obvious reason of keyword search.I'm just wondering if it's possible to show only the top answer post which will be determined by the number of merits received of that particular answer the best possible method that community suggest below. I know that this impossible since this additional work to the forum. Just a suggestion for the future version of Bitcointalk.",

I mean, even if the issue has tons of merits but does not provide a solution to your concern, it may be meaningless, as opposed to unmerited/received few merits but solves your question, right?",

I forgot to indicate that the feature focuses on Beginner and Help board same as the screenshot that I attached. I understand that some best answers are still unmerited but this feature might help them to finally give them credits properly? Besides, I noticed that merit sources usually spend a lot of merits on this board so technically they will be the ones who will decide on the best answer by giving the required merits in able to become the top answer. The merit is just my assumption criteria. you should not focus on that.  Thanks for the reply guys!",

Ordering by merits, whilst it may prove to be interesting in some cases, loses track of the proper context by resorting the sequence of posts.I’m not acquainted with Bitcointalk custom scripts, but there is one by @hatshepsut93 that sorted the 10th Anniversary contest by Merits, though it looks generic and it may work on any thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5194870.msg52836909#msg52836909",

Sorting replies by merits would be a very bad metric and make it quite difficult to follow discussions, as not all topics are questions requiring answers. It would also be misleading as many replies and topics (helpful or not) go without receiving any merits at all due to where they were posted or how far down the thread they are.Userscripts are one solution. Another community generated one, would be the OP quoting the most helpful reply to them into the topic. This would be down to the discretion of the thread starter and may not be overall accurate, but could be a pointer to what posts to check out. Or just read through the discussion and filter the replies yourself.",

Even views on them doenst count and as such, the keyword search seems to be the best way to go. Reason being that, there are several materials in the form of threads or responses on them that treats a topic sentence and these topics are created repeatedly.Hence, its difficult to narrow it down without you even getting to get the title in exact that relates to your question. Perhaps the ninjastic.space might be your best option to narrowing things things down. Although, there are functions on the forum that helps to narrow your search range down to specific boards or even user if need be. Keywords might be one good option as, the answer you seek is likely not to be in a thread or not discussed conclusively in a thread and as such, it gives you the variability you need to access several materials.",

This could also lead to cool other uses to make threads more entertaining. Yeah, that's how I see this working as it is with other forums out there. The only problem with this, is it wouldn't happen a lot. A lot of questions come from newbies, which are here specifically for that question, and generally don't have any interest in continuing to post. So, likely a lot of them wouldn't pin these solutions either. The other option is to have a community based voting system, but that probably isn't perfect, and has room for abuse or misuse, since not everyone will agree on the solution to the question. Even when there's a rather narrow scope for the answer, you might only get partial information from one user, and then another one expands onto the point. So, either way probably isn't a perfect system.",
