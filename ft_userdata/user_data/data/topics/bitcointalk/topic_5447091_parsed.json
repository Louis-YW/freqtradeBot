If it's not, it can be moved to the correct board.I received a notification from the Bitcointalk Supernotifier which notifies you when there is a mention of your name on the forum. When I checked it out, what I saw was a bit strange, and I would like for someone to explain it to me because at first, I thought I was hacked. The link led me to a YouTube video, which is rather odd. Find a screenshot of the notification below.",

It does not belong to Bitcoin Discussion board and you have two options to post this thread in.Either Project Development board (in the announcement thread of that bot)or in Meta board (for forum issues).The first option is a best to move.",
