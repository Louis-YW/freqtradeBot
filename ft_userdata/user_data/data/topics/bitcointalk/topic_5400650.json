  "content": "Serious question I am not anti Bitcoin do not get the wrong impression and I have grown a deep hatred for our fiat system that is exploitative and ill natured. When we compare Bitcoin to fiat there are a couple of differences which I think could impact us in the future: 1. Bitcoin's will become more tainted over time2. This pushes governments to become concerned and impose more KYC requirements3. Eventually most Bitcoin will be tainted to a degree. If we look at this research concluded by economist Rogoff[1]:Quote from: IndependentRogoffâ€™s estimate of the share of currency held by consumers for legitimate purposes is even more suspect. He relies on surveys of consumers, who report holding 5 to 10 percent of all outstanding currency. Then, by assuming that any cash that the surveyed consumers do not fess up to holding must be held for nefarious purposes, he concludes that 34 to 39 percent of all currency in circulation is used by criminals.34-39% in fiat currency is a huge of money. Bitcoin is further limited by its cap of 21 million which means that if Bitcoin becomes the mainstream currency used by everyone the share of tainted money would be higher because of the cap with fiat more money is printed in the fiat currency which reduces this amount. We already know that governments require anti-money laundering evidence for many transactions outside of cryptocurrencies such as buying a house requires proof that the money was earned legally and not through illegal activities. Exchanging money on exchanges requires identity which they probably look at your salary reported by the government. We have seen that in the last couple of years governments have started to require KYC more, and I believe that as the share of tainted money increases, government regulation and intervention will also increase. I am not saying it is a problem of Bitcoin because I think it is unfair and most of us have probably touched money that has been used in criminal activities without knowing it. That is the nature of cash but cash cannot be tracked as easily. Blockchain works against us in this way, providing an easy way to discover tainted coins. The government could use this as propaganda if it wanted to and convince people that cryptocurrencies are bad because a good portion of them are used in criminal activities but not just this because they can prove it and further convince others that btc is \"bad\". How do we prevent this type of propaganda attack or invasion of privacy? [1] source: https://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?id=1289",

      "body": "1. It is technically possible to hide things. Monero can do this, their features can be implemented by Bitcoin if needed.2. People can mix coins. When more and more coins are mixed, then censors have to reject all coins (or accept all coins, in the same way as they accept cash).3. Taproot can hide the number of participants. You never know, how many users are behind a Taproot address.4. If Taproot will be banned, then we could use homomorphic encryption on verified public keys and do the same thing, by using more complicated math, but it could still work.5. Lightning Network can mix coins by default. Many clients will give you different coins, when you close your channel, and will leave your previous channels as opened (for example Phoenix wallet).6. If censorship will be common, then \"validation as a service\" will be created. You will pay someone for doing validation on your behalf, in the same way as people use fake IDs or SIM cards registered to someone else. It would be even easier than with physical items, because it can be done remotely, just by writing some software and using maths.7. If nodes will be banned, then we will start connecting outside TCP/IP. Bitcoin Core is trying to get there by supporting more and more protocols, see changelog of version 23.0.8. There is more. We can invent new ways when needed, some people are working on that.So, I think we know how to protect Bitcoin from censorship. My answer is just \"we should write a better code\".",

      "body": "The argument is largely on whether Bitcoin is fungible or not. That is a perfectly valid concern and has been discussed thoroughly quite a while back at the height of MARA's censorship.IMO, the solution as I see it is precisely as what you've said, all of the Bitcoins will eventually have some degree of taint. The basis of this 'taint' is often quite unfounded, without any concrete proof that the current owner of the coins is in knowledge or have any connections with the prior owner. There will be a problem of trying to determine what threshold does a service intervene and report to the government. If this were to be too low, then most of the users would determine Bitcoin to be unusable, and resulting in the services being unable to operate at all. There will be significant pushback from the community and these regulated services in this case, and only serves to further push these services to operate off the regulations and underground. It would just be a tradeoff between how much you want to regulate or not; an over-stringent policy doesn't benefit any party in this case. Regulations are okay, it just means giving Bitcoin more legitimacy, and if people don't want to comply with them, then more people would trade OTC and not rely on these regulated services.There are of course services which has started to use taint as a basis to close accounts, but those are cases where the user have a direct and clear connection, ie. withdrawing straight from an online casino to their exchange account.",

      "body": "It's worth looking at fiat and cash and think about if this money is 'tainted'. You're right that all money (no matter which form of money: cash, fiat, crypto, whatever) is going to be used for some sort of activity that in some countries violates some law. This doesn't make it any worse than before this activity, so it continues to be used just the same.For example:Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated_currencyMost banknotes have traces of cocaine on them; this has been confirmed by studies done in several countries. In 1994, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals determined that in Los Angeles, out of every four banknotes, on average more than three are tainted by cocaine or another illicit drug.Another one:Quote from: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-exactly-how-often-cocaine-and-feces-show-up-on-your-dollar-bills-2017-07-11Poop. A 2002 report in the Southern Medical Journal reported that paper money can carry more germs than a household toilet. A whopping 94% of dollar bills tested contained harmful pathogens like staphylococcus - the bacteria that causes staph infections, and can be passed by not washing your hands after using the restroom, or from contaminated food and dairy products.So as you alluded to, basically 'if everything's tainted, nothing's tainted'.What we can do?Run our own nodes, hold our keys, accept any Bitcoin and refuse any random arbitrary party's definition of 'taint'. Otherwise an economy doesn't function. Nobody checks a dollar bill's serial number or the substances found on it. Everyone just accepts it and uses it, certain that it will be accepted.If someone were to start differentiating which bills they accept, they would be cutting themselves out of part of the economy; we should treat those who try to have this attitude on Bitcoin, the same way. Stop making business with them if they don't want our coins, instead of trying to convince them our coins are good (by sending KYC documents or whatnot) - so they understand they're cutting themselves out of part of the economy, not the other way round.",

Newbies (that includes governments) come in and are confused about these differences so they try to treat every aspect of bitcoin differently. But the fact is that only some parts are different while others aren't.Bitcoin is money and like any other form of money it is used by every group of people for different purposes. Now remove every \"bitcoin\" word in your post and replace it with fiat and your topic is still true! Why? Because there is no difference between bitcoin and money.For example if you run a supermarket you have definitely received \"tainted\" money. But would you care at all about that? No. Simply because you are used to fiat system and nobody is spreading false information about an arbitrary thing such as \"taint\". But if you receive bitcoin and someone is spreading lies about \"taint\" then you suddenly are concerned!!!This made me wonder how would the government or people or services react if someone ran a \"fiat analysis\" (like blockchain-analysis) service and somehow services were forced to use it, like in case of our supermarket the owner was forced to first check the serial number of the dollar bill they received with this service for \"taint\" then accept or reject the payment!",

If bitcoin becomes the mainstream currency used by everyone, including criminals, there will be a huge increase in the number of bitcoin transactions. Also, with the increased number of people wanting their transactions to be included in a block, there will be an increase in the fee value because people have to pay miners to incentivize them to pick a particular transaction. Miners will take the fee and convert it back to a \"virgin\" state by including it in the coinbase transaction, which means a small part of each \"dirty\" transaction will automatically become \"clean\" once again due to the nature of the mining process. The more transactions we have, the faster they get laundered in the miners' laundry. If governments all over the world really want to get rid of dirty coins, they should make all miners refuse to accept profitable transactions or ban mining completely, convincing everyone to switch to a different consensus algorithm that is more susceptible to government regulation, proof-of-stake, for instance.",

Sure, technology can be written and improved to make it more easy to launder money, but it doesn't make it legal.So if you own billions in XMR and one day you suddenly want to buy a private jet with it, it will be very very hard to do.

You're trying to say that they convicted someone for having a dollar bill with traces of drugs, but then they could arrest everyone. That's exactly the point; since all fiat has drug traces, you don't normally get punished for paying with such bills. Therefore, when paying with some 'tainted' Bitcoin (used for illegal purpose in the past), it should also be accepted without issues as well.",

This is something I think will be a problem even if a lot of people do not share the same opinion here. Quote from: vjudeu on May 30, 2022, 05:13:38 PMForced? No, I don't think we are there. Not yet. At least not in my country..They do track spending of notes I think that is what the other member was saying but I know that bills that have been taken by a heist have been tracked in the past. I do not think they can send you to jail for spending on of them they are just tracked to give them a lead other evidence would be needed.",

This is something I think will be a problem even if a lot of people do not share the same opinion here.That's definitely happening: Lobby groups and governments do already pay millions to paint Bitcoin in a bad picture. It seems like a last-ditch attempt at stopping people from buying and using Bitcoin, which is very telling.We have a topic here where they try the old 'Bitcoin == climate change' falsehood which cost them a ton of money and I believe it has achieved nothing:\"Change the Code, Not the Climate\" FUD campaign coming next monthBut to get back on topic; if Bitcoin's transparency was going to be its downfall, all these weird attempts and mental gymnastics to somehow make Bitcoin seem like a bad thing for people, wouldn't be needed at all.",
