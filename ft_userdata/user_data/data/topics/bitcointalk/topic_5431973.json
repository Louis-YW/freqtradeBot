Although I wouldn't suggest using that payment processor but that's a different story:https://bitpay.com/directory/jewelry-watches/Google it. That's the easiest way to find what you are looking for. Try \"buy jewelry for bitcoin USA\" or a more specific key phrase that corresponds more to your geographical location. You can even check with local shops if they are willing to take bitcoin. Even if they aren't advertising it over official channels, they might be interested.",
