I can use any payment method that you want and I can send the money first. Trusted sellers only please, thanks.If you can pay using any payment method, why not choose a famous platform like Binance, complete the identity verification and buy from there, the transaction will be better, easier and faster.But if you don't want to lose part of your money in fees, you can try P2P trading like localbitcoin.If the payment method is not reversible, you can ask users and you may find interest.",
