  "content": "Hello, guys! How are you? I'm gagux123 from portuguese board  Before I created this topic I searched here on BitcoinTalk and didn't find anything similar, and that's the reason I'm creating this topicIt's been a few years since I've been participating in this forum, i'm learning, making new (virtual) friends, I even earn some money working in \"Signature Campaigns\" and others relevants things.With that, a way for me to reciprocate all these events, I'm creating this topic to help new users or anyone interested in publications/translations.Recently I was thinking how can i give back all these good things that this forum, cryptocurrencies and blockchain provided in my life!I am creating this topic - \"YOU CHOOSE AND I WILL TRANSLATE\"credit: @cryptobaboon - Guia Luso-Brasileiro de postagens no Bitcointalk○ WHAT'S \"YOU CHOOSE AND I WILL TRANSLATE\"?The user @cryptobaboon  created a topic with compilation of several relevant contents in the portuguese board, for example tutorials, curiosities and informations.\"The objective is simple, I will translate some topics chosen by someone (Portuguese board) and I will post the translation in the proper place/board here on BitcoinTalk.\"Guia Luso-Brasileiro de postagens no BitcointalkThis \"service\" will be completely FREE○ WHY AM I CREATING THIS TOPIC?• As I said above, this is a way for me to \"repay\" all things this forum has given to me!This compilation of translation that I'm going to create, can help a lot of \"newbies\" here on BitcoinTalk, even, maybe can be useful to an experienced user.• With these translations that I will do, this will improve my knowledge of the English language (because I am interested in improving my English language proficiency.• If someone wants to use the Google translator (portuguese >>> english), there may be some kind of inconsistency in the translation, because the Google translator is not 100% assertive in these translations.○ HOW IT WILL WORK??Any user can request the translation of a topic within that list created by @cryptobaboonExample:1° \"User x\" - \"gagux123, I would like you to translate the \"topic x\", is a tutorial explaining how to use the Ledger hardware wallet.\"2° I will translate this topic chosen by \"user x\" and I will post on the board about hardware wallet here on the forum.3° Then (in the post that I will reserve below), I will make the control and I will disclose the link of the translated topic and I will also insert which user who requested the translation.OBSERVATIONS○ PS: If I'm overloaded with this translations, I will take a while (translations);○ PS 2: There may be some possibility that I will make a mistake with the translations, because I am not a native english speaker.○ PS 3: I don't know if it's possible for me to created this topic in the services board, because with this subject in the \"Beginners & Help\" category, I believe it's better that I created the topic here, as it can reach a large number of users and also the less experienced.○ PS 4: Currently, I am working and studying (master's degree), maybe can happen the possibility that I need to focus 100% with these personal activities that I mentioned above, if that happens, I will take a while with my translations or I will have a reduced number of translations during the week.If someone have any questions or suggestions, you can contact me, and I will help you!That's it, i hope i was helpful with this \"\"service\"\"  Best,gagux123",
