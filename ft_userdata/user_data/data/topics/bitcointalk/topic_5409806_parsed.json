I have been introduced to this place by a trader, but I feel unsure whether this is a serious place or not. Any advice?One month old domain, claiming millions of users, claiming to be founded in 2013 and with offices in 84 countries and 3 billion in cold storage?There is no exchange in this world with that many offices in the first place!And that app with no links to google play but with 20k reviews, of course, it's nothing fishy at all.The \"trader\" is most likely a scammer who will trick you into depositing BTC on this website and then he will go deaf on all your other requests, except for the moment he will ask you for money to pay for cashing in your \"winnings\".",

Any advice?You actually got advice from a scammer, not from any trader - because those real traders don't give advice on social networks, but trade and make a profit. My advice would be to stop listening to the advice of unknown people on social networks, because first they will advise you to visit links like the ones you mentioned, and if you don't get caught in that trap, you will get a much more dangerous link that will contain malware or something similar.",

Unless you posted on socmed or forums asking for help for trading. Particularly if they introduce a website they called an exchanged. Always use google to check the website and make a google search \"site_name review\" to give you insights of what kind of website is this, check the website's social media handles, forums thread or reddit for reviews too.",
