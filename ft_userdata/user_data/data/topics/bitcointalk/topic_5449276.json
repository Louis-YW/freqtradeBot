  "content": "Most people being introduced into bitcoin sees bitcoin as a means of investment, precisely since 2018. They don't even care of knowing what it is use for, all they care about is that they can make money from it and this flaw has been exploited by the government and now most countries legalising Bitcoin, legalised Bitcoin as an asset instead as an digital currency.  I was once among these set of people who just sees Bitcoin as a means of investment not until I joined this Forum, where I saw a reason to read the Bitcoin Whitepaper and did research about how it helps in the field which it was created for.Bitcoin as digital currency was created to make online payments to be sent from one party to another without the need of an intermediary.I know people have various view of Bitcoin as some view it as an alternative to digital gold so they see it as a means of investment , some sees it as something that gives them total control of their money while they are other views but this is the most common aside from what it was created.Though, they have a solid reason to justify their claims but in the end this is not the main reason or use for Bitcoin. It is just a part feature that bitcoin offer as a digital currency.I don't really know how feasible is this my theory but this is how I see Bitcoin.I see bitcoin Blockchain as a country, where those who  works there are paid with Bitcoin \"just like how every country pays their citizens working with the country currency (those who receives salary in other currency in a country, obviously works in an organization that is not from their own country)\" and this is when the worker validate a block.Just like how there are those who are unemployed, unable to get a job done or are caught lying to have completed done a job are not paid, so it's on Bitcoin Blockchain, those who are unable to validate a block (unemployed), unable to get a job done or are caught lying to have completed a job earns nothing. This are the proof of work mechanism.When converting from one currency to another, the one with the highest value have a better edge (like if am converting from naira to dollar, I will be having less), Bitcoin is just another currency having higher edge than the other currency but just like how the rate from converting naira to dollar or any other currency may change, Bitcoin price also changes (though more volatile).This covers why bitcoin is seen as an investment. Then the wallet is a unique bank, that is to say, it gives you total control of your money (except when you using a CEX, which though still gives you more control of your money than the Physical banks but not total control of it). Just as some physical banks are more secured and better than the others, so is it for the wallet so you have to find the most effective and secure option for you. Aside from this the rate anonymity depends on the wallet you use. This covers why bitcoin is view something that gives total control of one's money. Like I stated before, there are various ways people view aside from the main reason it was created but if you check, you would see that all this are features that physical currency offers but with Bitcoin having more unqiue features to it. Now Bitcoin as a means of payment:When Bitcoin first came out, there where alot of criticism some saying it will make criminal activities such as money laundering, financing terrorism, Kidnapping easier and others speaking of how it not be accepted.There are other criticism which Bitcoin face, the criticism stood a ground at that time but not all are still standing and those critics of then and now, always try to find issues to speak against it and also not wanting to speak of uses of Bitcoin. Bitcoin as a means of digital currency has covered almost everything of it field (if not all)  as  a means of payment with the off chain and on chain protocol which has been use to aid payment like multi sig wallet, Lightning network, Schnorr Signature, SegWit wallet and others makes transactions faster. The multi sig wallet helps offer security, make not just a single person to get total control of an organization funds and also offers other benefits that helps the organisation. While the Lightning network, Schnorr Signature, SegWit wallet and some others are fixing the scalability issues.Bitcoin core members are working hard to make bitcoin the best means of payment and though Bitcoin still have some issues but they will be fixed. I prefer to see bitcoin being accepted as a digital currency and not as an asset or anything because that what it is.",

Bitcoin is not used for any specific purpose.  The price of Bitcoin is always fluctuating so it is profitable to invest in it and anyone can use it as a payment medium or as a means of saving money. many people also use Bitcoin for gambling  But I think it is used more as a potential investment. however, based on the population of Bitcoin, it can be predicted that Bitcoin can be used as an international payment method like USD in the future and many places have already started accepting payments in Bitcoin and it only needs to spread.",

Many places are trying to accept bitcoin as a method, but not as many as you say, and they aim to make an impression, not make bitcoin a natural means of payment. Even on this forum we are discussing investment more than currency.",

At the very least, by using bitcoin as an investment, you are already trying to prepare your future to improve. And when your country allows bitcoin as a means of payment, you already have more bitcoins and I don't think you want to use them because you must feel that bitcoin is too valuable to be a means of payment.",

While originally designed as a digital currency and payment system, it has now become a popular investment tool. It is difficult to predict whether Bitcoin will continue to succeed as an investment, but it is important to remember that there are still practical uses for it. There are still merchants and businesses that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. I do not think that this will change in the near future.

People can view it as an investment because it is a hard currency and is in the early stage of adoption and so therefore beyond just being a currency it is also the best investment in the world and will continue to be that for some years to come.I guess it is a little concerning how many people only view Bitcoin as an investment and they don't realize it is a currency. Like my mom (who even owns bitcoin) thought I held my bitcoin on Coinbase and I was like what no I hold it myself. And she literally asked me how is that possible lol. She didn't even know you can store bitcoin yourself, cuz she just thinks its an investment like a stock that only exists on exchanges.It's an education problem. The price movement and growth is the most public thing about Bitcoin so people just think of it as some financial asset like a stock. You can even see this in how it trades lately - Bitcoin being affected by Fed interest rate changes even though interest rates have no effect whatsoever on Bitcoin, because lots of people who buy and sell Bitcoin just think about it as some sort of stock, and stocks area affected by interest rates because companies are affected by interest rates.The general public probably won't think of Bitcoin as a currency until it is actually easy to use as a currency to buy things.

The rate of inflation and constant loss of value of the currency of most countries have made many people use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and devaluation.

Its primary function is to serve as a proof of transaction and prevent fraud.I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to explain here or to add to the forum, but if you're suggesting that Bitcoin is not meant to be used to earn money, then I think that's wrong. Bitcoin is a digital currency that can be used just like any other currency to buy goods and services or to send to someone. The advantage of Bitcoin is that it offers more control and faster transaction times compared to FIAT. You can send BTC to anyone in the world within seconds, with fees that you can choose to set. So, it's possible to earn Bitcoin by accepting it as payment for products or services rendered, or by trading it on exchanges like any other currency.",
