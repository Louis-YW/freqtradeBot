By doing this, they can raise funds to acquire more Bitcoin while limiting their direct risk exposure and maximizing potential rewards if Bitcoin’s price rises. Marathon Digital proposes $700M convertible notes to acquire more BitcoinQuote- Marathon Digital plans to raise $700 million through convertible notes for Bitcoin acquisitions and debt refinancing.- The notes offer conversion into cash or stock, with specific rights and early redemption options for holders.I wouldn’t be surprised if more companies start jumping on this bandwagon since it’s a clever way to balance risk and reward in this volatile market. The competition to accumulate Bitcoin is definitely heating up..",

With Bitcoin hitting $100K soon and US's pending treasury reserves in Bitcoin implementation, it's going to full FOMO season for Bitcoin.Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy are game changers in traditional market and Bitcoin market. They initiated a new method of convert company asset, raise fund from customers and invest in Bitcoin build up massive wealth for everyone engaged.Other companies see this successful method, and it's reasonable that they don't ignore this open-access investment method, apply it for their companies and get success like MicroStrategy. I would like to stay with a classic advice, following the leader, in this case the leader of this method is MicroStrategy. Why people ignore MicroStrategy and invest money into other companies that are late comers and copied strategy of MicroStrategy, it's unreasonable decision.",

But these big firms like MARA and MicroStrategy seem to have so much confidence in Bitcoin that they would issue convertible notes to raise money for buying Bitcoin. MARA's convertible notes will be due by the first quarter of 2030 but could be redeemed by 2028 if the investment is profitable. Maybe the company is targeting to sell in the next bull run and optimistically they would make enough profit from this risk.   Quote from: pooya87 on November 30, 2024, 04:05:30 AMMaybe, but I think it is mostly the media that has changed.

The majority of people don't care about privacy or decentralization, all they want is more money. Maybe the media is gradually mispresenting the main reason why Bitcoin was created and new Bitcoiners are buying the misconceptions.",

But you're right as well that if ever they start dumping the holdings they have, there are always buyers willing to take over those sold Bitcoins.AFAIK, they just can't sell everything all at once and it's going to be in sequences and batches. But I guess that I'll have to look at the brighter side on this that they're helping Bitcoin's demand to become higher and make the price better.There's always the two side but weighing in, the better one is the positive that we're having right now that makes the price goes up.",

Prior to June 1, 2029, the notes are convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.From what I understand, it’s like you have trusted your money with them for a set period, usually long term. Once the bond matures, you can sell it at whatever the price is at that time. However, if we analyze closely, It’s all in their favor as they can set a share price lower than the actual profits your money has made, especially if Bitcoin’s price has gone up.",

We can not change them, but if they can help to increase money inflow, it will be helpful for Bitcoin market to have bigger demand, higher price, bigger market cap.
