So i can show here my PNL There is no PNL on spot trading pairs because you are not opening/closing position, you are buying coins/tokens. Fliping from one coin to another. Poloniex does not know what's your native currency (USDT, BTC, ADA) so it doesn't know when you actually open/close your position. 3$ is not enough. \"The minimum trade amount varies depending on the base trading pair and are as follows: BTC, 0.0001USD (any), 1TRX, 100BNB, 0.06ETH, 0.0001.\"https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040031373-How-to-TradeSo for some tokens like TRX you will be below the minimum transaction thresholdTrading with this mindset is gambling. Trading with $3 on such a illiquid exchange as Poloniex can bring unexpected returns that will be unreliable and mean nothing. For example, I once had a trading bot that did up to 100% a week on providing liquidity on a small exchange. The math shows that I would have made $500 to $30 million in just 4 months, but the truth was that the bot couldn't make more than $500, a week, on average, because the volume was so small.",

So i can show here my PNL Spot trading with $3 is ridiculous because even if you can make 20% profit from it, it will be only 0.6$ profit.  So you cannot earn a big capital by trading with this capital. You can make some profit by gambling with $3 or doing futures training, but you can never get anything good with so little money on the spot. I am not encouraging you to invest high amount. But since you say you have a long experience in trading so I would say increase some amount and then trade then you can earn good profit.",

So i can show here my PNL I don't know, I don't want to jinx your goal or your challenge to yourself as you said, but its a good practice challenging yourself with only limited capital, not limited from your capital you have a small liquidiry, which means limited leverage and limited margin of loss, so I think it will ve a bit hard for you to make it grow as you have a low leverage you also have a kow profir, but profit is profit, if you can make it grow then it will show that you are a good trader, if not then still good for experience and also you only have a little amount of loss, anway goodluck I hope you update us on what will happen to your challenge, either good or bad. Some might say that you can't do it or discourage you, but it's a self-challenge, and I see that you want to try yourself, so that's fine.",

I don't know of the platform you are using to trade but if the trading platforms I know, they will not accept that deposited amount and allow you to trade with it.

Like deriv which I have been using to trade was taken the minimum amount is $10 and I was using Bitcoin to trade in that platform.  And what I will advise is that use that amount and convert to another coin and not Bitcoin but any altcoins that you can use to trade.Because if you use Bitcoin with that amount then it would not work.

However, $3 is still too little, especially if you trade on the spot market. If you trade in the futures market, it might be better because there is leverage that will help your capital.I don't use poloniex, but as far as I know exchanges usually have minimum limits for crypto purchases and can $3 be used to buy crypto? I think it would be better to increase your capital, maybe around $20 or $30, that's probably much more logical",

Some famous and popular centralized do have this, because with $3, most of exchanges don't qualify it as \"minimum amount to trade\".",
