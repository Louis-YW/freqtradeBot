Running my own node helps checking it? Thank you Yes I will recommended to verify the status of your transactions on the blockchain. It will ensure your transaction validity and completion of your transaction. You can do this task just by checking the transaction details on a any blockchain explorerIf you are running your own node then its provide more decentralized  way to verify your transactions. When you run a node, you validate transactions without relying on third-party services. In node you just have to connect wallet with node and here you could check transaction here with full privacy.As a normal user , I will recommend sample site (Blockchain.com) which is easy to check but if you have good knowledge of node then go for advance transaction checking",

Running my own node helps checking it? Thank you You really don't need to double check all the stuff going in and out of your wallet. Especially after it's confirmed - that data gets stored on the blockchain so your wallet grabs it from there anyway.  Kinda pointless to keep rechecking.  But say something seems weird or you just wanna peek at the details on an independent blockchain explorer site.  Those sites can get your IP address and other private stuff then pass it to who knows who and  better to cover your tracks. So I'd say throw on a VPN or use Tor if you're worried about that.",

Just take note that being valid is not enough and you should never accept an unconfirmed transaction. It's possible that a transaction is now valid now but unconfirmed and becomes invalid after a while.",

Running my own node helps checking it? Thank you Yes you can run your own full node to avoid using the public blockchain explorer which could affect your privacy. Also just as said when when receiving a transaction do not rely total because it is in the explorer, have Atleast 3 confirmations or 6 confirmations which is considered the most safest option to avoid anything like a chain reorg in the process which could render even a 1 confirmation transaction invalid.

If the purpose is to check any transaction without relying on third parties, a prune node wouldn't be helpful and you would have to run a full node. That’s true but since a prune node can have some past blocks stored too, that means not all new address that needs to be verified it has to download past blockchain because some of the recent address might already have its block already on the prune node. It will redownload the entire blockchain again only if the address to be verified is older than the main address running the prune node?",

Yes, you have to redownload the entire blockchain.Every time you import a new address/private key or a new wallet in bitcoin core, it has to rescan and that's not possible if you are running a prune node and you don't have the entire blockchain. Note that there is no way bitcoin core can know when your address was first used without having access to the entire blockchain.",

But what makes you think the watch-only wallet may be fake and shows wrong information? Didn't you create the watch-only wallet by yourself? What software did you use for creating your watch-only wallet?By the way, note that if your transaction has received 1 confirmation, it will likely receive more confirmations, but you shouldn't consider a transaction with 1 confirmation final especially if you have received a big amount of bitcoin.",
