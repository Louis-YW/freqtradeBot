This is my major complaint. The price is ok in my opinion. Finally the BTC only version shouldn't be limited edition but a proper product.",

Finally the BTC only version shouldn't be limited edition but a proper product.I have only known about the wallet as its preorder started today. I used the keyword Trezor safe 3 to search on this forum to know if the topic has been existing but I did not see anything. I am just knowing this right now. I will lock this thread and continue on the other thread.It is worth mentioning that o_e_l_e_o commented on the other thread that the secure element is close source, just like others like Ledger Nano. The wallet is cheap but I will not go for anything that I do not know how it is generating my seed phrase, keys and addresses. Trezor has continued going worse.",
