  "content": "Hilarious summary or the defence:Quote from: bbcFaruk Fatih Ozer, 29, fled to Albania in 2021 with investor assets after his Thodex exchange suddenly collapsed.He was extradited back to Turkey in June and found guilty of money-laundering, fraud and organised crime.Ozer told the court he would \"not have acted so amateurishly\" if his intent was criminal, state media reported.\"I am smart enough to lead any institution on Earth,\" the Anadolu agency quoted him as saying.\"That is evident in this company I established at the age of 22.\"So, basically man claims to be such a genius that we should believe he can pull a better heist than this, but at the same time we should believe that he is such an amateur that he fails to run a generic crypto exchange and loses all the assetes. And being such a genius he goes and gets caught by interpol from albaniaProsecutors asked for 40,562 year sentence so i guess THAT was ridiculous, unlike 11,196 years which is totally sensible. It might not be enough, but it sets an example. I might have a personal issue with scamming crypto scammers as i've seen those people ruining so many lives in this scene.But he is a first timer, so maybe he sits only half of it.Sourcehttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66752785SBF must be thanking his lucky stars for not been born in Turkey.",
