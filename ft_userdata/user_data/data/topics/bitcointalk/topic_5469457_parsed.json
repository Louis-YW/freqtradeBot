Make we no dey think say outside na heaven because even for that side you go need do multiple jobs if you wan get a better life, abi you never hear people dey do multiple jobs as shifts just to get enough to survive, make we no dey think say e easy for anywhy. E get good paying job for Nigeria here wey dey pay well and you no need multiple sources of income to survive but just that the jobs dem no plenty and we dey overpopulated for this side for job to do us. I wan correct something, if you want to get out of poverty, no be plenty jobs go solve your problem but investment will, because investing the bare minimum can help you elevate your financial situation but person wey dey do multiple jobs fit still dey inside poverty as all the money him dey make is going to sort a bill or wasting them on liability.QuoteIf there is a way that working salary would be increased, tit would at least reduce the need for multitasking because all these things are part of those things that gradually affects our health and reduce life spam.Multitasking isn't bad, it's a type of hustle that when you do it very well you can generate enough capital to be used for you to start a business or investments to help better your standards of living and takes you out of poverty through your investments. Dem dey multi task for everywhere but as you dey do am, no go over do your own. Know your limit and stop at a point because there's no point in making the money and you won't enjoy it. Always look after your health and don't do jobs that'll stress you out. You can have a salary jobs and do some bot hustle on the side and when you get home do some trading or working online. When you multi task like dat e no go too weigh you but if you wan do all as manual work, you'll be stress out.",

Bros no vex which strength that person won use run all these jobs wey he no go choke am. Life na planning and no be by how many work you dey do but na how you use your head arrange your life na him go help you over poverty for the nation. If person get government work or any work wey dey pay am from 100k above, him fit save from there start up business. The problem be say we no know the kind of business wey you go do, wey go progress, this na another problem. Look around your area make you find the commodity wey people dey buy well and wey no too dey the area, from there, you set save plan how to start to sell that commodity or better still only sell essential commodities wey you know say people no go fit do without, so that at least everyday you must sell something. As the price of things dey high, you too go dey increase your own price base on how much you buy, with this you dey sure say you go get gain. Another one na, If you invest in bitcoin with small small money every month when you get you pay. As long as you get wetin dey give you money to dey chop and to take care of other responsibilities, you no go put your mind towards selling your bitcoin investment and gradually, your investment go dey grow. Our problem be say we dey go spend money sometimes for things wey no dey necessary or important to us, all those uneccessary spending too dey follow worry person financial life.",

I have seen people who multitask themselves unnecessarily, they died before their time. The best way to multitask your self is to find jobs that fit your other job , you should have a major job while others will act as side hustle. That will help you to be focus not running from one work to the other in the name of hustling for money. Health is wealth",

Multiple stream income are very essential and you must learn to cut down cost for yourself and your family to be able to survive there are some things you don't attached values any more if not you would get breakdown.

I think I will kinda disagree with you on the particular theory of multi tasking because having two or more things doing doesn't particularly classify or guarantee that you are not rich but it's actually the basics for every hustler or even a rich man to particularly have more than one job, I mean it's rather just increase the stakes of having more cash inflows.",

But I doubt if anybody in Nigeria can successfully get up to 5 jobs at the same time. I can agree with getting two but five in Nigeria is very unlikely, considering our employment system that  mostly unemploy people on 8-5 Hours routine, it's will be a bit difficult to get up to that number (5).",

All these things just to survive. Perhaps you would know other method that can help reduce multitaskingI purposely highlighted the first sentence as you used \"most,\" how possible is that? Most jobs are time demanding and need your attention, not a divided one, so it's not easy as you narrated unless you are a shop owner in addition to what you do. Even if some people are doing it, it's a heavy burden on them and it will be a very negligible number of people that would cover much in a day, which will often tell in their health, and money is not everything. The time to do all that means that the person will have to work almost 24 hours a day without sleeping/resting as it's not easy to be actively involved in 5 different jobs, or should I call it occupations in just a day? Come to think of it, your main job is a paid one, and a job of that nature will take you between 9 am and 5 pm, even if you know how to cut your corners, you will still do an average of 9 am - 2 pm. Is it the remaining hours of the day that will cover up for the remaining 4 occupations? I don't see how that is feasible really, they will clash and will not work. Working three hustling together is still more feasible but likewise tasking and it depends on the nature of the job, while 2 jobs are better and common these days in Nigeria if one exempts farming from it.However, this is not what we call multitasking, multitasking is the act of performing the task/job at the same time, better say simultaneously. You won't have to leave a vicinity before you multitask. I deem it fit to make this correction since we learn daily. Nonetheless, what you described is widely referred to as Moonlighting, but in some spheres depending on the job, it could be called Juggling.It's so unfortunate the state we find ourselves in Nigeria, a country where Master's and Ph.D. degrees do not guarantee a good living not to mention of good retirement. As much as we citizens have our share of the blame, the government and their poor leadership have the most of it and have dragged the situation into a state of hopelessness. Gone are the days when parents were proud that their children went to school alone, now, people are starting to enrol their wards in outside schools extracurricular training like barbing, tailoring, engineering work, beauty house, furniture apprenticeship and other training and artisan works that were like a taboo for those who went to school in the olden days. I can't blame them since it's for obvious reasons that education has failed so many people in the country. Those extracurricular training are the plan B and there are some children that would have learned 3 of them before they eventually graduated from the university.This is shameful in a country that is blessed with huge potential and natural resources.",

      "body": "Technically, one might not still be able to escape poverty if they lack the ability to manage their resources. You know that apart from those that are just earning a small amount on their salary, realistically, there are also some people who are earning a reasonable sum of money but have not overcome poverty, nor have they overcome it. Why is it so? If that question gets a good answer, then multi-tasking can help some people overcome poverty while it can't also help some people. It can also help some people to only live comfortably at that moment, but you know that nothing lasts for ever; you cannot be young for ever. The time will definitely come when you cannot multitask again. So what I am saying in essence is that if one practices budgeting, planned spending, develops a saving habit, and learns how to invest, they will likely escape poverty.There's a saying that \"those who have no good plans, plan to be failure.\" Definitely, if one has some good plans and a better strategic means of working towards their plans, then they will likely achieve success.",

If you know a skill, know it very well to be able to solve problems, the more problems you're able to solve, the more money you'll be able to make. Secondly, we all need to work smarter, shun greed, expand your network of like minded people. The more connections you get in your line of business, the more money you're likely to make.I am never a fan of doing a lot at the same time, NO. The goal is to stay focused in your hustle and not looking for another  new hustle everyday. There are several upgrades you need to do in that your business to keep up with competition and continue solving problems. The problem is that most times, we don't adjust to emerging changes. We can't keep doing things the same way and be expecting a different result. It doesn't work that way, you need to adjust to the trend if you must succeed.",

There are so many reasons as to why it all seems rough for them and the reasons prompted them to striving by all means to live.

Most people fit just Dey gather as many skills as possible so that they would be able to fit in whatsoever space they find themselves.   The country is so hard that a single job is no longer enough to sustain or be enough for the daily lives of the hustlers or citizens, that’s why it’s important to have more than one job or business that brings in capital, it’s not easy to multitask but the country left the citizens with no choice but to survive by all means, there are so many ways to multitask, for example one can be working for the government and also have a small business of his or her own that they sustain on. In essence, a solo job won’t be enough to survive averagely in the country, therefore multitasking seems as the only alternative regardless of its tediousness and unless the economy is being worked on there won’t stop being backwardness in the means of survival.",
