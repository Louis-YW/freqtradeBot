  "content": "Since the world is full of vaccinated people, how can you get away from them so that you aren't poisoned by them? Should you move to a hideaway in the Andes or the Urals?The best thing you can do is stay away from all people a little. If some of them are unvaccinated, they still might be carrying poisons they inadvertently received from the vaccinated. The second thing to do is to find out ways to detoxinate yourself as best as you can.Part of the answer might lie in a few ionic mineral products that seem to fix the blood somewhat.Vaccinated individuals are “infecting” the unvaccinated with dangerous graphene oxide, says biomedicine expertQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-07-25-vaccinated-individuals-infecting-unvaccinated-with-graphene-oxide.html# Dr. Philippe Van Welbergen, one of the original experts to find damage from the blood due to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, found that unvaccinated individuals have graphene and self-assembling nanoparticles in their blood – a manifestation of shedding from those who took the shots.Van Welbergen is a specialist in biomedicine who deals with chronic cases. He has postgrad work in women’s health in pharmacology, bio-pharmacology, advanced pain management and aesthetic medicine, which is why he was able to detect developments of patients that were seemingly out of character or did not make sense in terms of the patients’ diagnostic history.“One of the tests that we run routinely as a diagnostic support tool is red blood cell morphology – it means that certain conditions can change the shape of a perfectly good red blood cell from a lovely little donut with a dimple to very strange shapes,” he explained during a recent appearance on the “Dr. Jane Ruby Show.”The host, Dr. Jane Ruby, pointed out that there are two main ways the injections – whatever is in them – can be transferred to another person who is not vaccinated. This could be through inhalation or skin-to-skin contact.Van Welberger said that in looking at the pure blood smears, which he took straight from an individual to the microscope, he noticed that the unstained blood “started picking up unusual, tiny structures” that he has never seen before.He then presented data showing that red blood cells – which are usually round and doughnut-shaped – have been damaged by the spike protein. Those cells have become quadrangles or octagon-shaped instead of round. They have become messed up due to the spike protein damage and cannot be restored. (Related: Is graphene oxide what caused Japanese authorities to suspend Moderna’s “contaminated” covid vaccines?)“You can’t repair red blood cells,” Van Welverger explained. “So these things are basically lost to us.”Moreover, because these cells have lost their shape, they cannot move through the macro circulatory system. Instead, they just bunch together and block things....",
