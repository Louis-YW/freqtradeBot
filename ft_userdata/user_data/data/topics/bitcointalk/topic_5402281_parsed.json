  "content": "With the downward slope of the BTC, crypto investors believe that for the market to recover, measures need to be taken. Amongst these enthusiasts we have Galaxy Digital C.O.O, Mike Novogratz pitting his two cents. The Galaxy Digital CEO said:“My hope is that by the fourth quarter, the economy will be slowing enough that the Fed says we are going to pause, and then you will see the next crypto cycle start. Then Bitcoin will break from equities and lead markets\".  He also strongly believes that BTC will not trade well if the Federal Reserves do not relinquish control. If this matter is not looked into, it would be shocking to see how a digital asset embraced by the world would  sink to unimaginable lows. https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/billionaire-mike-novogratz-predicts-next-crypto-bull-run-begins-in-q4&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwja7-y7iKj4AhW58LsIHYppBSMQFnoECAYQAg&usg=AOvVaw3Va3XBGqoQTatDKX-CVvKx",

      "body": "Of course a permabull would say that bull market is coming soon. Even if it hasn't been one full year since the last ATH. And of course anything can happen, Bitcoin has always been unpredictable, but still there's a pattern that there's usually quite some time between the ATH and a start of new bull run. And it's more likely that this pattern will remain true.I wouldn't pay much attention to what the FED is doing or any other events in the world, they do not strongly determine Bitcoin's price.",

Then Bitcoin will break from equities and lead markets\".The expectations he mentioned have a historical basis, which is that Bitcoin usually closes high at the end of each year.it is natural for us to close on a high, but the question is from what bottom? previous summit? 30k? or less?The analysis that Mike Novogratz mentioned is trying to link Bitcoin and stocks by making the Fed the main controller in this market by adjusting interest rates, but prices are far from the Fed’s direct control and perhaps need more powers and legislation to be able to make a change in the price of Bitcoin in the long term.These times are not useful for beginners or for following opinions and expectations, either you buy more or consider the value of your currencies at zero and wait for several months/years but do not sell.",

I can totally get behind a Bitcoin permatat (not on myself but well, I'd pat someone on the back for it) but this rando shitcoin I'd never heard of until last month?Not that I used to think the world of him, but I'd never actually framed him to be one of those.Anyway, as you say, times are a lot harder than most alive have experienced. Probably will get even tougher. Can't really bear to think how bad, but should no be deluded into thinking a cycle is en route.",

This is why we need to explain this to everyone, and make them understand that the moment FED stops, is the moment to buy, and we need to talk about this for months before it happens.",
