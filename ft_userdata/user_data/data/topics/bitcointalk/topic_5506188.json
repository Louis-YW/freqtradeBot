  "content": "I have seen some threads where people claim that Bitcoin was created by the FEDs or the US government.  Recently, an entrepreneur and investigative journalist, Dave Troy,  filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the FBI, which is aimed at uncovering information about the identity of Satoshi. The FBI responded that \"Satoshi could be one or more third-party individuals, and they can neither confirm nor deny their existence\". This response simply means that the FBI didn't confirm or deny  the existence of any records related to Satoshi Nakamoto. Unsatisfied with the response Troy is planning to push forward for the release of any information about Satoshi. So he is planning to appeal this scanty response. The agency's inability to give any valuable information about the creator of Bitcoin shows that the identity of Satoshi will continue to be a mystery. I don't know why people are putting so much time and energy into unveiling the identity of Satoshi.",

For fame maybe, they want to be the one who finally unravels Satoshi's identity, but we very well know how it will end, in nothingness. I don't really care what one investigative journalist or the other does, they are free to see if they will find something, which they won't, but what i do not like is when true bitcoiners engage themselves openly in also trying to unravel Satoshi's identity, when i see no need for that, they already left us with BTC, better to put that energy in its development.",

The FBI said the right thing, it's either a group or an individual that we will never know.Quote from: Fiatless on August 14, 2024, 10:37:32 PMI don't know why people are putting so much time and energy into unveiling the identity of Satoshi. He's a journalist and that's part of his investigation to unveil if his efforts are going to be worthwhile. But as we can have that guess, he'll never find the real answer and real satoshi.The first one that we'll know if satoshi is still alive is us, he'd for sure be back on the forum and have his greetings here for which I doubt will happen.",

I think they're doing that to know who's the genius that created Bitcoin when there was nothing like it before. At the same time they might want to get public attention because whoever searches for Satoshi gets attention of the public.We all know that Satoshi used to be active part of this forum and he/she/they have totally left posting in 2010 and that's all we know. There's no need to know more about him/her/them because the product of Satoshi aka Bitcoin is still with us and has made many of us financially stable. Thanks to Satoshi for creating Bitcoin!",

I don't know why people are putting so much time and energy into unveiling the identity of Satoshi. It’s best if they never find out Satoshis true identity. Definitely best for Satoshi but even more so the maker behind the brilliance surely would be very intriguing to learn the identity or identities and see what they are up to now but we are not meant to find this out I don’t think. I think it will always remain a mystery.",

The government would be the most interested to know who is the real satoshi. I am sure that they will find ways to make Satoshi somehow responsible and answer to them. Meanwhile some people are just curious. They most likely look up to Satoshi and would want to know their identity. I have seen many dream about meeting Satoshi just to ask him questions.While others I am sure intend to rob Satoshi one way or the other. I think we as a community should just move on. Not knowing Satoshi does not really make much of a difference anyway.",

Many would be interested to know him especially if they can confiscate his millions of BTC. Just think about a government learns that he is a Russian and that millions of BTC goes to Putin. I think there will be lots of people would sell their BTC. But the same thing happens if the US government confiscates the BTC if they find out Satoshi is actually from NY. What would happen to the ETFs? If the government plans to make BTC a reserve currency, they have to get millions of BTC or maybe they already have it?",

This guy is an investigative journalist, his job is to reveal mysteries and find the truth. He shouldn't rely on FBI giving him info for free. He should launch his own investigation and publish the results.To be honest, I don't care about Satoshi's real identity. Revealing his identity wouldn't change anything in the crypto world at this point.What if Satoshi isn't a US citizen? The FBI doesn't have jurisdiction outside the USA. Maybe this guy should ask CIA, Interpol or Europol, but Satoshi isn't a spy or a criminal.",
