  "content": "Good day to all my forum members here, Let me share a little bit if I know about how to do a pullback trading strategy and it's also good for beginners here, because it's very simple to do it and even if we already have Another trading strategy is that we can incorporate this so that we don't miss the opportunity of a good trade and we don't just rely on one strategy.So now let's find out what is Pullback Trading or we can also call it Retracement. Because the price does not run in a straight line, we normally see a pull back. When the market is trending upward there is always a pull back. Let's just remember that this is a battle between Buyers and Sellers. When the buyers side is strong we will see an uptrend and when the seller sides are strong we will see a downtrend.Because of the uptrend market there is a pullback, because the sellers temporarily have overpower over the buyers.Every pullback we see is a failed attempt of a reversal.In this case, we can take advantage if we know how to identify a pullback properly. It depends on the timeframe in which we are trading because that happens in any time frame. So we are looking at 3 key levels to identify the possible pullback. In an uptrend market we are not able to buy immediately before a breakout. So what we do is we wait for a pullback and this often happens at Support and Resistance.When the market goes uptrend there is always a pullback, but it depends on how strong the trend is. If the trend is very strong, then the pullback is not that deep. And this normal pullback picture that we see does not reach its previous swing low.In this case, in our example, this is his previous resistance that can serve as support because it has been broken.So let's see if the price approaches to take a long position. And of course we will not forget our stop loss that has a distance from the support that depends on risk management.In this case the trend is not in our favor, so it is also important that we know the historical movement of the assets so that we know the precious support and resistance where the price can bounce.same concept in the short position in the dwontrend market, all we are looking for is the key levels like support and resistance where the price can be rejected. Like the example in the picture below dwontrend market.We can see here how the previous support that may have become resistance levels is repeatedly rejected.The good things is we can also do this strategy in the trading range market. As long as the swing Hi-low is far apart to have a chance of profitability.",

      "body": "PART 2 CONTINUATIONAnother tool that can be used to anticipate a pull back is the Trendline.One also serves as Dynamic support and resistance. So there's a possibility that the price will bounce or reject here. A good example is this chart you see. We have an uptrend market and if we notice that the price is bouncing so let's just see how the price pullback.It is not really necessary for the price to stick to the trendline. Sometimes it doesn't reach or exceeds a little. And depending on the timeframe, if the upward run has been quite long, it is possible that there will be a reversal, so we should also be aware of that possibility.This is also the strategy for the short position if you notice that price is also rejected on the Trendline. Meaning this can happen again when the price approaches the trendline again, we can put a short position.If we don't want to use Trendline, we can use Moving Average.Here we can see the price bounces and is also rejected here. It still depends on the timeframe, what period we set the moving average and also depends on the token in which period it reacts. The movement of the price is sometimes different so we need to double check it. The history of the assets to which the set-up MVA reacts. As in the trendline, the price respects the moving average for an uptrend market, we will just see if it pulls back.In the same concept with the short position, let's just wait for the price to return to the resistance levels and wait for a rejection.We can also look for Confluence levels.In the example image above, we can see that we used a moving average and to strengthen the confirmation, we will also see if that area was previously resistance that can also be support now and it is, that's why if we put a trendline on it there is a possibility of a bounce in that area.I hope the knowledge I shared with you will help anyone who wants to have an idea of conducting trading activity here in crypto or Bitcoin. And I want you to understand that this is not a perfect strategy because it also fails, so the pullback we expect will not happen, it will lead to a reversal. So our mindset should still be prepared to lose in a trade no matter what strategy we use, the only difference is how we manage it.",

Thank you very much again.On the time that these formations had been shown then you do already have the idea on what are the positions that you would really be taking which neither buy or selling position if ever you are doing futures.Im not really that a fan when it comes to precision of technicals but since we dont really have that choice because not all the time this market does have news or fundamentals and this is why people would be mainly be needing to learn technicals. Price reversals should really be something that we do really need to get  to enter because we would really be able to maximize that profitability if ever the price goes on what we do expect. The only issue or things that you should really be that in concern or would really be doubtful is on the time that breakouts do happen. You would really be thinking that what if the price would be able to break out and you did make that buy or sell position? For sure it would be a total negative.  Not all the time that TA would really be that precise but at least you do know on what you are doing in terms of analysis rather than on making yourself that making some price entry guess withouthaving any basis.",

This is one of the painful parts here, the trading discussion section still needs merit source, if not sources. I hope @theymos could pay attention to this and understand the reason for having more merit sources (those who truly understand the value trading) here to encourage people to post meaningful trading articles and that can bring about exciting competition. This will also develop others and themselves to earn.Online learning has helped me to be a stable earner through trading, but without much merit for people's work here, they won't be often encouraged to share the value they know.As for the subject, you've done well, the market could move towards the trend, retrace, reverse or without a direct (sideways/range). In any of those conditions, what will guide any trader are mainly the price action, trend strategy and the support/resistance strategy used. Also in addition to the trendline strategy mentioned, one could also add the Fibonacci tool and Elliot Wave theory, which are particularly important during the wavy, retracement and indecisive markets like sideways and range.",

Actually, right here in the trendline that you showed Op, anyone can learn a technique, even a newbie, about making a profit in Bitcoin or crypto trading.
