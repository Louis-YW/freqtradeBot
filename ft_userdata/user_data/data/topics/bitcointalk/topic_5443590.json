I wouldn't particularly care if it did come from the US gov. They also brought us SELinux (NSA), Tor (US Navy) and some other free and open source projects you can inspect their code and verify it doesn't have backdoors or what not. It really doesn't matter who made it if it benefits you or me in the end, you and i decide, not them.Use it or not, your choice.",

But if I may ask, you just said that if we don't have evidence that we are not allowed to disagree on this thread. So my question now is, where are your evidence to prove that US government is actually Satoshi? Or wallet addresses to prove that U.S government has 15 million BTC just as you claim?QuoteThat mean BTC is fully centralized by US Government, but no one know it Because 15M BTC are in complatly different wallet.Point of correction, Bitcoin is fully decentralized, because nobody has control over it, not even Central banks nor the US government QuoteUS Government Always control the market and BTC price, they use Mass payment system so they can transfer any amount of BTC automaticly from all 15M wallet easily.That's not true, because the only currency the US government has control over is the U.S dollar which is a stable currency by which the value of Bitcoin is been pegged to it. That's why the value of Bitcoin is always given in U.S dollar",

That's why the value of Bitcoin is always given in U.S dollarThat is not how a pegging works. And the USD isn't stable, unless the slide down is a form of stableness...It is given in USD as a manner of convenience. In Europe it is given in EUR, that is not a pegging. And because its a free market, you can often see the price in USD and the price in EUR does not match when converting one coin to the other. The local economies also affect it.A pegging is when they declare x equals y. Its what the so called \"stable\" tokens do, which is basically going against the market forces usually by promising to keep a fund equivalent to...There was a time that Argentina decreed that 1 peso was 1 dollar. That's a pegging. You can check that history to see how well it ended...",
