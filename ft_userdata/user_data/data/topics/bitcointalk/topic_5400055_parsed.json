  "content": "We all need each other to grow ,we all need each to attain greater height ,from newbies to the top stage rank ,Encourage each other,nobody prays to remain stagnant even to top rank,we one way or the other needed opportunities to become whatever stage we have attained,we wouldn't have been happy if we contribute alot and yet it seems invain after putting much effort towards it.When posting i expect encouragement and objection not discouragement. Givers never lack when we feel the need to encourage , share merits if you see reasons too, comment, object and disagree with a post or statement, we should feel free but doing it in an appropriate way,not using words like fuck ,shit ,bitch,nonsense post or passing all forms of insults to one another, do not discourage others for intending to be kind for what does not please you might pleases others .i come across this kind of comment in this forum ,it a forum for discussion not an avenue for us to show our non challant attitude ,if everyone decide to behave in such manner, it wont be nice the aims of the forum will not be acheived ,learn not to hurt others feeling, we have different up bringings .We have different understanding and read meaning to words differently ,dealing with each other should be done with ultmost respect. If you are in an office settings, you will learn how to caution yourself .why not practice and instill it .commment ,objecting is allowed but shouldnt warrant any form of insult, i try to disagree with conversations in a good manner and make the person see reasons why by pointing out the reasons and form of correction .I almost felt like giving up here at the start due to criticism, i was able to overlook and see the positive side and kind hearted people in here with their beautiful contents creation and i believe i have alot to learn here. Let love lead ,some of you are mentors to people here , one way or the other but you might not know ,do not make them feel disappointed. I know i will soon be criticised for this post ,kindly feel free comment and object.Thanks with love from here",

I saw your post history more on politics and on this board (I'm glad, not more on bounty participation), would you sometimes explore on the technical discussion board or Bitcoin discussion board, we've many discussions to be explored.  Never mind first the merit, it will come without knowing you if you have a good post, just continue to contribute and keep yourself encouraging and interact with those topics that you have the knowledge to share. Quote from: Israelgogo on May 24, 2022, 08:09:38 PMI almost felt like giving up here at the start due to criticism,.Maybe be a part of those thick-skinned gang members, here in the forum they have gangs that you can idolize.  Just stay with what you are and maybe the encouragement that you have will give you a reward soon and be a high rank or an established member.  See you around!",

Sometime this way could be more effective to motivate others. Its not just about merits, some users are posting nonsense that need to be address by noticing it in a hard way. Of course consideration is being there, especially if we youll review the account posting.

I can feel what youre saying cause Ive been also undegone some negative criticism but thats fine. Cause if you arent then your proving them right. Accept if the tutn out of discussion or arguement loses on your side, thats totally fine. Its just mean that they are right and you are wrong which nothing to be ashamed of.Quote from: Israelgogo on May 24, 2022, 08:09:38 PMI know i will soon be criticised for this post ,kindly feel free comment and object.Thanks with love from here Just accept it. Sometime the outside looks of their response is just a sarcasm to mask the hurt words you shouldnt be reading. Anyway, just my 2 cents dont harder yourself and make it looks like your in it.",

You said givers never lack, some people are not here for giving purpose, infact it is a rule that there is no kind of begging here, including vegging for merits.It is not also compulsory for people to comment on posts, agree or disagree. No one is under compulsion to do anything in this forum.Further more, people did not come to this forum to learn characters, while some will be kind and polite, others might not. Afterall they don't care how you threat them. I believe we are all here to learn about bitcoin, so in as much as you are seeing here as a family where you advice of morality, others are seeing here as just a bitcoin discussion forum.We do not need to have saints here, all we need to have are helpers in things concerning bitcoin.",

Congratulations.Truth is, if you are here looking out for respect from other members, you will be highly disappointed and discouraged, if you are hoping for members to reply nicely to your posts even when they disagree with your point of view, then you are on a long thing.It will do you alot of good if you learn to man up and don't let anything on this forum get under your skin, and even when you make a nice post and no body appreciates it, learn to look the other way and move on to the next, this is how to survive here.",

Just read the name of the forum, or should the forum be renamed to \"rules of conduct\"?It happens quite a lot; a sort of rehashing of posted content in the hopes of getting merits. We see it with introductory posts being made wey often especially when one seems to be working (by working I mean getting merits). This makes is extremely difficult to decide which member is being genuine with their posts or inquiries.What I usually do, if I find myself in such a dilemma is to go through the user's post and find out if the user has other useful content on their history and merit those. It might not seem as much, but avoiding meriting a spammer who needs that to rank up and join bounties feels good.",
