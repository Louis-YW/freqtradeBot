  "content": "Bitcoin: A Trojan Horse for CBDCsLynette Zang, Founder & CEO of Zang Enterprises thinks Bitcoin is the Trojan Horse and said that it wasn't a coincidence that it came out in January of 2009 when QE started in March. And because of the timing of when it came out which was after the 2008 financial crisis, she suspects the NSA has something to do with this.their conversation led Michelle Makori to be neutral in her view but would like to present a panel to debate with Zang about this. here's one question that pops up in their discussion. do you agree with what Zang is saying that because Bitcoin was brought into the traditional system through ETFs mean Bitcoin is not outside the system?",

NSA did it for what?Honestly if the USA. had problems with their economics, why did NSA need to step in and create Bitcoin in 2009?I don't find any logic here and why NSA had to do this. I believe that Bitcoin is a natural improvement in cryptography developments and before Bitcoin, there were some other digital currencies but they did not get success like Bitcoin.Satoshi Nakamoto tried to code and build up Bitcoin, and decided to launch it at the right time, global financial crisis in 2008.Bitcoin Prehistory.",
