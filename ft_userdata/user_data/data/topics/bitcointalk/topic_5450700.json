I do not want to move the topic back to beginners and help because moderator moved it to off-topic. It is about bitcoin users that are using google 2FA app. If you update to this recent update, your 2FA will synchronized with google cloud and your 2FA codes are no more offline.We can see how many bitcoin users and other crypto users have lost their money through Google Cloud and  iCloud, what is online is not secure like offline.This is about letting other people that do not want online 2FA to know.I will lock the old topic. If this topic is moved to off-topic again, I have nothing else to do. I hope you have all seen it.",

I doubt about it.Example is Electrum wallet which provides 2FA feature but it is from Trustedcoin, not from Google. Electrum 2FA.QuoteElectrum offers two-factor authenticated wallets, with a remote server acting to co-sign transactions, adding another level of security in the event of your computer being compromised.The remote server in question is a service offered by TrustedCoin. Here is a guide on how it works.2FA will cost you more fee for Trusted Coin which is unnecessary in my opinion. You can use either cold wallet or multi-sig wallet with Electrum without additional fee to a third party provider like Trustedcoin.",

Also that on every site or wallet like Electrum, before you can use the OTP, the secret code would first be generated and you can do the manual backup.Quote from: BTCGalaxyA12 on April 30, 2023, 07:05:40 PMIf in case someone uses Electrum as a Bitcoin wallet on android and chooses the address Wallet with two-factor authentication, then he installs Electrum windows Portable version on the computer by choosing to enter the seed that was obtained when making it on android and entering the google authenticator code, say someone that's me. Can it have a negative effect on me like this case?Let me tell you the negative effect. Do you have chrome on your Android phone? Click on the dots at the upper right corner and click on settings. You will see password manager. Assuming you have your 2FA on another device because you think it is safe like that. Some people that are using online accounts like custodial wallet, exchanges or anything that has to do with 2FA like Electrum 2FA wallet can be affected because what is called two factor authenticator is no more two factor authenticator if it is linked to the email on the phone. By just downloadimg the app on the device and use the email with it, you will see the OTPs generating. Some people can be very careless and synchronize their username, password and 2FA. What else do hackers need to hack successfully? Nothing. Those three are enough to steal from people.Do not save your username, password and 2FA codes on Google cloud, it is very dangerous.",

If you use the same seed to import your two wallets: with 2FA and without 2FA, you will have a same wallet. Only the 2FA wallet will require 2FA code to sign your transaction. However, you won't lose your coins if you lose 2FA backup code or that device is broken, as said you can get a same wallet by importing from seed, without 2FA.QuoteCan it have a negative effect on me like this case?Nothing negatively, except that you will have to pay additional fee by using 2FA provided by Trustedcoin.Why do you need Trustedcoin with paid fee when you can have your multi-sign wallet without such fee?",

By having access to his 2FA codes, these people by proxy now have access to one set of private keys for his multi-sig wallet.I agree with your suggestion about why he needs TrustedCoin at all, though. In my opinion, if you want the safety of a 2FA wallet, then it is cheaper and more secure to run your own multi-sig rather than rely on a third party. But if he wants to keep using a 2FA wallet, then he should create a new one where the 2FA comes from an open source app which doesn't send his shared secrets across the internet to other people's computers for storage.",

It is a 2-of-3 multi-sig wallet, where a third party known as TrustedCoin holds one of your private keys, your wallet contains one private key, and the third is recoverable from your seed phrase back up. When you want to make a transaction, you enter your 2FA code which TrustedCoin use to confirm you are the real owner of the wallet before co-signing your transaction.A better solution as I explained above is to just set up your own multi-sig wallet and not rely on a third party at all.",
