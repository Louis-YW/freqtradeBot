If you take the average of the weekly invested amount, you may invest at $17000 in average which is better than investing all at $20000.Well, this was about trading, not investing.I think that in trading the DCA works in a way like:* you buy at 20k and set 22k as selling target* if it falls to 19k then buy more* if it falls to 18k then buy even more* if it falls to 17k then buy even more, if you still have funds* if it grows you sit and wait until the 22k target is met (or, if you've bought at 17k or 15k you can decrease the target too, according to the prices and amounts you've bought at so you get some profit)I am not sure 100% though if I've got it right.",

In trading, it should not take beyond some weeks before selling. But while investing, it can take some months. Very possible the strategies can be used for both trading or investment, I think duration of time is what that matters to consider it either trading or investment.",

From 20000$ how to DCA?Isn't it obvious?  From the word Dollar Cost Averaging, you have to buy every time the price goes down.  That is the meaning of cost averaging.  And it depends on your preference for how you will spread your fund.  If you want to DCA every $1000 difference then you just do it.  If you think you have enough funds for every $100 dip then do it.  After all it all depends on how much your fund is and what is your preferred price to cost average.Quote from: hd49728 on October 28, 2022, 12:16:14 PMDCA is more related to your capital management and less related to price increase or decrease.DCA depends mainly on the price adjustment.  What is the meaning of cost averaging if you don't take advantage of the price dip?  It is a mere accumulation if it is not related to price changes.Quote from: hd49728 on October 28, 2022, 12:16:14 PMYou can do Dollar Cost Averaging weekly, monthly, quarterly, each six months and how often you do it will depend on your plan to allocate capital for DCA.It in turn depends on your source of income.

From 20000$ how to DCA?If you understand the rationale behind DCA, this question wouldn't have come from you! There is one simple rule for DCA - buy at every dip. Since no one knowns how much a dip can go, it's always good to buy small amount at every dip constantly over a period of time. That's how you can do DCA and hold for medium to long term for significant profit. No other technical things to remember here! It's that simple!",

So from $20000 to $15000, you have a target price to buy bitcoins but unfortunately, we don't know if the price will drop to $15000.Most people buy bitcoins but not based on calculations and just randomly. But maybe you're better off using the DCA strategy for every month.Example:This month you buy as much as $ 200. The next month buys as much as $ 200 and so on until 5 months or even 1 year later.Actually, this depends on the strategy you want to use because it also relates to your readiness to know when to buy bitcoin.

From 20000$ how to DCA?I think at 19k you can put 50% of your remaining capital into the market. And the remaining 50% you should put in the market at around 15k. Market might go even below this point but honestly that would be very temporary and has a very slim chance that would happen. Investing in these two chunks itself would be enough and will give you a dca of around 17k which is good enough in my opinion.",

DCA because it wants to continue to get Bitcoin at the average price bought.",

And the investor basically divides his money to build his portfolio so that it is diversified and also gives him the opportunity to take advantage of market downturns without risking too much capital.and if you target a maximum amount of 15k and the highest price of 20k you have to make periodic purchases at a price of 19k, 18k and so on. But I don't think the bitcoin price will reach 15k, and I suggest you should make DCA purchases without setting a maximum price during this downturn and for the long term to get satisfactory returns.",
