Right now with the emerging live poker players like the emersive experience a lot as well, they are key areas where a gambler focuses on during the pandemic, which again makes it a much sought after game.

But poker isn't so appreciated from every casino because it is really hard to manage poker room, check players, ecc. and have in change only the rake, that's why they prefer classic casino game.From my understanding, poker is a game of skill, though it still require some level of luck to win, but focusing on the skill part, i think this could be one of the reasons why it seems like not very many people pay attention to poker mostly in online casinos, i myself for example gamble most times, but ive never looked the poker way because i dont have any knowledge or the skill required to stand a chance of winning, and i believe it could be this same story for several others out there. And to what the OP said which i quote below-QuoteWe have seen so many types of GameFi, but none of them is focused on the game which means it is not entertained. I think poker is a good start point to enter the gamefi area in the future.There is no way online casinos will focus on a game not too many people pay attention to or know hoe to play, running a casino is like someone doing a business, the product which your customers demand for more is the product you buy more of so you dont run out of it, casinos pay more attention to games their customers and potential customers want to spend their money on playing, maybe if more people begin to find playing online poker more interesting than the other classic games, then casinos will begin giving poker a much more attention.@Op, Another reminder to quote the source of your post, for the safety of your account as everyone else have said.",

In fact, I find it hard to believe such a statement.OP doesn't specify what study he refers to and where such data comes from. According to the article linked by yahoo, there are approximately 120 million online poker players worldwide. That is actually ten times less than the 1.3 billion mentioned by the OP, and that is a much more realistic figure in my opinion.",

There should be a way of earning through the game or boosting their earning through leveling their account or if there is a character that has a stage progress through playing by other users. So how does this work on Poker? Axie infinity considering gamefi game which I think they have also a game that well-entertaioned players.",
