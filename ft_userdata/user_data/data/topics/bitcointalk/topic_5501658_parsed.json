Bitcoin transaction fee with using its ATM is high and many will rather consider the comfort from their mobile device than using the ATM machine for making a transaction.2. We can also consider the adoption and regulations over bitcoin and crypto at large by some countries as one of the major determining factors hindering the demand for the use of bitcoin ATM as some may require government approval before installation and do on, but only for countries like El-Salvador and others where Bitcoin is being supported by the government may have increasing demands on the use of bitcoin ATM.",

Source  Source Speaking of adoption then this is something that would really be that increasing as years passing by specially now that we are heading into the bull run then it would be understandable on why there would really be those numbers increasing on which this isnt really just that limited on ATM's alone but also in other aspect as well. People who do have that experienced those other cycles or run in the past on which hype is really that on the rooftop or lets say that euphoria is on then everything would really be that looking increasing. This is why its not really that shocking that everything would really be that looking positive.Also, if these ATM's are increasing in number then its a good news for us specially to those who do make use of those machines on buying up coins.Somehow, if we do speak about into those fees which these ATM's are really that having then i would really be rather preferring on using up on p2p on exchanges.",

According to some reports as of two years ago about 87-89% of Bitcoin ATMs were located in the US. So you can agree with me that other countries are gradually occupying some chunk of the market. The adoption might not be fast but there is a significant change. Check Check",

Some countries in the EU have a significant number of such devices, while some others have only a few, which only shows that the interest in such a way of selling/buying cryptocurrencies is quite different.Even more fascinating to me is the fact (coinatmradar) that crypto ATMs exist (for now) in only 70 countries in the world, which is approximately 30% of all countries in the world.",

More people see Bitcoin ATMs, more people will be curious what it is, some of them will start learning about Bitcoin and part of them will become Bitcoin investors, traders, speculators or maximalists.Bitcoin ATMs have big disadvantage in fee that is expensive and it can be barrier for Bitcoin ATM usage. More stricter regulations from government can force Bitcoin ATM operators to uninstall their ATMs.Bitcoin ATM feeQuoteCustomers are charged a service fee for using a Bitcoin ATM. This fee is typically charged as a percentage of the transaction rather than a fixed dollar value. Bitcoin ATMs can be very high, and the exchange rates offered may not be as competitive as could be found elsewhere. For example, Bitcoin ATM operator CoinFlip charges between 4.99% and 21.90% of your total transaction amount, compared to paying between $0.49 for a Bitcoin purchase of $1 to $4.99 and 1.5% on a purchase of $1,000 or more using Paypal.",

An ATM is supposed to be used to get cash, which means that if you are using a Bitcoin ATM, you are converting your Bitcoin into your local currency, the fees might be high for that but it serves the purpose for people who might not want to go through the longer process of first using a P2P service to get money and then using a traditional ATM to get their money.Quote from: Doan9269 on July 01, 2024, 07:00:40 PM2.

And, as far as I know, for a service to install a Bitcoin ATM in a country, the country doesn't specifically have to have Bitcoin as a legal tender, if it's not illegal or banned and is regulated, it can be done.",
