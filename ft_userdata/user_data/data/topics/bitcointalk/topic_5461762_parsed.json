The RTP determine how much are returned to the player.. based on how the games are configured.",

      "body": "In my opinion, not really. Games of keno, limbo, dice, etc., are gambling games based on luck. So if you're risking some percentage or just using a small bet, it won't matter. And in this case, your luck comes when you use bigger betting money than before. But maybe some friends can check the calculations because there must be someone very experienced in this matter.I haven't played craps in a while, so I don't know how it's progressing. I used only to bet small amounts and never raise my stakes because I was too afraid to lose a lot of money.",

For me, there are times my first wager will come out good. The luck comes at anytime. But if that is what you are doing to gamble and you are making profit, you can continue the strategy, but do not depend on it because betting is just luck and it comes at anytime. As for me, later watering is what I am very conscious about, for emotion not to build up to make me to be making wrong decisions.",

Do you know how it works and what is the calculation behind it?, do server sends outcomes by checking our wager?No it is not like that.I have played Plinko a lot of times and 90% are missed hits or they give a very low amount while only in 10% of my bets I have hit x470 and x1000 which is the best possible option.The wagering means nothing,maybe I have seen the same pattern in the Stake originals more precisely on Tome of Life slot as there after a certain buy bonuses gone wrong usually gives a couple with great multipliers,not the best but x270 to x700.So the wagering for me has nothing to do in all the games,maybe in some specific ones but also I am not sure about this.",

Do you know how it works and what is the calculation behind it?, do server sends outcomes by checking our wager?There can't be any correlation between two different bets it could be your first bet wasn't lucky enough to give you a win. Also the percentage you use in wagering is something of concern too as the amount matters in a way that for instance if it's in sports betting you don't  have to accumulate much games which does increase your risk reducing your chances of winning. But with a high percentage wager the risk are very low as you may not have to accumulate much predictions to get a big potential win.AFAIK, the amount of money I risk in a bet is part of my strategies as it determines  my predictions and the number of games I accumulate and place a wager on.",

Do you know how it works and what is the calculation behind it?, do server sends outcomes by checking our wager?I have been really active in mines and the rest you mentioned and I can assure you that there's no math behind it. Sometimes you can just log into your account and place several bets and you'll only have just one win out of all of them, the main factor there is the percentage of your winning probability of you're betting on low odds you'll have so many wins but as soon as you increase the odds you'll experience so many losses but if you're lucky enough you might ave some decent amount of wins but relating your lose to win ratio to the number of bets you have placed is totally wrong and just have others have said it's merely a coincidence.",

This is related to a phenomenon known as the \"gambler's fallacy.\" Predicting the future based on the past is a cognitive bias.If you're betting instead of hitting, you should start winning. The more you bet, the more you think you'll win. Actually, the opposite is true. Each individual occurrence in a game of dice, keno, or limbo stands on its own. No matter how much you've won or lost in the past, your odds of winning are always the same. The results arent being manipulated by the server to favor your bet.You're probably just perceiving patterns where there are none, or your brain is playing tricks on you, if you've recently started to have a run of \"luck\" after placing bets. Gambling is ultimately based on chance and randomness rather than any discernible patterns or historical precedents.",

But playing more doesn’t increase your chance of winning since every bet results is independent. For a better overview, imagine you are betting 100 bets on a 10% win chance rate, The chance of hitting win is higher if you will bet more often since you more chance to try done betting with few counts.",

Do you know how it works and what is the calculation behind it?, do server sends outcomes by checking our wager?From my personal experience, the amount you wager have absolutely nothing to do with your chances of winning, atleast i know this from a very close friend of mine who on his first day playing a slot game, that some one helped him create the account, and taught him how to deposit and withdraw, later on, i think he said he deposited $50, and since he wasn't too sure about betting on sports, he decided to play a slot game for a start, after the whole setting up the bet amount which he set at $5 per spin, just on clicking the spin button for the very first time, he got a bonus which made him win around $78 , though he got so excited and later lost everything including his initial deposit, but that goes on to prove that the amount you have wagered have nothing to do with your chances of winning a game, this also applies casino original games as well.",

What you experience in a short period of time does not mean it will happen consistently. It's essential to be realistic and stick with the principle behind the house edge. All provably fair games have a house edge, and regardless of the percentage of the house edge, it still favors the casino in the long run. As gamblers, the more we gamble, the more our chances of winning will reduce, especially if we aim to earn consistently, as that would only lead us to gamble more.",
