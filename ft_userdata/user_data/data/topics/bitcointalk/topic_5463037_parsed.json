Let's say your tx has 10 block confirmations, it means that 9 blocks have been mined on top of the block that your mined tx was included in.",

In other words you can think of the \"number\" of confirmation as the \"depth\" of that transaction into the blockchain or the distance the block containing that transaction has from the tip.",

Nodes validate transactions and store transactions, blocks in their nodes.Each block on the blockchain is like a layer of soil, one above another. If your transaction is confirm by block #100,000, later blocks will be added on top of the #100,000 block and will increase security of your transaction, make it more irreversible.How many Bitcoin confirmations is enough?",

However, the number of confirmations does not represent the number of nodes that have verified the transaction, but the number of successive blocks that have been added to the blockchain. The first Bitcoin transaction didn't have more confirmations because there was nothing previous to connect to, but over time and as successive blocks were added, it accumulated more confirmations.",

When the next block is confirmed (mined), all transactions in the previous block will have one more confirmation, and so on. This is where the name \"Blockchain\" comes from, which literally means a series of blocks linked to each other.",

Bitcoin journey do full of such questions which we should ask other wise one day you will become a senior member and afraid to ask them (i am not talking about any other senior member). hehe. But still, asking question sometimes work as the reminder to remind you the knowledge which is getting corrosion somewhere in your mind.",
