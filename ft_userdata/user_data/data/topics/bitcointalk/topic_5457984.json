Bitcoin is a currency and a payment method that can only be used if you already own it or received if someone else owns it and sends to you. Same people may be lacking any fiat at hand, does not mean they will magically have bitcoin at hand. On the other hand, it does make sending the money easier, which I agree.Of course if you are a Nigerian price trying to scam using bitcoin, then its a different question - devilishly, you will get rich from tricking people. But that does not solve a poverty problem.Fiat will exist as long as people exist because the entire economic system is hardwired to it. Crypto is till now an alternative, maybe in future new things will come in play and the use of both will get balanced.",

Because it is decentralized. Because bitcoin is decentralized, that does not mean it can reduce poverty because those that invest in bitcoin invested money.

Fundamentally,  you were right in your explanation on Bitcoin peer-to-peer payment which does not need exchanges,  but for Bitcoin to reach that stage of global adoption, it will greatly take time.",

Poverty is due to the increasing number of population that result to less work for every person on specific country. Bitcoin can't solve or reduce poverty since it's a currency and it can't generate steady source of income because it's value is derived from traders speculation and not with continuos supply of liquidity from money printer like fiat.Bitcoin can help someone out of poverty if he has money to invest but still it's not guarantee success rate.",

The number of opportunities created by bitcoin as an employment is not that much and is limited to only tech oriented people. The only way to earn is by investing and this can be done by some with money not just poor people",

Actually I do not understand the whole of your writing. But I would assume the goals you say are like someone who has a strong hold on bitcoin over the long term (Hodler).Regarding the decentralization presented by bitcoin, it is indeed the main attraction for me personally. Even before, I didn't really think about the knowledge of the financial system that adopted a centralized system. So at that time I felt fine holding fiat and keeping a lot of it in the bank. But after I learned about bitcoin and about how we need a system that is not centralized that makes us have freedom and full control of every asset we own. And the presence of bitcoin has become the answer for everyone who wants the freedom to be in full control of the assets they own.And in essence Bitcoin has indeed brought awareness to all those who study bitcoin about the importance of privacy and the importance of transparency in transactions and also the importance of having full control over the assets we have.",

I doubt that you have read and understood the concept of bitcoin in the way you have presented it.Bitcoin is the opposite of fiat. Bitcoin was born decentralized to fight centralized fiat hegemony. Talking about bitcoin then talking about money. Bitcoin is an investment asset, and you need money to buy bitcoins. There may be a way to get bitcoins for free, by following your signature project but it's not from bitcoin vision. So maybe you better understand bitcoin as a whole before you relate it to eradicating poverty, because I don't think there is any correlation at all.",

Maybe Bitcoin can change the life of someone who buys it, holds it for a while, and sells it when the price increases. It will reduce poverty because that person can benefit from investing in Bitcoin.If, in your country, the government has accepted Bitcoin, you can use it for various purposes because surely many local shops will use it too. This makes Bitcoin even more popular and will be adopted by many people. And if that person can set up a shop and accept Bitcoin as a means of payment, he can benefit from selling his Bitcoin to fiat especially when the price goes up.I think there is still a lot of hidden Bitcoin potential that we don't know yet. For now, we should use it as an investment or trade and make more profit.

I meant to say, why many are in poverty and some are rich, some will say they are making more efforts and they are hardworking and they take risks so that's why they are millionaires and billionaires but the poor also, do the same but why they aren't rich?The reason is they have become a slave to a centralized system where governments and institutes want to control them in their favor (to fill their own pockets), But BTC had provided the poor a way to escape from the matrix and many have already been escaped and those centralized authorities didn't like it and that's why they are attacking the Decentralization system of BTC has provided by introducing the tokenized BTC ETFs. (I am not trying to create some kind of fud or fear just stating the fact I have in mind). The point is, when those centralized authorities will have more BTC under their control then they might control this decentralized system by making a collusion. Which will be terrifying for the poors and rich too. So, till that happens, BTC has a lot of potential and it will keep growing until there are poor in the society and rich too. Because both are using it in their ways to save their money. And in that usage, BTC is getting more adoption.",

Even if bitcoin doesn't volatility and becomes stable, I don't believe governments will accept it as a currency because bitcoin is decentralized. If they accept bitcoin, the government will lose control over its people. Do you think they will let that happen?",
