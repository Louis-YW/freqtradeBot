So there is no method that we can suggest to you, using the same method does not always give the same outcome for every trader.You have to combine several trading guides besides mastering some technical analysis, it can be like risk management and emotions.",

Don't trade without having the background knowledge of how to start one, let bitcoin be your first digital currency you could start with and try give your time in learning about trading before you start any, trading is as simple as when you understand the way it's een done, this will avoid you from running under loss while trading.2. Try as much as possible to learn the trading patterns and make sure you have a good time with learning them, also know how to read the weekly candles and study the chart along as well, make sure you don't make use of trading bit because they are not hundred percent effective but you can rely on your chart indicators for that.Here are additional information you may need to learn about bitcoin trading.new to trading?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5446799.msg61999785#msg61999785Lastly try to move your thread to trading discussion board.",

I wouldn't give any channel so it's up to you on what will be results by entering these keywords that you've already mentioned.But if you're up for reading materials, aside from the ones that were being said. You can see a lot of them made by exchanges just like what's mentioned by bitmax that's being done by binance.

There are no such people known to the public. Warren Buffet got rich from investing, but his method is based on analyzing businesses and markets. This is not applicable to Bitcoin and crypto. If you tried to do it, you'd reach the same conclusion as Buffet - that crypto is useless. Most of the people who got rich through crypto are just those who held for a long time and enjoyed the recent rides.",

I think you want to learn from a series, like, one by one in which crypto terminologies are interconnected and could teach you how to trade in a sequenced way. Well, from this, i think you want a series, and here is one made by Hamza2424 and he is still working on it:New to Trading - Tips and Suggestions (V1) Getting StartedHe almost wrote 4 to 5 topics on trading so that newbies could understand the most used terminologies easily. And still, if you want to get a general overview of things that could help you to understand which types of things are necessary and which are not. Then you should give a glance at these threads:Beginners Should Follow These To Be A Good Price PredictorWhat are the steps in understanding technical analysis?--> You need to read the full thread just in case, the OP made some mistake and the correction will be in replies by other members then.",

I already made post that my target price will be 200 Weekly Moving Average which was somewhere at $21.5k.

Those who are good at looking at charts already know where the market will move without depending on negative news and the sentiment that is born towards BTC.Well, for those who are not yet proficient, I think this is enough to help you in reading the market, but the theory that you have learned and have read is also juxtaposed to make it even more accurate  If the reading this picture may be reversed if the Tweezer-top arrow means the price will go up and the Tweezer-bottom is marked a decline.So, that's the basic formula I think, so, you willbe know when you enter and when to leave market, But, these are signs for short-term players. Just my assumptions. but you can see either now or later when you trde. If anyone adds, they are welcome so that those who have recently become better and educated in BTC trading later.",
