As long as you're sure that you don't have a gambling problem, then there's no reason why you can't have a bit of fun with it. If your gambling is causing financial problems, then it might be time to take a step back and reevaluate your relationship with the casino. That's why it's important to have fun and enjoy yourself in the process instead of trying to win big.",

But when everything settles down, and I have a capital in my hand and totally rejuvenated, then I will go back again.Quote from: Saisher on October 30, 2022, 09:55:19 PMYou can anytime you wantDo you have the power to do it anytime that you want.Of course, it's all in our mind, maybe if you have enough push within you, might quit for good.Quote from: Saisher on October 30, 2022, 09:55:19 PMYou have to when you're wife tells you toI know a lot of guys who quit gambling for good after their wives tell them to, do you know of someone, or at one time you are one of them.Let's discuss this and thank you for participating.What if your wife is also a gambling?   it could be a very difficult situation for you and for her to stop gambling for good.",

Since gambling is one of the actovities that we always do, it will be quite hard to break it even if we use one of the mentioned triggers to stop playing because we think that it's okay to still play one last game.I'd probably stop if I can spend weekends on an entirely different activity that will make me engaged and hooked at all times.",

Instead of quitting, you might actually get hooked to gambling. If you are a first timer, then that is a good hook. If you are an old-time gambler, it is just additional fund to gamble more. Winning a big amount is not a good deterrent to gambling. Quote from: Saisher on October 30, 2022, 09:55:19 PMYou can when you lose a huge amount This is the most popular reason to quit have you done this only to come backThis is possible unless you are an addicted gambler. NO number of losses can deter you from gambling. Instead of quitting, you will find more money to fund your gambling addiction. That is how addicts bankrupt their resources. But I think not so many are like this. I for sure, if accrued a very large lost will stop gambling. At least for a while.Quote from: Saisher on October 30, 2022, 09:55:19 PMYou can anytime you wantDo you have the power to do it anytime that you want.This is a case-to-case basis. It depends on the person if he has the will to quit gambling. Others do not have the will to control their habits or addiction. You are lucky if you are one of the people who have the will to control their gambling habits or quit it totally.Quote from: Saisher on October 30, 2022, 09:55:19 PMYou have to when you're wife tells you toI know a lot of guys who quit gambling for good after their wives tell them to, do you know of someone, or at one time you are one of them.Let's discuss this and thank you for participating.This could help #3 especially if the wife is very supportive of you. But if she is just going to nag you about gambling, I think the result will be the opposite. Many men hate to be nagged by their wives, but some are willing to change because of their wives when properly approached, supported and guided.",

That's the reality for most gamblers. The eagerness to recover that amount will just be fueled more because the loss amount is really big.To quit gambling, there's no other way but to become dedicated to doing so.",

What might his purpose be?Perhaps it's it's deal his got with stake.com to keep the gambling going or maybe he just having fun while trying out his luck.Winning huge is hardly any reason. It might be a reason for a day to end the session and try again tomorrow, same with loses but to quit gambling, I doubt that. Most huge wins are seen as lxuky money, extra cash and so, you just want to use it as you want. What better way would that be than to try and win more.

Best thing to do is diversion of activity. Find something that would consume your time and eventually it would replace the hours you are spending in gambling activities. Make friends as well who are not into betting because if you will be still surrounded by people who are into it, you'll surely have a hard time to get over it.Losing a huge amount, to some people, is enough to give up on something but there are people who will get more drive from such instance or to simply play more.
