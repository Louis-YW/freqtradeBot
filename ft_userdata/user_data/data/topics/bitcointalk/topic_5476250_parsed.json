Are you talking about passphrase?Because Bitcoin core does not have a function to import seed phrases and maybe the old paper phrase you have is from other wallets?Would you mind to check the old paper phrase if it contains a 12-word phrase?You can import it to Electrum or any wallet that supports the seed phrase and recover your old wallet.",

I have never used it nor do I know how it works without looking it up on the Internet, but Armory used to have its own unique backup solution I believe. They called it root keys. Not only that, but there were different versions of these keys, adding more complexity to the backup process.nc50lc talks about root keys, a chaincode, and a SecurePrint for Armory in this post:Quote from: nc50lc on August 23, 2021, 09:23:50 AMYou wont be able to restore it to the oldest version because it requires a \"Chaincode\" alongside the \"Root Key\" and \"SecurePrintâ„¢ Code\".Specifically old versions lower than v0.90; You can only restore your backup to Armory versions that support 'backup version 1.35c'.I think that's what HCP meant by the long \"sooooo\". Because what you said and what you have didn't matched.Try remember the Chaincode which is another two lines similar to the root key, then you can try to restore it to the oldest version.OP seems to have disappeared after creating this thread. He either figured out what to do himself or gave up.",

I downloaded Electrum.And followed the steps to access via a seed phrase. However, something strange happened, which perhaps you can shed light on.i opened standard wallet> i already have a seed>entered seedI wrote my phrase, however....i only got to 4 words plus the first letter of my 5th word.. for example:the quick brown fox jthen the next button appeared ready to gain access to the wallet. is came up \"standard\" wallet.so i hit next etc and i opened a wallet.What is strange is that i only entered 5ish words.there is no funds in the account, and i dont know of this is my account.i tried the 2 factor authentication way as it was suggested this may find funds and it said the seed phrase is real, however you cant access via the 2 factor way.so my thoughts are:did i create a new wallet?or is this someones walletis this my wallet.when i search the wallet on an explorer there is no funds in it, but i would like to know if i have accessed a old wallet or if i have accidently created a new one.werid it was only a few words too.thanks so much",

Or anything that could help recover your wallet?I suggest read the post provided by pooya87 above to know any kinds of wallet backup and format and use them to find your wallet backup on the same machine.",

This means that of the 212 possibilities for the first 12 bits of the hash of the seed phrase, 18 of these possibilities are valid (24 + 1 + 1). This is a chance of 0.44%, or around 1 in 228. You can literally type any word and then just hold down the last key in the seed phrase box. Watch closely and you'll see the \"Seed Type:\" dialog pop up every so often when the hash happens to match what I've described above. (Obviously no one should ever use this method to actually generate a wallet!)Out of curiosity I worked out the average BIP39 word has 5.4 characters and so the average 12 word seed phrase has 65 characters, meaning that a little less than 1 in every 4 Electrum seed phrases on average will create another valid seed phrase while being entered.",
