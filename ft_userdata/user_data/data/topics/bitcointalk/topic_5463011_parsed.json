The time frame that gives you more profit fits your personality in trade.Personality in Trade I say this carefully, you can be a scalper, intra-day, swing, or position traday.Just to be brief on Timing;A Scalper eyes is usually on 1mins and 5minsAn Intra-day eyes is usually on a day to an hour. Spotting opportunities.A swing personality looks for weekly and daily chart for opportunity.Position trading as the name implies takes longer timeframes.Note: There are little variation to this which depends on few factors.Always take note of the time you enter the market it will also give you insight to live with profit or loss when necessarily.Feel free to contribute as there are many more things to learn.",

Trading- Is buying and selling.Note: Timing is everything to trading.Don't time the market and think that you can do it well to get profit with trading. It is more risky if you are bad with capital management and has habit like using all capital for trading. One or two lost trades will eat your initial capital very considerable.QuoteFirst of all, You need to know which time frame works best for you.The time frame that gives you more profit fits your personality in trade.Each time you enter the market, you will have different best time frames to use. It depends on market and what you see (chace and risk) at the moment, so you will see potential best time frames, best waiting time to close your positions.Like when a market is side way a long time and seems to have a big movement, it is terrible if you use a long time frame because you will stuck with the market.Long or short time frame, you must always be clear about your entry, profit taking and cut loss prices as it is how you manage risk and avoid or minimize loss from your position. It is important in trading whatever time frame you are using.",

For example, if you are a long-term trader, times such as a day or two will not constitute a change in the price. the scale on the weekly pattern or several weeks is what governs your trading strategy.in daily trading trading patterns is less than 24 hours, and therefore allocating it to hours or minutes will be the best, and then your profits will be limited to less than 5%, or whenever you achieve profits, even by 1%, you can close the deal, as the trading strategy here is to achieve several simple profits, but open several Intraday deals, which is the opposite of long term trading.In general, trading is a mixture of several things. the simple knowledge of all of them is what makes you make a profit and not focus on one type of trading.",

Also, before one is able to consistently make more profit on  trades, they must also have been good traders. A professional trader, who maybe is a scalper, usually works with his trading strategies by regularly using his trading tool to analyse the market and know the right time to enter the market, how long the trend can go, when they will make profit, and when they must exit the market. All of that works well for a trader who has worked on their trading skills first before they can even be very moderate with timing. Also, despite how professional one is with timing and trading, they cannot still make a profit all the time.",

However, if you want to start profiting as soon as you entered the market then you need to also look at 1minute but most swingers don't usually see it as needful.QuoteA swing personality looks for weekly and daily chart for opportunity.Position trading as the name implies takes longer timeframes.Don't you consider these two as the same?

It would really be varying though because it would really be that basing on your own analysis and approach on things because you are  the ones would really be finding out whether it would really be that relevant or not. This is why it is really that important that you should really know on when to get in and when to get out because if you cant really be able to distinguish about in between time frames then you would really be that having a hard time whether you should get in or not. It is really all according into your own learning and experience in overall on which you are the ones who would really be able to find out.",

To time (timing) the market and to know what timeframe (time). Whether in FX trading, Cryptos, Stocks, Indices and all that, any trader who doesn't respect those two concepts in addition to the control of their emotions won't succeed at trading.I like to swing trade and that makes me consider higher time-frames to check for trend, either for the day or on the long run before making any trades. Then I pick my trades from lower TFs. Waiting for candle close of whatever TF one picks for entry is very important. It's bad practice to trigger a trade in a haste without waiting for the candle close, no matter how enticing you think the entry has presented itself.",
