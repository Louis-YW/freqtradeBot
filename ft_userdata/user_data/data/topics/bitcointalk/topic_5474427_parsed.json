The best approach that I have thought of is to use not more than your gambling budget but in a way that all can be lost as long as you can afford to lose it. But after winning, it is good to just quite for the day and not have the fun again.I also agree when you prolong your session you are also \"adding\" more chances of a big win as with the lowest amount of bet you will have much more spins than if you used a heavy bet that would make that 200 disappear in an instant and that is something usually only addicted persons do,normal gamblers will not lose money fast,this shows that you are in control when you play with the lowest bet and not the addiction.When you own a casino like that old wise man said you sure will make money but let me tell you that the fun part is totally out of the way,you can never feel that feeling of hitting the max win,only real gamblers will feel that and as such I prefer to have a fun night with that 200 dollars by playing as long as possible.",

Win a million dollars? You will go home empty handed. The next thing that rings in your ear is you can still win another or more, that's the devil whipsering, the art of gambling is knowing when to stop. Not exactly, it all depends because that time you are winning may be your lucky session and to maximize it may be a good decision. If in the process of playing then you start dwindling in winning or profit then you can run of with the remaining balance.I think the point is, as much as we put a budget to how much we want to stake and play for the time we are there, it is not also bad to set a target to how much we are targeting to win since the luck is \"shining \" on us but we must ensure that we leave as soon as we get to that target because by then all our luck may keep favouring up until that that and who knows the house edge may take over afterwards. So to leave at a targeted profit when we are winning is still good a decision.We should also build confidence to maximize profit afterall we lose so much on a bad day, why not win so much on a good day until you can run if the loses start to come. Going on to double our gambling budget, we can also maintain the ride to tripple it if there is real possibility for that.",

I realized that it happened everytime I tried to continue gambling after 3 wins and In that way, I learned that it's better to stand up and get out once you win up to 3 or more times because you'll know what will going to happen if you decided to bet again all the money that you have.",

I hope that if they have exhausted all the money in their wallet in the sense that there is no luck at all then obviously the best thing to do is to force themselves to get out of the casino and go home in tears, don't even think about looking for alternatives to increase the contents of your wallet such as borrowing, because anyone will never know when they will win, so with that alone we should be able to think logically about what should be done in such conditions. In that condition your greed and patience will be tested, yes it is very likely that you will immediately return there with new enthusiasm even though there is basically no guarantee of anything. There is no other way but for you to be more assertive in your self-control and boundaries and basically only you can do it, others will not care about you.",

When I reached just x3 of profits that's when I got mad that I wanted to bring it back to x5 one more time. But it doesn't work like that, there's a chance you will lose more and that chance is high enough that it will really happen in just a day or worse, an hour or two. And then when my profit went to x2 I got so angry and I started betting without even thinking about what was happening. Greed can cloud our minds and so does chasing all those profits that we received at the start of our gambling. Casino games mostly give profits at an early stage but when you keep on going they will take everything, and I mean everything including your capital.",
