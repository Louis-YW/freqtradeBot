Sorry if this sound like a stupid question but I want to if 4GB cards will be able to work on the new ETHW and the other, please enlighten me if I'm wrong. The size of the DAG file will depend on the decision of the developers and the vote of the community, as it happens with the Conflux coinhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410204.0It will probably be beneficial for the developer to have more video cards able to mine their forks, but it’s better to ask about it in the community of new coins.",
