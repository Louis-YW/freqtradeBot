  "content": "See this as a question.This business account company is new, make more research about it yourself.On Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swwipe.appIt is a business accountYou do not have to register the account name with your name, you can use any name that you likeFor another bank to transfer cash to which is your bank, Opay, Kuda and Palmpay are not listedOnly commerical banks like First bank, GTbank that are listedSaid it is licensed by the Centralized Bank of Nigeria (CBN)The last time I tried Chipper cash and other means bitcoin and other crypto P2P users can accept naira payment, I always see my name displayed if I want to send to myself. But with Swwipe, it is only the name that you used that will be displayed, not your real name.I noticed on Nigeria local board that we do not like P2P. This might be because of privacy. Is this app worth using?You can read more about it yourself. It is created for business and it has more features than what I have explained about it. Is it worth it? It is new so I will only advise people to try it with small amount of money. What do you think?",

It will be good anyway but then one have to do more research about the company.  If it happens that they are actually approved by CBN, then Bitcoin penetration in Nigeria is about to take a new shift and that is a wonderful news for us.",

What do you think?Thanks for this new update bro, i will do personal research to know more about this new app because most of the exchange app always demand for BVN for registration which is my fear for any new app that is asking for BVN before the process will be successful because, we all no that anybody can use your BVN to gain access to your money at anytime without your permission. Since you have advise us to try it with small amount of money, if the registration is successful and the app is good to our taste before thinking of how to save some huge amount of money for future use. I believe this app will be more secure than OPay, kuda, and palmpay because, many people has loss a lot of money to all those new online app that made people to prefer banks than online banking because if you have seriou issues you can run to the bank for their customercare to solve it for you instantly.",

The business account is not about bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies, it is basically about naira and naira only. What I am only implying is that if you want to send naira to someone using the business account, if the person did not use his real name or official business name, the name the person used as the business name will only be seen, not the person's real name. Crypto users may like it because of that, they may want to do transaction with the buyer not knowing their real name.Quote from: Zanab247 on September 16, 2023, 05:16:56 PMThanks for this new update bro, i will do personal research to know more about this new app because most of the exchange app always demand for BVN for registration which is my fear for any new app that is asking for BVN before the process will be successful because, we all no that anybody can use your BVN to gain access to your money at anytime without your permission.That means you can not use it because it will demand for BVN. Only just that you do not have to use your real name and your business name can be anything you call it which people will only see.Quote from: Zanab247 on September 16, 2023, 05:16:56 PMI believe this app will be more secure than OPay, kuda, and palmpay because, many people has loss a lot of money to all those new online app that made people to prefer banks than online banking because if you have seriou issues you can run to the bank for their customercare to solve it for you instantly.I do not think we should see it as secure as Opay, Palmpay or Kuda because it is not also a commerical bank, it is just a payment account. I will still say that Opay and the likes are better for now because it is just still new.",

I withdrew ₦5000 immediately and it was also almost instant transaction when I received it on the commercial bank account that I used. Only BVN is required.Please, if you will have to test this business account payment, use just the amount that you can afford to lose for it. They are new and they have to stay for awhile before we can begin to trust them more even as they are registered with CBN.",

Sometimes, I no dey like make di person wey I dey transact with no no my real name but e no dey possible with Opay, Kuda, Moniepoint, so Swwipe go come very handy if dem fit support something like dat. Afta you don receive di money you fit push am go any of your oda account, but as your advice na to dey look am with one eye until dem register with CBN.",

What do you think?We appreciate you sharing your moment with us. With This new updates, it mighty be helpful for those who consistently conduct transactions always. But in my opinion, it would be beneficial if they could learn more about it and how it functions because not all apps are reliable in the Nigeria of today. If more people thoughts wisely like mine and followed my advice, I think it would be beneficial.",

Non of the reviewers gave a positive response on their part. Though CBN approved the service to be running in the country but those wey dey use am nai go tell the legit or genuineness of the app and the first users never say good about am. But to some extent dem dey keep customers privacy well and that is one of the good part of their service.",
