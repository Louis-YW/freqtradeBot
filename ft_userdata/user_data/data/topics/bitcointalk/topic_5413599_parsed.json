Women in fact, are not only coming on board as investors, but also as creators and builders.Cryptocurrency may be a 21st century financial innovation. However, it has a very 20th century problem - not enough women. A phenomenon that’s been observed not just in India, but across the world - and hopefully not for too long more.
