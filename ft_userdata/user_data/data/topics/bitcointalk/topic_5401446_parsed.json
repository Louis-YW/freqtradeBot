  "content": "Decentralized control of cryptocurrencies.The existing monetary financial system of the USA has strict control allowing to regulate the issue and creates rules for centralized financial regulation. One way or another, all countries of the world build their financial policies on the same principle, focusing on the $ USD exchange rate because the world does not yet know another better system. With the advent of BTC and other crypto currencies, there was a similar issue of control, but there was a problem, how and who will exercise control? All the developers, focusing on the dollar in various ways and options, decided to invent a square wheel (cryptocurrency Fiat) in the end, a dollar called centralized stablecoins USDC, USDT and BUSD and supposedly decentralized stablecoins (UST, DAI, FRAX, FEI, OHM) turned out again. The example of LUNA showed the inconsistency of such ideas. An attempt to link centralized finances with decentralized ones leads to what Satoshi Nakomota refused by inventing BTC. Satoshi's idea is to create decentralized finance, which should and will exist in parallel and complement each other by transforming.What do you think? Is it necessary or possible to control a decentralized cryptocurrency or not.",

Is it necessary or possible to control a decentralized cryptocurrency or not.Depending on who you ask, if I were the director of the central bank then my answer would be \"mandatory\". This question has long been answered by the fact how governments want to control as much as possible, and prohibition is the ultimate judgment of their inability.The right question is not about necessary or not (globally) as it is an option individually. If you still enjoy the facilities of a centralized financial system, it shouldn't be a problem even if you are controlled and bitcoin is not for you.",

This isn't long lasting, they were able to do this to some extent. Those are days when the market is infant, whenever there happens a crash the whales make some disturbance and the same crashes the market even further. I remember those days when there is crash, we can see a series of negative news on hacks, stolen funds etc that are intentionally circulated to create panic waves.",

If I am to put myself in the shoes of the central bank governor or the finance minister or even the president or perhaps even the CIA or FBI director, this lack of control is a big problem and should be solved. This decentralized currency will either be controlled or stopped. But coming from somebody who is fed up with all these controls, it is best to just let it operate as an alternative currency. But the more interesting question is, could it be controlled or stopped? But leave out the rest, we'll only talk about Bitcoin.",

But leave out the rest, we'll only talk about Bitcoin. base on my personal experience and view about bitcoin, i can say it cannot be controlled neither can it be stopped, and i will like to buttress some point for the two answers, it cannot be controlled because Satoshi Nakamoto has made every necessary plan in place before the launch of bitcoin to make it fully independent beyond the control of anyone, that privacy and freedom in financial economy we all find it difficult to cope with make him implement the digital currency fully decentralized and that's why as you've mentioned that it's a choice to use or adopt bitcoin, secondly it can't be stopped because they have tried many attempts to ban what is not under their regulatory system such as bitcoin but it can't be stopped because of the anonymity in the system as well, that's why after the ban on banks to stop any crypto transaction and close users account responsible for such couldn't as well solve their problem because banks were ban p2p cannot be banned.",

A monopolist controls bitcoin through Fiat, emptying your wallets, stuffing his own and try to get out of this control, it is unlikely that you will succeed. The crypto market in this sense completely repeats the currency market.
