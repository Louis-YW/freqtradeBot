  "content": "LIVE Christmas Gambling Stream with DiceBot and Free Script! Another year has already gone by and we're doing another Christmas LIVE stream! The stream is of me gambling on a website using a bot and script. Here's the stream link: https://odysee.com/@cryptogambling:0/livecryptogamblingscripts:1Here's a direct link to the free script used in the stream,https://pastebin.com/5MsSgYDXMy basic strat when using this script:Keep the balance about the same, slowing ramping up, depositing profits to vault. (we started with 1, now ramped up to balance of 2)When bust, change seeds and take out, 1.5x the last starting balance you had from vault. Continue until you are in the green again and then deposit profits again, to the vault. Let me know if you have any questions. Cheers and good luck!Johnny",

Why not post the whole information in here as for many people to understand what this really id. Honestly, I really don't understand what you are really trying to do. What I think is that you are just sharing your stream about using scripts that are free or you are giving scripts for free and providing the link of the steam for people to see the settings of the script.",

That's why I don't believe such thing will make you rich. It is all about making your bet automatic base on what you set it to. Reputation is also important if you are going to share a scripts that you yourself make.Quote from: shasan on December 24, 2022, 07:57:08 PMThe script is free to base on the op as well as the title.

At first, I was thinking about that where this thread is a spam after all but decided not to say it instead I ask what's this thread supposed to mean like is it about the script that being used, is it the gambling site where op gamble or both the script and gambling site plus referral link in the site where op stream. I guess you are right that there's a value compared to others without value. Merry Christmas and Advance Happy New Year. Enjoy the holiday.",

Based on that, we know if OP playing around 85%-90% winning chance as the total losses & winning is about 1 : 9, which mean, OP betting can be busted when he got few streak losses, am i right?
