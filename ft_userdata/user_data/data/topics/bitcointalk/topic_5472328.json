Isn't it a much better option to try to invest your money in different things and in that way reduce the risk of losing everything in the event that Bitcoin fails to do what you want - or in case you happen to be hacked in the future?The world is always in chaos, it's just that now we are exposed to this information far more than before and it seems that it is much worse than it actually is. If something really bad happens, then money and Bitcoin will lose all value, and everything will come down to what you have to trade in order to get food and water and everything you can't survive without.",

In my country, you cannot access your retirement funds unless you retire or leave the organization. However, the answer to this question will depend on some factors. The currency of your country is an important factor to consider. If you live in a country that experiences high inflation and steady depreciation of the value of the currency, it might be okay to take the risk. I know some retirees who ended up in poverty because the value of their retirement benefits has depreciated over time. You also need to consider what you have as a backup. Do you have a house or other sources of income? Do you have young dependents? Don't forget that it is your retirement benefit. You don't have to put all your eggs in one basket because anything could happen. Yes investing heavily in Bitcoin is not a bad idea but there is a need to still be cautious. It will be better to diversify your retirement funds into different sectors but you can give Bitcoin a high percentage.",

You call it obligatory, yet it seems it is accessible even while you are still in service. If that is the case, I will go with the option of diverting it to Bitcoin. Keeping money in fiat will never be my preferred choice, seeing what inflation has done to our local currency. On the other hand, the potential in Bitcoin is amazing, and it even provides a form of hedge against inflation. With Bitcoin ETF and halving on the pipeline, there is no doubt that we will see a decent rise in the price of Bitcoin. I'm also involved in a mandatory retirement contribution, but ours is not accessible until after retirement or four months after quitting the job. Should I have the option of chaneling this funds to something else, I will be all in in Bitcoin.  However,  don't take my words for it, follow what you are convinced is the best decision.",

The Bitcoin ETF projects would be a nice time to invest for old timers especially who understand how it works and want to take advantage and invest in a good DCA strategy. I don't think I could allow my retirement funds be DCAd for now until the halving is over even as it remains the best practice overlooking that timeline. No FOMO or emotional investment would make me do such because the company couldn't care less about the best investment strategy for me. It's better my retirement funds are left intact and then I DCA or invest of my own earnings till retirement.",

In some countries they won't even let you withdraw the money before you retire, and in others, such as the USA, you will pay between the penalty for withdrawing before and the tax of around 50%. Leave the classic options such as index funds in retirement and save on your own to buy bitcoin.",

The one time I had a 401k there were specific things we could choose from, its not like we had the entire stock/bond market to choose from.So it'll likely be some time before 401k's actually start adding BTC ETFs to their approved list, and even then it'll only be some that do this.But for anyone who at some point in the future is able to invest in a BTC ETF through a 401k I don't see why you wouldn't do that, at least with some of your 401k money. Probably by the time people can start accessing it through 401k's Bitcoin will be much. more mature and no longer grow at a super fast rate, so by then it might just be one of several things you use the 401k for, instead of putting all your 401k money into it.Whenever BTC ETFs start being approved, whether it is next year or 5 years from now, it won't be retirement accounts that fill it up but your typical traditional investor, investment firm, corporations, and the like, as buying an ETF will be easier for most of them than actually owning Bitcoin. I would guess once an ETF is available that's when we'll see more institutional investment into bitcoin specifically, from investment firms and corporations because they are only interested in using Bitcoin as an asset and not as money so for them actually owning Bitcoin isn't important and adds complexity. For the \"bitcoin is an investment-only\" crowd an ETF is gonna be huge - lots of Bitcoin is going to be taken up by ETFs thanks to them. But it'll likely be awhile before people start getting access to Bitcoin through something as controlled and limited as a 401k account.",

This question has been asked before a few times, but in this question, you asked something unique, which is that your company allows self-directed investments and an option to save funds in BTC has been available for you, and you are skeptical about it because you doubt if it is a good step to cover all of the savings of a retiree in one asset, which is a great hedge against inflation (BTC).I mean, BTC is better than the US or any other fiat currency, but volatility is still there, but in the long run of 2 decades, I will say go for BTC, and that would be a good choice because over the period of 20 years, your savings in fiat will become less as time passes and its value will be eaten away due to inflation, but if you consider BTC, then it will be saved plus more value will be added. And 20 years is a long time.Plus, you are getting the features of 401(k) in it. But I think this scenario of yours is imaginative because I don't think other than a country that has totally accepted BTC and its decentralization will take this step.",

Because what they do is like betting, they are actually betting on the future price, whilst the true believers  of Bitcoin are already invested in deep for years.Of course buying/investing now is much less profitable than 30 days ago, and 30 days from now it will become much less profitable than now.If you don't trust and believe in Bitcoin, it's best if you don't engage with it, you might suddenly loose 50% of your portfolio and dump everything to save at least the other half, just to realize in a matter of few weeks, that you made a big mistake.",
