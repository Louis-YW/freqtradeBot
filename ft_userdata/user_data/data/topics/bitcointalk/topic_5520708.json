We should wait for the final adoption of this law.Secondly, with the growth of the cost of bitcoin, some countries suddenly began to change their attitude towards bitcoin. I assume that this is due to the desire of governments to additionally tax the huge profits of crypto investors and certainly not for the favorable existence of investors.And thirdly, there is nothing to say about CBDC, because it doesn't bode well for ordinary citizens due to the digital slavery that will arise with CBDC.",

Many North African countries and entire African countries have not taken any bold steps since the global hype and influence of US President Donald Trump. While we are waiting for it to be legalized more awareness should be created in other African countries because Bitcoin can help change the economy. Honestly, their government may not be technically inclined toward Bitcoin this may be one thing that would make them feel that there is a great risk in legalizing Bitcoin. Aside from that they should care more about the advantages than the disadvantages. Since they will benefit more from the process. No technology does not have its Pros and Cons.

There is an 80% possibility that they will legalize it from my research. We should be positive about it. Anyway, am no Moroccan.",

Just has Donald Trump wasn't friendly with Bitcoin on his first time as president he is friendly with Bitcoin now so it's all Good. I think we are filling to see that Morocco is an Islamic country and they may have had some religious sentiments to over come before legalising Bitcoin or Crypto-currency in general.What ever the case may be I believe it's time countries start to see that Bitcoin does them more good than harm. Legalising it doesn't mean the ban of their traditional Fiat system but giving an opportunity to a fast, effective, transparent form of financial transactions and services.",

      "body": "Quote from: Text on November 26, 2024, 03:59:06 PMIt's interesting to see how Morocco is shifting its stance on cryptocurrencies after such a strong ban in 2017. The global trend toward embracing digital currencies is unstoppable, with many countries reconsidering their policies. Even in places where crypto is technically illegal, people have found ways to trade and use it under the radar, which speaks volumes about its demand and utility. The move to legalize cryptocurrencies, along with the exploration of a CBDC, is a positive step for financial inclusion.Once I saw the likes of China actually looking to relaxing their rules against bitcoin I was convinced most countries will follow suit. We might have been thinking what took them long but we all know what they want which is the centralization that was there to dear to them, many of this countries restricted it because of not only because they cannot control it but because of their religion stands and I think as they go on to see its use case and find out that it is basically just money with much better use case than fiat they have started leaning towards it. I think should the USA relaxes some of their restrictions, other countries too will have a look at it too. The governments have now accessed CBDC and might hand seen that it’s no where near what bitcoin portrays",

There isn't a single word on Bitcoin, and no mention of legalizing \"all cryptocurrencies\", as Cointelegraph article puts it. So, to me, it looks like biased reporting by Cointelegraph, misrepresenting information while citing a reputable source (Reuters). I don't know what Morocco will or will not do, but it's too early to be excited. Sometimes countries go for a CBDC, but not for lifting restrictions on Bitcoin, after all.",

The good thing is that they've realized how unfortunate they've been with some of these unrealistic decision that was not well thought out that they took.

The Moroccan government deserves credit for acknowledging its previous stance may have been misguided. While Bitcoin is not yet legal in Morocco, I’m confident an official announcement recognizing its legality is coming soon. I just hope the forthcoming regulations will be of  benefits to both Moroccan Bitcoin enthusiasts and the government",
