  "content": "Hello.I wanted to share a personal story and I would like your opinion about it. Back when I was a teenager, I joined this game called Habbo Hotel, it was the typical game aiming for the social interaction of young people while pushing their users to spend real money to buy subscriptions and furniture for one's room within the hotel. However, I soon realized within this game there is a strong capitalistic system, where people partake in trading of items for profit, speculation, \"jobs\", scams and gambling. When I joined there was this item called \"Dice\", it was not worth much. it was a furniture which was rolled and revealed a number from one to six. It was worth about 6 credits on the game, I had one.As time passed, people in this game started to create actual casinos using these dices, teens and young adults would play 21, placing bets up to hundreds of dollars in rare items (these items have actual value and are sold even for USDT in a type of p2p unofficial market).Source: Google ImagesUnfortunately, I quit the game before taking advantage of the increase of value of my stuff there, otherwise I could have sold them for a good profit.A young family member of mine some years ago developed a bit of an addiction to gambling on this game, screaming of emotion in the morning and at night when he managed to beat his foe at 21 by rolling the last dice, pocketing some money and I recall a day he was specially sad because he lost 50 Euros in furniture the previous night. Fortunately he moved on.There are items in the game which are worth thousands of Euros, btw. So, there you go next, time you see your children playing on a computer they could be gambling without you noticing.  Have you heard about this before? Thoughts on this?",

      "body": "Yes, I once played a game about pirate captains on a smartphone and it had a built-in dice game.  Gambling is part of real life.  Therefore, they are an integral part of computer games.  If a young man decides to become a professional computer game player, then perhaps he will get rich by selling virtual items.  This is a real social lift for a teenager.  However, the main danger in this case is the formation of gambling addiction, due to the large amount of time spent in virtual reality.",
