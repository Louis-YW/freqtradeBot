Many people had regrets especially those who did not invest time go study what they are doing here, on ever decline with the market price.So if you do not feel to invest yet, feel free to do so.

I know you are curious and just need affirmation or more like a go ahead, before you invest in Bitcoin. While that is good, you should remember that volatility in the market is what makes one loose or gain during trades. Bitcoin has proven to be more stable when comparing its volatility degree to other coins out there, hence why more persons rely on it.",

There's no way a government body that will regulate it when it's decentralized and its value cannot be controlled by any authority. What the regulator bodies can do is to monitor those companies that manages and allows the trades and transactions of it like what we're seeing with exchanges.Those people that are scared of bitcoin's volatility are likely scared of any investment that bears risk. All investments are bearing risk even to the tiniest that it can.Quote from: Victorybit1 on February 26, 2023, 09:11:36 PMMy question is this, is it possible for bitcoin to be completely immune to volatility in years to come?I've read someone said it that it's possible but it's unknown whether we still live by that time.

If you play it right you can buy low & sell high. It seems simple to say but it really is but only if you have balls of steel & a high time preference. You are going to need to be patient to guarantee a great ROI but if you can buy & wait 10 years or so, seeing bitcoin as a long term investment then you will do very well.

You should embrace the volatility and beat it with strong will-power to hold your coins through it. Time has proven that this strategy rewards those who successfully undertake it. Put your coins in a cold wallet, forget about them, check in 4 years or more. This unbeaten strategy might not be as effective in the near future, so enjoy it while it lasts.",

If they should be a regulatory body then that's going to defeat the whole idea behind Bitcoin, Bitcoin was created to be decentralized and not to be under the control of any agency ( both government and private body). And for the volatility part, the answer is no. And if you still continue to wait you'll only end up not doing anything at all. The volatility of Bitcoin is what makes it more interesting. If you're truly scared then why not try to be a long term HODLer? If you have some spare cash you can just purchase some coin and keep till the price becomes good enough for you.",
