      "body": "Ukraine will never have freedom until the government and military of Ukraine stop persecuting and killing Ukrainians who are in favor of Russia. You want freedom? Stop taking it away from those among you who want freedom to interact with Russia in fair trade and friendship.At this stage of Ukrainian leaders' stupidity, it will be almost impossible to do this. The best chance you have is to stop taking orders from the US and Nato, and expel them from Ukraine instead.",

      "body": "You are not from Ukraine.  You accept the information that is presented to you, come here and count those people from Ukraine who are supporters of the Russian Federation, but the condition is that weapons should not be directed at them, look at the city of Mariupol, why rejoice there?  There people praise Russia for the fact that they bombed the city and sleep in winter without windows in the house, you are the one who speaks for such freedom for Ukrainians.  Do you want to live like this yourself?",
