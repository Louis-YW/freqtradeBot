It's not the current exchange called BitMax because my transaction is from 2012 so predates it's existence.Do you have social media where you talked about your bitcoin shenanigans? I am now overly curious and invested what Bitmax is if not the trading platform. The trading platform was launched around 2018 so of course it must be ruled out.I don’t see much information about it. If ever it was something relevant back then then we would have some information about it now even if it is dead but the fact that there is none then that tells you one thing.",

Should anyone who bought anything for BTC sometime in the past feel bad about it? Of course not, because BTC is a cryptocurrency, and this was shown by the example of buying those famous pizzas that would be worth millions today - but instead of regretting it, the same man celebrates every year with a new pizza.Story lesson -> do not only hold, life is too short",

This transaction has long been completed (irreversible) and bitcoin can't be returned back, regardless of whether it was spent wisely or on some rubbish. It's in the past.

All bitcoins you spent in the past or lost can't be returned back, no matter how much it costs now. Think not about what was lost, but about new opportunities (ways to get BTC).",

They were pretty successful because many people were less informed and knowledgeable about bitcoin. And they used the their psychological tricks and emotional manipulation to have their way. They were the ones who gave bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a bad rep in the public.

It's honestly hard for me to understand what you want to say - because how did the OP \"grow from the experience and make something out of it\" if he only now found out that he financed some kind of scam 10 years ago? Honestly, I didn't learn anything from what I already knew from before, which is not to invest in anything that is too good to be true, or that smells like a scam.Quote from: m2017 on April 19, 2024, 02:52:55 PMOP wants to celebrate every year in the same way, but not pizza day, but “what did I spend those bitcoin on then?” ~snip~I have nothing against it, everyone can have their own little celebrations from time to time - or remember bad investments from the past. Not that I don't have some bad moments from my past, but I learned a long time ago that there's no point in crying over spilled milk while cows walk past me waiting for me to milk them (not literally of course).",

I’m glad I knew here when I started my crypto journey, maybe I would have had a lot of stories to tell in just few years I’ve been into the crypto space. The truth is when you start your journey into something new, you’ll make mistakes and where you don’t have a mentor to correct you, you’ll lose big before you’ll realize your mistakes.

It was like starting on a fresh slate and learning as you go along with nothing but expectations from this asset you have recognized with potential.Even simple exchanges which people can do now within seconds used to take whole lot more than that.It sucks to make mistakes that looks to cost us more as the asset continues to rise but for the user to only be scrutinizing a 100BTC transaction now after 10+ years, I will say they still made a lot out of it.- Jay -",
