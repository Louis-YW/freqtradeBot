On how strong the buy is, you can check the buy orders at some trading platforms and from there, try to make a conclusion on what's going on.If you are in that situation where you are still confused about what to do, you need to have the guts to decide to buy at the current price.It's regrettable to see the price is climbing up again and you will be left with the concern, \"if only I buy at the lower price\".",

I think it exists because some people who have known about how Bitcoin has moved in the past will definitely take advantage of the opportunity at this time to buy more Bitcoin before Bitcoin is at a higher price or at a price that they might find difficult to reach with their limited money.",

The price holds for a long time in this range actually so there is a chance that this could be the bottom. The weekly chart shows it's at the bottom.

Because everyone has different thoughts on this matter and obviously not everyone basically has the same thoughts as what you think at the moment about buying cheaply.I did think it was weird how quickly a lot of orders move on crypto exchanges now, especially a few weeks ago when I was looking at them - it seems a lot faster than your standard bear market in my experience. The volume looks pretty optimistic and for the price to have been sustained here for so long like someone said, there's a decent number of buyers optimistic about bitcoin in the short term (we were at a pivotal price point a few days ago and bitcoin seems to have started going higher since - for now).",

No idea how much but we will retest the yearly low most likely.This is due to the fact that bond yields have risen alot in the past 2 days and the stock market looks like its about to retest the yearly low also. Since they are closely correlated so will most crypto assets. It will be like this until the next CPI report most likely. Or maybe if the unemployment numbers are weak.",

If small purchases do not fall into the category you are referring to, do Bitcoin purchases such as those made by MicroStrategy fall into the category of purchases you are referring to? because they just bought 301 Bitcoins in addition as Michael Saylor said.Quote from: Michael SaylorMicroStrategy has purchased an additional 301 bitcoins for ~$6.0 million at an average price of ~$19,851 per #bitcoin.

I do DCA and I think that times like this are good to buy because we should be close to the bottom. The $20k has proven to be a strong support, because when we have gone below that mark we have not been slow to go back up.  Although I would not rule out that as the situation stands, with the Fed's policies that have severely affected the stock market (although bitcoin remains around $20k) and that will cause unemployment and deepen the recession; the price of bitcoin will fall below $17k.If that happens, I'm going to do some extra buying.",

If it has not bottomed for the year at the low of June at $17625.00 yet, it would only do a little by pressing lower the level as buyers are piling up at the bottom and lower prices from it. In a nutshell, it will not be harmful to begin buying Bitcoin at the current level as the risk to its holders is minimal.",

Once bitcoin price drops below 50% or 70% it will be a good time to start shopping and no one buys a large amount of bitcoins at once they will always implement the DCA strategy. There are still some people who wait to buy in bulk once, because they are confident in their analysis, but this is not a wise strategy because the market is very unpredictable. You see even big whales buy using DCA strategy, as MicroStrategy recently announced to buy more bitcoin at $19.8k, shows that no one dares to assert anything in this market.",

It’s advisable to DCA now if you plan to accumulate on this bear market because the price might pump again above 20K on the end of the month because that will the closing of monthly candle while we are still red right now. Closing the monthly candle on above middle part is always happening at the end of the month to fill the gap for the next month candle.I think we can only see lower lows on Bitcoin price next month and not on the last week of the month because there’s no source of bad news that can drive the price down again like inflation.",
