While the overall crypto market sentiment is somehow dictated by Bitcoin's movements, there will be cases of selected altcoins that would somehow move in a different direction. This must be due to the specific altcoin's activities. There might be a new significant project update, a product release or development, a new partnership sealed, a big investor, and other reasons. And this is definitely not the first time that it happened. But generalizing that the specific altcoin has generally outperformed Bitcoin is definitely wrong.",

During the first week of April 2022, some altcoins- Ether, Sol, Luna, Avax, Near  outperformed Bitcoin. So this is definitely not the first time this is happening. Although I believe that this is due to sentiments and it's only temporary, Bitcoin will continue to rule over them. Over the last decade Bitcoin has been the only cryptocurrency that has been consistent in moving upwards despite market volatility and speculation. So many altcoins that seemed to \"outperform\" Bitcoin have disappeared. In the long Bitcoin always prevails.",

But it doesn't matter though, I mean those altcoins being mentioned as price so cheap that it's obvious that anyone can buy a ton of it as opposed to buying bitcoin at this price (even if it's going down). So for me this numbers doesn't have any weight though, good for those altcoins but they will have a hard time sustaining that run in the long end.",

In other words, these coins' temporary independence from Bitcoin should not be taken as a big deal. On the contrary, it should be taken with utmost caution. If those isolated movements made you richer in terms of Bitcoin, it is better to grab the opportunity to make conversions to Bitcoin, because sooner rather than later they would eventually align themselves with Bitcoin. The crypto market history has taught us that sticking with Bitcoin is actually more profitable than sticking with altcoins.",

Obviously not, but saying altcoins are outperforming btc is putting them all under same umbrella. There are tons of them. Most of them underperform at least in bear market. But as BTC has highest marketcap it's not as volatile as lower marketcap coins. They have more room to grow and need less money to pump them. Or dump them.",

You are only comparing a very short period of time, we know that altcoins can outperform bitcoin and when that happens in a general way then we call that an altcoin season, so this is nothing new for anyone that has been on this market for a long time, however it is unrealistic to think this is going to become the new trend of the market, bitcoin is by far the best coin we have and it has outperformed any coin if we take into account its initial price and we compare it to the current price.",

From time to time, altcoins experience short-term gains which are higher than Bitcoin or top altcoins experience during those days. The difference is the risk and stability. Bitcoin can have periods when it's going down, yes, and periods when it's in stagnation. However, long-term, it always recovers and goes even higher than before. There's only one Bitcoin currency, and a handful of top altcoins. As for those alts that can high short-term, there are hundreds of options, literally, and it's very hard to predict which will go up and when. So the short-term gains are high, but often seen in retrospect.",

Significant bear market started last week Friday, you can check the price of bitcoin and compare it to the price of altcoins and see how bearish altcoins are, as cryptocurrencies prices were falling, bitcoin falled from $40000 to $30000, you can see coins like Luna falling from $87 to $14. Altcoins are many and they do rise than bitcoin on bull market, but if you are invest and make profit, better to convert the altcoin you invested on to bitcoin because they fall more than bitcoin in bear market time. Just also that some altcoins are shitcoins, someone can invest on shitcoin, thinking the price will rise but instead, the price fall ans the person lose.",
