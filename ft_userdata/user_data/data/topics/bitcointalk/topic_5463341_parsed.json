And if I should bring out a list of them they are gonna be more than hundreds of them so, I don’t really like the idea of singling one or two out of them when they all helped me the same way.",

I prefer to keep it hidden and I think everyone should keep it a secret because it reveals that making someone happy and someone unhappy is not desirable for smart thinking people. So keep it secret and just follow him",
