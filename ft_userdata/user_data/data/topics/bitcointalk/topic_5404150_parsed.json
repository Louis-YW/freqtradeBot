The little miners get NOTHING and go away.Strength is in the group, there is no solo space.It is as if you are sitting on a large bag with a huge amountGold bars and he could not buy anything and exchange for them.Together, we can do a lot.Together, in harmony and understanding, we can create a better tomorrow.It's like growing peppercorns - any pepper.Take care, look after, water - take care and your harvest will be great.For those who understandBest regards and have a nice day.https://discord.gg/BKa83HUjc7",

      "body": "PeppersCore....... EPPE.The road Map has been completedThe goals we have set will be realized.Route to the selected last stopIt is very far away.......Let's face it, there are so many coins today.And finding the one you want takes a lot of work.Lots of research and some luck......Some ..HISTORY.We tested many coins, many possibilitiesVarious combinations of POW and POS, POW. Much to write ..The first for testing, The EPPE coinWas created two months ago............ PeppersCore - POW only... ZERO premine - ZERO bonus!.Many people know that I love hot peppers.He suggested the name, a good programmer came up with it.If he ever allows, she will write his name.Today ,here THANK you Buddy......In the first stages, more than 10 coins were createdVarious variants, but our best opinion isPOW only, although everyone likes % - ownership.Well, we stayed with the original.Working coin names have always been associated with sharpnesswith something special.I*t had to be a spicy name From hell .Once the coin was finished. Main programmerHe breathed a sigh of relief and called the last coin working................ FRANKENSTEIN - Just live.!.He got up, raised his hands and said: ..........Here it is - EPPE !.Really great moments of joy and expectations have been leftSomething special was created - PeppersCore......And I will repeat myself for sure.Thank you good friend.A good person and a good programmer.If he ever allows it, she will write his name too.(There are rules and you mustn't break them - there must be permission!).....From the very beginning, a decision was made not to advertisetoo much EPPE.The surfeit of advertising can be disastrous.You have to slowly dose the information and build / implement itPlan.Plan, Plan and many temptations from the start.Do not stray from the course.You cannot turn - the road is one and the destination is chosen......... PeppersCoreThe goal is the most important - Praising Sharp Red, Green, YellowEVERY super-strong pepper/paprika......The tests were positive.The coin started to be mined by miners is fine.We spent a wallet on windows.Others appear at the right time.Our next plans.I try to reach people who participate in the competitionHot pepper eater - I've always liked this competition.This thrill, this taste, this emotion.Try to eat and you will understand what the thing is.Burning in a person, tears, joy ... it cannot be toldYou just have to experience it......One of the goals is to make a coin in real life.Not much - it's a symbol after all.So a limited quantity, maybe 100 or 300 pieces?The decision was not made.A black coin with yellow peppers.It's a good idea, but let's put it aside.Today let's focus on mining......We keep extracting POW.It's still easy now.Now there is 3 EPPE for 1 blockAfter Halving, it will be half.And that's not much time leftHalving each 31800 blocksWe need coins.The needs are huge.Promotions, advertising, competitions, guessing games. We fund prizes in games: guessing, trivia and similar entertainment.I do not promise it, but there is a chance that we will test play today.For the first time in the easiest guessing game ever.On the server - PeppersCore -EPPEhttps://discord.gg/BKa83HUjc7Please visit the server.As a Community Manager - EPPE I try to write as often as time allows me to write about everything Related to paprika and our project.The goal for yesterday is..block explorer - http://161.97.142.60:5555The goal for today is a game - a test guessing gameThe prizes will be EPPE coins.These are symbolic rewards for guessing the questions correctly.I Of course, fun, fun - taking away from everyday gray matter.SATURDAY, play, eat pizza with paprikaAnd let the EPPE coin give us joy I wish you all the best.Lots of fun and a nice day.Regards.https://discord.gg/BKa83HUjc7Please visit the server.And get coins - PeppersCore -EPPEhttps://mcmpool.eu/site/mining",
