      "body": "Trying to check out the site and was bit that curious about the name DNT but it turns out to be thisDOUBLE NO TOUCH (DNT)  Basing up on the given link then this is one of the features on which you should really be needing to clear up;Buy DNT tokens based on your prediction for the next 5 minutes (use 1 minute timeframe to check BTC price volatility)So does it mean that DNT is the coin that you would be using up to predict movement of BTC and earned up if ever you do hit up the right prediction?So its not really that guaranteed 2x but rather this is really just that an another Binary options thing.Dont make those kind of misleading words like;Earn 2X DNT in 5 minutes with low market volatilityEarn 2x just in 5 minutesIts just that obvious that you are getting that too desperate when it comes to marketing or exposure approach.",

What are we missing here?Even Binance, which I believe was one of the top shillers of BUSD is phasing out  BUSD support from their platformI immediately asked myself this question, too. Binance is discontinuing all support for BUSD as of February 2024. This is certainly a deterrent for potential customers. The use of BUSD will then also no longer be possible after February: QuoteThis decision comes on the heels of Paxos’ move to halt the production of new BUSD coins. By February 2024, Binance users must transition away from BUSD, prompting them to explore other stablecoin options or digital assets.SourceFortunately, there are plenty of widely used alternatives, so I would switch to other alternatives like USDT as soon as possible",

      "body": "If I understood you correctly, you are saying that there are two options, which is that if the user’s prediction matches the value of Bitcoin, he will get double the balance, and if that does not happen, he will lose all of his balance. Is this true, and how much range does it take to predict and match the price of Bitcoin?If that is the case, why do you say that the profit is guaranteed, because the profit here is not guaranteed, but on the contrary, the risks are great, and it is closer to binary options. However, if the profit is guaranteed every 5 minutes and you do not explain an honest mechanism for that, then I will leave a negative trust on your account as HYIP.And why Busd?",
