  "content": "It’s never late to place a decent question on Beginners & Help (where I'd prefer it to have stayed):Here’s a case I encountered the other day. I sent two consecutive TXs minutes apart, let’s call them TX1 and TX2, both from the same wallet, and sent to different recipients with seemingly (at the time) adequate fees to be processed within a block or two.Since things were taking their time to be confirmed, and encountering a sudden spike in Bitcoin’s network activity, I bumped TX2 using RBF. I then (subsequently) tried doing likewise with TX1, but the wallet software would not let me. I therefore had TX2 in the mempool at a rate of let’s say 3x the fee of TX1. Now when TX2 got confirmed, I also saw that TX1 also got confirmed within the same block. The weird thing was that TX2 was obviously within the block’s effectively processed min/max fee range, but TX1 was not (my fee on TX1 was way lower than that processed in the mined block).Now In the aftermaths, I looked at the inputs and outputs, and saw that TX2 was using as an input TX1’s output change address. TX2 therefore depended on TX1.Now here are the questions:Q1) Would it be correct to infer that TX1 was mined alongside TX2 because what I pulled off was a CPFP (without using the wallet’s CPFP function, but by performing the steps I described above)?Q2) Could the said dependency be the cause for the wallet not being able to apply RBF on TX1 (after successfully being able to do in on TX2)?",

I have done this many times without using the wallet CPFP and it worked as the transaction are included into the same block. Transaction 2 is CPFP transaction.",

In this situation TX2 would not be valid if the output from the change address (of TX1) is not included, and output would not be included if TX1 isn't confirmed, so the miner must have been compelled to include both into the block.• I am not aware of how the link would prevent a bump of the fee.",

We are to observe the comments from experts. If I may say TX1 and TX2 are two different Miners that confirm your transaction at the same time in coincident. I don't think the dependency caused the RBF rejection but probably because TX1 was unconfirmed",

You did CPFP.Your second transaction used the output of the first transaction and the miner had to include the first transaction as well. When miners see a transactions spending an unconfirmed output, they usually calculate the effective fee rate and include the transactions (the child and the parent) in the same block if the fee rate is high enough. For calculating the effective fee rate, they add the total fee of the transactions together and divide the result to the total size of transactions.",

Most wallets and software will base their suggested fee only on the size of the child transaction, and will not include the size of any unconfirmed parent transactions. Depending on the sizes of the two transactions, you might end up needing 10x or more the recommended fee on the child transaction to get the combined fee for both transactions up to a suitable level.",

To avoid this, either turn it off or use the coin control feature to select which UTXOs to spend. QuoteQ2) Could the said dependency be the cause for the wallet not being able to apply RBF on TX1 (after successfully being able to do in on TX2)?Not sure, but did you have enough balance to pay for the extra fee?

Put in mind that the change you received from TX2 does not count as that transaction is not valid any more! If that's the case, TX2's input (TX1's change) is not enough to fill both transaction's total fee plus 1sat/vB rate of the replacement txn.Electrum's default rbf behavior is: \"decrease change, or add new inputs, or decrease any outputs\" in particular order.Replacing TX1 will invalidate TX2 anyways so it'll use TX2's input for additional fee.",
