If you think your post is helpful or can change some perspective between some post or the thread itself then post it. But if your post is just nonsense and just want to post because you want to increase your post count then maybe think about more better than that since it doesn't give any good contribution if your intention is to post random matters.",

If you are patient enough and you can take some time to read all the replies and responses from the first page to the last, there is a very high chance that you would see what you want to write, that is someone else has already written it and given the response.",

You can comment on it if it's really necessary for that same topic. Necro bumping is what you are gonna commit if you will continue to post with that warning since the topic is already abandoned by the OP.Quote from: Timmzzy on June 14, 2023, 11:55:41 AMDoes it mean we cant go back in time to comment on any topic, just need few explanationYou can always create a new thread specifically for discussion on that specific old thread as continuation of that topic.

I still recommend you to change something in the thread name if you want to discuss about the topic in further detail. But, if all dimensions of the topic are already cleared out in the previous thread then it doesn't make sense to repeat the same thread again and again.",

Most members don't do this unless they really want different response results along with thread specific settings to filter out some unexpected replies.By the way, doesn't this question belong to the Meta?",
