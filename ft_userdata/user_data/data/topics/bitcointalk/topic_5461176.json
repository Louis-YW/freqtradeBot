Do you have any ideas why he bought exactly 2 BTC. But not 1 or 2?Quote from: un_rank on July 27, 2023, 06:20:55 AMQuote from: KalOlak on July 27, 2023, 06:13:35 AMWhy do you think Robert Kennedy Jr. bought each child exactly 2 bitcoins, not 1 or 3?If he bought 3, the question would have been, \"why not 2 or 4?\".It has to be a certain number an it just happens to be 2.- Jay -The current supply of Bitcoin is 19.44 million. I believe he simply calculated how much Bitcoin one would need to own to be in the top 0.1% if Bitcoin were to replace the global financial system. Yes, today it's a bet of 1.944, and he just rounded it up to 2.",

Possibly, he has been campaigning and one of his major campaign point is focused on Bitcoin adoption which has so far gianed attention so I believe doing such will mean him leading by example which will make him the topic of discussion but my thoughts are as follows, why choose now to do such, you claim you are a Bitcoin enthusiast why did you not do all these you have been doing earlier before now so that the electorate would know it's not strange and would acknowledge the fact that you have long been doing such why now buying Bitcoin and making it public so that people would start talking. I am beginning to see all these as a cheap political campaign point and not making any sense.OP next time do well to attach your reference so as not to get your account in a plagiarism saga.",

He had the money and he understand Bitcoin and it's potential, it's something that every one of us can do for our children, the only difference is he is rich and many of us here can't afford 1BTC.I do like what Kennedy Jr is doing in crypto space lately and I also like that he is going for the presidential candidate but there is nothing proven here yet, are we supposed to be happy he bought Bitcoin? Or do you expect the market to start pumping because Kennedy Jr bought some Bitcoin? If he likes, he should buy 100 more for his children, we aren't supposed to debate on that, it's why I believe your point is not valid.",

Given his current status as a presidential candidate, perhaps because he wants to beat his rival candidate by an even number of counts.The obvious reasons are only owned by him and I don't really believe in the words of politicians.Anyone who has money and not only intends but decides to buy bitcoins should be at any amount depending on the individual. Buying a lot is better.I don't think this is too important to discuss.No offense.",
