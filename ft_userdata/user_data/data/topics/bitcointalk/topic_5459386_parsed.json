There could be many reasons why your posts fail to attract merit rewards. Manybe you are posting in such Boards where merit sources rarely visit or you may not create attention properly in the forum. Also having about cryptocurrency, trading strategy and gambling startegy isn't all you need to have, you should have deep knowledge in most of the sectors and have a good presentation, helping nature and communication skills among the forum members.

There is no way to know who marked you in ignore list or blacklist until he share with you or publicly. As far I know some shit posters, spammers oftenly get ignored but not by all.",

I find it disappointing to hear a full member whine about the qualities of his posts. I just looked at your profile and found that the majority of your postings are not merit-worthy. instead, it's important to consider how readers will interpret your message and its potential value to them. Although some of your contributions are discussion posts that don't really contribute much to the forum, I don't want to criticise your efforts. You should be aware that you attained full member status because other users thought your contributions were deserving. If you believe that you aren't receiving any more merits, you may want to consider improving your postings or, better yet, you can report any unmerited posts to the merit sources. Not everyone on the forum ignored you so don’t worry about people who ignored or blacklisted you,  just keep working hard and improve your posts quality and the merits will surely locate you. Let the people who blacklist you be the ones missing out on your posts.",

How do I proceed with such a delimma?Neither this forum nor anyone else can guarantee that you will get merit by every posting. If your post is eligible for merit then your post will definitely get merit. The topics you post on are usually topics. where a huge amount of posts are completed in a short period of time from different accounts. So an quality post from there does not come easily to the notice of any merit sender.  You can post on critical topics where critical problems are solved and a lot of merit is distributed like Meta, Bitcoin Technical Support,  Scam Accusations, Reputation, Beginners & Help, If your aim is to earn merit then try these boards here you will understand how talented you are",

      "body": "Just like other members said, you can’t just outrightly be able to know that you are on ignore list except they publish it here or they tell it to you. The lack of merit doesn’t mean you are on ignore, there are members who you might have caught their attention and they feel your post are lacking quality so they just go past it. Also the lack of merit is most influenced by the kind of post and boards you engage on, and currently I have looked into your history and I would say it is that reason why you are not getting them. Most of your posts are on boards that some merit sources considers spamming and area, and none of them are actually sharing knowledge or problem solving, rather i saw lots of posts based on reporting news and this isn’t seeing as a quality post. Quality posts are when you help some one or the community out of a problem and not necessarily creating threads. If you feel to much concerned that your post are merit worthy then you can ask certain prominent members like Sceptical Chymist, for review, or better still there are threads you can post on as suggested by Jawhead99, three members have such thread (LoyceV, Ratimov, Filippone) and this could be Abel to solve your problem",

See it as you not posting enough in boards where those who are generous with merits post in. Again, know that merit giving is as much as subjective as one feels tagging posts as spam. It's all in the judgment of the person doing the appraisal. I don't think it's about your post quality because I don't see you as a shitposter.

Certainly, the quality of posts and putting someone on the ignore list are related. If you spam or write useless bullshit, there is a high probability that you will end up on the ignore list of many users. So, don't spam and you will not be ignored, merit will come as a consequence.I think that the ignore option is mostly used by older members, probably because they are tired of reading nonsense. Also, they have the most merit to give.",

You will get stocked if you are just a good poster. You need to be an excellent poster to be attracting merits on a daily basis.If you sit back, merits may never find you.

Ask yourself, if someone else should make a similar post that I just made and I have some smerit will I send it to this type of post? And besides most of the post you think are quality may just be a shit post to some while the ones you think are mildly quality will be more appreciated than the rest... Another thing Op, correct me if I am wrong, I bet you main aim was for you to get to a full member rank and when you finally did you got too relaxed and didn't feel the need for merits anymore and now you're no longer satisfied with your current rank and want to move to a higher rank but can't figure out how to go about earning merits since all you have tried isn't working.
