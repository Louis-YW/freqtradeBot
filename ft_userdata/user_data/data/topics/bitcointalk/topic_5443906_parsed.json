The quoted text will automatically appear in the reply boxBut most members don't like this kind of quoting or replying since you are replying to the last person. Why quote all the previous replies?",

Itâ€™s a nested quote created by four people quoting a post (one quotes, another quotes the quote, another quotes the quote of the quote, and so forth). Generally speaking, in order to respond, you are not going to need to reference the complete nested quote.Itâ€™s best to try to delimit the quote to the part that is relevant, and not to drag along massive chunks of (possibly nested) quotes.In general, if you want to answer to multiple people youâ€™d make a single quote from each post you want to answer to, and delimit the relevant part (or leave a general quote as I did above so itâ€™s clear that Iâ€™m responding to your post).",
