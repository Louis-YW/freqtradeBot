That model is super rare, it has not been listed on their official distributes for months, which suggests that they made a very limited quantity of it, the currently available models are just the M50s and the M50, with efficiency ranging between 25w/th to 29w/th, and hashrate that goes from 108th to 130th +-5%.The difference in price, however, is very unreasonable IMO, for example, it's 6$ difference between the 28w and the 25w versions, not sure if that is worth it for a power rate that's below 10c per kWh.",
