Without oil, there are no combine harvesters in the fields and without natural gas, there are no fertilizers. Without this, no matter how large the fields are, it will still be cheaper to buy grain from a neighboring country with money from the sale of processors than to collect grain by hand and sow new crops without fertilizers.",

We need to include oil in the list of resources to see the role it will play in our development.- The issue of natural resources of the country, region,... brings a great advantage in times of industrial development and is also the reason why countries in the West Asian region have become richer like So. But we should also look at the problem from another perspective when there are cases of possessing abundant resources like countries in South America or Africa, but they cannot be rich while under sanctions.- Agriculture is always the foundation of long-term development. No matter how strong a country is, they must always find ways to maintain and develop this industry to serve them, as shown in the economic context in recent years. Nowadays, food is increasingly scarce and expensive, making the problem of hunger even more widespread. I have also heard about the price of rice increasing and have also seen the generosity of a country providing aid real quantity. Vietnam gifts Cuba 5,000 tonnes of riceIn a different aspect, they all have a great influence on our lives today, so I don't think which one is more important because they have a relationship of support and service for people.",

There are also greenhouse products. This tech lets you grow anything anywhere. Let’s just say, if you invest enough time and money, you can grow your own food but if you don’t have oil, you can‘t grow it no matter how hard you try. You can only buy it from somebody else.

But that doesn't mean they will eliminate agriculture in their own country because they will still look at this sector even if only to meet their needs because the income sector already exists through oil resources.QuoteBut, of course, the agricultural sector, though not given the proper recognition and the required investment is one sector that contributes seriously to the development and dependence of most nations .The agricultural sector is indeed a very important sector for all countries because it is related to the issue of food and the daily needs consumed by all people. But other sectors such as oil natural resources also need to be considered to make the country's income bigger and more advanced. You can look at the oil producing countries in the world which on average can become more developed, and do not experience excessive difficulties in other economic sectors such as agriculture.QuoteNo matter how blessed a country is with oil minerals, if its agricultural sector isn't working and she has to rely on other country for her food and agricultural resources then in event of war or political differences they might suffer. That is quite logical, but countries that have progressed through oil resources can also use small areas of land for agriculture even though the state is not so focused on their own agricultural products because perhaps the government has its own way of making sure that the country does not experience difficulties in agricultural sector.",

Agriculture vs oil, which is the big deal when it comes to the economic strength of a country? Both.With oil, even with the popularity of EVs it's still needed and the same goes with the agriculture. Both are needed and there's no need to have a debate on it. I think those countries that are rich in oil and knows how to manage it really takes care of themselves even without agricultural lands just look at the middle eastern countries like Saudi, Dubai, etc. Whilst for the agricultural lands, they have their food country and that's also another form and sign of good economy.",

The simple answer op is, Both agriculture and oil contribute to a country's economy. Oil rich countries can become wealthy, but if they don't invest in agriculture, they might spend a lot of their oil money on food. The importance of each sector depends on factors like how much oil a country has, its development level, and the global oil market. Oil can bring in a lot of money, but a strong and reliable agriculture sector is crucial for food, jobs, and economic stability. It's best for a country to balance both sectors for long-term economic strength.",

Oil is given first class priority onlyby the countries that have this resources, they are blessed Hy nature and since oil is an catalyst that boom their economy, they don't joke with it, in addition they are in abundant which means they make more revenue from it and hence the reason why such counties don't prioritize agriculture. Use Qatar for example, they are oily rich country that grow littlenon agriculture.Other countries on the other hand that are not oil dependents don't have choice but to concentrate on other sectors like Technology and agriculture, use China as example, they don't have oil but that has not stop their economy from been the leadership in the world, they still dominate this world with wealth despite not been not oil country and they are blessed with medicines too, other countries patronize them also and they make mad money from these  alternatives.QuoteNo matter how blessed a country is with oil minerals, if its agricultural sector isn't working and she has to rely on other country for her food and agricultural resources then in event of war or political differences they might suffer.

For that, The liberals give a suggestion to make dependency on each other when they are dependent on each they will never go to war.QuoteAgriculture vs oil, which is the big deal when it comes to the economic strength of a country? before 2010 oil was the biggest economic strength then agriculture and produced more revenue than agricultural products and took less time while agriculture needed 6 months to come. But today I think agriculture has been good several times as the world is shifting from oil to electric and solar systems. Let's take the example of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia they shift their country's revenue to tourism and other things, Just go and search about MBS mission 2030, in which the prience less dependency on oils and shifts it to the tourist spots.",

While oil production does not depend in any of its stages on agriculture, agriculture has become dependent in many of its stages on petroleum products that help it operate the necessary machines and active factories in the food industries. Just as a country cannot survive without agricultural products, it cannot build a pastoral economy based on agriculture without relying on oil to the same degree. There are countries that still depend on the non-mechanized pastoral economy, but they do not achieve significant development in terms of productivity except through the large number of manual labor.",

The discussion over importance of agriculture versus oil for the strength of a country is very interesting and complex one, and largely depends on a range of factors, such as availability of natural resources, country's specific circumstances and its political and economic strategies. Both oil and agriculture have their merits and challenges and their significance can vary from to another nation. Personally, I place strong emphasis on development of agriculture, given its critical role as its to meet basic needs of human and animals beside proving raw material for numerous industries.",
