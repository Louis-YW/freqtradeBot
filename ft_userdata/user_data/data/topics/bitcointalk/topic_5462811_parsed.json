I'm not aware that this icon is clickable until I accidentally click it now while browshing the forum thread.I just notice that if you will click the icon, It will display the thread that received a reply for today but I became confused on its real feature because it doesn't show some of the thread that received today post. FYI, The icon will gray out when you scan all the thread that has a today replies on the thread. Anyone using here this feature in the forum?",

And the topics that you read will be hidden when you click on the icon and you won't see them. There is no other secret hidden there so don't be surprised because this topic may be new to you but many btt users already know about it.",

When it is blue, this means that there are unread topics, and when it is gray, it means that there are no new unread topics in the section. Personally, I rarely use it.This triangle iconÂ  has been discussed before in the meta section about the possibility of converting it into another icon like bitcoin icon for example.",

Is really good to try out some things in this forum as long as you're not breaking the rules of this place. And I'd like to know if one can still post in any of those icons if you get it open?",

Anyone using here this feature in the forum?It doesn't show threads that you already read (after visiting the thread) after having new replies, and that's the reason why it gray out, which means there's nothing for you to read on that particular board on that particular time.I usually didn't use it and i prefer using the Show unread posts since last visit.. Actually, it's more like the same but just in particular board.",

      "body": "Yes, I have tried to use that feature before (when I also realized it's clickable) to keep myself updated in the forum in case of new replies and comments, but I find out that not almost all topics that receive a new reply are indicated there. Sometimes, after reading a thread, I just add it to my watchlist, but any time I also check the watchlist, I only discover that some of the topics I added are not there. So, I don't use it again, but now I use the BTT Super notifier. I think if you are concerned that all the topics you are looking for are not on that icon, then you can use the BTT Super notifier to get updates on new mentions or comment notifications.",

After that, I know about it being clickable but never know it's function and if I remember correctly, I never used it since I don't know it's function or if it's any use to me.",

Admin probably just left it as it is when he was customizing the forum. The same logo appears even on their Github ProfileIf you look carefully, it's actually a Lever which is a type of simple machine just like a pulley, inclined plane etc.",

Well, I just click the button and find out that it is for recent unread posts. I thought it's symbolizes for \"mute\" since it looks like a speaker with a slash. Thank for the info but I prefer on browsing insidw of the thread than to use this.",
