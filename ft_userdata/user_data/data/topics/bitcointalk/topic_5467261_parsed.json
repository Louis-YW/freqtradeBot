  "content": "I'm trying to recover a wallet from around 2015 or 2016 for an elderly relative who has some details but can't remember which platform or which wallet she used to create it.She has the following written down :- the seed which has only four words (I'm guessing she lost the other ones)- the email address she used to create it (she says she cleans up her inbox though so there's probably nothing useful in there)- the email and password she used to register on the platform or wallet- the account ID with lowercase letters and numbers separated by a hyphenI tried recovering using the four-word seed in Electrum just in case (the address is a Base58 P2PKH legacy address) but it didn't show up.Is there any way to recover using the account ID? Is that type of lowercase hyphenated ID a feature of a blockchain.info account? Is my only option to contact blockchain.com here? Or literally just trying Forgot Password on every platform that was around in 2016?Many thanks in advance !",

So I'm assuming she also had two factor authentication.Let her try to create a new account using that email or recover the wallet-ID using it. If a new account is created, this means that it is not the email associated with your account, and if you get a notification with the wallet-ID, then the problem is on their part in sending authorization mails.There is a suggestion: If she is using a device from 2016 or from a device that she has connected to before, then try to connect through it. People rarely delete cookies, and if cookies are present, they may bypass authorization, although I think the probability of this option being successful is slim.",

So, if you try to login to your Blockchain defi wallet with the email address \"abc@example.com\" and you initially configured your email address as \"Abc@example.com\" then you will not receive an authorization email.It doesn't sound like this is the OP's problem as they also tried to log in with their Wallet ID. The last ditch solution is to change the email address associated with your wallet. This article covers troubleshooting the problem, as well as how to change your email: https://cryptoassetrecovery.com/posts/not-receiving-blockchain-authorization-emails",

This was before the new implementation on blockchain.info and they're passphrases related to decrypting wallet id and password.The four words we have saved aren't in any BIP39 wordlists but I found them on an archived page of blockchain.info in a mnemonic_words.txt file. There is about 60,000 not 2048 words.So it's not a brain wallet as someone said. I already tried bitaddress.org but it didn't give me my correct wallet. It seems it's a phrase that was given by blockchain.info itself. It looks like this page used to be used back then to decrypt wallets in such case : https://blockchain.info/DecryptWallet.html. But that redirects to this tool which doesn't even work : https://github.com/blockchain/my-wallet-backup-decryption-toolIt's crazy that I can't restore my wallet when I have the correct wallet id, correct password, correct bitcoin address, and a mnemonic from an outdated system that blockchain.info provided almost 10 years back and which they don't support anymore.Blockchain.com's support is not very helpful with this. I don't think the current support staff even know what blockchain.info was back in 2015 or that this was before they provided seeds that are like private keys. Support are asking for the registered email address so they can update it on file but we have no idea which email address back then was used and if we still even have access to it.Is there any other way to recover a wallet using these old blockchain.info mnemonic words?",
