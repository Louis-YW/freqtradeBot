Only Bitcoin is the one on which we can trust.Are you still learning this for the first time? Isn't that what it has always been with centralised organisations? Banks, financial institutions, centralised exchanges, etc.â€”all they do is monitor your transactions any time they feel the need to do so, and they can still free their coin or token because it's their native token and they created it, so they can do anything with it. This is not a new thing; people know about it.Even with the Altcoins you mentioned, any project can just come up with the idea of freezing their token, and once they do so, you cannot even withdraw or trade those tokens. At such a point, those coins can become useless, and the investors assets will just disappear gradually as the token losses liquidity.",

Various private companies or government institutions will never give you financial freedom, to get financial freedom you must be associated with Bitcoin because only Bitcoin will give you financial freedom. At the moment ALT coins in the market cannot be relied on much because these coins tend to disappear from the market so at the moment Bitcoin is the most reliable platform. Investing in Bitcoin will give you financial freedom as well as ensure substantial security of money.",

USDT and other stablecoins are regulated entities and forms of implementation are more sophisticated than the banking system which is ready at any time to \"steal\" legally the wealth you have stored, and that imo does not concern one's overall economic condition.Financial freedom depends more on personal ability to achieve it than external factors.",

That's why you see that they come up with fake project to scam their customers. OR they put some conditions to favour themselves so that they van freeze customers funds and turn it to theirs. All these altcoins can do the same because it is a centralized one. This is one of the reason that makes me not to invest in any centralized platform to avoid such. Bitcoin is the only decentralized project that you can have your freedom to use your bitcoin and there is no rules and regulations that will deprive you access to your coins in your noncustodial wallet.",

So there's no need to worry if big companies keep blocking us from having financial freedom.We can look for coins other than Bitcoin to save money, but saving Bitcoin is better than saving other coins. And we also don't need to save money in Paypal's stablecoin, especially with that tweet. That proves we have to be really responsible with the crypto we have.So keep as much Bitcoin as possible, don't tell anyone you have Bitcoin. There will come a time when governments will realize that their citizens need financial freedom and they won't be able to stop it. And when Bitcoiners can do that, we can get financial freedom. Just HODL and sell when you are profitable",

Of course, if you are a consumer, companies are not even going to think about your financial freedom. Become an investor in those companies, or create one, and see if things change. I am talking about companies in general, not only in the crypto world. The example you give of the Paypal stablecoin does not surprise me, a centralizedshitcoin and that they can freeze.

People discover investing and heard how it can make profit and the next opportunity they see to invest they will mindlessly grab it, even without knowing just what they bought or invested in. People tend to go blind and just mindlessly dive into something they are clueless about just for money. Hence, it should be greatly emphasized how important research is, as well as asking for second thoughts and advice from those who are already knowledgeable in the field.",

In reality, most of the people are happy to find such tools.But they don't know that such companies are made to control you so that you guys don't turn to BTC or other decentralized systems where we could gain financial freedom.

Only Bitcoin is the one on which we can trust.You sound disappointed as if you just realized this (although I hope that's not the case), but the system has always looked at ordinary people as consumables, whether you consider the Middle Ages or the period 100 years ago or what we have today. Financial independence would be a complete disaster for those at the top of the pyramid, because centralized currencies are one of the most effective mechanisms of controlling the masses through all the long instruments that directly derive from them. It is true that stablecoins are one of the biggest follies that people have accepted because they consider them an easy and simple way to transfer value, but they are neither stable, nor secure, nor nearly as much as most people think. Altcoins are definitely a story for themselves, because as I commented the other day in another topic, I don't consider them to be anything other than tokens for gambling in a game called Pump&Dump.",
