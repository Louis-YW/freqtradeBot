  "content": "Yes, the pool strategy of investment doesn't refer to the game of pool, but a method in which a group of persons can come together to agree on combining their funds to invest in a business or acquire asset that is evenly shared or divided among themselves. I was surfing through my Instagram and saw a clip of an interview, on how an Arab family of 4 brothers, married their wives, live a big house, pool their funds together, invest in an asset and share the profit evenly among themselves. This way, they all had exotic cars and property and the wives and their mom only had to take care of the home while the brothers go do their work. This is one way wealth has been replicated for generations according to the  Arab man who granted the interview and I found this revelation quite intelligent and very helpful. We live currently off the idea of a P2P system, in which  among many other reasons is the fact that it has created a kind of trust between people who on a normal day don't know each other or would want to have anything to do with them on the grounds of race, ethnicity, tribal sentiments, religious beliefs or wealth class.QuoteIf a group of people or organizations pool their money, knowledge, or equipment, they share it or put it together so that it can be used for a particular purpose.The first step is to earn enough money to cover your basic needs, with some left over for saving. The second step is to manage your spending so that you can maximize your savings. The third step is to invest your money in a variety of different assets so that it's properly diversified for the long haul.Steps to pool money:*Decide what you want to invest in.*Gather your group of investors.*Determine how much money each person will contribute.*Sign an operating agreement that outlines everyone's responsibilities.*Follow through with the investment plan and reap the rewards!A group of friends or brothers or relatives or colleagues can come together, buy some crypto asset, possibly BTC because of its credibility and then share the profit after the time agreed upon is due. They could also invest in Altcoins for quick profits on short duration.What do you think?

In business we have seen so many business that started with partnership but I wouldn't advice anyone to go into partnership to invest in bitcoin because in whose wallet will the coins be in. Remember bitcoin should be store in a noncustodial wallet and which of these partners will have the private keys. If the person who have the private keys run away how will you arrest him that he is with your coins,when this can not be investigated by the government because the only way one can have his right in any business that he partner with his friend if he is deprived of his right. Is by going to the police but in bitcoin no evidence unlike a physical investment where there are so many documents to proof. I am not cool with this idea. Human is greedy in nature.",

When it comes to Bitcoin investment, there is no limit to what one can buy. Whatever little money you have, you can buy what you can afford and call it your own. Adding money together to buy Bitcoin will even be more confusing, and some issues might arise in the future.Bitcoin profit is not calculated based on how many people add money to purchase it; it's calculated by the amount you hold, which is how much you can earn in every little bull run. Let me say, for instance:Four brothers who have $1,000, $700, $800, and $900, respectively, add the money together, which will sum up about $3400, and use the entire fund to purchase Bitcoin. This Bitcoin will always be shared based on the individual's amount invested; it is no different from buying it and holding it individually without even going into that kind of stress. This kind of strategy will only be beneficial in a family where they have been issued general funds that should be split among themselves. If they are not in a hurry to use that money, they can come together and agree on how to invest that money in Bitcoin, from which they will all benefit if there is a profit added to it, and if there is any loss recorded, it will also be shared among themselves. About families living together, both husband and wife and kids, in a big family house, to some point I don't like the idea, but that depends on what people believe. sha If you don't look at society today and the way things are moving and how families are going into conflicts with one another, you will see that it's best for married people to stay far away from each other's families, especially where more than one family is involved. You never know where issues will come from, and when they do, you never know who you are to support or who not to support, whether you will choose your wife's statement over that of your own brother's, and so on. To avoid some kind of drama, it will be peaceful for them to stay in separate homes, provided that each of them can afford to foot their bills. Family is more peaceful in distance. I don't know about the Arabic home, but I talk based on personal experience here in my local.",

Not just a few people getting together, but tens of thousands, in some cases even millions of people put their money into them, and they end up using those billions and billions of dollars into making big moves which shapes the market, allows them to basically manipulate it which results with them making more profit. Is there a pool there? Yeap, is there a lot of people investing with that pooled money? Definitely, are they making money from it? They surely do. As you can see it is an idea that works but it does require a ton of money and also requires a lot of powerful people at the top that knows what to do with it. It can work, but not with us gathering couple thousand from a few people.",

Addition to having different experienced entrepreneurs coming together to share ideas on how to tackle present and future challenges makes it's all easier to face compared to when all of that is coming from one head.But having a partnership business investment doesn't mean success is sure. Partnership demands people of like minds dedicated to the vision mutually, and humans are unpredictable and can change at anytime should there arise a discrepancy of interest and such change could have a devastating effect in decision making towards the investment. In otherwords, the pooling strategy of investment for wealth multiplication can be stalled when the investors ain't of a uniformed mind and vision, it could be disastrous.",

Let's discuss!This could really be that applicable but this would be only good if you do make out dealings with family members but still having the chance when it comes to trusts issues considering that we are talking about money on here on which there are really people who cant really be that trusted specially to those people who do been holding up the funds. For traditional investment then it might be applicable and possible since everything could really be having that kind of agreement or signed or notarized basing up on what had been agreed upon, doesnt matter if you are family or total random person who do share up on the same interest or concept in mind about pooled investment. The main argument on which people would really be that realizing is on how they would be making up decisions if ever this one be applied on crypto investment?Who would be the ones will really be holding those invested amounts considering that you would be holding up for long term? This is why i would say that this isnt applicable on crypto spacebut rather into those traditional ones which it is really that realistic.",

Basically I do not really agree with the use of this pattern in terms of investment, the group method of combining funds to achieve large investments in crypto or bitcoin is not a good strategy, because we can independently engage in bitcoin investment even if we rely on small capital. The consequence of pooling money in a business or investment with a group carries a level of risk that can make the group distrust one another.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on July 16, 2023, 06:34:06 PMA group of friends or brothers or relatives or colleagues can come together, buy some crypto asset, possibly BTC because of its credibility and then share the profit after the time agreed upon is due.

How far can you guarantee this will work normally and why not involve yourself in investing independently in bitcoins. I think an idea like this is not quite right and we will be in trouble when the price reaches a sharp decline in the market. In the end one group of friends would suggest selling bitcoins instead of waiting for a sharper decline and eventually the investment went even more chaotic because one of the members was worried about the of bitcoins.Regardless of how you can build confidence in building capital with a group of friends, I don't think it's the best way and there are still other ways to get to the usual investing ability stage.",

A lot of people grew money from this technique but in the same note I don't really recommend this to everyone cause first off, you have to have people you trust. Plus points if you have friends, and God only knows how many of us here have gone long enough outside to get friends we'd trust with our money lol. Kidding aside though, Another reason why I don't suggest this to everyone is the mere fact that you're entrusting someone else with your money, meaning you have someone else to blame when shit hits the fan and your investment tanks. It's better to take full responsibility over your money so you have full power and accountability over it. Otherwise if you're not quick to anger and you're willing to share the profit or the loss with other people, then by all means take the pooling method.",

Yes, if you have the ability to manage finances and have credibility and a good portfolio, maybe you can make one. But I don't agree if a mutual fund company will be used for bitcoin investment, in my opinion the risk will be very large. It may be best if your mutual fund company makes investments like any other, usually investing its money in the stock or bond markets. Maybe you can use some of those profits to buy bitcoins and hold them. It's probably a lot safer and has a lower riskMutual fund companies will usually distribute dividends periodically, if you invest in bitcoin you will have a hard time when you have to distribute dividends, the price of bitcoin is too volatile and when the market is bad maybe you need to hold bitcoin longer and it can go up for 2 or 3 years, then What are you doing? You will distribute dividends when conditions like this occur?I would suggest it is better if you will create a joint company and then you should invest your funds in a safer sector. Even though the dividend yield is not that big, if you can pay dividends regularly every month, then your company's investors will have more confidence.",

Let's discuss!I think it's rubbish.Such a 'system' only makes sense in order to access an investment that you would not be able to access individually. For example, if the minimum to invest in something is $5,000 and you only have $1,000, it makes sense for you to get together with four others to be able to invest. But at the end of the day the return is the same. If you invest in something that has an average return of 10%, whether you do it alone or with more people, starting with $1,000, after a year on average you will have $1,100 and investing with more people can have more disadvantages than advantages, especially when it comes to making decisions, such as when to sell. The more people involved, the more disadvantages.",

This way, they all had exotic cars and property and the wives and their mom only had to take care of the home while the brothers go do their work.If i am not wrong you are refferring to same video i have watched in which those brothers are sharing their money as, one brother is doctor, another is construction worker, one is engineer and all of them has gathered their money and bought cars, house etc. And their women are living a luxury life in the house by become housewives. If that video is same then those brothers did not invested their money by combining them they used the money to buy things by sharing each other money (by combining).And believe me we Muslims prefer this way, like when i came to know about \"getting out of house\" is a thing when you have to leave you parent and house after turning 18, i was like what! because we as Muslims loved to take care of our parents and wants to live with them so that we could take care of them as they did when we were child. (i could share hundred of stories like these which are 100% true).We as Muslims loved to pay Black Tax, if you know what it is, a topic is already created here before you could look into it by searching it on any search engine (like here on BTT or on Google).  We should live together like a family and help each other, but you have to be careful because if you are living together then your wives might not like that idea so convince you wives and if you are not married then ask you finance about the idea of living together. Because this is the main thing that would become a reason for fight but in most cases the problem is solved. Well, you have to be careful while making such relation because you have to make this relation for the sharing or love only not because by living together we could buy anything because such thoughts and idea will only become a reason of fight.",
