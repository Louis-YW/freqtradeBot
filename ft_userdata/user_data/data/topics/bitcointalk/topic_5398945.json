I think many fell for some of this careless speculations and relied solely on it neglecting our own research in which i too was a victim. What speculation did you fall for",

However, we all know what happen next and now we understand again that bitcoin price prediction is very difficult.",

Bitcoin in 2021 became so bullish that many were really thinking that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 within that year. Was it deceitful? Not really. It was a reasonable expectation which was born out of what was happening. The laser eyes movement was supported by a lot of respected Bitcoin fans. Another reason why this is unfair is that this Bitcoin bullish speculation was possible. If you really want to hear the most deceitful speculations, go listen to altcoin projects promoting their ICO, IDO, or existing tokens. They're not only deceitful, they're horrible and out of reality.",

Maybe I'm pretty skeptical about everything and everyone.I remember some guy writing about Ethereum hitting a 10K USD price a few years ago. I kinda believed him for a while,but I changed my mind pretty fast.Back in 2017-2018 I believed that the GRAFT coin project will have a great future and the Graft coin will increase it's price.Right now,the GRAFT coin is a dead shitcoin with a 1K USD market cap,AFAIK. I'm glad that I haven't bought any GRAFT coins.

What speculation did you fall forI don't see any speculation that bitcoin will cross $100k in 2021 but for me it's more of a wish for everyone and every wish may not come true. As we all know, the bitcoin market is speculative, meaning it may or may not be achieved. So as an investor, you must be smart in analyzing the market correctly.",

That is mainly caused by people making profit with other things, so when your bitcoin goes 2x, or even 5x, that means your 1k becomes 5k and people start to use that profit by investing into something silly, which makes no sense to me but people do that all the time during hyped periods.This results with people having some tokens that worth nothing, but they just gave it a chance. Just watch, if the market goes up enough that bitcoin becomes 100k one day, there will be plenty of useless tokens people invest into all over again.",
