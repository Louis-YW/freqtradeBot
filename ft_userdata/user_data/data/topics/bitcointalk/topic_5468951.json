If Craig claimes to be Satoshi, he should login his account in this forum and make a post to convince the Bitcoin community. On the other hand, let him make a transaction from Satoshi's wallet. If he fails to do any of the above, I will gladly join the group that see him as a laughing stock.",

But when they turn against their boss, it even looks ridiculous. Has Craig's superhero power perished so much that the team that continued to support him is now turning against him?These people may also be under pressure after all the drama, but no one believes them. But it's good news when the team turns against Craig and realizes that it was a mistake. A penance might clear their names, but not completely as the past records will remain and can never be erased.",
