      "body": "I remember that a year or more ago you launched your own UMC project and launched a Bounty campaign to introduce the project and find potential investors. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5367043.0Returning to the thread of the project announcement, it seems dead and has not been updated for a long time, despite the success of the bounty campaign that Julerz was the manager as I remember.Today, I was surprised to find that you are launching assistant service and you have an open loan of $50. What happened with the UCF project? Did you stop working on it? And Why not make it clear on the Ann Thread or ask OP to close it? Clarity and transparency will help people believe you and confirm your integrity. This is just advice and you are ultimately free to do whatever you want.",
