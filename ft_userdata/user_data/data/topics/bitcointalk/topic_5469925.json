  "content": "Greetings my follow Nigeria (Naija) bitcoiners, i will like to celebrate everyone in this house for the good work we are doing in this Nigeria (Naija) local board, and there is an improvement in the area of quality post that made Nigeria local board to be part among the best local board in the Bitcointalk forum. Â The reason why I created this topic is to remind whoever that is in charge to allow Nigeria (Naija) local board to have moderator in the local board, I believe we are due for it and we have what it takes to have moderator so that we can begin to enjoy the respect and value all those local board that has moderators are enjoying in the Bitcointalk forum. If you check round other local board you will no that our facilitators in the Nigeria local board are doing a great job to impacted users about BTC that will generate potential bitcoiners in the future. Do we really need a moderator in this Nigeria local board? Or we don't have the requirements that qualify us to have moderator in the Nigeria local board forum? What is your opinion.",

If you look around we have any qualified candidacies for the role so it's not a matter of lacking qualified individuals or there are no willing persons for the role. Having a local moderator will add more to the sense of belonging we dey enjoy for the forum and bcos as nah person wey dey closer and understand the Naija pidgin language beta e go dey easy for the moderator to identify between posts that is worth having a space in the LB or not. So issue of us having a LB moderator is not a matta of opinion but a necessity.",

So issue of us having a LB moderator is not a matta of opinion but a necessity.Yeah we have matured individuals who have been in the business of crypto, block chain and bit coin for a long time now and we have got some legends that can become moderator due to their high level of wisdom and intellectual capacity is this forum, so I hereby second the motion as this development will bring positive energy to our co cypto enthusiast. This will also bring us closer to each other and be able to also relate our opinion and challenges among one another. it's also gonna boast our moral knowing fully well that our moderator is our fellow compatriot",
