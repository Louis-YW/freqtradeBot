Hi ! i hope you're fine !  Totally understand you about that, But Mr.NaRAMoto comes from Twitter (I'm not going to directly share his twitter account because I don't know if he would like it, but if you look at my tweets you won't have trouble finding him  ), he has already bought few of my collectibles via PM in Twitter, and I told him that to participate in the auction he had to register here, that's why he can bid, but indeed if an unknown newbie arrives in the auction I will contact him before accepting his bid to find out who he is. (and indeed the first time that lots of newbies had arrived on my sales/auction I had this fear that it would be seen as shill bidding/selling)If I don't put a rule like this in my auctions, it's because I don't want newcomers to feel \"rejected\" when they arrive here.I have never had an unknown newbie who bid on one of my auctions, almost all of them are new members coming from twitter since I promote there, so that our world of collectibles is more seen by the general public or people who were unaware of this.If you have any other questions don't hesitate!Quote from: TheNovemberMan on May 24, 2022, 02:58:42 PMLot#35 : 0.025BTCHi buddy ! i hope you're fine !  thank you a lot for your bidding ! really appreciate !good luck to you !Current high bid :Lot#20 : 0.025BTC - Mr.NaRAMotoLot#21 : 0.025BTC - sweeteye Lot#23 : 0.025BTC - Otillio1330Lot#24 : 0.025BTC - tldr-hodlLot#25 : 0.025BTC - BTCOVERFIATSLot#29 : 0.025BTC - Dustin westerbeckLot#30 : 0.025BTC - pinky1234Lot#31 : 0.025BTC - sweeteyeLot#34 : 0.025BTCLot#35 : 0.025BTC - TheNovemberMan",
