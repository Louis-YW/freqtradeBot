The Baltic Sea is an open space and most reports refer to the presence of the Russian Navy and even the presence of some submarines. I mean, it will not be easy for America or any country to mobilize its forces in the Baltic Sea in preparation for an attack without Russia realizing it.I rule out a military confrontation between the two forces in the near future. A new cold war could last for years.",

And now they want to make Russia look like the bad guy...I just see USA trying to get something by force and with the kind of person Putin is, is not going to be easy at all.",

They were powerful enough to set the Bolsheviks in power back in the early 1900s. But they weren't powerful enough to keep their stranglehold on this new Russia they put into power.They have been trying ever since to take their power over Russia back. But Russia is thwarting them at every turn.",
