I didn't know that could be an issue.If you want to implement it as simply as installing a plugin, I believe using a managed third-party is the most reasonable option. They do all the integration and you will receive the bitcoin.With this option, things to consider are its fees and any legal requirements like KYC, etc. that some services might require. Other than CoinPayments and BTCPayServer instances, you should compare other similar platforms that offer the same service or requirements that you need.",
