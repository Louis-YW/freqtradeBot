Oh also there will be max supply for Ethereum finally too, or is this expectation of mine way too high.I don’t think Eth can takeover BTC. I mean , I have often seen people claiming that using of ETH is more complicated due to it’s separate blockchain and smart contracts etc. On the other hand BTC is as simple as that.We can also compare BTC and ETH popularities and marketcap. These shows how more people are attracted towards BTC.Moreover BTC are limited in supply, this drives more people crazy about Bitcoins and hence they are fond of storing or buying more BTC than ETH.So I don’t think OP, it never gonna happen.",

Oh also there will be max supply for Ethereum finally too, or is this expectation of mine way too high.Well at the moment the marketcap of Bitcoin is \"only\" a little more than twice the amount of the marketcap of Ethereum, so i don't see a reason why Ethereum should not be able to get the top position from Bitcoin sometime in the not so distant future. That being said, i still think that it won't happen in the next 1 or 2 years and also that it won't happen automatically. Even in this forum there are still a lot of Bitcoin hardcore fans that are saying that every coin besides bitcoin is a sh*itcoin but i think those people slowly but surely become less. If we just take a look at the functionality then of course Ethereum is already king.",

If it goes well and according to plan then yes ETH can become deflationary and therefore increase in value, another scenario you should keep an eye on is what if the merge didn't go as planned and \"unexpected\" problems happen? Will it be the end of ETH, and potentially a huge blow to the crypto market as a whole? Only time will tell..",

This is already proven over time, even when Ethereum first started, most of the time Ethereum is always the number two highest market cap cryptocurrency.About the upcoming update of Ethereum, Ethereum 2.0, you cannot guarantee that will be the key for Ethereum to become number 1.Maybe in some aspects, Ethereum will number 1, just like the total transactions, transaction fees, etc.You can track it here too: https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/flippening/",

IMO, ethereum will be king for altcoins, but won't be able to beat bitcoin even though nothing is impossible in crypto world.",

But I don't really believe that Ethereum will be able to overtake Bitcoin. All these new upgrades of Ethereum will probably just make it a lot stronger especially compared to the rest of the altcoin market which are mostly made up of lower quality projects. But we'll never know for sure. My personal take is that it will not overtake Bitcoin but the gap will greatly be reduced.If this means anything, I guess it's a good time now to also stack ETH.",

Your expectation was not too high. Ethereum has ever overtaken bitcoin a few years ago but if bitcoin mining become even harder and i think that would be quite difficult for ethereum to over take bitcoin. The key was not post but how to prevent the inflation that happened in ethereum and bitcoin. That means if ethereum was getting fixed on its inflation and bitcoin was also doing it. I shall remind you that if bitcoin also also becom deflationary assets which lead if the total supply can be less and less.",

Do you expect Ethereum to jump more than twice just because it converts from a POW to POS?Let's be realistic. It will not happen and I believe it will never happen. Ethereum's price movement is still depends on how Bitcoin moves so don't think that Ethereum will take over Bitcoin just because of one single update. There is no guarantee as well that Ethereum's price will jump after the update/s.There are some aspects where Ethereum is better than Bitcoin and vice-versa but in terms of market cap, no one can take over Bitcoin.",
