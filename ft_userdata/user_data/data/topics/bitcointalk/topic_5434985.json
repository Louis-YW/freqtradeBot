He got a server from me at a 25 percent discount. After three days of use the server was banned because of his actions on the server. According to my rules in such a case there is no monyback.  View screenshot : https://ibb.co/wWt225cAfter persuasion I gave him a new server. The new server got banned again because of his actions.Where is the scam ? I gave you a server twice.Stop lying.",
