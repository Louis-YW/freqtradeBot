That is why he has six negative tags from DT members. He has come up with another way to scam people by claiming to share 50-50 with anyone that loan him €1000 to gamble on the game that he knows nothing about. OP,what makes you feel that forum members will fall for this your cheap trick and send you money. Impossible, it is better you do something good with your life than fooling yourself looking for someone's funds instead of yours. Big up mate. You don't borrow money to gamble.",

If you have nothing to lose, it is a scam.I dont know how some gamblers take bitcointalk, do we have a free money-making machine in here?Nothing is free even in free town, and ops should know that members of this forum are the most educated in terms of risk management and also trust evaluations, this is paramount because gambling is a higher risk and everyone here is warned about the danger of excessive gambling and how unpredictable gambling results can be, so for that how can we risk such a huge amount on gambling not to talk of bankrolling a user that already has red tags on their accounts. I don't know why some forks just randomly try out their luck, but mostly in a bad way that has triggered a higher degree of danger for cryptocurrency users, unlike the physical casinos where users can freely trace each other using their bank account, in cryptocurrency that is not untenable so ops should have thought of several factors before putting out such and offers to bitcoin talk community.",

I’m really interested to your offer.  Seriously, You have a lot of negative feedback and active flag to your reputation. There's no such thing as strategy to have a consistent profit on gambling or else it's not already gambling anymore. All gambling games are designed with house advantage.
