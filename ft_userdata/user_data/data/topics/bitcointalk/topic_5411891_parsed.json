And than you will understand the power of alts and how much people invest in it to earn passive income",

You will always find people making money from different things. Some are making money from HYIPs and Ponzis. Does that mean you should go for them? This is your call.Altcoins are not doubt profitable, but for the newbies going in to altcoins first would mean a bigger risk compared to bitcoin. Those altcoins which are old and are in the top10 list of CMC and CG, they can be tried but even then the possible profit with bitcoin is much higher if bought at a low price.QuoteSo I decided to come here to seek the views of experienced traders on the potentials of altcoins. Professional traders dont come to forums. Most of us are amateurs here but have been trading for a few years to know what is good for us.",

It's because too many altcoins will just give you the hype feeling but eventually, that's going to be gone and you'll never like it.Bitcoin, altcoins, or any projects, you need to pick the best that you can base on what you know about them.

As a beginner, I won't advise you to engage in trading because it requires lots of knowledge, experience, and patience. in your own case, I would recommend buying some of the trusted alts in the market if you really want to invest in alts or just buy btc to be on the safer side.  However, you can keep watching the alts market, pick some good alts on any of the tracking apps like coingecko on your watch list and watch their price movement, doing this can help you understand the market better and make your decision.

This are probably the top two ways of earning from Alt-coin.

That's why you have to do your research.# this is optional but I rather go for achievements that's Alts that has already proven itself to an extent rather than go for a new one because it's cheaper.",

Indeed, you should be careful and not in a hurry when trading on altcoins. Unlike Bitcoin, the large number of altcoins is indeed a very high risk, meaning if you choose the wrong altcoins for trading you can lose your money.If you hear that there are people who can make a profit from altcoins it's true, but what you have to understand is not all altcoins can give you profit.That's why before you decide to trade altcoins, I suggest you learn everything about the crypto world. So you understand how to choose altcoins that have the potential and can give you profit. My advice is just focus on trading on the top altcoins, it will give you a greater chance to make a profit. Because the demand is high, it makes it easier for you to trade. In addition, top altcoins are more predictable than new coins, where new coins are more volatile and risk being scams.",

Many investors earn but also many of them loss because they don't have patience and they can't control thier emotions when the market is bear because of greed so have patience and be good.",

But the thing is that you should know how to look for gems and that is the most difficult part. You really have to chase and do your own investigations. There could be websites that can help you out with that so again, you have to do a lot o leg work.
