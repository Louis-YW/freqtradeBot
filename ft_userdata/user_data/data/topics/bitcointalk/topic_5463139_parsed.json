  "content": "Since I registered in the forum I observed one of the things that brings setback to the beginners like me, I will like us to look into this tips of mine I seen like some of the barriers that contributes not to have a quality post. I don't know if someone have outlined this tips before, but this is what I think that is beginners problem of not having / making a quality posts. For we to make a quality posts we have to consider the following.● Sentence ● Spelling ● Research ● Environmental observations ● ArrangementsSentence I observed that for a post to be quality it's necessary that the Sentence of the composition or comment will be well arranged, and sometimes readers find it very difficult to read and understand the authors writing because of the Sentence or grammar used is well arranged and it can't be understandable. Most often what makes a posts a quality is because of the grammatical irony used. For we to improve our quality, we shall make our Sentence to be well understood by the readers, and if our Sentence is in order it will make our point to be understand by any reader.Spelling This are the most of the things in English language that we have correct properly because  Spelling  will mislead a reader to understand your point. In Spelling sometimes you will read a particular thread severally before you could understand what tye writer have in mind to offer you will be discouraged because the spelling of the terms used are not corresponding, spelling is the most thing a beginner suppose to avoid it's mistake, because when you spelled wrongly it will distract the readers and they will find it very difficult to understand your points. To improve in quality posting we have to correct ourselves from the error of spelling wrong words during making a post and it can be corrected or observed during posting when you preview and read twice before posting. Research A research is very important to anyone that wants to learn, what is keeping alot of us stagnant of growths in the forum is because of lack of research and lack of understanding, and I find out that lacks of research is what makes some of us to discuss out of point, a research is part of knowledge and also  a discovery, but many newbies including me don't research for what to post, before I don't research bur now I notice that to make a research is very important to everybody that is in bitcointalk.Environmental observations This should be one of the things we should do when we are newly registered in the forum, and secondly any newbie have to take it time to observed the environment being the walls of the forum to know the rules and regulations of the forum before posting, sometimes we missed out good information that already exists in the forum because of lack of observations and research, reading a previous threads will benefit us as beginners., and again all pinned post are important for the beginners, I read them and I seen that many of them are meaningful and it's not good to skip any of them in any board.Arrangements This is the summary of then all, because a quality post starts with a good sentence and good spelling that is well coordinated through the Arrangements, so if don't take your time to arrange your sentence or grammar your point will be pointless, because the reader will not understand you, so in every writing you most make a good arrangement of your worlds so that the readers will understand the authors or op point of discussion.When you check some posts that are difficult to understand, it's because of the Arrangements of the words are not proper, and that makes people to find it difficult to understand what the writer is saying. So in conclusion, I think arrangement  of words and spelling of words contributes meaningfully for communication and a quality posting and when writing is quality some people will plagiarised from your article.",

But, you should bear in mind that not everyone here in the forum is from an English speaking country. I have seen so many of my threads that I discovered so many blunders after going back to re-read what I wrote there still yet I received merit from it. The main aim is; were you able to deliver the message that you were trying to deliver even if your grammar was not correct? If yes then that’s fine. While for the spellings, sometimes if you’re accessing the forum through a mobile device autocorrect could play a part in your wrong choice of words or when typing with a keyboard on your pc you could mistakenly hit the wrong key and might still miss it when you’re proofreading your post.QuoteEnvironmental observations Unfortunately, not every newbie wants to research about the forum or navigate through the forum to figure out how things work around here.I remember coming to the forum and after making my first post here I took sometime off to learn about how posts are being made and during that period I discovered several tools like ninjastic.space, bpip.org, and also telegram notification bot all these contributed in my growth here in the forum but nowadays you’ll see newbies asking about something that’s self-explanatory, I’m not blaming them tho after all not everyone was built the same.",

My suggestion is to use a grammar tool like Grammarly for spelling mistakes. I also use it but sometimes it does not provide desired results so I have to ignore many suggestions. But, it does make a good impact plus sometimes you are trying to teach or explain someone something but you forget to use the comma or full stop in this way it becomes difficult for one to understand which sentence is related to which one. For that, you could use Quilbot's grammar mistake checker its best.But the thing is, even if a newbie or pro wants to explain or say something, I can at least understand what he/she is trying to say because of my reading experience. I didn't read this much posts or articles which I read here on BTT.",

There’s a software that can improve the quality of your writings including spelling and grammar while the content itself is only the user can improve it.You can have a quality post even with minor spelling and grammar error while your content is helpful and understandable since not all user here use English language as primary language.

I'm saying this because not all of us speak English as our first language. So yes we make mistakes. If you have doubt you can use any online tools to fix your sentences and spelling etc. Research in the most important part in BitcoinTalk. Before you make any posts you should always search the topic and research your way out. Most of the newbies don't do that. They just make a thread. Try to search first. Because there are many similar threads where your questions are already answered. If you try hard enough you'll find them. This forum is filled with knowledge if you know where to look for.Most importantly you should always abide by forum rules and regulations.

Even when the grammar is not properly arranged, it does not stop the main information that the OP is trying to pass. Trying to make your grammar perfect is another thing that usually leads some people to use AI to generate their sentences.In the aspect of research, I see this part as an important factor that contributes to someone's knowledge, and as such, it will also add to the kind of post they can compose, but research shouldn't be done by copying and pasting documents from a research article without dropping the source link, as that won't be considered research and will be called plagiarism.For arrangement, I also agree with you that most times the way and manner in which a thread is presented determines the kind of attention that will be given to that thread. Some users make the mistake of not paragraphing their write-up, which ends up making the entire thread appear like trash. But well-paraphrased words without any solid information on them do not still make the thread useful or qualify it to be considered a quality post.",

Research and application of your knowledge is the best tool to improve someone post quality.For now English speaking members even though there are local boards here that you could join, the general board still uses English and as such you can simply develop your language although not necessarily through using various English grammar links or paraphrasing sites like Quillbolt. But my major problem suggesting this is many people throughly abuses this by just copying texts and putting them up for paraphrasing. So even when you research make sure it is something you have gained valuable knowledge from and can pass the knowledge from your head out and not copying. There is no need necessarily to teach what you don’t understand. So for easy learning one should stick to board where they understand the language. Quote from: BitcoinPanther on August 13, 2023, 07:36:12 PMAside from the list stated by @OP, I believe one thing that can improve the quality of the post is the content and its connection to the thread topic.  One can say lots of beautiful and informative things but if it is not connected to the topic being discussed, it can still be considered as spam and more likely get deleted by the moderator.Most people go out of points on threads simply because they want to explain it too well or want a lengthy reply. Most of these I would say is sometimes associated with the quota of post to be meet for signature participants. Another thing I will add to OP lists is the organization of your thread do not just write wall of texts, present them well In paragraphs so as to be clear and readable. There is a way you organize a thread it will look attractive to reader and he will engage on it.",

I mean spelling can be easily corrected because if you spelled it wrong, it will show red zigzag lines below it. As for the 3, it isn't a necessary that you know it, as long as you know what you are saying towards a particular topic, I guess you can make a \"quality\" post from it.As for punctuations, for me it's a big factor especially the comma because that punctuation can change the idea behind a sentence. There was a time where I really need to study about punctuations because there are times where I'm wrong with it especially when I'm posting here. There might be times that I'm still wrong, but I can say that I'm better now in terms of using it.Overall, as long as you know what you are saying, you are knowledgeable with it, you have idea on what you're saying then I guess you can make a quality post off of it. Of course punctuations matters still.",

You have already provided an ideal example of how to quote by simply taking out the part that was irrelevant to your answer.At least as bad I personally consider pyramid quotes, i.e. quotes of quotes of quotes of ...

I'm easily captivated by page-turners, sentences well spiced. Nothing draws one's (I speak for myself here) attention better to a well written text than the flowery and well constructed structures embedded therein. However, despite how I love that to be; the article or posts made should be something constructive or well researched so that no one tries to spill a lie here. Nonetheless, I'm aware that there are posts which may not be that subtle but underneath them they've succinct messages and that could be because the posters aren't native speakers of English language. So, in all, I don't like criticizing people for not writing in seemingly good grammar especially when I see through their ingenuity. After all, English isn't the most spoken language in the world. Chinese is.By the way, \"Arrangements\" should encompass Sentence and Spelling.",
