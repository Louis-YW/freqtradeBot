I've sent a ticket to technical support, but I would like to know what this really means? Is there something I should know about this pool and what is going on?  Are you sure that you reached the minimum amount to be able to withdraw ? If not, and if you are in a hurry you can always rent some hashrate to be at 0.005 BTC but the risk is to lose some money with the hashrate rental (prices of the bids are quite high right now)here some infos from Antpool's FAQ : https://support.antpool.com/hc/en-us/articles/5985391549977-When-is-the-daily-payout-time-QuoteTo receive your payout, you will first need to configure a valid wallet under “Settings”.Check the minimum payout value in the “Settings” interface. Payment will only be initiated when your balance is above the minimum payout threshold.The default minimum payout value for Bitcoin is 0.005 BTC. You can modify the value under “Settings” according to your needs. The minimum payout value is 0.001 for LTC, ZEC and DASH, 0.01 for BCH, 0.1 for XMC and 1 for BTM. Earnings less than the minimum payout value cannot be paid. You can modify the payout value for all coins.ANTPOOL will process all accounts at 9 o'clock every day. If your balance has reached the minimum payment after today’s settlement (after 9 o’clock), payment will be processed next day.Antpool is there for years, and always been honnest with their miners, so you shouldn't worry. If you reached the minimum withdrawal amount and setup your account correctly, there is no reason that you won't receive your funds. They will answer to your customer support ticket but it can take some days.",

I agree with the second part, but I'm afraid I have to disagree with the first part, Antpool aka Bitmain's pool has been nothing but honest, they claim to have a 0% PPLNS payment system, and to this point in time, most users still believe they are mining there for free, what Bitmain keeps 'intentionally' hiding from them is the fact that while the pool doesn't charge them mining fees on the block reward itself, they keep 100% of the transaction fees, that it could be anything from 0.1% to 10%.So do I think Antpool will steal op's funds, probably not, but do I think Antpool is honest? hell no, no one should keep more than 1 day's worth of mining rewards or the minimum payout with any pool out there, I rather end up with a ton of small outputs and pay more fees than have a pool store my earnings.",

When I said that Antpool is \"honest\", I didn't express myself clearly enough. I meant only the payouts, meaning that yes, indeed they will pay OP if he has reached the minimum necessary.However, as you say, their policy regarding fees (especially now!) is not clean. Also, personally I would tend to avoid a pool that holds 20% of the total hashrate of the network.Like Foundry, Binance Pool, Antpool are in my opinion enemies of BTC. They mine empty blocks, and contribute to a strong centralization of the hashrate. I prefer to mine on small pools, like at Kano, ckpool, or mmpool (before it makes an exit scam, unless the hacker was real? We'll never know). I understand that some people don't want to mine solo, or don't want to wait 1 or 2 years for a block to be solved in PPLNS to receive their funds, but in this case, IMO, they should consider secondary size pools like EMCD for example.",
