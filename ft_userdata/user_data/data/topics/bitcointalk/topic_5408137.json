I later discovered that I was naive at that time, the latest development/revolution in Bitcoin made me ever feel bad and I had lost a lot of opportunities in the past to this.The lesson learned was that it is better to move closer to what is new to us than to be condemning it from afar. Can you imagine that despite having enough money to invest in the cryptocurrency between 2019 -2021, I was adamant that I wouldn't because I believed Bitcoin aids legalities like trafficking, money laundering, terrorism, activities of drug barons, and many more. I forgot to think that as it has its advantages, it also has its disadvantages, no system works perfectly.Thanks to the present-day awareness, development and regulations that make it clear that Bitcoin is not as porous as I thought. 95% of my only transactions are now crypto-based.I love to read your stories about Bitcoin adoption too!",

First they are centralized platforms. You don't have keys of your Bitcoin. After you make a deposit to their platform, you can assume you lose control of your Bitcoin forever. Will you get it back by withdrawal? It depends on that platform, are they legit or scam? Will they get bankrupted?Trading is hard to help you get rich. Investment can help you to get rich but if you invest seriously, you should not leave your Bitcoin on any exchange.Recommended walletsAnd another bad thing is with Forex, you can over leverage that will cause liquidation of your capital.",

Bitcoin development is endless, it will continue well into the future, on that there is no missed opportunity, the possibilities are endless with this network, it matters less when you join.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on July 30, 2022, 10:51:08 AMThe lesson learned was that it is better to move closer to what is new to us than to be condemning it from afar.

I forgot to think that as it has its advantages, it also has its disadvantages, no system works perfectly.None of that is a disadvantage of bitcoin, fiat currencies have aided illegal activities for as long as possible, and it used for money laundering than bitcoin, if any currency should count that as a disadvantage of it, then it will be paper money. Disadvantages of bitcoin will be things like: (though they are subjective, and have advantages even in their disadvantages)VolatilityScalabilityLimited adoption for now, and fewer places to spend it.Responsibility and risk go hand in gloves (many folks take it to be too risky to protect their funds themselves, so they don't like bitcoin for that because they don't wanna take responsibility).",

I guess those you describe as very smart and they know what there choices should be. Opportunities is still there, bitcoin is still fairly young as compared to stocks and other traditional financial markets. And with that said, this is the perfect opportunity, even if the price is around $20k, this is still at a discount and maybe in the next bull run, we might it at least $100k, just saying.",

So don't be surprised if in this part of the world many countries are starting to adopt bitcoin, because they all see great potential in bitcoin.",

I Functioning as a payment system is actually the main usecase of Bitcoin, as it was meant to be a P2P payment tool, so you were using Bitcoin regardless that you didn't agree with it. That's a plus, cause it gives the impression that bitcoin was the best, and simplest option for such payments.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on July 30, 2022, 10:51:08 AMI was adamant that I wouldn't because I believed Bitcoin aids legalities like trafficking, money laundering, terrorism, activities of drug barons, and many more.

At the end of the last century, people looked with skepticism at home PCs and the Internet, without which almost everyone's life is now unthinkable. The same is happening with bitcoin, whose ranks of users are increasing. But this process is hampered by the negative information background spread by traditional media: television, radio, newspapers and everything else that is already loses its power. Most people find it difficult to break through this layer of negativity and \"what a bad BTC\" tale. OP's story only strengthened the idea of this. Only those who have been told the truth by friends and relatives, or sources of information on the Internet, most often from crypto-enthusiasts, decide to personally come into contact with technology of bitcoin. But the best place to bypass misinformation about btc is this forum.",

This is a valuable lesson and one people who possess the bad character of hasty condemnation/criticism without first understanding what it is they are criticizing should learn from. IMO people who normally act in such manner do it out of ignorance and always want to get people to share their opinions with them. If you happen to meet some of these individuals and don't have a mind of your own, your opinions on certain things can be affected. I imagine how many persons whom OP may have unknowingly during his time of ignorance turned into dislikers of bitcoin as well from his open condemnation.
