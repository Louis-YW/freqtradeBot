I'm really interested in knowing how you intend to stay ahead of the curve, knowing that loads of P2E games exist in the space and investors need to be super convinced about what difference exists in the P2E game you are focused on as there exists too many P2E games in the crypto space and many of them don't go beyond the first 6 months of their existance.Beyond pitching the idea to big VCs it will also be ideal if your P2E game gives a different context from the general view of P2E, this will make the project unique in its competitive disposition.",
