However, you must always remember the basics of investment - portfolio diversification, own research, as well as control of market trends.Even without taking into consideration on the history. You can easily what's gonna happened by understanding the investor's thinking towards crypto projects. Most of the crypto investors want a quick profit that's why they are always FOMO buying to ride the hype of the project and then move on once they already reached the target profit since project development hype always has an expiration due to its slow development nature. So you will get much larger profit if you will invest on new project that surpass the existing top project because the tendency is investors will just change boat and ride the much newer one that has the hype.",

Cos I plan to look into new projects for the future instead, what do you think?It is because many of them are prone in rugpulling. It's true that many of the top altcoins now are likely new but they're launched a few years ago. I get the idea of your thought that new projects are going to replace a lot from the top. But that shouldn't also give you the confidence that all of them will be there. Just think of it that a few of them will be at the top but also many of them are likely have no chance at all and might even caught as a scam.",

Cos I plan to look into new projects for the future instead, what do you think?Just because it happened a few years ago does not mean that it will happen again the same way in the futures. That is also the reason why i think that all that trend analysis stuff and other predictions that are based on the past can never really tell what will happen in the future. Maybe they can give a slight indication in what overall direction the market will move but nothing more than that.In a few years the top 20 of the coinmarketcap ranking will definitely look a little different than now. That is just part of that industry and within 4 or 5 years there will definitely be a few new projects that will come up and move to the top 20 relatively quickly like Solana for example did it last years.Other projects like Shiba Inu will probably not be in the top 20 anymore in a few years.",

While there are many scam projects that can be found almost every day, both of them cannot be predicted with certainty whether it is potential or it is just a scam.",

If you managed to find a good and unique project, then that is a good sign and opportunity. Just beware of the other scam projects honestly nowadays I cannot tell exactly which one is a real project and which one is not.",

Cos I plan to look into new projects for the future instead, what do you think?Take a closer look at why you think it's bad, see for yourself how you understand it, and whether your experience with this market is real. Of course, most of what I've seen after every trend is an exaggeration of the future when they offer nothing but quick gains and losses, we get carried away. during those trends when it is easy to make a profit. But you need to think more about what you will gain and what you will lose when buying them. Having an easy strategy for these will reduce the risk of loss even more. I myself now spend some time researching new projects and looking for profit opportunities they bring, but basically we should still hold more BTC. Find a way to increase your BTC over time.",

The past condition doesn't merely suggest the future will be the same, especially if you barely researching what is the new project that trying to solve.2. Note the possible economic/market downturn that spread around recently. Taking the bigger picture, a lot of big companies are laying off their employees for efficiencies and some big investors are drawing back from spending funds recklessly.3. Separating the wheat from the chaff is a monstrous job. Do you have the capacity for finding which project is a hidden gem?",

Can't say that investing in new projects is a bad idea, it would be correct to say that you can invest in new projects if you have enough knowledge and skills to choose from a variety of new projects one, or maybe several of those projects, that can grow and develop to get into the top 100. It's not easy otherwise everyone would be able to do it. If you want to try how well you can do it, then do it with a small amount so that in case of failure, the losses are minimal.",
