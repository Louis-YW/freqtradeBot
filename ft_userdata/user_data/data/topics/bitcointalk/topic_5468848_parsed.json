  "content": "It is quite understanding how our names reflects in our behaviors and life style. In the ancient days our parents gives us names according to the circumstances that surrounded our birth. Like for example in igbo land when I woman experiences labour while walking along the road, when the child is born they will name the child as good road ( uzorma ), when a woman experiences labour while she embarked on a journey, as soon as the child is born they will name the child as good journey ( ijeoma ). Then when a child is born in a wealthy home , they name them good wealth ( Akumma ). It is important to give our children good names irrespective of the circumstances that surrounds their birth as the names we give them can also reflect and influence their attitudes in the society.Further more, a good names brings about positive vibes as if a child is given a good name and he/she begins to behave or act strange people when start telling them to act according to their name so when the child recalls the meaning of their names it can automatically make them change their behavior.Even the holy book ( bible ) made us to know in the book of Proverbs 22:1 that a good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, loving favor rather than silver and gold. So when you have a good name and you are acting according to your name people will start to emulate from you and even parents will start to give their children good name because of you.So we have to imbibe the habit of giving our children good names as life is a reflection of who we are and who we are is justified by our actions and our behavior in the society and bearing a good name is also advisable.",

Many people in the society answers a good name but has nothing to write home about. While some has bad name but good character. Dey said \"Good name is better than silver and gold\" the good name in this context is your reputation and intergrity which your linage has kept.In some community there is a surname you'll call, they will tell you there history. If it's a stealing accusation dey will say there is no thief in that family or no criminal record in respective of there various names. it's quite unfortunate that many people fall victim of there name and people now see it as there name is the root cause of there problem which is not so. And mean while for the aspect of those names given to us by our parents those days according to event, if you check those names has gradually vanish because the world is now advanced. No body can give birth in London and call his son (LONDON) or even give birth in festive period and name the child according to the festival name. Even if it's still active it wouldn't be like before probably from%100 has fall down to %40 or less",

      "body": "Good Name is definitely a good thing, I mean, as parents, it's a duty we owe to our children to give them a good name, and not just give them a good name, but also ensure that we encourage and help them to live their life in such a way it will allow their good name reflect in their lifestyle, since it popularly said that a good name is better than silver and gold, though the good name meant in this adage is not actually a good name but a good character, for it is a good character that the society refer to' as one having a good name.. For naming your child God or Jesus will not make that child behave like God or Jesus, it is the training and help given to that child that will help him or her to grow up and have a character that is close or near to resemblance of the character he or she is named after, for example, I've heard and read stories of people who were named jesus after birth, but they grow up to become criminals, kidnappers, set of demonic individuals causing several types of havoc and unrest in their then society.. So giving a child a good name is not where it ends, making sure that child grow up wit the best of training, education, encouragement and help is what will help the child live up to the good name he or she was named.",

      "body": "Bearing a good name is something worth it. It gives a positive vibes around you and wherever you find yourself but it does not just end in answering a good name. One can answer a good name but what are the attributes of the person bearing the name. These days, people do not look into names again but the person in question and how the bearer of the name tends to play out in the society. This is where I keyed into @Fivestar4everMVP idea and opinion.It is not all about giving a child a good name but the process involved in bringing up that child who bears that name to replicate or behave accordingly with the name they bear. Parents have a role to play when grooming their child to becoming reasonable people in the society. Every parent desire their child to be outstanding in the society and at such should be ready to do the needful by training their child to be in tandem with the name they bear.Nevertheless, the bible says in Proverbs 22:6 \"train up a child in the way he should grow and when he grows he would never depart from it.\"  This is amongst the key tips to making sure a child grows and be a reflection of the name they bear. This goes along way to say that parents have a role to play in the life of their children till their maturity and age when they know the good and the bad.",

Instilling self discipline can go as far as making them conscious of their acts and engagements to doing the right thing, obeying and following established rules and be modest in the society.With the aspect of parents being too busy and careless of their children, I think that is worth looking into because these days parents barely make out time for their kids all in the name of work and most times they are not available at their child's disposal leaving them with their nanny and caregivers which those employed staff can not really play that parental role in the life of the child.  Parents should not forget their roles in the life of their children and should be able to instill discipline so they don't go astray.",

Parents have more responsibilities than they could possibly imagine, more work during the adolescent phase and ensure to hold their children tight with discipline and principles. The children are enormous blessings from GOD and they've always been the amazing things to be grateful about on mother earth. In everything you do, always make sure your child bears one of the sweet name which will bring inbound favors and greatness.",
