But given this kind of amount, it seems normal that it can take some time to do extra checks. Duelbits is legit so I would give them some more time and hopefully they process your withdrawal quickly.",

Your history shows how you manage to deposit and withdraw that same amount in the past without any problem so just be patient because they might just be investigating you for coin mixing or something since your account history shows the same pattern but rest assured that they will not gonna scam you no matter how huge your balance because they have a very solid reputation here.You are wagering huge amount so I'm surprised that you are just being KYC now while you keep deposit and withdraw multiple times with that amount.",

OP, it is doubtful how this can be when  without no much evidence back your accusations. Why not do a review on your  complaint.The question for you is, is there a casino that will provide ETA when processing KYC from its players? To be honest, I have never come across it because the support agent is only in charge of answering questions from users and there are other departments that will process KYC, withdrawals, and include inspections when there are suspicions about their players. I doubt they don't have the ability to pay players who make withdrawals because Duelbits sponsors football clubs in the English premier league and of course, the value is bigger. So besides the Op being able to post in the scam accusations section, it is also hoped that he will be patient waiting for his complaint to be processed by the casino, if Op is still able to log into his account it could be better to also include evidence from his game history to strengthen existing evidence.",

I know it’s a big amount, and when you wait 48 hours+ while waiting, it feels uneasy. Moreover OP you also mentioned that you have provided them with your KYC. So as I can see from the screenshot, you have made 2 times 500k withdrawal before this, so at that time, they didn’t ask for KYC? Did you cheated somehow in the game and won now? Or are you sure you have not violated any terms of services of the site? If not try to wait for a week and see the status of your situation. If still no positive response then create a thread in Scam Accusations board.",

The other $500k withdrawal request, if I am judging correctly, was about 4 times within 2 days, which is 2 million dollars withdrawn from an account. This might either be because the other withdrawal was not a success, which they later reversed to the account, or the other few were successful before the other recent withdrawal. If they are successful, it's also enough reason for a new withdrawal delay. This is an online casino we are talking about here, and only a few online casinos can pay this huge amount of money to their customers within 48 hours. I am not saying the withdrawal was purposefully suspended, but we could also look at it from that angle too. And the technical team will be working all hands on deck to see if there is any suspicious gaming behavior. They will always come up with a solution, I believe. The OP just has to give them time. Judging by the amount, I know it warrants panic, but panic can't resolve anything here either. Let's just wait for the Dullbit representative to come and explain to the OP.",
