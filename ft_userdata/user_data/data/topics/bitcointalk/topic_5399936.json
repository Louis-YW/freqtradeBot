So the better move is do a dca on it so you could average your buy even its go down. No one can predict accurately the bottom unless you are a fortune teller and most especially only use money you arent scared to lose cause it may go down so its quite dangerous for you to use hard earned money.",

However, investing in bitcoin on a regular basis, regardless of the course, may be a wiser move than waiting for a better day.Sometimes bitcoin surprises us very much, after which we again hear such regrets from people who complain that they did not have time to buy it at the best price.",

Predicting the future price is very hard to do but having faith in Bitcoin price will grow more in the future is your only weapon if you are planning to invest in it long term. Remember that those who are faithful to Bitcoin in long term get the most benefits.",

Rich people buy when it's cheap. Poor people, at times like this, panic and stop buying or even sell at a loss. I am not telling you this as an investment recommendation but if you do some research on the subject you will see that it is as I say.",

      "body": "Usually this is the problem of everyone who wants to get the idea if the current price is the dip. But, you'll never know if the price is already the bottom of it unless we see that it's moving up ahead and leaving the current price level.There's a solution to this but this would depend on how much budget you've got. I think others have been doing already the DCA on this problem you've addressed. So if you think that the current price is low and you worry that there will be a lower price soon but you truly want to buy, just buy like a portion of it. Maybe 5% or 10%, 15% or 20% depending on how much you're willing to buy for the moment. And then just do it again if the price goes lower. This sounds easy and not a good idea for the others, but is there any other thing you could do upon spotting the lowest?",

The price is constantly changing, so the value of bitcoin you would get for say, 1k usd now, is not the same you would get in a month or even the next day.Quote from: Wincob on May 24, 2022, 04:58:33 AMI stopped buying because it looks like Bitcoin dips isn't over, imagine buying at 19k per BitcoinImagine buying at 39k usd instead of the current price of 29k? That is the risk you bear when you try to speculate the price and predict the bottom, it can go up or down. Historically, you could have bought one bitcoin at 1000 dollars, or 100 or even 10, so rather than trying to save up on some investment money, It seems better to buy when you can and hold as it would not matter much in 2,5 or 10 years what price level you bought at.Quote from: Wincob on May 24, 2022, 04:58:33 AMI think the whole idea of investment is when you are buying not running after the best coins in the market, buying them cheap is better or I don't get it?.When to buy is important, but what could be more important is knowing how much to invest and building patience to hodl through changes in the price.",

I stopped buying because it looks like Bitcoin dips isn't over, imagine buying at 19k per Bitcoin, I think the whole idea of investment is when you are buying not running after the best coins in the market, buying them cheap is better or I don't get it?.It depends on how long you want to hold bitcoin, if you buy now, you and you want to hold it for like three years, it is a good idea. You can use different strategies and approaches. Like dividing the money you want to use to buy bitcoin into like four, setting plan to buy more if the price continue to decrease. If the lowest price you want is $19000, the price of bitcoin now is at $30000. You can buy at $25000, $23000, $21000 and $19000 if bitcoin possibly fall to that price.There will be a time bitcoin price will decrease more, but you will have to wait for months for this to happen or just invest and see your money grow within 3 years from now is my personal advice.",

As scary as that is, it won't be out of place if it happens. Though I believe that won't happen. My confidence that it won't happen stems from the fact of the involvement of institutional investors who are long term in their investment approach. This will, in a way, help steady the tide of further collapse of the Bitcoin market. However, whatever happens during this bear I will remain unfazed. I've seen worse in this industry to make me panic now. I guess that should also be the attitude of users here. OP, you can DCA or you pend around where you think the market can revert. Don't wait for an imaginary bottom. It doesn't exist in the real sense.",

From there, you should know when you can buy bitcoins.We don't know if this bitcoin decline will occur because there is no sign of bitcoin's movement, but we can analyze where the trend is from the bitcoin price movement. We can decide whether to buy or wait a little longer because the trend will fall again. But it's better if you buy bitcoins at every lowest price level because that will allow you to have more bitcoins.",

What is it - accumulation or distribution?  That's a very difficult question.  These questions are called $1,000,000 questions.  A trader who answers this question correctly can make huge profits.  The price of Bitcoin has recently fallen well below $30,000.  However, the price then returned to just below $30,000 again.  What will happen next?  Price increase?  Price drop?  If you are a long-term investor, then in my opinion you can buy a certain amount of Bitcoins.  If you are a trader, then the answer to the question is not so clear.  In my opinion, even in a bear market, the $30,000 price of Bitcoin is quite reasonable and fair.",

However, this method is tricky, you need to keep track of the price of the coin you are buying and be sure to get the best value for your crypto investment. Even if the price goes down, that is not a reason to sell it if you believe in the coin's growth. Wait for the correction and at that point you will find that it was a good call and will likely have huge returns in the future. Selling at a profit is a good idea to rebalance your investment.",

If you keep on hesitating when to buy, you might lost the opportunity in front of you. So just do DCA, buying at every price drop particularly if you are waiting for the best buy. No one holds what the future of bitcoin, whether it will drop its price more or recover eventually, then at least you already accumulated bitcoin in your portfolio and that's the good thing about DCA. You never lose anyway, but the fact that you already bought bitcoin and prefer to hold it for long term, then there's good profits waiting for you ahead.",
