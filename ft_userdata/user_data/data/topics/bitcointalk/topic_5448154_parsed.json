  "content": "I saw this announcement just popped up on my screen, and as I used the forum search, I did not see that it had been posted, so I decided to create the topic.\"The Crypto Marchants\" have designed a waterproof crypto wallet case as an additional option for crypto users to protect their hardware wallets and offline cold storage devices.Hardware wallets or some other cold storage device can get distroyed through external factors like fire or water, but the advantages are that even if a hardware wallet gets distroyed and the crypto user still has their private key, they can still import their address to a safe wallet or possibly buy a new hardware wallet and import the address to get back their coins. So guys, do you think the new waterproof case is really so necessary for use?QuoteIn terms of hard cases, The Crypto Merchant offers a few case options. The Casematix Waterproof Hard Case features a military-grade shell, waterproof O-ring lining, and air-pressurization seal, and it's capable of holding hardware wallets from Ledger, Trezor, and more. Another option is the Casematix Hardware Wallet Travel & Protection Case, which offers similar security features as the Hard Case, only in a more compact and portable way.",

The image is very bigger and that means it can be sighted very easily wherever you kept it. It is a nice development. Since it is a new production, it would be hard to get it everywhere but it might be in specific location in the globe. With this case the hardware Wallet can be kept inside and hide it in a place that you won't forget. And in any place you drop it, the hardware Wallet would not be affected since the main wallet is protected by the case.",

In as much as we keep our hardware wallet safe, no one is too careful and no one is also too careless, so in my opinion the water proof case is a great idea for those who tend to send all their funds into a hardware wallet and hold on for long without even touching or constantly visiting to check how safe the water is. With this case protection, owners of hardware wallets are guaranteed rust free, water damage, and some kind of slit break, but unless it's intentional, I don't think that case can easily be broken, The advantage of this water-proof wallet is higher than the possible damage it can cause, of which I doubt there will even be any.",

This waterproof HardwareWallet case can be used to store other wallet security devices, even your security keys. When you decide to hide the case in any water storage facility in your house, the case makes it easy for you to freely do that without it being distroyed, and just as @wind_fury said, you can store it in a toilet water tank. It can also be hidden in a kitchen draining pipe.",

I am sure you understand all this and therefore, depending on the living conditions, such cases can be useful and help keep the device in working order. It will be very sad if you urgently need access to your crypto assets, but HW device turns out to be out of order.Of course, what OP offers is a good offer, but I found it cheaper (2 times) with a lazy search on the well-known Chinese site - item 1. It looks just as ugly (is the appearance so important), but at least cheaper (as always, merchant sellers sin with inflated prices), performs its protective functions (didn't check - I don’t know), the seller will not recognize your personal data as the owner of the hardware wallet (this you can buy a case for a regular flash drive, right).I see it like this (put one into the other): hardware wallet -> waterproof case -> fireproof case -> shockproof (metal?) case - and then you can rest easy knowing your assets are safe. Oh yes, I almost forgot:  item 2 - fireproof case, for example.As a shockproof case, any box made of durable metal with thick walls (it would be better if there are additional stiffening ribs inside), such as stainless steel, but not soft aluminum, can be used. In fact, shockproof and waterproof cases can be combined, it is enough to make the metal case airtight (waterproof gasket).P.S. This is not an advertisement for the well-known Chinese site of all sorts of junk.",

I would love to watch a stress test video to see how it copes with fires, acid, being dropped from high up, etc.  But unfortunately the company doesn't have any videos; they have only given a few descriptions of the stress or tension the case can withstand. I am not against the use of this kind of case, but I don't really need it now, but if I should buy one, it would be of the same choice like what you think. At least a case that is resistant to every factor that could damage the hardware wallet, such as water, fire, heat, etc.But anyways, the waterproof case could still save crypto users from the chance of their hardware wallet or private key device being distroyed should it come in contact with water or any external factors that can distroy it apart from fire.Quote from: SFR10 on April 10, 2023, 06:20:17 PMThe main issue with almost all of these so-called waterproof cases is the fact that they're \"only\" water-resistant as opposed to being waterproof [in other words, they can only provide protection to a certain degree (ignore anyone that says otherwise)]!That's true, the security measures are just to some certain level, unless you go with a case that can really withstand all the possible factors that can destroy the hardware wallet. I don't need these cases now because I don't yet have a hardware wallet, but it's good that I am already learning how to protect a hardware wallet and which case is best to use.",

It is not necessary to make it resistant to shocks because you shouldn't be leaving your HW outside on the ground for a lightning strike in the first place.And how do you propose to combine fire resistance with water resistance? It seems to me that this will not be easy to combine in one case. Those materials that provide good protection against the penetration of moisture and water, most likely will not have the ability to withstand the high temperatures that occur during combustion. Simply, these materials (like silicone) will melt or burn.To protect your HW device1 from lightning (although I didn’t mention anything about lightning before), make a lightning rod.

It's not even that you can drop hardware wallet (ordinary foam rubber, which will be sheathed on the inside of the case, will help here). Shock resistance is needed so that the case can withstand the fall of heavy objects on it. For example, bricks or blocks from breaking walls during an earthquake (or other force majeure circumstances). Of course, this will not protect against very heavy objects, such as concrete walls or floor slabs of apartments, but additional protection will never be superfluous.In general, it is impossible to protect yourself from all 33 misfortunes, but you can protect yourself from some of it by choosing a certain type of case (or several). Which one will depend on individual preferences and the environment (situation). Don't look for universal solutions.",
