  "content": "Introducing Echangere a brand new Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Cryptocurrency MarketplaceHello everybody,I am really glad to be able to introduce you all to Echangere. After 3 years of development, we are ready to release it to the world. It is a brand-new Peer-to-Peer Cryptocurrency Marketplace where you can buy, trade and sell many cryptocurrencies for fiat or other cryptocurrencies.Echangere exists of 2 main sections for buying, trading and selling; the Peer-to-Peer section and the Market section.Peer-to-Peer:On here you can do Fiat-to-Crypto, Crypto-to-Fiat and Crypto-to-Crypto.How does it work?From a seller POV:You as a seller create an offer, and it then gets listed for sale. When a buyer is found an escrow starts. All information needed for the trade to occur is prefilled by the buyer and seller, so no chatting or other communication is needed to complete the trade. The escrow guides both parties on all things needed to do, in order to complete the escrow.From a buyer POV:You find an offer that suits you and buy it. An escrow is started and when we have received the funds in escrow you get notified on how to proceed.Advantages compared to other P2P services here:The seller does not need to deposit any cryptocurrency before a buyer is found. The seller can do it, but it is completely optional.Disadvantages of the Peer-to-Peer section:An escrow takes time in order to complete.Market:On here you can do Crypto-to-Crypto.How does it work?You deposit cryptocurrency to your Market wallet and can then trade it for other cryptocurrencies instantly.From a seller POV:You deposit the cryptocurrency you want to sell, then create an offer with what you want to receive. It the gets listed for sale, a buyer now buys the offer or part of it (depending on the offer type (static/dynamic)) and you instantly receive the payment cryptocurrency to your Market wallet and can withdraw at any point.From a buyer POV:You deposit the cryptocurrency you want to pay with, then find an offer you like and buy it or parts of it (depending on the offer type (static/dynamic)). You receive the bought cryptocurrency instantly to your Market wallet and can withdraw at any point.Besides this we also have the concept of Ranks:Ranks gives users benefits such as lower fees, higher search ranking, an exclusive badge etc. and of course supports the platform.Ranks can be bought on a monthly or annually plan and only paid with using cryptocurrency as we believe in order for cryptocurrency to become adopted you need to be able to spend it, and what better payment method then cryptocurrency?You can try out a rank using this voucher code: WELCOME – it gives 1 month free of any rank.If you like it, and enjoy the platform then here is a 15% off voucher code for any rank, any duration: WELCOME15So all in all here are the Pros and Cons:What are the pros?Free depositsFree withdrawalsNo minimum withdrawals amountsSome of the lowest fees available for P2P tradingNo need to deposit before a buyer is foundWhat are the cons?Not mobile friendly – an app will be developedCurrently only 2 fiat payment methods – more will come with timeTo finish off, I will tell you a short background on how it all started:I (OP) in 2020 thought to myself that a new kind of P2P service was needed, a service that wasn’t fixed on anonymity, but more a marketplace for everybody to exchange cryptocurrency easily with all kinds of payment methods including cryptocurrencies. Where everyday people with ease could acquire cryptocurrency or exchange it, without having to know how a more proper trading platform works (CEXs). People do however know how a marketplace works. What we believe is the problem with getting in and out of crypto using CEX’s is that you typically need to use a bank transfer or a credit card. However, all kinds of other payment methods exists and these needs a place for people to use. So, with that in mind I pitched the idea to my father, and we started development of Echangere. We wanted to focus on being user-friendly and demystifying cryptocurrency and especially P2P services. Development took a little longer than expected, but I was doing school full-time and my father working a full-time job. But we got here in the end, and are excited for you all to try it.We look forward to (hopefully) welcoming a lot of you to Echangere, and if you have any questions feel free to reach out.Best regardsTB and CBWebsite: https://echangere.comShort URL: https://ech.cxSupport Center:  https://support.echangere.comEmail: support@echangere.comPS:Please let me know if I need to move this thread to another place here on Bitcoin Talk. I assumed this would be the right place for this post.",

We believe honesty and transparency is the way forward if we are to bring cryptocurrency to the masses.

If you create an account, you will see there is a lot more to the platform as logged in.We are aware that other p2p platforms have shutdown lately, however we still feel like Echangere has its place among the current once as our approach is a little different compared to others.We hope to welcome you on Echangere Quote from: Darker45 on June 03, 2023, 03:21:49 AMWhat do you exactly mean by \"an escrow takes time in order to complete?\" And how are the funds held by the escrow? Sometimes, I wonder how a peer-to-peer platform is really peer-to-peer when there is in fact a centralized entity in between facilitating transactions. The buyer and the seller are not even in contact with each other. It actually doesn't differ much from a centralized buying and selling platform.When saying the escrow takes time, we mean that both parties of the escrow needs to do some actions in order for the escrow to complete. These actions could take some time, fx deposit funds to the escrow, make the payment etc. So compared to our Market section where the funds are in your market wallet ready to withdraw right after you buy or sell an offer, then an escrow takes longer.The difference between a peer-to-peer platform and a centralized is that on a peer-to-peer platform it is marketplace, so no trade occurs before a buyer has bought the offer. On a centralized platform the matching engine takes care of peoples buy/sell orders by matching them and executing the trade.We hope to welcome you on Echangere Quote from: noorman0 on June 03, 2023, 04:04:11 AMQuote from: Husires on June 03, 2023, 01:03:47 AM-snip-and Legal pageI don't think a service with non-KYC as the main offering would need a legal page, because it also has to point out that the exchange is under a jurisdiction where non-KYC guarantees will be compromised at some point (eg regulations suddenly become strict) or users have doubts since beginning.But it's strange, if at the same time this site also serves the trading market (like CEX) where actually the service owner as a third party can also manage user funds that are stored while this practice must be under the auspices of the law.I want to know about this more.We are sorry if we did not communicate properly, but we are not a non-KYC platform; we do require people to input the most basic information and verify with a phone. Then depending on the user’s activity on the platform further information may be required.We hope to welcome you on Echangere Quote from: Findingnemo on June 03, 2023, 05:42:13 PMImpressions:1.

Your impressions are correct, but we just started out, so as you say liquidity comes with users. Touching on KYC requirements then once you create the account you will be taken through a mandatory setup, where you need to fill in the most basic information and verify a phone before you can use the platform.We hope to welcome you on Echangere Quote from: Potato Chips on June 03, 2023, 11:45:05 PMQuote from: OPTwo fiat payment methods will surely hold you down since less options = less likely users.

One way to alleviate is to implement a feature that enables people to import their reputation from other exchanges.We agree that 2 fiat payment methods are not a lot, but then we have 5 cryptocurrencies fully integrated. We will integrate more fiat payment methods with time, and we completely agree this is something that we will prioritize. If you have any suggestions on a fiat payment method you would like to see added feel free to reach out.We know PayPal can be viewed as high risk, this is why when people are doing PayPal as payment the instructions are very clear on what has to happen during the escrow.We hope to welcome you on Echangere We thank all of you for your feedback and suggestions it is all very appreciated. And once again we hope to welcome you all to Echangere.",

Can you mention how much the exchange fees (in percentage) for regular users? Are there any other fees that need to be known?We do indeed have free withdrawals, but you do pay the blockchain/network fee (we show an estimation of what it will be when withdrawing). You can find the fees listed on the frontpage or under the Subscription section when you are logged in along with all your other benefits.Here is a list of our current fees for a regular user (free user):Peer-to-Peer buyer: 0.70%Peer-to-Peer seller: 0.90%Market: 0.40%The reason we have free withdrawals, is that in theory holding funds should always be a liability for any marketplace/exchange, since it is just liquid funds sitting there not making them money and not being listed for sale. Besides that, we also want to encourage people to do self-custody and the best way to do that, is to make it as hassle free as possible to withdraw cryptocurrency from our marketplace.We hope this answers your questions, if you have any others feel free to let us know.We hope to welcome you on Echangere",

If you create an account, you will see there is a lot more to the platform as logged in.We are aware that other p2p platforms have shutdown lately, however we still feel like Echangere has its place among the current once as our approach is a little different compared to others.We hope to welcome you on Echangere Not only that, but your site contains a lot of tracking tools for Google which indicates that the site was compiled rather than written from scratch.Let's take as an example that you have a link on Github even though the link is empty https://github.com/echangereTherefore, you may need to re-check and delete the incomplete things.The https://echangere.com/termsofservice page is general and does not indicate professionalism. no new users have been registered since the last time you visited the site, and therefore you should check with the marketing team.We do indeed use Google Analytics, it is a very convenient tool for getting information, but that does not mean a website is not made from scratch. Because our website and everything that goes into it, is made from scratch.Our GitHub is empty right now, in the future we hope to release tools and other stuff, but we see nothing wrong with having a profile.The ToS page is very simple, but it is a ToS page after all.We agree growth is slow but we are also brand new, and people do not know about us yet. We are only 2 people working on it, so there is no marketing team, only us.We hope to welcome you on Echangere",
