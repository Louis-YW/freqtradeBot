I believe that these two genre are not based on luck but skill that's why I ask this question, since most gambling projects have games that are based on luck like roulette and others. I don't know about those project you are asking about but sports betting and horse racing are often mentioned as two types of gambling where someone with enough talent and effort to study the field, as well as good bankroll management, can win in the long run. I don't know about horse racing but it seems that sports betting has become more difficult over the years as the bookmakers have been adjusting the odds.The other game you would be missing would be poker, where it is possible to win, but as in the other two cases it is not easy. In the case of roulette and casino games, if you play, it is better to consider them as entertainment, because in the long term you will not be able to beat the House Edge, although you may get some jackpots in the short term.",

I believe that these two genre are not based on luck but skill that's why I ask this question, since most gambling projects have games that are based on luck like roulette and others. In some games, there is some level of skills involved. Let me explain with two examples:1) Sports betting or prediction: This is very much popular in my country and it has resulted in lot of companies or websites offering these games. It was challenged by some people in my country that it is like lottery and court gave decision in favor of websites. It was because court was of opinion that some skill is required to make these predictions. It is obvious that if you have done good research about the players and team involved, pitch conditions and many other things, then only you can make correct decisions. 2) Rummy: Same way as above, court also ordered that online rummy will be legal in my country as it depends on the skill of the players. That is why there are so many rummy sites are operating here that entertain millions of players.",

Though we can't say not all gambling games are not based on luck. However, we ask for it to be with us and win. Because even in sports, even if you're team is strong, you can never say that all the time they will win, perhaps they still lost because they were unlucky that day. This is the same in gambling, even if you have skills, losing is inevitable.",

Luck still works. I don't know of any project that has sports and horse racing game onboard but in regular gambling Soccer games and horsing luck also get in. Skills are needed too but sometimes games gets to complicated to predict, even big teams get poor performance too so many who win big get them through luck and less skill",

I think you might be wrong about that. All gambling games are probabilistic to their very core. Which is why they are gambling games and not games which can be won by using complex computer algorithms like with chess. So what you call luck is really you being on the less \"lucky\" side than the actual gambling casino with their built-in house edge. But you definitely could raise your chances of winning if you are skilled enough. Even though you will never be \"luckier\" than the casino with mentioned house edge. Trying to cheat fate by calling something lucky or unlucky is just psychological. Not a good gambling strategy.",

That's basically the sort of gambling you're in if you don't want to rely 100% on luck (I say so since there's still a factor of luck even in those types of events/activities). Outside of sports, I reckon Poker has some form of skill involved but unlike sports, luck is still a highly reliant factor. You're not participating in the activity itself though just to note, cause if that's what you're looking for then it isn't a gambling site/activity you're looking for anymore, it's a tournament instead. You're not a gambler anymore, but rather a participant instead and you're the one being gambled on instead.",

Well, in my opinion, i think one still need luck even in games that require skill to win, like in soccer and horse racing that you mentioned, the skill required is knowledge, the gambler have to know some vital stuff about the teams and how they play to be able to predict the out come of a match correctly, also i think knowing how a different teams perform under different weather conditions is also a vital asset as knowledge to have in sports betting.But even with all this knowledge, you have need some atom of luck to win since knowledge is never enough, because after doing your best in betting with your knowledge, some things can change in the pitch that will utter the result of the game and your prediction.So personally, i think the role of luck is still very much needed even in skill/knowledge based games/gambling.",

The only game which require skill for me is Texas holdem poker and everything else is based heavily on luck despite a bit of skill is involved there too.In fact in sport betting you may know very well the teams,may have followed them through many years and you never miss for example a training session of your favorite team,this is skill but when the referee does not give a clear penalty and your team loses against a much weaker team then this is called luck and luck is heavily involved in sport betting because you do not rely on your own like in Texas holdem and for me the only games that cannot be luck based are the ones I take part myself.",

Indeed, not all gambling games are based on luck, but some are skill-based.The more proficient your skills in analyzing a match, the greater your chances of winning.But still, you need luck so that the results you predict can still happen because we have seen some matches can turn around beyond our predictions.Maybe sports betting is a bet that is not based on luck alone but an analysis factor is also needed to be able to choose the right team.",

I like to talk about horse racing its one of the hardest games to predict because of the many factors involved like handicapping, breed, condition of the horse before running, and who is riding the horse, it takes years of analysis and inside info, before you can accurately predict the winning horses or combination of horses that will win in a particular race, but it's worth it once you dig deep on these horses luck is just secondary and most of the times you can accurately predict.",

If that's what you're asking then also the same thing with poker and sportsbetting. They don't really mostly rely on luck at all and there's really a big difference between those casino games and skill-based games.What's good with sports betting is that you bet only with a few choices but depending on the game, they can put several options for you to bet with which will require you still with some guessing.",

I totally agree with this very statement of yours, because in as much as personal skill and experience is a prime factor to winning a soccer or horse game, the presence of luck can't be overemphasized, as it also plays an important role. Moreover, at times you could be the best horse racer in the world, but if you are unlucky to pick an unhealthy horse during a race, irrespective of your skill you wont be able to win such match, and likewise will a good foot all club not able to perform very well without a favorable weather condition during a football match.So both luck and skill is important",

The last time i bet in horses it was virtual horses in Betnomi, they have soccer betting too, and if i'm not wrong, i think stake and roobet have them too.As you mention those sports are about skills, but soccer is more than that, the good team work is a must to be success, and if a player is on any of those popular teams is because he is really good. I mean all the pleyers on the match have good skills, so, luck still an important fact for the win.",
