  "content": "The decentralized community-based blockchain marketplace project will allow members of a community to trade goods and services directly amongst themselves using real-world asset tokenization.All trades happen directly on a DeFi blockchain orderbook without the need for any browser plugins in order to place trades or access the assets in the wallet/account. Trades can be signed using secure off-line equipment then later submitted to the blockchain for increased security.Each decentralized community marketplace will be operated by a trusted member of their community that will be compensated by means of listing and/or final value fees.Some of the benefits that will be made available by using DeFi blockchain technology that are not on available with other on-line traditional marketplaces even those that allow the use of crypto are as follows:Empty shell bids are not allowed this is enforced by the on blockchain orderbook. This will make sure the buyer has all the funds available to immediately complete the transaction before the bid is even accepted.Buyers can place bids that are under the sellers ask price to form a \"best offer\" type bid that the seller will be able to see on the blockchain orderbook and accept if they desire.Sellers will be able to dynamically update the ask price of the item for sale at any time to accommodate changes in the value of whatever that is being accepted as payment.An asset path finding service that can search for a link between the various items for sale on the blockchain orderbook to make a trade happen.Direct barter between two sellers that have items listed for sale on the blockchain orderbook is possible. This direct barter could even be possible across decentralized community-based marketplaces.Your DeFi blockchain marketplace wallet/account and all the asset inside will continue to be available even if the decentralized marketplace dissolves for whatever reason.These decentralized community-based blockchain marketplaces will be hosted on the Cryptops DeFi blockchain where trades close on average in under 6 seconds. The Cryptops DeFi blockchain uses asset tokenization to provide an intuitive, secure and censorship resistant method for the buying and selling of real-world assets using an on-chain orderbook that allows users to fully verify all trades.Cryptops is a open trade platform where the transaction fees are decided by each users decentralized vote. These transaction fees are then equally distributed weekly in the form of (COE) the native blockchain currency to all the stakers of the Cryptops blockchain effectively allowing them to set their rewards rate using blockchain protocols. It is not necessary to run a Cryptops node in order to receive staking rewards, but it is necessary to be running your own decentralized node in order to vote on the transaction fees and other characteristics using the blockchain protocol.This decentralized community-based blockchain marketplace project is in the pre-seed stage of development and there is still much that needs to be done, let me know if you would like to get involved in advancing this project.",
