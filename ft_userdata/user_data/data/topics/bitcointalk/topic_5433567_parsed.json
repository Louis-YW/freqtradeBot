Dem say they prefer make money dey inside system (bank) dey flow so dem go fit track every transaction wey dey happen. The problem now be say whether the thing go work smoothly or not because from the history no be the first time be this wey CBN dey introduce this kind policy but e dey fail.QuoteIn 2012, the Sanusi Lamido-led Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced cashless policy with the aim of reducing the quantum of physical cash that is being used in the system in an attempt to cut down on cash handling expenses of banks.During that period na just few states implement the policy before they con suspend am in 2015. So how this new one intended to be different from the previous one?QuoteEmefiele had announced the full implementation of the cashless policy effective Monday, January 9, 2023Although, the CBN boss Godwin Emifiele Don assured us say everything Don set wey go make the policy work effectively but na naija we dey na. Na so dem go talk normallyQuoteAll infrastructure that is needed to ensure a smooth working cashless system such as the CBDC, online banking, Payment System Banks (PSBs), point of sale terminals (POS) agent banking, mobile banking and ATMs have since been deployed.As the matter be now, if you want to withdraw money from ATM na 200 naira and lesser denomination e go dispense for you. To get 1k note or 5h, you go enter inside bank or you go to POS center.if you Wan read full details about this you fit click HereSo wetin you fit talk about this policy? You think e make sense?",
