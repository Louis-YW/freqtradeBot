It is also about the acceptance of it in regards to goods and services. All businesses would need a gateway implemented at this sudden moment as well. If (for arguments sake) all businesses instantly implemented this gateway with no hiccups, everyone knew how to use BTC appropriately and this event happened, without a doubt the fiat system would crumble and positive change would quickly follow. It would take a lot of work for the people to quickly facilitate this change though...as I am sure that if something like this were to happen then the community involved would need to be governed by a new fair and non-corrupt body of people rather than existing government bodies.",

But people do not have that kind of mindset, cryptocurrencies are not having stable price and they are volatile, stable coins that are most reliable depend on fiat while many people will always have a reason to have fiat. Most businesses in the world are using fiat and they are growing, but I understand that keeping fiat in bank or holding it is just a way to make your wealth to be deplete in value.Quote from: PX-Z on March 07, 2023, 11:34:14 PMThat's a dream that can only done in a dream.

It doesn't really matter if those things happen again as we always see those changes from time to time. Not just it, we also see changes in market trends that's why all of us are just adapting to whatever changes are.",

One of very potential is gold, because gold is tested about many years ago and strong. but if crypto, I am not sure will replace it when gold is more stable than it.

I mean, there are small yet significant disruptions happening right now. There's no need to see shocking events just to see the impact of Bitcoin. You need a big event to happen if you want every person in the world to convert to Bitcoin instantly. We would probably need fiat to collapse and that probably will not happen for a long time. Every country wants to keep fiat alive because they profit huge margins from keeping it alive and Bitcoin is a threat to their profits because they can not control it like they do with fiat. They will try to rescue it if it is at threat of being replaced by Bitcoin and I think it might be bans on Bitcoin if we did come close to threatening them because they want people to think that fiat is the only option for them. If Bitcoin grows steady and people do not jump ship instantly the government might not ban it or put too many restrictions on it. Then when we have enough passionate users who are willing to fight to keep Bitcoin alive we might be in a good position to challenge the fiat currencies but we are a long way off until we can challenge it.",

I've said it a lot of times, maybe sometime in the future as you said, some 100 years later, bitcoin may replace fiat but even that looks highly unlikely. looking at the history of man and money, there have been different forms of money over time before paper money so I believe the world might get to a stage where people no longer need fiat but from my estimation that can happen in at least 200 years later and it's not still guaranteed that it would be bitcoin that would replace fiat.",

      "body": "The problem is that inflation isn't widely regarded as a negative thing. Too much inflation is an issue, but a stable inflation rate is considered healthy and stimulating for the economy by many experts, with the argument being that the fact that money is losing some of its value over time motivates people to spend it rather than save up, and spending is crucial for a healthy economy. With Bitcoin, which keeps growing in value over time, there truly seems to be an issue for many to spend it, as people want to hodl and enjoy better profits. At the same time, though, people aren't inclined to spend Bitcoin when it's losing value either, as they believe it's temporary. With fiat, when a currency loses some of its value, it rarely then grows in value later, so the spending motive works. At the same time, it can be argued that people spend money when they need to buy something or feel like they want to buy it, not because of inflation.But I don't see people turning to cryptos instead of fiat in the near future because people don't want volatile money and largely views cryptos as assets, not as a payment method.",

I was guilty of that during the start of my journey and actually thought that the biggest value-proposition that Bitcoin has is scarcity/limited supply. It might be, but my opinion/thoughts about the narrative changed, or perhaps I simply don't care about \"Bitcoin vs. the U.S. Dollar\" considerably anymore. From a \"disruption\" viewpoint, I believe we should look more into Bitcoin as a tool for weakening political strongholds. As an illustration, what if Russia pegged Russian Oil with Bitcoin to go around sanctions and price-caps implemented by the United States?",
