In that time limit, you only get max uptoÂ  4-5 confirmations, and sometimes not even one (if you pay lower miner fees).Just to let you know it'll take between 2-4days for it to reach 200 confirmations.Quote from: Vijjuxtra on January 26, 2023, 01:59:36 PMPLEASE DONT WASTE TIME IF YOU ARE FUDFirst of all, stop posting with all those capital letters.

The terms you have doesn't make it attractive to the doubtful users and the majority here are going to assume you as a scam.
