This is one of the very interesting question marks that will contribute to our history as a planet right now in my opinion....My new question mark is if free market stablecoins or closed CBDCs will be used if they decide to use blockchain for their digital currencies. Or, their own blockchain network? While I believe the Bitcoin protocol is where development efforts around the globe should be focused to create an evolved global payment network, envisioning a blockchain explorer exclusively with BRICS+ local currencies in the form of stablecoins/stabletokens seems like a cool thing to picture (especially if interoperable with Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market, which would inadvertently create a massive on-ramp for Bitcoin too). I know it seems like I'm kissing your a$$ every time I say this franky1 (said it a few times), but thank you for your post, it lead to a new line of thinking and updated research. I like your work and if I had merits to hand out I'd be sending you a lot more",

I mean, if BRICS starts gaining momentum and influence globally, how much do you guys think it will affect Bitcoin, price-wise and adoption-wise?Something I don't understand is why would the stability to hold Crypto assets be pegged on the US USD known to be the USDT when cryptocurrency is decentralized and no official or legal defendant that the Crypto industry is centered on the US that would warrant it currency (USD) to be pinned a stablish to a unifying digital and decentralized currency as bitcoin.Why has the US also had that influencer role in the bitcoin market despites the Speculations that bitcoin isn't officiated with any authorities but just of it communities adoptors.I believe there're still certain sentiments within the global economy trade with the Brics and the US which the BRICS wouldn't want to play a backup (support) the growth of the US as they both acts as oppositions around the global economy system.So the BRICs facilitate on the adoption of bitcoin unsentimentally, of course it'd bring a maximum winning to bitcoin and the potential values of bitcoin would be  maximize because they also have an economy influence like the US.",

To be honest, I don't think BRICS countries will even launch their own fiat currency anytime soon, especially after the threat from Trump on imposing additional tarrif. Most probably they are going to stick to USD for now and keep a very small percentage of their business in local currencies. Don't expect any big changes in that immediately.",

This has reduced the chances of the organization to agree on a common currency that will be used for trade. Currently, they are encouraging member states to accept local currency thereby reducing the use of the dollars.Bitcoin adoption and price will increase if BRICS nations decide to use the currency in international trade or as a strategic reserve. But since a leading member state, China is not friendly with Bitcoin, I doubt if such a move will see the light of the day.",

Of course, that's one of the assets of the United States and they're not going to give that to China. Being friends while having some business to make in competition is gonna be tough. But this is going to be developing story as they both agreed upon to make peace in their regions.Looks like Trump did really stopped the talks about BRICS and many countries wouldn't be interested anymore on that allegiance.",
