I just want to point out that your homepage is very dull because you categorized too much your casino leaving the homepage showcas less games of your casino.I believe you should place some part of your casino games and sportsbetting on the homepage to have a quick view on what you are offering. I agree on @Slowdeath comment that white background is not good on the eyes. Add a feature for a dark theme or make it dark to bcome less stress on the eyes.",

Although white color seems not good for background color, but there's many casinos already use black color. Maybe they can use grey color, it could be dark grey or grey.Quoteanother thing I noticed was the \"100% WELCOME BONUS\", the minimum requirement to have 100$ welcome bonus is to deposit 5000 USDT, I think this is a very high amount and it won't attract many people if you had put a value lower could make a lot of people interestedUmm what did you mean?Quote from: https://coinplay.com/bonus/welcome_bonus_casino_bettingCoinplay will double your first deposit (up to 5000 USDT) and give you 40 free spins in Zero Day from Mancala. You can use your bonus in the Sports or Casino section.The rules are simple: make your first deposit of at least 20 USDT to take part. Then, you need to wager your first deposit amount x40 times within 30 days. You can track your progress in My account. The bonus will be credited to your main account once all the terms of the offer have been met.Detailed rules for this promotion can be found in the Terms and Conditions section.You need to deposit at least 20 USDT or $20 to double your first deposit and it's up to 5000 USDT which mean the maximum of your deposit is 5000 USDT, so you will get another 5000 USDT bonus with 40x wager requirement in 30 days.It's not deposit 5000 USDT to earn $100.",

You can find a light/dark theme switch on the top panel, if you go to one of the category pages (Sport, Esports, Casino, Bonuses or Blog), here’s a screenshot:However, we see how it might be inconvenient, so we’ve passed your feedback to our product team. Regarding the Welcome Bonus, 5000 USDT is the MAX amount, so you don’t actually have to bet that amount to receive a bonus. The minimum amount is 20 USDT. You can learn more about the bonus here: https://coinplay.com/bonus/welcome_bonus_casino_bettingKYC is a standard practice among the majority of online sportsbooks and casinos, its only purpose is to ensure security for both players and the platform.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",
