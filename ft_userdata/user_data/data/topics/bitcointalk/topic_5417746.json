  "content": "So far no one has been able move the price of Bitcoin from its current level ($19,130) to new high. Bitcoin master has waited for sometimes to see if anyone is strong or wealthy enough to move it up above $22—$23,000 after he allowed the price to fall from its $25,000 high it was moved to.Now, if the price start moving up again from now onward, I expect every honest person to know and recognize why it's really moving.By the way, did you notice that the price moved below 19,000 few days ago? If Bitcoin master had stopped supporting the price it would have moved way below that price. The word \"decentralized\" in one of his posts changed everything and brought the price back to 19,300 from 18,350 or so. All this power to move the price however he wants is impossible without our CREATOR. So all Glory goes to HIM alone.I have offered people the opportunity to benefit from this price movements but only very few people accepted. I will be managing them to ensure that they are always profitable. For those who are yet to indicate interest, you can still benefit from the price movement from now onward especially when you see me posting about things related to Bitcoin and crypto in general, but you may not be able to know when to sell as that will be reserved exclusively to those I'm managing. But here is a hint: once the price is moved to a record high and you notice I no longer post Bitcoin related things, you may need to be careful with your investments because Bitcoin master may allow the price to fall in order to help those he manages buy back again, and this will likely be repeated always until there is a good development in Bitcoin/crypto space that's enough to break the resistance and move the price to another new high.Related post: How Bitcoin price is moved without money https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5396744.msg60008904#msg60008904",

Inform us on the person as you are speaking in confidence like you know something that is to happen with bitcoin price. Did you see tommorow ? Are you Michel de Notredame (Nostradamus) ?Can you handle the truth if you know who he really is? Someone wrote a Book called Mastering Bitcoin but if another who has mastered Bitcoin says I have mastered Bitcoin, don't you think weak people could get mad at that person for daring to say the truth? Bitcoin master don't want to be revealed partly because he is conscious of such people and the spirit of jealousy that could use them to create problems here. Bitcoin serves Bitcoin Master... he rules over Bitcoin and Bitcoin obeys him. Rather than serve money, money serves Bitcoin Master.",

I guess, the price of Bitcoin will surely reach $70k before the end of this year 2022 for people to believe that Bitcoin price is be control by demand and supply in the community.",
