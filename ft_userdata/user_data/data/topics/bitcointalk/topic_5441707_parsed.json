  "content": "#CATENA_Network#CMCX_CoinHello friendsSome time ago I read a report on the Cointelegraph website and it was very interesting (https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/the-core-multichain-is-overclocking-blockchain-consensus).This article is about a project called CORE-MultiChain. The name of the project consists of two parts: CORE + MultiChainThe main goal of the project can be understood from the name of the project1- CORE = Cryptographic Object Resource Engine 2- MultiChain = A Virtual World of Interconnected BlockchainsPlease read this Cointelegraph article and comment your opinion. Because I have invested in this project, your opinions are very important to me In the next post, I will explain the reason for my investment and also the CORE website is https://coremultichain.com#CORE#CORE-MultiChain#COREMULTICHAIN#CMCX",
