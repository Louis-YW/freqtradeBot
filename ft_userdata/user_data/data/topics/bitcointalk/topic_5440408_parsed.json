I mostly use my hardware with Electrum anyway so there is no need to update quickly. Things might be a bit different if you use an official app that always requires the latest firmware. This is probably one of the ways scammers can mask their message, saying that there is a new major firmware update available that fixes a major security flaw for your HW.",

What you are suggesting is that someone has compromised the official Ledger e-mail and is using it for phishing/spam? It's not about that, but surely about some poor scammer who got hold of the database and is trying to get hold of personal data, which he will then use to register on various online services and resell those accounts on the black market.Quote from: crwth on February 21, 2023, 02:50:24 PMHas anybody received weird emails with numbers and just an attachment? I believe that's from the data leak as well, where they got my contact.I received them a couple of times, but they were in the spam folder, which I check at least once a month in case some of the legitimate e-mails are redirected there. I think that the sender of these messages wants to confuse the recipient in such a way that if the message is not clear to him, he clicks on the attachment - although this is only my assumption.",

Additionally, don't skip too many firmware upgrades, otherwise you might find yourself in a situation where you can no longer update the software at all. For example, versions below 1.3 for the Nano S can no longer be upgraded, and you probably have to replace the device with one that comes installed with the newest firmware. https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Update-Ledger-Nano-S-firmware?docs=trueQuote from: joniboini on February 21, 2023, 02:45:26 PMDoes this e-mail comes from their official e-mail account...

It says in their documentation that versions 1.1 and 1.2 can no longer be updated with Ledger Live. I don't know if the company has other means by which they can make the upgrade. But anyways, I wouldn't send them a used Ledger, especially one where the seed and private keys are still stored on it.Firmware version 1.2 came out in 2016. Ver. 1.1 is obviously even older. It honestly makes no sense to still use such an old version considering there have been bug and vulnerability fixes, but also performance improvements.  Quote from: examplens on February 21, 2023, 11:44:05 PMI wanted to give away a ledger with some coins on it, but that person will not use it very actively, it would certainly not be regularly updated. is it still better not to do it with the ledger, but to look for another option? You can be the one to upgrade the firmware before you give it away. Maybe 1.1 and 1.2 will always be the only firmware upgrades that can no longer be upgraded, or maybe that threshold will move in the future to 1.3.1, 1.4.1. etc. Hard to say.",

My point exactly. That's why I am replying and commenting on your post where you said you have never heard of an electronic device becoming useless unless updated in time, alluding to Ledger. Both the Nano S and the Trezor One are dinosaurs technology-wise, and they are very limited for today's standards. So the thing you have never heard of it quite realistic, and not just with hardware wallets. Trezor One came out in 2014, Nano S in 2016. The Samsung S5 came out in 2014. It uses an outdated Android OS, which can be upgraded a bit, but still to an outdated Android version. Some apps nowadays require newer versions of the OS to run (maybe Android 6, 7, 8, etc.), and since the S5 doesn't support it, it has become quite limited and useless for today's standards. So there you have an example of a useless hardware device.In fact, the Nano S and Trezor One are in a better position than the old smartphone models. Had you just updated the firmware in time, you wouldn't find yourself in a situation where you can't run the new one. It's the user's fault for not finding a bit of time to update the firmware from time to time. A phone allows you to update to a certain version and that's it. It doesn't go any further.",
