If you are really that a member of some crypto groups specially on Facebook, then you would definitely be seeing up those people who had really be that anticipating that PI network does really have that kind of value but actually there are people who had been saying that this doesnt even have that actual blockchain, then why it would be something that would really be getting some value? This had been already a long time and i've read up that there's some promises that had been made but until now it wasnt really be able to happen.Is it a legit or fake?https://indodax.com/academy/en/what-is-pi-network/Mining in mobile nowadays is really that a pretty common. There is also that Avive mining and Omega but it seems that all of them are just waste of time.",

Cause here in our country they are accepting Pi Mining as form of payment in their stores. Or someone buying it with real fiat money thats why Ive said it has value. But if you are talking about exchanges, Im not sure if theres one that is listed on it since its not have a blockchain yet.",

Pi has been talked so many times here and it's just another crap coin that full with brainless people who wanna be millioaire without doing nothing.

Do you think is real or is going to be launched soon?You are right to be suspicious ror anything \"free\" especially when it's announced in advance. That's a guarantee of it getting botted and worthless to individuals.But the whole concept was pointless to begin with. Only gimmick with it was that it's going to be mineable by phone, and even if that would work, who cares. That wasn't a problem anyone needed solution for. Their token that's trading in some of the most shadiest places seem to have paid volume only. Which i thought would be thing of the past, but i guess this is coin design from the past too.Say far away. Even with airdrops and mining you are losing time and most likely compromising your phone as well.",

And I found github explorer for PI Network, and the first commit existed since 6 years ago. I hear form several group member in Indonesia that i joined, Here Pi-Network doing seminar few times, unfortunately I did not save the documentation from group member, one think made me don't believe about this project is, most of those who participated ini seminar look like is not understand crypto. For example, this one:Source: https://www.beritabulukumba.com/nasional/3877843048/begini-keseruan-kopdar-pi-network-di-indonesia-siap-siap-cairkan-pi-coinlook at the people who attended the Pi-Network community meeting, it seems they are not people who understand crypto right, I'm pretty sure they are join this community because of tempted by the promise of profit and make them rich sooner.

Indonesian old lady interested in crypto,  lol, I dont know cant judge them by their looks. But obviously this Pi Network works like a ponzi its like the lyka gems that surround before and now its gone. Many scrutinize that project due to a lot of factors. Worse is Pi is being inclined as a blockchain project which clearly it isnt. Its like a centralized platform for using Pi but not really involve blockchain tech. So be careful to a lot of coomunity there, dont wanna fall on this.",
