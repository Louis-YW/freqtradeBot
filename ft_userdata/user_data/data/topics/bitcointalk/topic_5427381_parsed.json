Do we need someone to put together a thread of ChatGPT predictions to see how accurate they are?  Any other thoughts?This sounds like a tempting option until you begin to realize all the effort such a thing would entail, AI algorithms are in many cases very simple but the amount of data you need to feed the model is huge, and even if the algorithm found a way to be profitable you will still need to get all of that data in order to predict the upcoming games.So this is one of those things that it is easier said than done, but if it could be done then I would expect such an AI to be more accurate than most gamblers.",

Successful gamblers based their prediction on different factors and stats alone although a major factor but it's not the main thing that would help them succeed in what they are doing. Thing is, if one player will miss a game due to injury, that would definitely make the AI inaccurate in its prediction.",

I have seen this bot writing code based on your description and modifying it according to your requests. I mean wtf is that? It is not only copy/pasting a code from its database, it understands you and makes the modifications you want from it.I guess we will be needed only to serve other people in restaurants, cafes etc. Even though machines can serve people food and drinks too, we still want to socialize a little bit sometimes.",

Humans are unpredictable,they throw off our bets so it will happen for the AI too.But yea overall I recon using that ChatGPT would be a useful tool.",

The algorithm predicted that Belgium would reach the final... Yeah, that didn't end well. Maybe at some point in the future, the AI will become good enough to predict sports events or casino game outcomes. Will this make the gambling industry obsolete? Will the gambling industry adapt and create games, that are harder to predict? Probably yes. Who knows? I hear about ChatGPT for the first time and I have never used this tool.

So just like you, I’ll stick with what I believe that will work on me. I cannot compromise my own money just by relying alone on AI, I have to find more reliable datas for my analysis and predictions. But yes, maybe in the future it can be possible as high technologies can somehow be reliable even if it’s not completely accurate.",

I tried and tested it after seeing this though and said some random matchups from the world cup, the AI just answered me that it was impossible to predict the outcome since it's based on various factors, and I'm glad it actually knows. Maybe in the future, we'd be able to see an AI actually analyze matchup histories, quantity player stats and skills and make decisions based on that, but that might be pretty far off in the future, especially if we consider how quantifying player statistics may be impossible or fully accurate since, well, that requires specialized testing.",
