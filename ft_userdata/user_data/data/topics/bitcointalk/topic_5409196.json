Just basically curious, please ignore my message if you don't appreciate it.To answer to OP, personnaly I mine now with 2 guys, and we have access to almost-free electricity, so we won't stop. But I have to say that 2-3 times, we thought to switch everything off because of climate issues due to a hardcore summer.",
