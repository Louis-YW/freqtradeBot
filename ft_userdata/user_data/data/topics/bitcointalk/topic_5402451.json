  "content": "Since its creation Bitcoin has experienced a total of 3 \"bear seasons\" and we are in season 4 right now. The most recent bear season happened in 2018-2020, At the end of 2017, the Bitcoin craze was because by the panicking of the investors. In 2017 Bitcoin gained $20K value from $1K.Then it dumped of a sudden more than 80% and dropped the value near around $3k within Q4 of 2018, resulting in the total cryptocurrency market cap falling by more than 80%.After the halving year 2020, we go through the highest bull season max x20.8 times increased, and we acquired the height value of around $67K within Q4 of 2021. Currently, bitcoin is trading at $23.44k. Where will bitcoin's final bottom level be during this bear season and what will be bitcoin's new ATH level in the next bull season?Your input will be greatly appreciated.",

(doesnt sound like bitcoins current situation)retail winter is where you see the ATHafter that is the january/spring sales. where the prices come down and everyones looking for a discountbitcoin prices are in the discount position for buyers. retailers(seller) make their money in winter and get rid of their stock in spring. .. so i would say we are in spring right now. leading to summer.. right before the tourists (FOMO's) come in and pick the economy up again",

After all, pausing withdrawals is only temporary to fix the system, should now be able to make withdrawals again. So, we can't say the crash today because of this case. Then the Celsius problem, this 9,000 BTC sale may have an effect on price movements, because if they sell all at once, there will be an instant price drop. but still, not strong FUD i think.",

Sure, the price of Bitcoin went skyrocketing thanks to altcoins way faster than it would have alone, by itself. But even if we lose every altcoin we are still left with crypto's (ironically) instrinsic value. Bitcoin.So all we are seeing is a deflation of short term value. Long term, Bitcoin is still going up.",

      "body": "This is a wrong comparison because you are only comparing a small part of the market (ie. the drop part) not the other bigger parts which are the rise, accumulation and the bubble. If you compare those you can clearly see that each drop that is big (like >80%) is happening because the rise part leading to that drop was massive. And when I say massive I mean tens of thousands of percentage rise bubble (13000% for 2017). But we never had the same rise this time (2000% this time) which means expecting the same behavior (even if it happens) is unreasonable.",

And it amazes me how people are selling at this time, if people don't sell the market will not bleed. i thought it is period like this investors should look forward to buy btc at cheap price, or the intention is to send the price even lower to buy at a very low price. When btc was hovering around 28/29k i thought it may not go below that price, i see the sell pressure is high, If only people will stop panic sell, but am sure they will also panic buy back when the time comes.",

You got lucky because without LUNA bankruptcy and later a glitch on Binance that made them stop withdrawals, we wouldn't be here and your order would still be waiting to get filled. Another proof that markets cannot be predicted and sometimes the unexpected happens. This is also the first time in bitcoin's history that we went down so much without a relief rally. 12 weeks of constant downtrend and over 50% down from 47k with no pullback.",

Notably, a time to flush off some shitcoins that have been in the crypto space for too long.If you ain't ready to sell, them precious Satoshi right now, then be ready to wait for over a year or two and have the value returned with some profits on it. Sincerely, it hurts to see it drop this much but with it comes the perfect buying opportunity and I hope people are taking there chances already. Don't wanna see no cry baby after the next halving!",
