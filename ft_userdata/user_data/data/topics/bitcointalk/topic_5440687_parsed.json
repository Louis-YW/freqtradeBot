Will you advise them to vote or not base on the current issues at hand.I have no idea what issues you're referring to, but whatever they may be, the best way to address every issue in this nation is for the people go out and cast their votes on election days.i believe that if we choose not to cast our votes on election day, our problems will not be resolved. Because some of our problems we are facing in this country are coming from our bad governments. Therefore, it is now up to us to select the best candidate among contents in elections day. So I'd like to encourage people to take advantage of this chance and cast their votes for their preferred candidates. Always remember this opportunity are only coming in after four years.",

Please do not sell your vote, follow your conscience and vote the right person. Any mistake made this time is an automatic 8 years more for the nation because it is now a tradition that any government that clinch power would definitely do a complete 2 tenure and it has been on so vote wisely, do not be a puppet in the hands of the blood sucking politicians come general election this Saturday. Play safe and vote wisely.",

Will you advise them to vote or not base on the current issues at hand.No matter what the current situation may be it is never an option to encourage political apathy, it's better for the citizens of Nigeria to go out on the day of election to cast their vote for their preferred candidate rather than hide under roofs and when the going becomes ugly they will be the first set of people that will start shouting, complaining and blaming the government for not doing their job when they ( those citizens that refused to vote) couldn't even come out to vote. So for me it's a yes, let them go out and cast their vote, if they're afraid that violence might occur then they should probably go to their polling unit very early that way they could avoid any issue that might arise later on.",

The hardship in general, i see it as a very tangible reason for the Nigerians to turn out in mass and vote for whoever they think will make Nigeria a better place to live in. The average Nigerian are really seing shege this period. Nigerians must keep aside tribalism and religion to vote the right person who have the country at heart. My conclusion is that Nigerians should vote in forthcoming election in consideration with the present situation.",

This 2023 elections is one that no Nigerian should exclude his or herself from coming out to exercise her franchise in that votes would count in this very elections more than any other elections ever held in Nigeria. There are no issues on ground of any kind that should make any legible voter not to come out to cast their vote to their candidate of choice.",

Will you advise them to vote or not base on the current issues at hand.OP, Your statement is not complete because you fail to mention the issue at hand that you are referring to: is it the issue of the cashless policy, which Buhari and the CBN governor have been sure to court, or is it the issue of corruption? Recently, I read that some states have agreed that they will not vote for the Labour Party candidate unless they release the father of Biafra, who is named Nnamdi Kalu. I don't know if anyone else has read such news because I can't find the headline again. As a matter of fact, which issues are you talking about?Today is election day already; let citizens never stop themselves from going out to vote for whomever they think is the right person. I know that some people may not go out to vote because of the insecurity in their polling centers. Let God simply allow the right person to emerge as Nigeria's president.",
