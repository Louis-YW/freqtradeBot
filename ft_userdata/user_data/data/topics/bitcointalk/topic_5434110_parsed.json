  "content": "Upon reviewing our past communications on this forum, we have decided to stop participating in any topic on this Scam Accusations board going forward.If there is any complaint post in the future, please direct the complainant to this announcement. We will still be monitoring tickets on reputable arbitration sites e.g. AskGamblers and CasinoGuru to clear up the confusion. The primary reason for this decision is the behavior of certain members of this board who, at least from our perspective, have repeatedly distorted our statements and made public threats in our previous communications. This kind of conversation they are fond of, and in general, their preferred ways of communication, is not something we should be involved in according to our code of conduct, and it is simply too much for our employees to bear emotionally. Just like most forum members, our employees are living people. Men, women, with family and kids. We have a responsibility to ensure they are not subject to unnecessary emotional harms. For this reason, we found it extremely difficult to continue as before, because our employees' mental health was at risk. Best,TrustDice Team",
