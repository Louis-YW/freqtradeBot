Right now we are at 19k levels which some assume or predicted never would go here after the initial dumped to 17k last few months. But we cant close our eyes at we can see more dump or a crazy rebound from here. Who knows, a lot of events affecting it such as eth merge and feds reports, so likely we have a very long rally here what would be the outcome of it in the next coming months to years.",

Similar pattern of growth happened few weeks back and it have some unexpected upward movement when predicted for a decline below $17k. These are mere prediction and reality of the market happen of its own..",

No one knows crap on what the next floor price will be.But there are prices that bitcoin can never fall to again, unless bad thing really happened that could collapse the whole crypto market. The lowest price I can think bitcoin would fall to was $14000, but it was surprising that it only falled to $17600 when I was expecting that. Bitcoin is at $19700 presently, but I am doubting if it would fall below $17600. No much analyses used than the 2018/2019 and 2020 fall pattern which makes me predict that bitcoin may not fall below $17600. But if it falls below that price, then I will just hold on to my previous thought which is $14000. With this, I believe that the volatility has decreased, but if falling below that price, which means bitcoin is just as volatile as 2016/2020, which is what I am not expecting at all to happen.",

Their purpose is to wait the lowest and highest until they miss all opportunity to buy Bitcoin at the cheap price or sold at the highest price. This is why accumulating Bitcoin is important, you don't need to guessing, just start slowly but sure.",

But for me, I do not understand the main purpose of the main subject topic. Are you asking to know if you will stop hodling bitcoin or because you are looking for the best time to buy more OP?",

It's next to impossible for bitcoin to drop below the likes of $100 or so.  The point is, There are lots of analysis on \"prices that bitcoin can never fall to again\" that you might as well not listen to them. How do you even know who to listen to in the first place?Quote from: Queentoshi on September 16, 2022, 08:05:56 AMJust like the name of this section which is \"speculation\", all you can get whenever the question of \"how low\" or \"how high\" the price of bitcoin can go is just a speculation.Yea, this thread wasn't originally in the Speculation section.",

      "body": "I agree with mk4. Projections don't matter. Even more, the lowest point will probably be short-lived and doesn't matter that much.Still, it's usually expected that the lowest point is reached nearly at the end of the bear market, hence, since we've already had 17953$ in June, going lower than that would not be unexpected (but I cannot say it'll happen).Some charts I've seen had the lowest point under 10k. I hope we won't get that low (I expect the bear market end this year), although I fear of the effects of ETH going PoS and hence dropping big time.",

There are those who claimed that the bottom was already hit when the price fell down to $17,700. But there are also those who expected more. There are analysts who see Bitcoin falling further to as low as $15,000 or even $10,000. All of these predictions could come true. So it doesn't anymore matter which among them is really the bottom. What matters is that we shouldn't miss this opportunity to stack more.",

It could be that in a matter of days the price of Bitcoin can reach above $22K and can also be below $17.6K. Again, no one knows for sure.",

Just goes to show how predictions aren't worth anything, no prediction would actually be right or wrong till the moment it passes, probably the only thing useful in knowing it is in identifying the general sentiment of the investors, at least those that are pretty public with their opinion.",

So far the lowest low is $17,500. So maybe that figure could be a good baseline, let's see for a projection for the lowest price this bear cycle. So it could be the worst like $10k, or just a shade of it, around $15k.For the projection on the next all time high, majority thinks that we might see 6 figures finally, maybe in 2024-2025. Overall, the market is really volatile, and we are still in the bear market so expect the worst.",

For example those Bitcoin solid supporter will surely predict that the 175000 is already the bottom because they don’t want the price to drop more. While Anti Bitcoin/Jeetz traders will surely predict that Bitcoin will go lower than 17500 because they want to buy more. This prediction is the way of traders on expressing there personal stand on the price movement you can always find a bearish or bullish signal on TA in different timeframe and use it to someone price stand opinion.",
