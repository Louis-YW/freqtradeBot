I don't know what you want to convey with this topic you made. What is the connection of what you say to the Economy category here on this forum platform?It's not that I don't want to answer what you say, dude, I just want to know what is its relevance and what do you want to convey and make such a topic here in this thread section.Although helping each other is something that can be applied to many things in our lives whether it is business or not.",

In case like this, I typically offer the person in need help a good alternative or right way to seek help in order to easily convince me to help instead of the outright rejection",

I often give to charities & I always give a few £ to homeless people when I see them sitting on the floor in my home town. Even if it’s something so small like helping an old lady across the street, helping others is important.",

      "body": "I believe it is important to help out others because it is good karma, if you do good by doing a good act such as helping someone you love and care for. Good karma will come back to you when you least expect it the help. Sometimes helping family doesn’t require to get paid or hope for something in return. It is more of showing the good will of the person that cares for their loves one or friends. And it makes me feel very happy when I can help others because I am not looking to get something out the situation but as long it comes from me and not because they ask me.",
