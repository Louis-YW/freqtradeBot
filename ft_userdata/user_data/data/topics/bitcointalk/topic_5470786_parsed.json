Sport bets vs in-house games which is most enjoyable and has a higher tendency of bringing much winning compared to it possibility of losing? I just tried my luck with slot machines with limited budget,however I don't feel that much limited as I use IDR as currency and when I do so 20 dollars is over 300.000 IDR so I can keep playing my favorite slot like Sweet Bonanza for quite a lot of time.The fun is there but it can immediately become a huge stress if it hits you a bad streak,I kept buying the bonus it kept me in the loop,no win no loss,same amount after buying the bonus lots of times.For sport games I would suggest you go with that as I have saved now the amount and stopped playing slot machines waiting for the weekend games trying to boost my balance so I can come back playing slots with a better bigger balance  .",

      "body": "Go sports on weekends. That way you can relax, drink your beer, and just watch the game. You won't even remember that you made a bet as long as you are betting for the team you are rooting for. I tend to just use my emotional pick when I bet on weekends and watch the game, that way I will cheer louder for my team even though I am just watching the livestream.  You said it's time to spend with the family so why are you thinking about in-house games? In my experience, in-house games will eat a lot of your time and it will stress you out if you are losing. It won't be family time anymore. Especially if you have boys, watching sports like NFL, NBA, UFC, or boxing will be the best idea on a weekend. Then you could go do barbeque while you can still watch the games. Just don't forget to place your bets before the games starts.",

It's sports betting – we can use that words since it's widely used. It's just for me, though. I would choose sports betting over casino games, although I also enjoy casino games. But since you're asking about the possibility of losing, of course, you're likely to lose when there's a house edge – regardless of the actual house edge.Maybe just play what you like because that's the only way to truly enjoy it. But don't expect too much when you choose to play at a casino – just hope you get lucky, so you'll end up winning!",

That is a sign of responsible gambling.I agree with you on the odds differentiation and how in-house games hold more odds than bookie games,  but then we are aware of the higher percentage advantage given to house edge on in-house games,  but on sports bets, you still have the balanced ground to speculate and get the prediction right. Also, I am not talking about responsible gambling as you stated in the last paragraph,  but just looking for where to have entertainment, in the coming weekend because I have just a spear weekend to enjoy and do not want to continue on the same trend after the weekend and will not want to consider the aspect of responsibility.",

House edge is also existing on bookies. If I choose a roulette and go for 3x odd of 33.33% chance of winning, I will prefer it than a football gambling with lower odds which also have something similar to house edge. The house edge that I am referring to in football gambling can be seen in the odds. Assuming a big club is playing, with small odd, the big odds can have 1.2x odd or lower, but that does not mean the match can not end draw or the underdog to win.",

Some details I feel I'm missing from the topic which would have assisted with providing you an accurate response but I will try anyway. You mentioned that you want to spend the weekend with your family, it would be nice if you have given us the age range of the family members. If you mostly male family members except your wife, I'll advice you go with sports betting. You get to watch the game together after you have placed your bet. If you have both genders of kids who are teenagers, bonding will come more from playing in-house games.

You want gamble with higher chance win, and not hoping on luck correct as you know luck can be run or we are not in good section (getting streak).Sport-bets was the answer, you can also feel the bet by watching the match. You will get 2 emotion, 1 from win the bets and the other 1 will be from watching the match. Good luck mate.",

Why I mentioned spending time with family is because I will be in the house all through the weekend so even if I gamble in my room,  without any interference since I don't have adults leaving in the same house with me. Playing in-house games is fun but I may not want to spend too much time on them to the point that I may lose the excitement of the weekend from the football match lineups.

I highly suggest to focus with your family bonding instead of mixing it with gambling entertainment because you will just ruined your weekends if you experience bad lose in the process. Been there done that, I preferred gambling when I don’t have anything to do.Quote from: Wiwo on October 18, 2023, 12:23:00 PMSport bets vs in-house games which is most enjoyable and has a higher tendency of bringing much winning compared to it possibility of losing? I’m never become a fun of in-house game because most of the game is just simply an instant result without cool animation that you can be entertained. The last in-house game that I play is mines which I stop immediately because I keep blowing mines instantly even though I have high chance of winning than losing.I suggest go for the sportsbet if you want to enjoy gambling while stay in-touch with your family since your attention will not be focus on gambling alone while you can share the bond with your family by watching the sports that you place bet. Just make sure to bet only what you can afford to lose.",
