I am pretty sure that must be a really bad casino platform to play on.Most of well reputable casinos always send me an email letting me know that I started a session on their website and I am in the same country but I use different ISP-s and they know that it is me,I also have 2FA enabled and when a person has 2FA enabled means that 99.99% is this very same person accessing the casino so yes based on how you describe the situation,this is extremely cruel and the name of that platform should be made public so everybody is aware of such scammy platforms.That is why I have said here at least a hundred times that people should check this very section we are writing here and check the ANN thread of reputable casinos and only play there,this way such incidents won't happen again.",

Which casinos you are talking about, I think you should mention it so members will not make will guess and starting to worry about such case? I'm pretty sure my IP is always changing most of the time since I use several different internet providers but I have never experienced something like that in some different casinos. It would be better if you can also provide evidence for the case, if you dont, others may say that you are spreading FUD or hoax here.",

I definitely agree with you- there is a boundary between a complete deprivation of funds without any notice; and a casino who has strict T&Cs who implements it with great stringent requirements. This gambling company is the former- they tend to completely confiscate the funds without any notice due to some minor problem that can easily be fixed on their end.Since this is the case, better yet avoid this online casino completely. To be honest, I am more inclined to convince you to spill the name of this casino so that everyone in this forum would be alerted and notified to avoid this completely.",

      "body": "It will still fall under multiple accounting, so I don't find it harsh if the user is reprimanded like this. Different sim cards and different IP address is one way of trying to game the system and going against the platform's ToS. This is just the casino enforcing their rules against the user, and it's up to your friend whether he'll abide by those or not. He's caught, he's reprimanded, and he's taken off his balance. For all the casino knows, your friend could have been doing this for a while and have gained considerable advantage against the casino leading them to lose money, so I think it's just a fair judgment on the casinos end--that is if what they did is fair, of course.",

No, I will not support the platform decision in this case. It's normal you will have two sim cards in your mobile. You will use both sim Data to browse the internet. But the platform can not ban for this reason only. I don't know yet even if there could be rules like you can not access sites from different IPs (even the device is the same here). But if there is any TOS like this they can take this decision but it's against the users. Not a good decision and this could not be a good platform.",

Although they would have grounds on suspecting you of multiaccounting or some other rule breaking. In that case they would withhold your withdrawals until you did a KYC. After which they should unlock the funds and let you withdraw.If they keep it after you KYC then the casino is probably a scam website.Although if you KYC from a country forbidden by terms and services then you might still be in trouble. But by law they would have to refund you your betted money while confiscating winnings. At least that is how it works from what I know.",

I just log in and I play without any problems... without KYC after years of actively playing in those casinos. So from my experience, I doubt that any player will be sanctioned just because he used different IP for the same account (the same device or not is even more ridiculous, I gamble from a laptop and mobile phone in the same casinos from different IP addresses, and in few occasions, I used my wife laptop...). So there's something more, it's not just about different IPs! Maybe OP's friend tried to create multiple accounts and abuse some free drops and bonuses... that happens more often than we think.",
