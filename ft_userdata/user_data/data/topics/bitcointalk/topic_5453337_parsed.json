  "content": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/personalfinance/is-ledger-s-new-bitcoin-key-recovery-feature-safe-experts-have-doubts/ar-AA1bpgQo\"When Ledger, a Paris-based hardware wallet-maker, announced a new key-recovery feature this week, it thought the move would be popular.Allowing users to recover their private keys – much like you can recover your password if you forget it – would help onboard customers, the company believed. Potential crypto users are known to be turned off by crypto's unforgiving self-custody ethos (\"not your keys, not your coins\"). But a key recovery service would offer more comfort.\"[Excerpt]\"Security concernsThe news of the update provoked a storm of criticism from the crypto community, with accusations that Ledger’s new offering contradicts its past statements about keeping private keys off the internet.In particular, Crypto Twitter piled on the tweet Ledger’s official account posted in November, assuring users of the safety of their devices.\"",

The hackers used the hacked information to target individual customers that bought hardware wallets from them. (Phishing attacks) Any informed Bitcoin user will tell you NEVER to store any \"Private key\" or \"Seed\" online, so it is ludicrous that a hardware supplier would even try to provide a service like that.",

      "body": "I wonder how ledger arrived at this decision, are they saying most of its current users lose total access to their coins and they are returning the favor by bringing this feature to life?Maybe this is a ploy to try onboard new users to the ledger world ,who would have perceived digital currencies work as good as an email  address were any user forgets his/her password can easily hit the forgot password button and access restored just like that...But giving them a benefit of doubt,  in a few months to come if this helps them sell more hardware wallets, then they might feel vindicated for this business decision as its a game of numbers at the end of the day for them..so can't blame them entirely !",

I would very much hope to see this has a major impact and creates a big disruption in the hardware-wallet sector. But I kind of doubt it will change much in the mid-long. Hope I'm wrong.",

I know people can sometimes seem stupid but I’m really hoping it’s not the case here and they decide to not accept this thing Ledger’s shoving up their face. This entire story proves Ledger cares just about money and would go against what Bitcoin stands for just for additional profits.",

If you still haven't, I suggest you read the next topic Ledger Recovery - Send your (encrypted) recovery phrase to 3rd parties entities in which you can also find one of the videos in which their CEO Pascal talks about the fact that everyone who criticizes their new service is just spreading FUD, as well as that he talks about the hacking of their customers' database as a trivial event that is something for them as a company normal and harmless.",
