      "body": "Why not avoid airdrops? I mean, they had decent value back in those days. However, I have read many negative reviews about them in recent times. There are some good airdrops, but they are not very frequent, and even when they do occur, they are generally valued at no more than $10 or $20. While they have a low initial worth, they might offer a good return in the long run. However, since most users pursuing airdrops are looking for instant redemption, waiting for the long run may be practical. In understanding, it is better to stay away from any airdrops, as there are multiple options available to obtain free tokens.",

I am frustrated with this since your wallet is being spammed by different nfts. Before only tokens that has funny names and literally scam tokens, now even nfts are being used. As lonh as your wallet is active these scammers will try to send frees to lure into a scam so better avoid that.",

And I'm sure people who have been in this space for a long time are well aware of this style of fraud.An airdrop hunter should always be careful when they are working on a task and are asked to connect their wallet through the link provided. Always use a new wallet to hunt airdrops, and to be honest I am also one of those people who occasionally follows airdrops and I also always use a new wallet or a wallet specifically for hunting airdrops.",

What on the first hand a good idea from the wallet developers, is utilised by someone to scam many cryptocurrency users.This is a wake up call for any wallet developers to combat by what all of their could do to mitigate users getting deceived by what is possible in this space. It would be hard since the scam methods and schemes are ever-evolving, but to reduce users getting scammed/phished they should do something to educate basic security to make them safe. It is a good thing that they are aware of this scheme and have already informed their users.",

First of all I would like to thanks to you for bringing this topic, because I think it will gives a notification to many beginners.Now get into the point, this is not the first time that was happening Because this has been happening before. These types of scammers are increasing day by day as the cryptocurrency world  become larger. We have to be careful, initially when going to invest in all these types of investment things, he should first see if there is a beginner on the official website of those projects. As I see that you have taken the screenshot from the official Twitter page of Trust Wallet. In this case, this thing should be noted that you are following the official page of the project. Thus in every case the original sources must be followed, and we must prevent ourselves from being too greedy because in most cases greed pulls us to these things.",

Because, before I had NFT, I didn't have scam NFT as shared by OP, but now I received more than 5 of those scam NFTs. We can't do anything about it, we want to throw it away, we have to get it approved, and I'm worried that if I do that, then the smart contract will drain assets when I have a number of valuable tokens in my wallet.

The Trust Wallet team may be late in publishing this warning to their community. I have had NFTs for years, and I did not mint them and found them in my wallet without my intervention, The suspicious thing that made me stay away from them is that one of these NFTs can give me thousands of dollars by staking it on the scam site that appears in this NFT information on Opensea and for sure anyone who opens a scam site and deposits a certain amount of altcoins or stablecoins to get the stake rewards, will lose his funds and may lose all the available NFTs on his wallet, these NFTs are like scam pump and dump tokens that we find in our wallets and lose our money when we exchange or send it, or after purchasing more quantities of it, so any NFT or token that you found dormant in our wallet that we do not know its source, I recommend that ignore them completely without doing anything.",
