  "content": "Hello mates, I am so grateful to be a member of this forum. Since I joined this forum, it is one year, I have benefited a lot in terms of increase in knowledge on various aspect of life and on bitcoin. Also my income has increased too,I got a signature campaign third week of October last year till date and my weekly pay has been regular. I have given the awareness of bitcoin to students in two schools, not only that I do visit once in a term to still impact more knowledge of bitcoin to these students.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414239.msg60974094#msg60974094https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422778.msg61335033#msg61335033I decided to give out little from what I have benefited from my campaign signature pay to the best students on bitcoin,based on what I have taught them so far. I came up with an idea of giving them a quiz,so that I will give out prizes to the best students. The quiz was successful conducted by the school authorities in my presence. It was very pleasing to see how wonderful this students performed in the quiz,but there must be a winner in every competition.Today is the prize giving day,and the over all best was from this school, his name is Samson Appah. He got 18 marks out of 20 marks, I thought of what gift I will get for him because from his name,I knew that the winner is a male. I decided to buy him a bicycle as the gift,so that this will make him not forget about bitcoin and Frankolala. I also got little gifts for the 2nd ,3rd and fourth positions. The second position is from the other school but he is ill and his friends couldn't come down here  to cheer him up. I will send his gift to his Head Teacher on Monday. The second prize will get a wrist watch,since I find out that he is the school time keeper. The third  and fourth positions will get note books with a logo of bitcoin on them. I also put bitcoin stickers on the bicycle so that when Samson is ridding his bicycle,bitcoin awareness will be spreading to wherever he is going to from his starting point to his stopping point.I did this to encourage the students to take whatever that they are taught in school very serious and to encourage them to tell their friends and family about bitcoin with the little that they understood. I took these pictures for remembrance because I have been transferred in my place of work to a different state very far from here,and I will be leaving this place on Tuesday next week. It was my pleasure to see the excitement on the faces of these students especially the best, as he thanked me over and over again. I encouraged him to give bitcoin awareness to people around him.My appreciation goes to Hampuz the manager of Trust dice campaign and Trust dice team who found me worthy to make ads for them,and to all forum members who has contributed to help me grow in the forum directly or indirectly, for with out you guys,I wouldn't have achieved a great day like this.Note : I was motivated by forum members who have used their income from signature campaign to assists people outside the forum.My question is don't you think that I am using those students wrongly to help spread bitcoin awareness. 2. Will you encourage me to tell my new colleagues in my new place of work about bitcoin or just pipe low,until someone that is interested on bitcoin needs guide or assistance in the adoption of bitcoin.1st prize : Bicycle2nd prize : Wrist watch3rd prize : 6 long note books4th prize : 6 short note books",

I believe that’s a rhetorical question, I don’t think you’re using the students, what benefit would that be to you? I think what you’re doing is very noble, the gifts are not cheap and must have cost good sum of money. Your actions have imprinted a long lasting impression on the kids about bitcoin, the customized bitcoin books will be a good way to advertise bitcoin to new people.

Will you encourage me to tell my new colleagues in my new place of work about bitcoin or just pipe low,until someone that is interested on bitcoin needs guide or assistance in the adoption of bitcoin.It depends on your workplace, I wouldn’t recommend talking about bitcoin in the office or during office hours maybe after office hours, you can share your experience with a colleague you are close with. Just because you’re doing something right, that doesn’t mean you have to shove it down everyone else’s throat. I think it’s best to let people find bitcoin organically.",

Teaching doesn't necessarily mean that he must involved in buy bitcoin or involving himself with investment, I think what he needs now is orientation on how the whole concept works before you could tell him anything about investment otherwise you may forget about the investment aspect and focused on him to gain the required knowledge before talking about investment. You know one thing about people is that whenever they hear or get the information about profit in a business they won't exercise patient to learn it thoroughly before including their money, is after it bounces back to them before they would realised they made a mistake after  they might have lost some serious funds.",

To answer your first question, I do not think you are using the students wrongly to help spread bitcoin awareness. In fact, I think what you're doing is a great way to get young people interested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. The quiz and prize-giving event sounds like a fun and effective way to engage with your students. I love the idea. As for telling your new colleagues about bitcoin, go for it dude! It is always good to share knowledge and info with others. But don't be too pushy or aggressive about it. Not everyone is going to be interested in Bitcoin, and that is totally fine. Just be open and willing to answer any questions they may have, and let them come to their own conclusions.",

Your way of spending really makes sense as it is always a better choice to help the needy ones. The students will always remember the gift and they will also find the ways to adopt Bitcoin in future. You have inserted the seed of Bitcoin into their minds and that will grow into trees very soon.After this step you should try to educate them about Bitcoin and you should also suggest them to join this forum. Help them with the education and they will be your friends, and companions in the race. They will share the education to others and that way the community will see new and valuable members. Such simple steps are the most important steps for the growth of the community.",

We should keep on spreading bitcoin awareness wherever you find yourself to help bring in more people into the bitcoin community.Kudos",

If I had read every words of your post carefully, I should have easily concluded that you were not intentionally using any students to increase awareness; rather than, I would argue that you were assisting them by educating them about Bitcoin, which I believe will be of tremendous use to them in the future.Alternatively, do you advise any of them to raise awareness?

Will you encourage me to tell my new colleagues in my new place of work about bitcoin or just pipe low,until someone that is interested on bitcoin needs guide or assistance in the adoption of bitcoin.Well, in my opinion, the best way to tell if you are using them wrongly or not is based on the education you have given them about Bitcoin. Just as you have mentioned that you told them to go and spread the news about Bitcoin to their friends and family with what they understood, if perhaps you give them a very concrete education about Bitcoin, they may definitely inform others  but it might be in a misleading manner. (I don't know if you get my point.) For example, if you have taught them all about Bitcoin and most of them only understand 20% of what you have taught them, they may be giving out incomplete education to their friends and family as well. Other than that, I don't think you are using them wrongly.Teaching your colleague about Bitcoin should be based on the time you have to educate them about it. If, for sure, you want them to know about Bitcoin and enjoy the decentralized means of handling their finances through Bitcoin, then you can introduce it to them, and most of them might pick up more interest, so from there, you can only teach those that seem to have more interest.
