Most of the centralized platforms feel comfortable providing their services using the UAE license, particularly since I think the regulatory policies now getting more strict.

The new regulations (2021) remove their licenses and branches but do not restrict UK customers from coming to request service through any office outside UK jurisdiction.The latest regulations now fully take customers as the object of protection, bybit no longer has the opportunity to serve UK users personally from any office jurisdiction.",

Let's wait and see if denying the allegations is just for the sake of public relations, but the truth is the Financial regulations won't be that friendly to them and as we know, it's always about numbers and profits.

At least they are quite explicit about it. I can see their point, but it is kind of weird that they don't apply the same thing to fiat scams. Are scams that different there? They do cite some reports that crypto scams increase quickly in the UK. If this is one of the reasons why the law becomes stricter and pushes exchanges away, one has to wonder whether this will encourage scammers to be more active through the \"black market' or not. At the very least P2P should still be a good option regardless of how the law change. CMIIW.",

Anyone from UK can help me understand this?You don't have to be in the UK to get the needed information, once you are online, you might even have better info than those living there. However, I love your concern as the same regulation should have been meted out to all similar businesses in the UK, and the UK is not as dramatic as the US's SEC and regulator's palaver, so why would Bybit consider leaving, and also citing marketing?Well, all these companies can't be trusted, not even the cited reasons might be the true reason at times, but there could be more to it. More regulation tends to tie their hands further and also exposes some bad deeds, which might be a reason for this.Take for example, since we use the global branch of Bybit, my brother and I discovered months ago that the services offered to us are different despite being in the same country and fully completed our KYCs. For exchanging $70 BTC worth to USDT, we are being charged different rates to the point that his own was ridiculously low while I would have to part away with $2+ just for a $70 conversion. We could not believe it but it persisted.Another one is the artificially made whipsaws on the chart that are non-existent elsewhere, but you can only know if you can compare charts with other Bybit users. They do this to scam people by routing them through different servers, and I'm not surprised since their CEO came from XM, a company that is also manipulative.",
