      "body": "Diversifying the assets in your portfolio is a good option in my opinion - but get more bitcoin than altcoin. Basically you can't expect to make a fast profit on an investment - that's because investing takes time that even you have to wait for a few years just to get 2x for the return. You can still make a profit trading - but even then it is risky if you don't have the good skills to do it.Remember - price volatility can give you profits as well as losses. But if you are able to take advantage of price volatility - it is very possible for you to get profits which then accelerate yourself to achieve what you want. But this is all risky - so do it with care and consideration.",

Now the markets have fallen - it's time to buy.At the moment, the prices of all crypto currencies have dropped significantly. This is a good time for short term investment and long term investment. There are many good coins in the crypto currency market that have the potential to give a good profit in the future, but as far as I think the coming time may be of AI coins. If you invest some part of your monthly $500 in AI coins, then it can prove to be a better decision for you in the future. Ocean Protocol Ajix and RNDR are good choices. To get profit always try to buy whenever the price of a coin falls and DCA will prove to be the best strategy. Apart from this, your portfolio also contains very good coins, from which you are expected to get a good profit, and you will be able to save a good amount of money to buy your apartment.",

You are looking for a high-risk investment with quick returns. investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum is the perfect solution. You can invest $400 in Bitcoin, and $100 in Ethereum and within a year or a year and a half when Bitcoin rises to 100k, you can buy and sell again when it drops below $70,000 stay way from XRP and SOL.I do not think that you will achieve $ 130,000 during 1-2 years by only invest $ 500 per month +$6000, but hodling for another 4 years may achieve that.",

With your altcoins, there is an opportunity to get big profits, but we don't know which altcoins will increase in the next altcoin season. I suggest buying more bitcoins and giving a bigger portion instead of buying altcoins or increasing the amount again. Especially if you can use $ 500 every month because I think that's enough to invest in bitcoin while waiting for the bull run. Or from $ 500 per month, use $ 300-$400 to invest in bitcoin and the remaining $ 100-$200 to invest in altcoins, so you are already running two types of short and medium term investments as well as long term investments. But that's just a suggestion. You should find out more about the altcoin selection.",

BTC and ETH are also volatile. The risk to lose your money is always there once bitcoin and ethereum go down to the below price that you have bought it. There's no risk-free investment in the crypto. The major crypto may also make you lose a lot of your money too. Im feeling skeptical with your method. It seemed to me if you will not able to get an apartment even when bullish market gonna come. You need to take the more risk by picking low marketcap coin. The less marketcap owned by the token and the more chance to growth as it will generate you more money compared with the coin that has owned very big market capitalization. This is the key when you are willing to get your apartment in the future.",

Now the markets have fallen - it's time to buy.None.I will not advice anything to you anymore.It seems like you know what's the quickest, and most safest way to earn in cryptocurrency already which is to buy those top coins in terms of market cap, and hold it for quite some time. You are also doing DCA with a huge amount on a monthly basis. You've also said that the markets have fallen, and yes it really is. This year is the accumulation phase where investors are slowly accumulating coins in preparation for the bull run.Ohhh wait. Best way to fix profits you asked? Same as what you are doing with buying. Do DCA in selling as well. Set targets where you will sell a portion of your holdings if it reaches that price. For me, my target selling price for Bitcoin is I think $75,000, $90,000, $100,000, and I might keep some Bitcoins if it goes higher even more. You still have a long way to go just by looking at your target, and the amount of money you invested already, but just trust the process, and continue DCA. Just focus on top coins as well, and don't forget to sell when you're confident with the profits already. Good luck OP.",
