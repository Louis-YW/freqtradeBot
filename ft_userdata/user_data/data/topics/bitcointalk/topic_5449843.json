The only thing I think you can do is try to use yours to see if the bitcoins are there and move them to another address of yours that you manage with other keys. This would be better placed on a technical board btw.",

Although your session might have been too close to the date of seizure for your private keys to have been wiped, there's a chance he never actually deleted any private keys, at all.Quote from: n0nce on March 16, 2023, 08:47:21 PMIt is 7TB. If backups were done that include the private keys, that was a big mistake. I can guarantee you that these 7TB include private keys, since I have seen funds withdrawn from ChipMixer (imported private keys)) disappear on the day of the ChipMixer takedown.Which would mean this was not true:Quote from: ChipMixer on October 23, 2017, 02:12:38 PMAfter you have received private key and destroyed session, we do not have it anymore.Although OP didn't provide hard evidence that supports his allegations, I don't see a reason why ChipMixer shouldn't be tagged & flagged at this point. Especially to prevent others from falling victim to phishing scams (not everybody knows CM is no longer operational).",

Actually this is my first time seeing someone said he lost coins due to the seizure of ChipMixer. I was really telling my friend days ago the advantage of mixers over exchanges even if they don't serve the same purpose. I was telling him assuming it was an exchange that was siezed, people by now would have been crying of fund lost.Just few hours after the discussion and praises, I have seen one case of coin confiscation. Op, I don't think there is a very big efforts you can make. You paid the price for privacy.",

How big it is that you still wanted to recover?  If that is so, it's better to consult a qualified lawyer for this.",

Anyways, lets move on for that, you should serve this as a lesson. Keep your money on your own safety, the one you generate, the one you made by yourself.",

I looked into it pretty thoroughly and there's no laws (at least in the US or EU) I could find that expressly forbid the use of mixers for non-money laundering purposes (not exactly sure what is required to prove intentions one way or the other). There are laws in the US that require mixers to be licensed as a money transmitter business if they plan on servicing US-based customers. Don't know if there are similar laws for other countries.Quote from: Jawhead999 on April 24, 2023, 09:46:34 AMI believe the @OP will need a lawyer and have a strong proof if he is not a criminal, but he need to accept if the process will not be smooth and the government might be watching him after that.Its incredibly murky territory. If the government has logs of all customer deposits then it would be possible to prove ownership of BTC by signing a message from the sending address. Even so - assuming logs were kept and the feds open actually do up some sort of \"refund\" process - it could still take years to finally get one's confiscated BTC back.",

The time and money spent to get his money back is probably not worth the hassle. Just move on OP, and learn from this to never share your private key with others, even if they are famous/reputable in the community. Some services even straight-up exit scammed you when they believe they are being threatened or they no longer make profits. It takes a single take-down notice or insolvency notice to lose all of your money, better store all of your crypto in a secure wallet next time. At the end of the day, this is one of those risks that you need to accept if you used a service that works like Chipmixer.",
