  "content": "This one, is about one of the most undervalued projects I've been able to find as of lately. When you start researching this one, you can't stop but wonder why this project is valued below 30 mio. marketcap, with these things taken into perspective: 1) They built their own custom multi currency wallet 2) They built the first fully functional Layer 3 DEX3) Their native token HDN is on arbitrum, holding this token grants smaller trading fees similar to how BNB was built. 4) \"Simple Swap\" makes it easy for anyone to trade assets on the fly. Their multi currency light wallet, supporting: ETH, BTC, LTC, USDC, USDT, HDN and many more makes it easy to store + trade all your assets. The project uses The Lightning Network, and Connext (similar to Lightning, but built for Ethereum), meaning you can trade for PENNIES, pretty much instantly.  This means, you can trade native BTC for ETH, without bridging between chains, or by using wrapped assets, such as wBTC.For anyone who has ever traded on Uniswap, especially during the bullruns, fees can run up to CRAZY amounts, which sucks!This beast of a DEX is going public this quarter, which is why it has been one of the most appreciating assets over the past weeksHydranet is built on Arbitrum. The token itself is not needed to use the DEX, but holders are getting up to 25% fee reduction while trading, which is pretty awesome if you're running bots with huge volume.The DEX itself will also use the trading fees for buy-backs, similar to how Binance does it. Only difference is, fees collected are used to buy HDN, which is then burned from the total supply.Website: https://hydranet.ai/Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hydranet/Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheHydranetDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/hydranetThis one is a hidden gem, the potential here is massive, considering it's insanely low marketcap still. If it gets a marketcap similar to Uniswap eventually, you're looking at $26/token, and that's in a bear market  The only down side for this project is, that the DEX itself isn't web-based. There's no such thing as web-based Lightning nodes (yet), but who knows, the possibilities are endless.If you remember the Exodus wallet back in time, where you could swap your coins whenever you felt like it, without KYC - This works practically the same way, using the \"Simple Swap\" feature, which is for newbies, who don't want to use the actual DEX.",
