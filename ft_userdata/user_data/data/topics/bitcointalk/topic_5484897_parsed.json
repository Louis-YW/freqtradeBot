While earning from cryptocurrency, you can invest some and by so doing the standard of your living will improve. Another method also is by rendering services and getting paid in cryptocurrency, although this will also require to learn skills. But in all, cryptocurrency is not a get rich quick scheme. This does not mean that you cannot become an overnight rich man with cryptocurrency. There are some altcoins and shitcoins which are very volatile. They could make drastic increase and plunge one into richness, but at the same time, it can also vanish your capital. That is why those kind of coins are not recommended for newbies who has no/little knowledge of how things work here.Above all, increasing standard of living lies in ones hands to do whether or without cryptocurrency. This is because there are people in cryptocurrency for years and yet there standard of living hasn't improved.",

But always know that cryptocurrency will never be a get rich quick tool, and those who have made fortune have made extra efforts and even experienced sleepless nights just to gain higher probability of success.However, while cryptocurrency can possibly increase the standard of living, it can also make you homeless and ruin all your funds if you invest without prior studies and research, and if you rely on social media influencers wherein majority of them are just doing it to create some hype, but in reality they don’t know that much about cryptocurrency matters.",

The existence of Bitcoin is not about eradicating poverty just like that. Bitcoin is not just going to make the economy better and reduce the cost of living. It has to be applied rightly.Bitcoin has created opportunities for people to make money and it is after they make money that their standard of living can improve. Bitcoin on its own will not charge anything if it's not applied.The percentage of people making money through crypto is too small compared to the total number of people so it's going to be difficult for Bitcoin to have a significant impact when we're talking of how it has created employment.",

And not everybody will also invest in it. This is why it is always said that Bitcoin will be an alternative currency for a long time. For one to use Bitcoin, he should be able to at least know how to read and write. They need this basic skill to be able to read about wallets and also learn how to use them. Anyone who cannot read and write will always need assistance to use the currency and this will not be good for security or privacy. It will take decades for Bitcoin to become useful for most people in my location because half of the population are illiterates. It is also important to include that Bitcoin can improve the standard of living of people if they invest a high amount in it and hodl it for a long time. Bitcoin is not a quick money scheme, so people should learn how to invest it for them to benefit from it.",

But it gives an opportunity to do so. Historically if I look at Bitcoin, it has out performed any other asset classes in the world. That's where the opportunity is. If someone can systematically invest in Bitcoin over a longer period of time, the potential amount of return can provide an opportunity to the investor to increase the standard of living. However, don't take my reply as an investment advice and do your own research to understand the downside before investing.",

I don't discriminate against those people' I'm just saying that crypto currency yes can help as have a good life or living, but not all people could do it, even those who have equipment and resources, what more those who have nothing unless someone will help them willingly and guide them until they succeed in it.

We can't rely our living solely on cryptocurrency but they're the ones who lift us from financial problems.",

Same thing with businesses and such - it's incredibly rare to find someone who accepts crypto because there's not much practical benefits to it. And even investing in crypto has no global effects, because poor people just don't have any money to invest.You mentioned 2 points I find quite important:1) \" it's borderless and has less restrictions and regulations\"   - I agree here, it gives all people, as long as there is a internet connection, the opportunity to offer products and services and receive payments without having to deal with the Credit Card BS. So if you live in a poor community and you get the idea to offer prayers for good luck, maybe it becomes a big thing and the community is no longer poor....2) \" crypto is not used much in real world \" -  This is actually quite serious, if a prize for something without a proper use case goes up because of speculation, than there is a risk of a bubble that will burst at some stage......Just a thought experiment: If you wake up tomorrow and magically Bitcoin disappeared over night - what would be the consequences in the real world, apart from some guys shatttered dreams of future riches.. ?",
