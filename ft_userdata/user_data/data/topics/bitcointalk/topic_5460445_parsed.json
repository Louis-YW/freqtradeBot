Does referral link violate one of the forum rules?Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM4. No referral code (ref link) spam. [1]Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM1. Such posts as \"SELL SELL SELL\", \"I agree\", \"+1\", \"Support\", \"Watching\", \"Interesting\", \"LOL\", \"SCAM\", \"LEGIT\", \"FAKE\", other one word posts, posts consisting mostly of swearing, quote pyramids, useless introduction threads, threads about a topic already recently discussed in several other threads.I noticed that if some people bring legit site on this forum with their referral link, some people do point to number 4 of the Bitcointalk forum rules. But what the referral link is only on the OP's topic and not elsewhere? I mean if not spamming with it.",

For instance ref link like airdrops that we know doesn't have any meaningful content can be found violating the rules as they said No. 4.QuoteBut what the referral link is only on the OP's topic and not elsewhere? I mean if not spamming with it.For this, if is not obviously that such person interest is to promote their ref link on the Op or thread. Let say, there are some other meaningful information op is trying to convey and we know that the efforts of his or her post is not channeled and centered on their ref link then we can say such topic or post isn't a spam neither are they promoting ref link  otherwise may come from a trusted member imo.I think mprep and other admin are in a good position to answer this questions since they are the people who implemented those law.",

I think the old topic created by 1miau should be helpful. Bitcointalk and reflinks: don't produce refspam, pleaseOP also used the same rule in his post, the one was used by your mentioned topic's OP. Means to say 1miau used the same rule to explain that Referrals came into spam category. And here in this topic OP asked about that rules. So, it indicates that, referral links are spams, and i recently like today, one of the topic in which i had posted. Was deleted due to the same referral link.The op of that post somehow input the referral code into the post but when we see it in the text editor it only shows there. It did'nt showed otherwise. The post was deleted. Now the query is, useful referrals links are also spam or not?My view here is no, because i have seen many service providers using other platform's to teach someone something and in the link section to the same platform they add their own referral link. At least these are not in the rules of Local boards. Because in local boards people are sharing referral links of airdrops etc.",

Because in local boards people are sharing referral links of airdrops etc. It's not true. You don't have to say what you don't know. I will not speak for all local boards, I will speak for the Russian local board. The Russian local board has rules for referral links. There is even a whole thread to discuss this issue.And the moderators of the Russian board xandry and Xal0lex strictly follow it. Thanks to them referral links are practically nonexistent. In the thread about forum rules there is an extensive explanation about referral links and there is even a local rule, according to which only \"official representatives of services, including ambassadors (you must be able to prove it at the request of a moderator)\" are allowed to post referral links.",

I believe it’s acceptable to post referral code here that is part of your service offered in the forum.The rules of spamming referral link was introduced when ponzi scheme is very popular on Bitcoin that makes many user spam referral code on random thread that is not related to the topic.

The manner of approach of the user is the most important factor when considering if a referral constitutes a spam. That's natural where spamming the referral link won't make the situation tolerable from the rules and will most likely get deleted by mods. From the word spamming means that no matter how it brings meaningful content but when it is spammed then it will get deleted all of it or only one remain like it will served as the main thread for the site that a forum member is promoting. Many people doesn't like spam and no matter what it is as long as someone is spamming then that post will be deleted.",
