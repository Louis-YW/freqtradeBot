  "content": "Accept bitcoin before it can be yours. People can decide something for their selfs whether good or bad, first of all we all have rights to do what so ever we want to do as long as it does not harm the next door neighbor but in my country the government has done what will harm the next door neighbor's. On Bitcointalk I have seen topics that say Bitcoin is not for everyone maybe that thought is based on their own opinions, but I totally diagree with it, if I may ask who will see something good and reject it? No body, even if some people rejected it, it might be because of the laws from the higher authorities like government or military. Bitcoin is for everybody, but we all have to accept it before it can be ours so I conclude that we must first accept bitcoin before we can have access to it and if you don't accept bitcoin you can't invest on it.",

      "body": "That is the problem that some people face not because they don't want to but because they can't due to the government's action by banning the use of cryptocurrency in their country and if someone is found using cryptocurrency then they will be sent to jail for violating their rules. The other situation is where the person doesn't believe in cryptocurrency especially Bitcoin because they believe it is a scam (due to less knowledge about it) therefore they say that Bitcoin is not for everyone. Honestly, I think some people are only saying that here in the forum is because they want to post something like that just to meet the total of posts that are required before they get paid.",

In every aspect of life, you'll really need acceptance, but prior to that, to make yourself acceptable, you'll still need to learn it.",

Bitcoin was created by satoshi indeed for everyone, regardless of race, sect, or certain sects to be able to own/buy bitcoins. So in that way, bitcoin is absolutely neutral for anyone, for people who want it and for people who are interested in getting into the world of bitcoin investment. So basically satoshi creates bitcoin assets, for everyone.But besides all that, there are rules in every country that apply to crypto digital currencies such as bitcoin, which must be obeyed by every community. Because it cannot be denied, that not all countries in the world allow digital currencies such as bitcoin to circulate and be owned by their people.So in addition to all the freedom that satoshi gives about bitcoin for everyone. But still there are other rules that apply to everyone in their respective countries regarding bitcoin.And the opinion that you express is not wrong, because to own or invest in bitcoin, you really need a sense of interest, desire and will result in a feeling of acceptance of the bitcoin. So your opinion, all of that is clear and indeed it must be done by anyone who wants to start investing or trading in bitcoin.",

Yes, there are some people who arent tech smart and so dont grasp cryptography.To put it another way, its like handing a skateboard to a fish: some people just wont get it, no matter how much we Bitcoin aficionados might desire for everyone to get a piece of that crypto pie. The government stuff, on the other hand, is a complete mess. There are different norms and customs in that realm. Accept Bitcoin, dont accept Bitcoin; in the end, it comes down to what you and your next-door neighbor's dog are comfortable with.",

Bitcoin needs a learning period before anyone can begin using it with ease.

Although some people are still closed to Bitcoin, it does not mean that Bitcoin will collapse, Bitcoin will still stand tall and will reach a market capitalization of trillions of dollars in the future.",

Bitcoin is not for everybody because it is not compulsory to use it as a form of payment. Before now trade by barter was the main medium of buying and selling of goods. Then it was compulsory because it was the only way you engage in trade. Fiat currency was introduced and barter became obsolete. Now everybody must use fiat to buy and sell. Until bitcoin becomes a generally acceptable currency, it is not compulsory to use it. And if it is not mandatory to use it, it is not for everybody. We don't know what the future holds, but the world may move to an era when fiat might become obsolete and the only option might be cryptocurrencies. At this time, Bitcoin will not still be for everybody because there are other cryptos. Bitcoin will be for everybody only if it is the only currency.",

Of course, it is for everyone, but specifically for those who understand the values of it, for those who realise how cool Bitcoin investment can be, and for those who want to be in charge of their financial control, because Satoshi's idea of creating Bitcoin was for the common man and woman to be able to have their own financial management under their control in a decentralised and digital way, so that those financial elites wouldn't really be in charge of how we spend our money all the time.In the bank today, there's some kind of huge amount of withdrawal you will want to pull out of your account, and your account officer will call in to ask you what you really want to do with the money, but with one's money in Bitcoin, no one will have to quarry you for how much you are withdrawing or depositing.
