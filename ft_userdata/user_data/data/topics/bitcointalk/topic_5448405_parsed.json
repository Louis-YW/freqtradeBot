      "body": "In the context of bitcoin financial freedom simply means having control of your money without any restrictions or regulations from the government or banks. Imagine wanting to send some funds to someone outside the country and the government puts a restriction of the certain amount that can be sent this could be frustrating but with bitcoin it doesn’t have this kind of restriction. Nonetheless I need to point out something that bitcoin isn’t a get rich quick scheme so having this narrative that you could be super rich with it is a bad mindset getting. Yes there is profit for a an investment done but that is possible some that can hold the coins for a very longer time. Also you don’t necessarily need to hold 1btc but can purchase fractions of it (satoshi) and as the price increases they also rise in value. The clear rule in investing into bitcoin is to invest an amount that is losable. This is clear because of some certain downturn periods (bearish period) that bitcoin faces.",

      "body": "QuoteCan owning 1 Bitcoin make you rich in 2023?The correct answer is YES and NO, and if you are wondering how this is possible, the answer is very simple. 1 BTC in a third world country and the same BTC somewhere in a developed country definitely have a different value for the one who owns it. For someone, the current $30 000 per 1 BTC would represent a real fortune, for someone else it would certainly not be the case. This means that everything depends on where you live and how you perceive the term \"rich\".Quote from: Bureau on April 11, 2023, 02:34:54 PMWhen I understood the true potential of Bitcoin. I joined this forum as I am not someone who can spare the money required to invest for 1BTC. I hope you know that you don't have to buy 1 BTC to own it, you can also buy very small shares if you consider that the smallest unit of BTC \"satoshi\" 0.00000001, and you can theoretically buy BTC worth only a few $.Quote from: Bureau on April 11, 2023, 02:34:54 PMSo, my question is can Bitcoin give a life that I dreamt as a child. Is it possible to gain financial freedom? What exactly does financial freedom means in context of Bitcoin?It is possible to make some dreams come true by investing some money in Bitcoin, but considering that you yourself admit that you don't have any money (or that you don't have enough to buy 1 BTC), then that dream cannot come true literally overnight. If you set a goal and if you persist in it, maybe one day you will achieve your dream.As for financial freedom, Bitcoin gives you the possibility to be your own bank, in other words to control the private keys that allow you to spend the Bitcoin you bought. Simply put, only you have control over what you own, of course if you want it and if you understand how to achieve it. You buy Bitcoin, send it to your address in a non-custodial wallet (desktop, hardware wallet) and after you make a backup and store it safely, you have your own bank",

What exactly does financial freedom means in context of Bitcoin?If the life you dreamt of as a child was to use a censorship resistant and permissionless currency, then yes BTC is created for that and you can use it and enjoy that freedom, but if the life you dreamt of as a child was to be very wealthy, and you want to do that with BTC, i'm sorry you cannot, except you're an early adopter. If you mined BTC when it was just created and you have been holding since then, you would be very rich through BTC now, but if you are just adopting now how can it just make you rich, you have to first of all buy it now with another currency and hold it, and your returns or how rich you can become depend on how much BTC you can buy now, and also how long you can hold it.",

If you're the type of bitcoin investor that's looking to go in for the long term, then there is a high chance of you hitting big if the price of bitcoin moves in the uptrend. Another thing you should not is that it's never too late to invest in bitcoin, if you look at the price change of bitcoin several months ago you'll see that it has increased significantly so assuming you bought one Bitcoin three months ago you'd have had plus ~$10,000 profit.",

Slide the bar to BTC to $1 mil, and things change, now it's also a thing of how much can you afford not only to invest, but also how much you can wait for your dream!Quote from: Bureau on April 11, 2023, 02:34:54 PMSo, my question is can Bitcoin give a life that I dreamt as a child.Unless you tell us, only god knows what you dreamt as a child, if those dreams include a 30-room mansion by the seaside with a tennis court and a Bugatti La Voiture Noire parked between ten other sports cars, probably not! Everyone has different dreams, some dream of a tiny house in the mountains and just a quiet and normal life, earning a bit over the median pension, some are going nuts unless you go into details no one will be able to even have an opinion on it.Quote from: Bureau on April 11, 2023, 02:34:54 PMWhat exactly does financial freedom means in context of Bitcoin?Again, it depends!For some, it means having enough assets and savings to never care about money in their whole lifetime.For others, it means not being at the mercy of a 3rd party, with no bank, no authority, no government being able to seize your wealth.But not that many really care about the second part anymore, the focus is on the first.",

Having 1 BTC isn't necessarily enough to make you rich. In fact, some people could spend one Bitcoin in just one week. It really depends on where you are located and the minimum cost of living in your country. Additionally, it depends on how you want to use the money. Some people have expensive tastes and would spend it on luxury items. On the other hand, some people can survive for a long time with one Bitcoin if they know how to budget and avoid frivolous spending.",

I do not know where you are from so i can not tell about  you but for some countries, it is very costly that  BTC1 could get a lot of things for any holder.  You can buy it in fractions as you can afford to and  hold for a long term so that when the price of bitcoin appreciate in value, your invest appreciate as well.",
