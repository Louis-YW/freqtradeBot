  "content": "One of the most important things I have learnt from this forum is how to secure your digital assets.Here are a couple  of things you should avoid after setting up your air gapped device or when installing your wallet generally;1. Avoid visiting sites with low trust score and security warnings. These security warnings are usually displayed in your browser.2. Use secure browsers like;    BRAVE which you can get from their official page       https://brave.com/    TOR browser which  you can get from.      https://www.torproject.org    You can even make use of the local browser that comes with your OS as long as  your privacy is safe and your device is protected from malware.3.And most importantly always get your softwares from their official pages especially when installing a wallet software. This will reduce your chances of installing a malware or getting an altered or monitored version of that software. Here are some official pages of some of the most secure and popular wallet softwares LEDGER. https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live TREZOR. https://trezor.io/ MYCELIUM. https://wallet.mycelium.com/ ELECTRUM. https://electrum.org/And most importantly Don't forget to keep your keys safe mate😁",

As redards your post, we should remember that when investing in Bitcoin, keeping your funds safe should be your top priority. If you're not sure how to do that, your investment could be in danger or at risk. Some people think that as long as they keep their access keys safe, their funds is secure. But in today's world, scammers have found tricky ways to steal your funds.To stay safe, you need to be smart and careful while browsing the internet. Don't click on \"allow\" requests from websites, as they might be trying to spy on your device. don't download software from sketchy or unknown websites because it could harm your device. Be cautious of apps that ask for too many permissions, if it's not from an official store, be extra careful. The world of investment is filled with a lot of potential threats one has to be smart and be vigilant as to what and how you choose to secure your investment.",

In other to be safe, you must avoid clicking links that you have no idea where it is coming from maybe through emails, social media, sms links, failing to make use of your browser in the sense that you do not type complete what you are searching for in your browser but using auto complete to finish it up.

      "body": "@Mia Chloe, There is one important thing that you have failed to include in your security warning details, which is getting OS from a direct dealer or licenced distributor. Reading through numerous threads with regard to security, malware, undetected viruses, and all sorts of malicious attacks from hackers, it's been proven that most of these viruses that target crypto holders and traders are primarily from the wrong OS. With the increase in crypto adoption, hackers have deemed it necessary to always improve their ways of stealing from those who are not security conscious enough.Most people buy OS from some roadside shop that was either downloaded from a non-trusted site or they just copy and paste it on a new CD without even knowing what it contains. When anyone buys and installs it on their system, they have the malware perfect where they want it to be looking for the best possible way and right time to steal for the users.Another means is when someone who has an existing airway licence happens to expire. Instead of purchasing a new one, you go ahead and go online in search of free window activators, which will lead you straight to the hands of those thieves. @dkbit98 identified and reported one of the famous window activators with a crypto-stealing tool on it . KMSPico Malicious Windows Activator Stealing Crypto  I see your list as incomplete if you don't give users a warning regarding the dangers of using the Windows OS. Even if they follow the right security procedures when running under a pirated window, they are not completely safe.",

Whether using a hardware wallet or software wallet things can get as ugly as you can imagine in a nightmare. There are cases like someone losing their hardware wallet while home shifting, some of them lost it because they kept it in a secure location in their own house and now they can't find it. Things can sound stupid but this happens. We have life, we have a routine and we get lost in that routine many times and forget things like that. Many times these wallets are used for cold storage meaning you do not really need them all the time. You have the address, you work your ass off and send all earned Bitcoin to such wallets, and then over time, we tend to forget where we have kept it. Quote MYCELIUM. https://wallet.mycelium.com/I don't trust this wallet after seeing its drawbacks. It has underdeveloped apps. Android has different features and iOS has just a simple \"representative\" sort of app. You can explore more. Better get Bitcoin Core downloaded.

As long as you don't visit strange links or sites labeled as harmful, you're safe using any browser. As for storage wallets, as many others have also mentioned, Ledger is no longer trusted and people have stopped using it.
