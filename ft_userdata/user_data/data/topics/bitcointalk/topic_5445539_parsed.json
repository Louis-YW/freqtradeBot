I tried the same right after seeing your post and await the result. I will share my result with you while you can wait for others if they can come up with any solution. You can always click on Mark all messages as read. But, this is not a permanent solution. It will there again once a user post a new reply on that bounty thread.",

The whole purpose of this feature is to keep you updated on new activity related to your posts. Quote from: cafter on March 19, 2023, 04:06:44 PMI participated first time in bounty campaign but how can i get rid of this unwanted notification.If you do not want to go through and read every single thread, you can simply click on \"mark all messages as read\" which will clear the list. At least until the next reply in one of those threads.",

AFAIK, there's no way to remove a thread from the new reply list after you have made a reply there. Just use the watchlist to follow threads instead, as you can easily choose what to add and remove from it.",

Usually, code changes should only be made if there is a critical issue or if there is a significant benefit to the user experience. In this case, the forum software works as it should.",
