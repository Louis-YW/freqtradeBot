  "content": "Newbies who have not yet invested in bitcoin or have bought their first bitcoin, or people that want to continue with the increase in their bitcoin portfolio should put in consideration of using Dollar-Cost-Average(DCA) to increase their bitcoin portfolio, as this is the most convenient way to accumulate bitcoin gradually without worries of the price movement of bitcoin. DCA is means that you are to maybe 10% of your income to buy bitcoin either weekly or monthly, it is just like you save some part of your income regularly in order for you to use in to achieve a goal in the nearest future.For those who don't have regular income but do have contracts that their money comes once in a while, there is what is called upfront DCA. Where you can buy use a certain amount once. Maybe let's say that assuming, you are monthly income and you budget $100 for DCAing monthly, if you are the person that is on contract based, when you get paid, you can use $800 to buy bitcoin which will be for four months DCA before you buy again. There are other methods, which one can buy bitcoin, which is buying at the dip and lump sum, but this method will only help old investors who have accumulated a significant amount of bitcoin. Why is the DIP not too encouraging for newbies is that, no one can predict the price movement of bitcoin when it will dip and if you are waiting for the dip to buy, you might not up using the money that you are keeping for an unforeseen challenges and it will not make you increase your bitcoin portfolio fast. Buying at the dip is good but anyone who is using DCA will have a better chance to increase his bitcoin investment because when bitcoin price dips, they will increase the funds that they are using to DCA and when the price of bitcoin gets, they can reduce the DCA amount. The high price that they bought at the dip will balance the low price that they buy when bitcoin price is very high.There is also what is called hyper DCA, this method is a kind of pattern that one can buy bitcoin anytime and not with a certain amount of money, just like the way MicroStrategy buys his bitcoin. For you to know that he is DCAing is when you add all the bitcoin that he has bought together, and how many years he has used to buy them. This will give you the average price by month or annually.Note that one can never increase his bitcoin investment portfolio through trading but rather you will decrease or loss your bitcoin through trading, because trading isn't something very easy as people thinks it is. HODLing is the only way out. You need to have a means of income to enable you buy bitcoin, and if your income is very low, try to get a second means of income, if you really believe in bitcoin. No amount is too small to invest with, the earlier the better as time waits for no one.",

It is challenging for both experienced and newbie people in this market. People are more keen on trading because they want to see quick results than wait too long time to see results with DCA.",

For most salaried people. I am not a newbie and I do it. Some investors may speculate and some can think that the price of bitcoin may still decrease, they can because of that not invest at once but start to DCA in a way that if their analysis or speculation is favoured, they will be able to buy more at a lower prices. Some investors will even buy more when the price of bitcoin becomes lower and some investors will invest all at once after many weeks of DCA when the price get to a lower targeted price.",

In terms of newbies their case seems different yes they will definitely accumulate good amount of Bitcoin with DCA strategy but it will take them a longer period of time. And most newbies might not have patience they just want to see their investment grow so badly and this might make them to go all in. One thing is to know how to DCA consistently and the other thing is to know that when it comes to DCA, patience is needed. When newbies overlook the Dip and without a structured DCA plan and blindly accumulate Bitcoin then its is no more called DCA it is called Gambling!",

So, I tried to search it and found out that, upfront DCA is like doing a lump sum investment in BTC.

HODLing is the only way out.Yeah, there is no doubt about that, DCA is not for traders instead it is for holders. Because holders are likely to get more benefits out of the DCA strategy because I have seen people doing DCA for more than 2 years and that does not come under the trading category. Many newbies might consider holding and trading the same thing but they should not, because both are two different investment plans.",

At least it is a good accumulation strategy and of course people have taken advantage of this strategy to get lower average prices.I think a lot of big investors are actually considering DCA - MicroStrategy is one I'm familiar with, but there are a lot of other big investors utilizing similar strategies. Buying on a dip with a lump sump is also not a problem because in my opinion you can still go back at another dip and buy in the same way - meaning you do DCA too without saving some of your budget on the first purchase.",

If you're going to buy $50 of bitcoin every week, then at least $1 is mining commission, and dependent on the exchange you use, you might get charged extra. For example, Binance charges 20,000 sat for withdrawing any amount to your non-custodial wallet.

For example,  if one person started to do DCA two years ago and did it every week, they would buy $100 worth of BTC every week, while another person started last year and did it every week with a buying capacity of $500 per week. Then I think that person will have more BTC now compared to the one who started to do DCA two years ago.

That goes for everyone, because even the experts and old adopters of BTC who have been doing DCA for a very long time might fall victim to their own emotions and become impatient and sell all of their BTC, or they might buy BTC by doing Lump Sum.",

So it is a calculated risk and you only investing what you can afford to lose, so even though you invested and the market price of Bitcoin dumps it doesnt matter, and you could easily HOLD at that time since it is just a small investment and you could easily gamble it, on long term you could slowly accumulate Bitcoin and after a few years for sure it's going to be a huge amount of investment, which probably going to be a good time since your probably planning to sell at the top or Bull run, so you could easily accumulate and at the same time waiting for the Bullrun easily. It was just like saving or something like paying your insurance monthly so it wouldn't really be a problem for most investors.",
