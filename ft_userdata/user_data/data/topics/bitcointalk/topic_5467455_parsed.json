But still good to hear this kind of warnings from this community.And maybe we have such victims from the Celsius bankruptcy and hopefully it can reach them and not be the next victims because it's going to be hard for them.

These scammers are always busy creating strategies to scam people in the name of helping people in bad times. It's even more important to think about how the scammers got your email address and sent you the email with the phishing link. Now sharing your personal information on any website has become risky because someone is sitting on the other side to steal your information in any way. This is really a lot to think about",

Gox who has been one of the ghost that still haunting us for many years, has been taken advantage by this scammers and made several websites as well, fake ones obviously to trap those victims because it's been years and they want to claim it right now. So just be careful guys, this scammers are really that smart to know which incoming projects have filed for bankruptcy and what is the next step for their customers like how to claim and then they created this fake websites.",

They do not change and develop their fraudulent methods and schemes. They exploit the news and trending events and create phishing sites so that the victim can connect his wallet. They rush to send phishing emails to as many emails as possible that they receive in some way or through social media, especially Twitter.Our role here is to always alert people and Keep them up-to-date with scams like the OP did and report all fraudulent things carried out by scammers, because the market is not devoid of newcomers, of course.",

This way, it increases the likelihood that someone will search and find the fraudulent service.",

So if someone is reading this out of nowhere and has the same story of having some claims on Celcius or any other closed service but eligible for that, it is not going to hurt you to take time and sit in your desk reading the validity and authenticity of what these websites are because if you don't, you might fall for one.",
