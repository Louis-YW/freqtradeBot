Even if it was an automatic message.Post here all the evidence you can collect before any action.Quote from: decodx on October 17, 2023, 05:48:19 PMHow do you know that you've won? Typically, you should receive an email from them explaining how to claim the prize. freebitco.in publicly announces the ID of the user who wins the prize after the lottery. This information is available to everyone, which opens up the possibility that anyone can claim on the Internet that they are the winner.",

All you have to do is secure your account since you claim you are the winner do not post anything that will compromise your identity and your account, the instruction is to contact them so contact them they have you in their database you are traced including your email they will not going to response to any emails but only your email so use the email that you've used to contact Freebitco.in and alert them through their social media that you sent email in response to the email you received coming from them.Update us after you receive your lambo and congratulations to you, you're one lucky guy.",

My guess is that you're one of them, that's why they immediately disregard your email. So, the best thing to do if you're the real winner and they didn't reach out to you is to provide them with all the proofs that you're indeed user 13517688 so that they would take you seriously. If you have proofs, try sending TheQuin a PM. I think he's a support staff of freebitco.",

I assume you know that there is a choice when it comes to the prize, a Lambo or $200k in BTC, and if you decide on this first, be sure that it will take time to get your prize, and I don't even want to speculate what the price is for something like that to be delivered, and of course how much tax do you have to pay to import such a car.If you are really a winner, then you just need a little more patience, you have already done the hardest part",

Another thing, how exactly they contacted you in order to inform you that you wont the price and are you sure that there wasn't any instruction how exactly to claim your prize?Quote from: Lucius on October 20, 2023, 12:35:06 PMI assume you know that there is a choice when it comes to the prize, a Lambo or $200k in BTC, and if you decide on this first, be sure that it will take time to get your prize, and I don't even want to speculate what the price is for something like that to be delivered, and of course how much tax do you have to pay to import such a car.Tbh, I don't think that anyone in their right mind would chose Lambo as God knows what kind of taxes you would have to pay in order to get that car to your country. After all, this lambo prize seems to me more like a good marketing stunt as it sounds better than giving xyz amount of dollars in BTC.",

After all, this lambo prize seems to me more like a good marketing stunt as it sounds better than giving xyz amount of dollars in BTC.  I'm not sure, but I think TheQuin once mentioned that no one has opted for a Lambo as a prize yet, but instead chose to receive an equivalent amount in BTC. This choice makes sense as it's much more practical.Speaking of TheQuin,  it's kinda strange that he has been away from the forums for so long. I hope everything's alright with him.@Kingqa980, if you're still waiting for a response to your messages, you might want to try PMing wetsuit. Even though he's not active on the forum, he should get an email notification.",
