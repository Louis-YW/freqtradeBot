Highly unlikely that this is the case for you.When a Lightning channel is opened you lock money in that channel that can be moved around between you and your channel partner. If you and/or your channel partner have more channels open, then routing is possible. Still the amount that can be moved is limited to little less than the channel capacity.Lightning transactions stay within Lightning normally, so how should this work that someone sends you via Lightning Network some magic amount of coins to one of your wallet receive addresses? Quote from: SME211 on April 06, 2023, 02:01:08 PMThe status of the transaction is pending and has been stuck in the Lightning Network for 3 months now.That's what the other party wants you to believe. Anyway, it sounds like total bullshit to me. You still think there's any truth in the story of the scammers or that \"someone\"?Quote from: SME211 on April 06, 2023, 02:01:08 PMHow can I find out why it is stuck and expedite the transaction?You can't because it's likely fake. Otherwise, provide transaction IDs or other verifyable data.",

OR it's rejected and unable to complete.No other options, there is no way for it to be pending.As others have said, this is a scam. Stop wasting time, your money is gone.-Dave",
