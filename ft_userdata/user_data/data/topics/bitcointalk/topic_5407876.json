  "content": "Ethereum classic (ETC) is six years old this month and it’s seen some significant gains during the last 14 days. In fact, ever since the penciled-in date for The Merge was revealed, ETC has risen in value alongside its counterpart ethereum (ETH).While ETH has seen a significant double-digit ​​45.7% gain in two weeks, ETC has jumped 124.2% in that same period of time. Despite the 124% rise, year-to-date, ETC is still down 34% and around 80% lower than the crypto asset’s all-time high at $167 per unit.

      "body": "Yes, it looks like ETC is getting a breath of fresh air right now as it could rise to a price of $33 (if I'm not mistaken). If the situation continues like this and ETC finds more support, there is a possibility that the price could continue to rise higher. But I'm not sure if the price can go beyond $100 because that's still a long way to go. Maybe if there is an altcoin season in the next month, it could trigger the price to go higher but if not, maybe the price will reach $50-$75 first. Maybe we can analyze and find more information about this to know what we should do.",

It is more obvious when Ethereum is moving so close to its switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. The stop of Proof of Work for mining on Ethereum network will force miners to switch their rigs to Ethereum Classic.People believe that when more miners come, the network of Ethereum Classic will become bigger and stronger. They believe they will more games and manipulation with Ethereum Classic.",

It seems like the legit reason why the sudden pump happened these few weeks, If only we have some information before this event, we would really make a decent amount of income but Damn! this whole process is decisive itself because no one really knows that it could happen sooner. Some news is not really clear so when the increase in the price of ETC is becoming clear the last week, there are more people investing in it because they see the movement of the price caused by the rumors is true.",

Miners have no choice but to switch to something they can mine again or just go with the flow and buy Ethereum for the staking process. I'd choose to find new and the pick is Ethereum Classic. It's a win-win situation for both and I think this is also the reason why Vitalik said something good about POW in public. It's not to erase them but to give them a clue where they should be now and it worked. Both coins have their gains and this ain't even over yet.",

Anyway ETC still has the future because eth miners will have this as the best option if ETH turns into complete Proof of Stake based blockchain so this is just a preview so its better to accumulate some ETC not completely for the security of the capital.",

But still though, many followed his tweets and listen when he open his mouth. The price is still above $40.00 the last time I check, still a good price in my opinion.",
