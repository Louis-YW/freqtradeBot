  "content": "Hi everyone, about a month ago I made a post about having insider info for a soccer match and I asked the community what the best way was to take out a large loan. I had a lot of people advise me not to do so, so I took your advice and didn't take out a loan, instead I just placed the amount I already had in my account.Anyway, the bet won easily so I couldn't help but feel like I should've taken out the loan... I wanted to share a match on here in case anyone wants to follow along, I'm unable to place a large bet on this so I'm hoping someone else takes advantage. I hope this isn't against any community guidelines.

This gambling thing must be taken with great responsibility, the most important thing is that you make a sustainable plan where you have options to have profits, even if they are small, but they are profits, it is not the same to win a little bit than to lose, because losing is having less money, winning even if it is not much, is winning and represents an increase in money, anyway I congratulate you on your victory.",

You might regret it in the long run and you might have to pay for nothing. Imagine that outcome, would you want that?Did you bet on the match that you have shared here?",

I'd rather have regrets than being haunted what could have happened if your bet goes south especially if you don't have the capacity paying it off.Also, you can gauge how much money you can bet based on the odds of winning; if you have a gut feeling (backed by research) that you're likely going to win, you can increase the wager, and or decrease it if not. I'm not sure if anyone do this method in gambling since I just learned it through trading, but you can do it instead of taking out a loan.",

I'm going to recommend you the opposite: take loans to bet, and follow what the tipsters tell you, you'll get very rich very fast.For many years I have seen people saying that they take loans to bet or invest, and they usually end up badly, very badly. Either they get it wrong the first time, and stay for years paying the loan for a stupid thing, or they get it right, become greedy and keep betting or investing more, until they lose, and the result is the same, paying for years.",

You will only take loans if you think that it will hit 100%, but even then the terms of the loan would require you to do staggered payments on the entire loan for the loaner to get some profit off of you, so accept the fact that you'll still not be cleared of debt even if you win this event. Your next move would be to keep the other half of your winnings intended for repayment of the loan, and then you can get greedy from there.",

It seems like you have regrets that you followed the community's advice and didn't take a loan to play the so called fixed game. Maybe you can next time so you see if it works for you. However the danger in developing such an unhealthy habit and why majority of forum members adviced you against it is that starting to take loans for gamblingÂ  can lead to you becoming accustomed to that dangerous culture of taking loans. If you take the loan and place on the fixed bet, if it works once...You will always want to try it till the day it gets you into trouble. So the advice is so that you avoid creating the problems for yourself before it starts.",

When you take loans to gamble, the game may not turn out well for you, and to pay the first loan you may end up taking more loans and this may lead you to become not just an addicted gambler but also a debtor. But when you gamble with your money, you may not win but the pains and pressure will not be as much as someone who took a loan and has no means of paying it back. Remember the information you got about a particular game may fall you as most soccer tipsters use the past history of a particular club to predict the outcome of a current match.",

However, it's true that the community will not suggest you to borrow money to gamble as it will double the risk. As I understood from the start message, this result was meant as \"guaranteed\"? How can this be proven? The odds are quite modest - in almost half of the cases, the better will guess such an outcome without any prompts. In addition, if the \"prediction\" turned out to be unsuccessful, then you can simply delete the thread and, given the small number of commenters, few people will see it.

If you have an insider information and you have gone to take a loan to play on it, you remember it is also a risk to go for a loan for gamble. You don't bet with loan and it is advised to bet with what you have so don't when you lose you don't get into debt with other people and that will reduce depression.",
