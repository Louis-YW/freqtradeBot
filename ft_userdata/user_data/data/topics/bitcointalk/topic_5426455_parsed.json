We have 28 live support agents working overtime right now to handle the influx of World Cup bets and the massive amount of promos we are currently offering.

We apologize that your issue has not been settled within your expectations but it will be a little longer until we can verify your bets. This accusation was a bit rushed and 100% unfounded.What kind verification do you need to do on fixing bet result like this. First of all how  the bet marked as refunded and loss? Second why it takes so long to verify this kind of result while the official score available publicly on the internet which you can use as reference to check his bet slip.I’m just curious OP that you have identical bets on all of your slip. I’m just assuming that those refund is due to the multiple same bet type which sometimes not allowed when you read the casino ToS. I believe this issue happened too on fortunejack which they refund the other one and honor only the first bet. This might be the reason for the refund but the lose bet should be in profit based on the official result of FIFA.This is the same issue with Fortunejack: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5368279.0",

If you did not truly win the bet, why the refund to your account? This is part of the nonsense that betting companies are playing, and I am with the OP on this. You should however go by the advice of @joeperry which was clearly stated in the second reply as I don't want to repeat what he has explained.

Since your issue has already been brought to their attention and forum member's attention, a proper resolution of this issue should come from BC.GAME. There is some confusion about the data here.
