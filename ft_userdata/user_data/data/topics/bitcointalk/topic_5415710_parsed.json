  "content": "Hello bitcointalkers, I was wondering that When Bitcoin Evolved almost in 2009 when it was in cents and still it is only 13 years old, not even even adult if we compare it to the Human life etc. I know it sounds funny.Also if we compare this to the Stock market, If I am gone wrong that might be at least 400 to 500 years old and still Woprd economy is around us..So my point was that Bitcoin is evolving day by day with many bull and bear seasons, I want to say that Bitcoin first Bull market was almost in 2013 when it touched only 100 dollars and that was just big milestone and now Bitcoin is trading per second in only 100 dollars and that is just timing things. So I am going to my main point and that is Bitcoin hit almost 70k dollars and that was just big and bigger milestone and currently it is just trading above 18k dollars. And in my opinion that is currently going in Bear Market. And that bear market will turn till Next halving and that might be in 2024 as per block data. So I was wondering that wether this bear market will be helpful for new people or not. Cause many people thoughts are different than old people in crypto. So I am preparing myself in Bear market so that I might be able to stand in next bull run that might be the biggest bull run for Bitcoin and that might be just all time high to almost 200k dollars as compared to 2021 Data. I am writing this article so that big bitcointalk members that are since 2015 and have very very god knowledge in cryptocurrency and can advise me and many other people that are new.",

      "body": "Not sure exactly what you are getting at, but I think of it in long terms, don't worry about the short term markets. Take a look at what bitcoin is, and how it is evolving, and make your decision on whether or not you want to own some. For me, yes I like it in general, and I think it is worth having some, especially in light of how money in general is printed and invented out of thin air. And yes the merit system is weird, but unless you are doing sig campaigns, it doesn't really matter that much, so just post and have conversations, and hopefully you will eventually get some merits. But begging for some, even if you pretend you are not, isn't really a good look, and probably won't get you any merits.",

      "body": "imagine there are 2 numbers to think about.. the market price that wiggles up and down.. which is speculation.. think of that as the ocean tide that has waves that go up and downthen imagine another metric of \"value\". this is the 'base sea level' which slowly over years goes up as more water stays in the oceans, and raises the base sea level slowly over the yearsin 2010 the cheapest cost to get bitcoin on the entire planet(the base value) started at ~ $0.10 where it was CPU miningin 2011 the cheapest cost to get bitcoin on the entire planet(the base value) started at ~ $0.20 where it was still CPU mining but more got involved..then came GPU mining which was more efficient so it caused the difficulty to jump.. it also triggered the volatility of speculations. the base value raised to about $2. but the speculation wave(tsunami) caused a $30.00 speculative price wave. every ATH tsunami is a temporary event that causes the sea level to adjust and settle at a new level.. dont ever think of ATH tsunami waves as value or an amount the sea level should stay at, at that time.. so the CPU-GPU change sparked a movement of 100x price and a 8x base value change. so the price settled down nearer to the new value line again the price in 2012 moved to $6 before the halving and $15 after the halving, where the base value beneath also raise, but not as muchbut general sentiment of speculation pushed the price upto $100 due to media news about bitcoin. but the base value was ~$X0in 2013 with more GPU mining brought the value up to $X0 and the price over $100.. then ASIC mining took over from GPU mining. causing the the base value to move to a couple hundred, but the speculative price moved to $1200 before settling down againthe base value moved slowly for a few years. as did the price.where the 2016 halving moved the price form an average of $450 to $900. then new gen asics which were more efficient cause and the development politics of an upgrade causing a win for big corporations wanting a feature, caused a speculative 2017 ATHall im saying isif you follow the history of big events/changes to bitcoin. and also calculated the most efficient mining costs on the planetyou can work out where the base sea level is.. and also calculate the most reasonable expensive mining costs on the planet you can work out the top limit of where the next ATH can possibly peak out atin 2021 $70k was the top limit. there was no real chance of a $100k-$500k btc in 2021. because if everyone on the planet can mine for less.. why would they buybut the base value waterline is no $0. its about $15k this year. so by working out these things you can work out if your buying at a time of great value. or at a large premium of speculated large wave actionbuying while cheap is always great time.. compared to this years $15k-$95k window of which the speculative wave action could have the price move within. you buying near to the base waterline amount is a great buy. dont expect $200k this year. the max is still only a bit under $100k but if you follow the history of the cycles of halving events and mining costs evolutions. you will see the potential future prices and value will be higher than previous years",

Yes, both market conditions are very important in the crypto market. You can’t be profitable when there is bullish season if you never start buying and storing your coins during the bear market so both bring opportunities to be profitable in the market. Otherwise, if you are just eager for the bullish season to come without good preparation in the bear season and without high patience, you will never be successful in your investments.",

If you take a long-term historical look l realize that bull and bear markets are an unavoidable part of howthe stock market operates.from 1957 to 2018, there were ten bull markets and ten bear markets. During that period,the average bull market lasted 55 months and gained over 150%, and the average bear market lasted just under a year and lost around 34%. The takeaway here is that major market drops tend to happen quickly and their dips pale in comparison to the steady march of economic growth and the longer bull markets that accompany it. That's why we here, at The Motley Fool,take a long-term view and generally advise folks to keep money in the market unless they'll immediately need it in the next couple of years because timing buys and sells around market tops and bottoms is incredibly tough to do.",
