They offering high reward for investors and also for referels to attract investors. I found out some evidence which clearly indicate that this project is very risky to invest...In their website they claiming that they have 385k users worldwide but if we check their social media twitter profile so they have only 272 followers (All followers 100% fake and bot followers). Domain is just registered 10 days old and registered for one years. They claiming address in UK while domain is registered from US(maybe use VPN or any other trick).Quote Registered On:2023-08-25Expires On:2024-08-25City:TempeState:ArizonaPostal Code:85284Country:USPhone:+1.4806242599 Domain checking Source Their package details is below Â look at the last package offering 2550$ for 30 days. They wanted that some users buy this package and then they will run away. cdmg posts has been reported and one post already deleted but he continuesly posting. If any DT member felt that it is Ponzi scheme then i will request to tag this spammer for stop promoting spam in this forum.",

One hilarious thing that I found out upon digging further... well, \"further\" doesn't justify what I said because I looked at one image of their \"customer\" and the rest of it was spent laughing my ass off --I mean, that's Danny Ocean sitting next to another stolen image-- is that they fabricated their customer review with fake profile, so yes, definitely another red flag. About the company, though, I agreed with what Gladiatorcomeback said. I think it's legit and real company that they borrowed without the company's consent. Crypto Mining Service, Ltd. is a real company, given they were striken off and threatened to be dissolved on 6th of June and fought the action to be discontinued by fulfilling the required document one month later.",

I will support the flag created by Rikafip, and I hope you all will also report these domains to the registrar sites. Thanks",

      "body": "There is something about ponzi scheme promoters and that is why I am not always in a haste to judge ponzi schemers. There are two categories of ponzi scheme promoters;The ignorant promoters The real ponzi schemers (maybe the founders or primary benefactors)The people in the first category are the people whose money are already collected and/or scammed and they are encouraged to bring in more people so tha they can be paid. I do not blame people in this category because I was a victim in my early days. I had to use all my social media handles to ignorantly promote scam because of the pressure to cash out. The second category are the real scammers who first occupied the oily spots and then send out the second category (victims) to spread the virus. These are the real criminals.",

I think the name is being used by scammers without the consent of the actual real company.

But if you have time to post those conversation (it shall act as a reference), you can start a scammer flag on them. It's a stronger flag so warning signs are hardened as well once the flag is active, see: Overview of the trust flagsSadly, domain registar is handled by godaddy and I've usually seen them having not-so-helpful approach/responses when it comes to reporting.",
