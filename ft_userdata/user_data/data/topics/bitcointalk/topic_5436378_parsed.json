Let's start it.We are the players who are plying to achieve rewards in the game and our primary priority is to achieve that reward and that is Bitcoin on its ATH value, not the cyclical value. The actual potential value now there are levels. Levels mean to say time to time ATHs of the bitcoin cycle on every cycle we receive rewards, as we hold BTC from the bear zone to the peak of Bull and book massive profit. Now as in a game, you have to suffer from the difficulties or enemies in this game these traps, enemies or difficulties are these platforms, I can give a bunch of examples but that is not what I am trying to explain. So from these traps, we have to be consistent and play one time two times, and so on until we achieve the final level. Â Dear now the answer to the question from this example is all of these are interconnected yes my analysis is that Binance was aware of FTX's bankruptcy, and even from sources it is confirmed Binance offered some funds on FTX reserves without flowing them into the market as collateral.Then Binance played a wonderful card by CZ and boom one strong competitor is out of the competition now. NDRC, China, Luna, MT Gox, Binance, and FTX are nothing but time-to-time enemies of our players. Their motive is to break us and trap our funds. Be careful.....#bitcoin community.",

He acted responsively protecting his reputation, his platform and his customers.After that, CZ even advised SBF on how to act towards the crisis. He told him to answer all the questions in public, to not hide anything.",

Crypto is a smaller world than we imagine, especially regards these big companies. These people know each other and make partnerships all the time, lending or borrowing money, launching projects together, etc... Due to the level of close contact and relationship they have, I believe it's impossible if one company is going bankrupt and its pairs don't know about it. Gossips go around, and employees leak it to acquaintances from other companies or even to CEOs they have access.",

Binance may have been trying to do a lot of sell offs at once to reduce their risk after luna collapsed and wiped out quite a lot of their free investment capital (and ftx's). This seems like it could've been something that started ftx's insolvency issues too (along with bailing out other services that were insolvent without having the funding for them).I don't think it's possible binance would know for definite what they'd destroy by devesting ftt and other coins (I don't think it's unreasonable to assume they'd shake out a few exchanges by doing that and then launching their \"proof of reserves\" program).",

Perhaps more things will come out in the future but as it stands the whole situation is shady. Right from the get-go? No, not really. But CZ eventually realized that something was fishy about FTX and the way they handle their customers funds, thus the $500 million liquidation. He's as transparent as anyone in that situation can be. He let the people know that something was wrong with FTX, which was his reason to pull out their investments in the company, whether this caused a bank run or not is still up for debate, but I'm leaning towards the latter, because losing a competitor in a still budding industry like this is tantamount to a whole infrastructure collapse. Something that he of all people, is not keen about. Anyhow, the damage has set in and we are slowly recovering from the fuckups of SBF. If you're trying to pin the blame to CZ for letting people know about the issues that FTX hid from their customers, go for it, but it doesn't change the fact that SBF mismanaged FTX funds, even went so far as to gamble some of it in hopes of recovering losses to fund customer withdrawals.",

CZ only owns 500 million FTT, and if FTX has more than 10 billion reserves as SBF's girlfriend claims, if CZ sells all FTT to kill FTX intentionally, he can't do it either. So, the obvious problem is that FTX is having a very serious internal financial crisis, if CZ is not the one to clarify things, sooner or later, FTX will go bankrupt.",
