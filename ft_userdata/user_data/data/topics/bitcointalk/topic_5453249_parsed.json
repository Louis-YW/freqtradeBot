I don’t know how easy it is to get that request accepted but I like the idea and it’ll be great if we have such boards here in the local board. The board is always choked up with similar topics and discussions, if they can be separated into different sub-boards, we can get to discuss more intensively on the topic that matters most at that time rather than seeing similar discussions filled up in the first page.",

Let's see how we can connect the nods with linking politics vs cryptocurrency in 9ja, we may further discuss government perception on Bitcoin /cryptocrunrry in Nigeria and the inflation rate within the economy, such Discussions can not be made on the general board since it may look political even though it covers some grey areas in bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoptions",

Man, you make good point here wey good to reckon with. You see this issue of attack on Nigerians, I am a witness infact I have had the experience too. It is very dissappointing though but we need to be careful because our board now is a big target and we know that based on the happenings here. I would advise that we take it gradually and step by step to achieving all we want. We should be happy we got our request granted to us when others are yet to receive theirs. The next thing I expected of us is to take time to building our local board so that we could have something tangible and meaningful when making any further request.As you have said with respect to posts here, since we don't have our own moderator,  it would be difficult to delete some post but the only option left for us now is ignoring that topic created so that the the person who created that topic would be reasonable enough to count his teeth with his tongue.I would encourage us to engage our local board frequently so as to keep it more active but not just that, let it be more coordinated and organized so that if any of the global moderators visits to examine how far we have gone, they would have no option than to commend us and give us our child board without much stress on their own.",

Many off topics are posted on the main board.  If there is an off topic childboard, it will compel anyone trying to create a topic to put more efforts or it would be moved to off topic.Also, my people have much interest in politics, having a politics childboard will be OK and this will enable the mainboard to consistent of mainly bitcoin related matters.Thanks!There is no harm, whether he approves or not.",
