  "content": "today i would like to present you 4 slides about 'wormhole attack in lightning network'.in a wormhole attack, a node operator with two nodes at the beginning and end of the route forwards a payment to itself, but cheats to steal honest charges from the nodes in the middle of the route.in a nutshell, the wormhole attack allows two colliding users on a payment path to exclude intermediate users from participating in the successful completion of a payment, thereby stealing the payment fees which were intended for honest path nodes.in the following github link this process is also explained: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/issues/3758i also found a very interesting 30-page report on the subject: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/472.pdf  https://twitter.com/BTCillustrated",

Like, if we will get visited by Aliens from a different Galaxy next 100 years? It is similarly unlikely. Is it even possible to have a scenario where Lightning at a certain scale can be attacked? Even if, coders will have already a solution to prevent it? What I want to ask: Participants in a wormhole attack will suffer a loss or get punished? What is coder's approach to prevent such attack? As usual, Bitcoin devs are known for developing a safe solution.",

AFAIK, there isn't a banlist like Bitcoin Core has, or even if there is, it is non-trivial to detect that this kind of activity is happening.For now there is not, but if this does become an issue I'm sure it will be added. Lets face it, many things were added to the BTC protocol over the years because something happened. Or something happening became a larger possibility. But for the moment, if it does happen to someone you can bet after a lot of head scratching and posts on the discussion boards the next time that node did something like that or another node did the same thing a ban list is going to get to the top of the to do list.Quote from: NotATether on September 21, 2023, 06:51:00 AMQuote from: stompix on September 17, 2023, 12:40:14 PMExactly and this is why it will never be a real threat because instead of the third guy whom you want to cheat, you can BE! that guy and take all the fees perfectly normal yourself!
