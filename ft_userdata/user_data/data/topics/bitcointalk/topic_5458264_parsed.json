That was why most times the mods or admin kept deleting some of the replies and comments they found not valuable. I think the best is to pin them at the top as Upgrade00 already suggested but it should be a reason and meaningful ones to be pinned.",

If I check some threads, I see some people already posting what is on first page with no added information to gain from the thread again.This is the main reason I avoid megathreads, even those that I've created myself and have developed over 10 to 20 pages of replies, even though I can still contribute to the topic, without repeating myself. After some point, only spammers reply to meet their quota for their signature campaign, repeating what has been said numerous times in the previous replies. Even if we suppose that there are a few decent posts among the 20-page-long thread, they're lost in the spam of other users and go unnoticed. The most annoying of all is quoting what has been said in the starting post and posting their completely irrelevant reply, with zero attempt to create a proper discussion and interaction with other users.",

Sometimes, spammers spread spam in those threads, and the discussion could just die off, but if the OP feels the topic is very important,Â  he or she can bump the topic once in a while. In my opinion, to keep those topics from dying off, the best thing to do is bump the thread once in a while. At least the forum doesn't forbid bumping a post; what's forbidden is bumping more often.Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",

But we can't just go back to such a topic to go and continue discussion over there, even if you want to. In a thread that consists of about 10â€“50 pages and you as a newbie happen to just come across such a post, how will you be able to read through such a huge page in order to check if a concern you could have raised has been discussed or not? And if you happen to wake up in such a thread, others say you are necroposting.Â For me, when I see threads that are very informative and there is an area of concern, it will be helpful to quote a few words from there referencing the original author, and anyone who wants more information regarding that could possibly go there and read more.",

Newbies should learn to make proper use of the search engine so they do not breathe duplicate topics. In my opinion, any thread thatâ€™s gone past fifth page will only have repeated comments from spammers and posters trying to complete weekly post quota, most times after the discussion has progressed to the 5th-7th pages, there is a high chance that the thread will be derailed with other conversations that has nothing to do with the original topic. You will find a lot of these mega threads in the gambling section, thatâ€™s why shit posters love to make their posts there.",

If so, you have the option to go read that thread or the multiple threads on the subject. If the topic hasn't been posted in for a while and you have something that adds to the topic that has value, feel free to post and get the topic back to life. If you add nothing to the conversation and post anyways, you're necrobumping a topic and there is a possibility it gets reported and deleted. Multiple infractions could lead to a ban.What ends up happening instead of what I said above is people do not want to search or they do not want to read a whole topic if they do search. So instead, they make a new topic and get their answers as well as are able to get more posts for their weekly quota by engaging with other users who have posted.",

I mean it's dynamic there are a lot of things that change technology keeps on improving so there are a lot of new topics that are going to be made. Also, there are topics that are just questions about some things, if the OP's question is already answered they can lock that thread already since the OP is already satisfied with the answer. There are topics that are going to be the same like for example topics about ordinals I remember there are a lot of threads that is related to ordinalsThese old topics are not dumped or dusted into the cloud, This topic is still saved in the cloud and anyone could still reply and see this topic which is really useful for a lot of members, members could just read the discussions online, and this topics also appear on google searches so it's definitely useful which is the reason the goal of the forum.",

In short words, there will be more unnecessary content on those valuable threads which will hurt the value of real content. So the best way for newbies who came to this forum that if they want to learn something about merit system, trust system, or if they want to know about how they can download electric wallet, how they can configure it, or how they can avoid themselves from getting scammed in crypto sphere.Then all they have to do is, put these keywords in search bar if btt forum and hit enter or they can write these keywords in Google Search Engine and at the end just type another keyword of Bitcointalk and the relevant topic will come. And the other way is to get information using Ninjastic tool, I hope newbies will also not aware of it and your intentions are to inform them about it by keeping the thread of ninjastic tool alive but alternative way is you can tell those are are searching for it.Another drawback of keeping all those thread alive is the new threads will never be on first page which will lose the interest of old users whose quantity is more than newbies. It means, in providing the facilities to new ones we will lose the old ones.",
