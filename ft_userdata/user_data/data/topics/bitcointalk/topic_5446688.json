There is nothing reprehensible in this. You need to find out the minimum requirements for a phone, buy a few used phones cheaply and try it if you are not afraid of KYC.And in order to use the phone to the maximum, you need to find a few more similar projects. Maybe it will be possible to earn money to buy equipment for mining.",

They claim KYC as the excuse to collect user info.You never need KYC to mine, it's only needed when you want to exchange to fiat. It is possible to mine using a phone but there is only one legimitate miner that I'm aware of and you mine POW algorithmsjust like any other miner. But it's a waste because it will earn much less than even a small desktop or laptop CPU.It's best to avoid anything claiming to be phone mining.",

Very true and i agree on that.And in the past there was already something about some User data and Informations was sold from that Pi mining KYC.I mean its now years since that all started with that Pi mining and as for today there was not really anything good that happend about it.Mining with your phone is also a risk that your data or details gets stolen or in the worst case you get hacked.",

The phone consumes little power. You can even sell it later. What are your risks?",

Not even for real POW mining on a phone. You can continue mining with a profit of 10 cents from one video card or less. Or you can turn off the mining farm and do nothing.You can also buy expensive PTX4090 video cards, which give a good profit now, but it is unknown how they work at a distance.But with small investments, now you can work only on \"telephone mining\". There are risks in any such business, but if you are afraid or in doubt, then wait for a new wave of GPU mining.",
