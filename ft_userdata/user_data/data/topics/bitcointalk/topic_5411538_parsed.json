Intresting logic...Well I don't know how you may comprehend it but I know too well that others may still likely ask same questions, so it would be very clear to move it to that section since is not weekly payments. Perhaps, payment would be after money realized from Initial Bitcoin Chip Offering (IBCO) to avoid much and to keep this section clean from such questions then moving over there would be ideal.Please I mean no insult or embarrassment.Thank you",

I just don't see the logic in moving a topic to another section just because it gets some payment related questions. Is there a rule on this that i'm unfamiliar with ?Quote from: BookFlower099 on August 29, 2022, 12:13:51 AMBitcointalk username: BookFlower099Telegram username: @DiasrubenTwitter Username: @Ruben_Dias03BTC address (bech32): bc1qpxegf2e3q8z2eejk9t95lrlz7eweex63npur68Buddy, did you even read the ANN ? i don't think you should leave the bounty section again.",
