  "content": "Arsenal like we saw in there past season and there performance and what they did and there unbeating run and what as they were in the edge of winning the EPL and later come out second.Now if you look into Manchester city the title holders and there team and see the kind of squad they have sqaud depth which are competitive players not back up players all players in the team are not just back up but always competitive and when you don't have Foden you play Grealish and when no Foden Gundogan is available ,so if Arsenal will have a squad depth and go with a team work like what they are building now with the recruitment of Declan Rice and Kai harvertzÂ  I think they are title contenders and EPL champion.",
