Not recommend anyone into the thing unless you have really a lot of money to make less than .1% gain to be considered as a nice profit, scale with your big fund. No chart, candle pattern, or technical analysis from the normal point of view to save you. The crypto market is tricky and unpredictable unless there are events like the Having or the Merge or any things similar where we can spectacular around it with high probability. You can not apply normal stock knowledge and expect a decent gain every time.",

You should avoid times when the market is moving closely to a changing point. Either it moves up or moves down dramatically at that point, you will get a loss (if it falls dramatically). You should avoid such times and don't hope that price will break out upside and brings profit to you. It's risky.",

Whilst for the others, this may not fit them as they are more patient and could wait a little bit longer before taking a profit. It also depends on the timing in the market if you're intending to scalp but then due to the market situation, you're required to wait more and that's where it's leading you to wait longer.",

Stick to this technique as long as it's profitable to you.-  A sorry friend and I will contradict what you said that scalping is less risky compared to day trading. You are wrong in this matter because first of all, they have the same risk, but when it comes to the level stage of risk for me it is high in scalping. Why? because if you don't follow its movement in its chart graph in the exchange, you will definitely lose a lot of your assets.Unlike day trading, at least, even if you don't go along with its movement, you can still make money, as long as you have a good set-up of buy and sell orders. Although you still need to analyze it in order to get a good income.But, if you find scalping easy, it's better to stay there and focus hard on that method as a trader.",

Stick to this technique as long as it's profitable to you.a good scalping strategy, you combine the reference support resistance with an oscillator indicator, and of course there will be many strategies to respond to each market with different conditions, but still in my opinion psychology is the most influential for launching that strategy, in my opinion Scalping is a short-term trading strategy that adopted by a trader to make a profit even though it is small but repeatedly the opportunities exist. this is caused by using a small time frame, so that in a day it can make several transactions, depending on the trading style of a scalper. but this technique is not easy, because it requires high discipline to carry out the analysis that has been made in the previous framework. On the other hand, mental resilience must also be maintained, for example the market is against or out of our framework then a cutloss needs to be executed, as in your picture of course one day the price will break, even though it sounds easy, but not everyone can do it. especially with wilder candle movements, of course it will spur our adrenaline.",

It is possible that the price the position is opened may not be riched again and money liquidation is possible. Scalpers also risk more than day traders, they believe in just little price movement, the reason they risk more. I am not saying scalpers should use more than what they can afford to lose. Either someone is a day trader or a scalper, there would be preference. But some traders can still believe in their analyses and that the market would turned back for good into their direction and that they will later make profit. Such scalpers risk less, have very low leverage and they can turn a position opened which they want to scalp before, but turned into day trading.If a trader want to diversify, he should hodl.",

Below is an example of a ranging marketScalping is similar to day trading, but certainly not the same. Scalping can be done in minutes to several hours while day trading can take up to a whole day and traders usually do it every day. From the level of risk scalpers are those who are faced with high risk because the capital they have tends to be higher, the reason is that it is not done every day so maximizing opportunities is the main goal.There are two things I disagree with in your statement.1. Scalping risk is lower than day trading.2. Do it every day.Maybe you can do it every day, but I believe you have to be smart enough to find high volatility assets with technical analysis. The risk is much greater if you are actually playing with non-potential assets between the pump and the dump.",

Sure they will understand how buy low sell high thing works but the accuracy of them profiting by short term trades is uncertain since most newbies can't read or make their own charts. Charts is for me effective even in doing scalping, it is nice to have a basis on trades even if it's on short term. I've been doing a scalping as my trading technique before and it drains me honestly. I prefer doing trades now on higher time frame since the profit there is bigger and it cost not much effort as scalping.",
