  "content": "The dark secret behind Elon Musk twitter purchase, he need to make himself “look” very busy, or ...some authority would come visit him and lecture him for having no work. As usual rich people like Elon Musk do not ever work hard in his entire life, he just leeching on whatever money he can get from his company, but his fear of getting visited get the best out of him. It’s hard to prove himself very busy, by using twitter he can make a lot of noise on the website and that can be used as a solid and powerful proof to show he is indeed very busy, as you know in the office politics lazy employee always make the loudest noise and steal every contribution he can get, most often lazy guy just using nerdy guy for his very own benefit, the nerdy guy work very hard while nerdy guy are absolutely unsociable, the lazy guy instead is very sociable and take full advantage of this phenomenal and use the nerdy guy and his hard work, include them into his resume and convince the boss that he is indeed worked hard for the company and deserve to be praised, the boss had no choice but to accept the falsified credits, in the end the nerdy guy loss the job due to his contribution got stolen, and frustrated by the office politics also boss do not recognise his hard work, all his hard work and time invested to the company go into veins; while the lazy guy got the best out of the deal and promoted into high rank executives and continue to steal from the inside by preying on the next new wageslave that’s freshly come out of the school who know nothing about dirty foul play on the office.",

But if you look closely it was from his 9-5 regular employees who work very hard every day to deliver this so that their boss, Elon will be happy. That is the heart of US capitalism.",

Not a lot of credit-grabbers can do what Elon is doing, although of course that doesn't make it right in any way. That is why I laugh whenever people think that SpaceX reusable rocket is his own doing; he has a team of engineers who works day and night in R&D to make it a reality. He has the vision, but he surely does not have all the brainpower to achieve all of that. If he did, he wouldn't really need social media at all and would just continue doing what he does best behind the scenes, creating more and more inventions to make him and his company a lot of money.",

Can't he \"make noise\" there? Musk seems like a narcissist and an extrovert. He wants to be at the spotlight every day. This probably has something to do with your theory about \"lazy people making the most noise and stealing ideas and credit from the hardworking people). I'm not a psychologist and I don't know how narcissistic extroverts behave in a work environment. I don't really think that Elon Musk is lazy. If he was lazy, he would never become the richest man in the world.He's a shareholder, this means that he isn't obligated to work in his companies. He could resign as a CEO and hire another guy as CEO.Musk is simply an \"attention whore\" and a troll. I don't like his sense of humor.",

The world is inherently unfair and that's how it works, if you know all the filth and lies of politics and you can't help but do anything about it, the best way is to stay away from them and find a way to live so that they don't affect you. By the way, I don't know what kind of person Elon is, a nerd, or a sloth who steals other people's ideas. What I see is the results he has achieved, he is a young billionaire and worth emulating.",

Do you not know how many guy ended up commit suicide trying to beat the HOUSE in the casino on the Las Vegas? The more you try to fight back on his own casino the more you get hurt and the more the HOUSE gaining traction! They’re the living big BULLIES in the Grunch Of the Giant. Apparent we try to ignore them as much as possible but the attention they made is all over the place, they basically asked us to pay taxes on top of crypto, first they shame us and called the crypto currency is a rat poison, but they’re now bend over the crypto eventually but instead acting like the parasite, demand taxation on crypto gain! The big BULLIES never ever give us a chance to breath some fresh air, yet fighting the HOUSE is inevitable a futile effort. What to do? Kill myself and end the suffering now? Hehehehehehehe..

Which one do you want? Everyone wants a world where richest person in the world has a billion at most, and they spend the rest to either paying fair wages or hiring 100k+ more people but that just doesn't exist, it's not an option at all.",
