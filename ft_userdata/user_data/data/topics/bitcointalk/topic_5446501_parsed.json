  "content": "Hello everyone,Since releasing the short demo of our Reflecta AI, we've received an overwhelming amount of interest. Many have commented that our platform has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with blockchain technology. With Reflecta AI, sending a transaction is as simple as telling or writing to our AI with commands such as \"Send 1 BTC to John\" or \"Swap 1000 USDT to BTC\".And what is really crazy it can work with any social media, in example below we used Twitter to send 10 DOGE to person.Demo you can find here: https://twitter.com/reflectocoin/status/1638993755335282691",
