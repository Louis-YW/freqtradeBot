  "content": "*Congratulations to Cygan! The Raffle Winner!*Hello Everyone, I think its time that I do a giveaway on here! If you wish to leave any merit this is much appreciated albeit not a requirement to join this giveaway. I have an extra Arculus wallet from Bitcoin 2022 in Miami. I will cover shipping inside US, outside US the winner will be required to pay for shipping in BTC. Junior/copper level members and above only please (unless otherwise vouched for by a trusted community member). Please let me know what number you would like in the comments below, once full we will draw for the winner!  Drawing method: Once full, I will select a future block and use the hash for that block and the last 2 digits of that hash address will determine the winner. Lets do 100 spots!1. inthelongrun2.
