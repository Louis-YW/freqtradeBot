From the title of your article above to the body, it seems you are comparing LN to bitcoin. It is not a right comparison. Bitcoin is a coin while LN is a network. But both the bitcoin network and the lightning network conveys and houses bitcoin. There is actually no need to compare LN to bitcoin.  The LN is actually a second of bitcoin which was introduced to scale bitcoin. As you said above it handles transactions more effectively and it is worthy to know that it is an off chain solution. Have you tried using LN, because practical knowledge is better than theory.",

Dependent on the amount transacted, you might pay a lot more via lightning. Even though, currently with people paying 10 sat/vb, that is less likely to occur. I'm also going to ask the same question as with Zoomic; have you tried paying via lightning? Because, most people I know who are super excited with it, haven't seen it working in practice. If you haven't, please lower your expectations.",

While it's true that the Lightning Network is often touted to have a theoretical throughput of 1 million transactions per second (TPS), this figure is highly optimistic and is more of a theoretical upper bound.  The Lightning Network's actual TPS capacity depends on various factors, including network topology, channel capacity, routing algorithms, and more.  Achieving this level of throughput in practice is currently far from being realized",

Without network congestion, transaction fees are significantly reduced for the Bitcoin blockchain. Although it has some potential issues and pitfalls, it has a lot of promise and could very well help solve Bitcoin's scaling problem. But because of its promise, the Lightning Network is presented as the solution to everything. The Bitcoin Lightning Network is one of many payment networks in the crypto space. Although it is faster and more cost-effective than the main blockchain, it still relies on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which has been criticized for high energy consumption.",

But with Segwit being delayed and taking forever for the pools to agree for the segwit fork, many forgot about it.Then when it came out nobody used it. I assumed exchanges would be the first to adopt it but I think last month Binance finally added LN. And other exchanges just recently started to use it. I am surprised why there wasn’t more rollouts years ago. Maybe Bitcoin fees just weren’t that high and it wasn’t needed anymore?",

Binance accepting lightning network when BRC-20 tokens attacking Bitcoin network, but people choose to wait and not send their coins.My assumption most of people are still use centralized exchange to hold their coins, so either the fee is high or not, they're not get any impact with that.[1] https://github.com/theDavidCoen/LightningExchanges",

Therefore, on average, you need to wait for 20 minutes, during which you can make instant payments for a month or more, depending on the second party .There is no max number of TX per  As I mentioned, it is instantaneous, and channel values is updated immediately.",

I also see that my electrum wallets also support the LN but am just curious of how it still not the most preferred network used when it comes to transacting of Bitcoin although i know its use will be very good for folks actually running a business and currently accept BTC as a means of payment so every payment will be done in a matter of split seconds.",

People may be considered using LN when the fee was hiked recently but now it is sitting at 6-7sat/vbyte then they won't be using LN for now.In case if you are wondering where to spend your BTC via Lightning network you can find most of the sites supports LN transactionshttps://lightningnetworkstores.com/",
