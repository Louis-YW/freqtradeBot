      "body": "Thanks for your concern !!!Going to Exchange quickly is to earn money on dump and pump, whereas we focus on the Purpose. We concentrate more on getting the real value for our tokens rather going on a dump and pump on exchange. Our approach is genuine and practical, we are very shortly going to be on the exchange.Moreover the market is volatile due to Bitcoin bubble break, so it's better to wait for right time until this \"Bitcoin Dance\" settles down. We also need to wait for ETH2 merge, so this month we wait and first week Oct probably.Ultimately we want to win.... not just to rush and go to an Exchange and just be like another coin in the Bin.So please allow us to take our own strategic decision in the interest of many who had trusted us. ThanksThe CEO",
