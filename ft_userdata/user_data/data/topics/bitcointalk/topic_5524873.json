After checking and doing their due diligence, then that's the time they have refunded it to the person thru his Bitcoin address.",

Their contacts are publicly known, so it is possible that the person in question contacted them personally, besides, they mentioned that they received numerous messages from across the industry on behalf of the user.Anyway, its a nice gesture from the Antpool. They could have simply kept the money and distributed it to the miners and no one would have held anything against them because thats their right.",

Remember the stories about people who threw away their private keys, or even whole computers? It can happen when you copy amount from somewhere and want to be fast. For instance, in Electrum the amount and fee are one under the other. The size of the fields to fill is exactly the same. If someone gives you address and amount it's possible to paste it into the \"fee\" field instead of the one labelled amount. It's just my speculation but the \"human error\" is usually the culprit and you can avoid it by reading everything once again before sending it. He was lucky. We can say Foundry gave him a Christmas gift",

Third party wallets or exchanges wouldn’t allow for such a flaw as the fees are automated based on the network congestion at the time of initiation.Haven’t gone through the entire publication from Foundry, it’s of note that, they were reached out to by well meaning individuals over the web and possibly people who knows the individual in person. How would they know?The individual possibly would have raised complaints to friends and family.Good thing is, the user has them excess fees refunded and that’s what we hope to here in cryptos.",

It was an honest mistake for the guy and let's just hope that he won't make the same mistake twice. I would be devastated if it happened to me since it's not a small amount of money. I would also say he is lucky because there's a chance that it won't be refunded (not that I am saying that Foundry team won't refund - just a speculation) since it's not the miners fault that it became 8 btc just for a transaction fee but the sender's fault.",
