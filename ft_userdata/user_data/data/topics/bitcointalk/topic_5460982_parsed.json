You only can lock your thread, move it to Archival or send a report to moderator and hope that they will delete the thread for you.Just don't create threads so you won't have to delete them.I search for answers from moderators in that thread but mprep will need to correct this Q&A.Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PMQ: How do I delete/lock my own thread(s) when I no longer need them?A: On the top right of your post is a delete button. You can delete threads if nobody has seen them. Otherwise, just click \"Lock topic\" link at the bottom left.",
