  "content": "Hello to all,I must write here another unpleasant experience with Rollbit.1. First of all I created account via VPS Kamatera (probably most known WINDOWS VPS provider) for security to have virtual machine for Metamask wallet and Rollbit account - as I have been hacked before on my PC and I think this is standard security now for any crypto bookie when withdrawals can go to any wallet.  And they were ok with using VPN and so clearly anyway.My friend told me about Rollbit to me and other friend and  we created accounts same day  me and one friend . He also used Kamatera. I told this to support also. My friends account is OK he was able to make withdrawal and can play there. They were not going after him just me - which is strange but OK.I did anticipated some problems here that they can ask for KYC. And was prepared for it. I played at  many other casinos and bookies so i pretty much know what they can ask and what is within reason. I also did read their terms and also I am familiar with Curacao gambling KYC or AML.I also was ok doing KYC because rollbit - anonymous bookie used third party provider for this which is licensed so it was not like some random, anonymous guys will be handling my documents.2. So i made account and placed 1 bet and won around 22.5k minus deposit  I can provide screenshots later. I made withdrawal of 19k - profit and logged out- withdrawal went through. Then after this my account was flagged for KYC which I anticipated. So I did KYC through 3rd party right away and my account was good to go. So I tried and asked for withdrawal. Then it was flagged under contact customer support - but ok. I contacted and after some time they wrote me back they processed my withdrawal of 5k. But it never arrived and was still stucked. OK i asked whats the problem and waited long time till they told me they need additional AML check.Which is strange right here - because i did 1 deposit and made it right through Binance. You need to be already verified to use and make binance withdrawals anyway so its joke right here, but ok.3. After this they told me they want to call me and they will be recording it - right this is strange. But sure i got no problem with call but i told them i got problem with recording it. And that i won't be showing any sensitive info.Anyway they got no right to this according to their license as well. Because under their license they got pretty much stated what they can ask and they got written it also on their site in terms in part of AML/KYC - i can provide screenshot later. Also I told them that I am EU citizen and would like to know if they are licensed to handle GDPR documents. And also told them that i want to open dispute as well with their license giver so if they will open ticket with complaint department or asked them to give me ADR. I asked several times without response but ok.4. So they ignored all my questions but as said I was ok with going on the call and see what they want. It was scheduled and some community manager Smokey Lisa (UK citizen i think according to accent)  was there. So we were calling I told them that I am not ok with recording it and asked about ADR several times - which he told me he will answer via live chat about it later. So he asked me to start my video as well not only audio. I said OK to that if he will start his as well and I will know who is verifying me and if he got contract with Rollbit. He refused to start his video so i refused as well mine. It's easy. This is pretty much not standard and breaking at least EU laws as well.I told him I got no problem with video call if I will know who is verifying me if he is member of compliance team or what and start video as well. I knew already its unlawful but I was ready to go under these conditions. I also wonder why they are so eager about video call when - they got no license handling KYC that are under GDRP unless their third party provider is leaking them the info. So they couldnt be possible to tell and verify who is person calling with them. Unless.... - they stated also several times on discord they got no access to KYC and its done by 3rd party. So whats the point of the video call even? Unless.... But about this later - this is also asking for very big fine and lawsuit from EU organs. But about this later.So pretty much we are stucked here. They are unwilling to close my account and send me withdrawal. They are unwilling to video call and identify themselves. They are asking for something their license giving them no right to do. And they pretty much know it and I pretty much know it as well.They are unwilling to contact curacao gaming complaint department. They are unwilling to contact ADR. I told them to contact department of EU Commission for customer protection. No response.5. Even when I got problem with this call. I am willing to attend it unless they will turn their video as well and identify themselves. But clearly i wont show my documents to random,anonymous people/person claiming is community manger. This is joke.So. I am ok with losing 5k. Just want to tell you people about this. I read they asked this call from more people. And I didnt read about anyone that passed.They are giving big bonuses maybe some people are abusing it and now they are paranoid about it and taking the money from all the people they got some suspection on. Stating multi-accounting, AML and whatever. If they got proofs - just point third party ADR and they will resolve it what is the problem? But back to my case.6. Lastly About GDPR and KYC provider. If they want to do AML and call OK. But do it according to law. I will be contacting also friend's partner law firm specializing on gambling law so they will recheck with their license giver and start formal process with them.To all - if  bookie isnt willing to disclose ADR or any third party for resolving disputes its a big red flag.Even famous Tony from 5dimes was not this ridiculous like these guys.https://imgur.com/a/mEeamhKhttps://imgur.com/a/HmrWQ0Phttps://imgur.com/a/JLDJGUvBest regards",

IMG is somehow not working for me when i put there link from imgur.To make some update I didnt receive any new messages from them so far and I have asked according to their own privacy policy to send me all documents and data they got on me under GDPR ACT. So I am waiting on this what data these anonymous clowns can have or if they will just break the law and do not send me any or if they break it by lying they got nothing.http://imgur.com/a/285OW8a",

You've raised a thread here against them, I'd ask you to stop making the exact same post on their ANN as it'll make things and development of the case harder to follow.I think there is no problem calling the attention of the casino by calling to their awareness of this accusations raised against them atleast that would help them know something of this nature is ongoing and would require them to pay urgent and utmost attention to the thread by resolving the pending complaints against them but the idea of OP going to replicate this post on their announcement thread is not welcoming in anyways and I see it as not matured to handle such a situation. It would have been better OP copy post the link of this thread there with a little more calling their attention rather than going to replicate this there.OP If what was said is true then I would advise you to do the needful by editing it and just post the link of this thread there to call their attention. That would be ok to go with.",

They want to delete it only when they delete my whole accounts with money inside. Which is ridiculous.If this will be the case i will report them as well to EU DATA PROTECTION SUPERVISOR.AS well they are clearly using third party for kyc because they got no authority for doing KYC themselves and doesnt hold GDRP standards. Thats  why I refuse doing any KYC and also video call with them. IT is unlawful. I am ready to provide documents to their third party. If they ask me to do KYC again via third party i am ready to go if they will release money. Otherwise they are asking things that are not legal and their Terms and Conditions and gambling act is not giving them right to ask such thing. I strongly recommend them to send me money otherwise I will proceed with EU authorities.",
