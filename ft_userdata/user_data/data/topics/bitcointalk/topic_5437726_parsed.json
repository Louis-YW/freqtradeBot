The draw chance is 3.30. Juventus is still the favorite, they will play at home and try to build the last reputation in Italy.I don't gamble too much, I have bet on Juventus.",

      "body": "Sounds like the favorite to win the cup from the teams listed here is Inter.I doubt Fiorentina or Cremonese will be a big problem for them.In the clash between the two I see an easy win for Fiorentina as in Italy as we are seeing which teams are in the final stages of the cup it looks like it has always been the case that every team values a lot the cup and as such only big teams excluding Cremonese are in the final stages.I say Inter the most favored because they have won easily in the Super cup against Milan and also the only team to have beaten Napoli during recent times.Juventus and Lazio are strong ones but I think Inter has the upper hand in the cup.",

Lazio opponent seems little difficult for Juventus actually after points deduction have inconsistency performance and last match defeated by AC Monza as home match. Juventus have back to the top performance actually have 8 matches winning in a row but after points deduction punishment Juventus face inconsistent performance and Coppa Italia become alternative tittle in this season.",

The result of recent matches matters in this case so I'll be taking Lazio as well. Who knows if the Juve players still haven't found their inspiration and confidence to play at a high level?",

The fact that they were really bad in their last 3 Serie-A matches by gaining 1 point only also shows that they are not in a good condition. It will not be an easy game for Juventus, they need to play with their best (players, strategy and mental) if they want to beat Lazio as Lazio is in a better form than Juventus.",

      "body": "First of all, it was a very bad defensive performance by Roma there. Cremonese were so comfortable in their defense line. Both of their goals were due to defensive mistakes. On the first one Kumbulla made a huge mistake and led that attack to end up with a penalty. Cremonese scored the penalty but I must admit that it was one of the funniest penalties given.    Patricio kept himself away from the player in the last moment and Dessers just faked his fall. The second goal was a really unlucky one for Roma though. Belotti gave hope by scoring in the last moments but there wasn't much time left for an equalizer.For Juventus - Lazio, I have mixed feelings. Juventus players seem preoccupied after the bad incident they have had recently. The Monza loss is a proof for that. Maybe Juventus would like to focus on the Coppa Italia after being in a terrible condition in the Serie A. But still I can't trust them. I'll try my luck with Lazio win in this as I see their effort more promising.",

Juventus started to be more ineffective and Lazio captured the control of the match suddenly. I understand Juventus that they just wanted to keep this score. Otherwise they would have played near their first half effort. Lazio did their best but it wasn't enough. I should admit I wasn't expecting Juventus to defeat them in 90 minutes.Juventus want this title as they are going to have a horrible season in the Serie A. I don't know if they can go until the title while there is a big Inter threat especially.",

Furthermore despite the odds I would yet suggest all to pick Inter only, but if someone wants to take a risk then wagering on Juventus is definitely an option but I won’t recommend it as I don’t believe that they’ll win against Inter Milan.",

I just look Juventus has 2.80, Inter 2.55, and the chance of drawing is 3.20. In this situation, maybe we have to wait a month to just look the squad (if have injury or anything change)",
