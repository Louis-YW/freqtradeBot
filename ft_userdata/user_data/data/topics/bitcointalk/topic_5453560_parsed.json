With this account, or do you have another account to which you have lost access? If the account for which you have forgotten the password is this one, which might be a better option since the account is still logged in on your device, that simply means that there is every possibility that the account login details are saved and remembered in your browser.If that's the case, try going through your browser's saved passwords and checking to see if your forum password is among your saved details there.Note: Saving login details is also not really advisable because your information can be compromised when your email linked to the browser is hacked.",

Next time use a password that’s unique to you and easy to remember.",

Meaning you just login in today so how did you log in?Maybe your account is set to always log in and your browser still has your old cookies which is why you still have access to your account. But the problem is we do not know if you are the real owner of this account you don't even have a stake address to verify unless you referring to another account.I suggest don't logout here while trying to recover your account through email use incognito mode on the browser. Or if you also do not have access to your Email instead ask mods if you can able to change the email and password of this account on their side.",

If you can still open it, just continue, but for more detailed reasons, of course you know why you are asking like that. I think the suggestion from brother @Zaguru12 is a very good reference because it is very clear the stages of work there.If from me, for other improvements, try to make quality posts and I'm sure if it's good both in terms of concepts, presentation of problems and requests for solutions, I think many of our seniors will give good answers.",

Unfortunately, you did not clearly explain what you want, so far we are not sure if you are talking about Bitcointalk account or another account.Have you posted any Bitcoin address publicly or privately? If you publish an address, sign a letter proving that you are the owner of that address.Then email recoveries...@bitcointalk.org with these links and they will be able to help you.If your account is old and has few posts, it won't change anything, unless you post every 14 days, you won't get a higher rank.",
