But with the approval of the federal government in marketing exchange like crypto currency, in buying or selling, by legalising the currency in every aspect of exchange it will be helpful.Making each and every transaction of crypto currency to any other wallet there must be a charges for it, and even you had even sell it the payer transact the amount into your Banking account, while transferring the money to the agent there will be another comission that they will charge .Which means making payment with crypto will surely make things easier for us.As of now my country had been on the way to make crypto currency payment possible on everything you can afford.",

      "body": "Probably when you have whatever that you want to sell you can place your option of buyer, it might be through a Fiat, cryptocurrency especially Bitcoin because in this present time many people do embrace Bitcoin and the normally fix their option of whatever thing they want to sell to Bitcoin, so therefore 1 bitcoin can get you a house if the person wanted in Bitcoin even though you convert it in usdt it will still give you the same value according to the country's rate of their currency so that is why in some countries one BTC cannot afford to get ours depending the position or the location of the environment why in some other countries one BTC will get you a huge house even get you a car depending the environment or the location of the building so in summary it depends the location and the country based on on their currency denomination",

Of course, if there is fraud from one of the government or the police, it will also be very difficult or impossible to intervene in this matter.However, if in a country that accepts Crypto payments or transactions, it is supported by a clear direction.

It's possible to buy a house and make the transaction on blockchain, then receive the house as a newly minted NFT on Ethereum for example, but it makes no sense from legal standpoint, as noone in the world recognizes NFTs as something that institutes property rights.",

And I'd question the sanity of whoever makes it legal (at this point if they ever do really.)  Even Bitcoin transaction as proof of payment wouldn't work since there are a lot of legality afaik that are involved when transferring properties to another name, which is not at an equal level in terms of authority compared to a Bitcoin transaction. Maybe if it was under legal authority but at that point you might as well do the proper procedures instead of just saying the transaction as your proof lol. As for buying houses with Bitcoin, I'd say it varies from country to country. It should technically be allowed but you'd have to find the laws related to that and whatnot.",

It's laughable to say that Bitcoin payment is safer than going through a real estate agent when nearly everyone does that and has no problems with them.Exactly, the ones who said are too delusional. Yes,  we like crypto currency; that's why we are here, but not all will be fit for crypto currency or the usage of crypto currency. Who would want to purchase a house through NFT? There are many legal requirements before a person could bring a house. Do you think even if you are using a crypto currency channel, the government will not detect you? No, and also, who's insane person would have rights to the house with using NFT? that's right what if it is a scam? then all your hard-earned assets will be gone.I understand how powerful and usable crypto currency is, but in these days, not all things are compatible with crypto, and not all transactions should be done in crypto. Buying a property is a serious matter, and if you don't go through legal circumstances, you might have a problem in the future.",

Without Escrow, you will take very high risk and potentially might lose your BTC but in return no house in your ownership.Use Escrow.Because value of the trade is big, make sure you wait for some confirmations like 6 or 10 confirmations before consider that on-chain transaction is 'completed' and safe enough to complete the house trade.How many bitcoin confirmations is enough?Quote1 confirmation: sufficient for small payments less than $1,000.3 confirmations: for payments $1,000 - $10,000. Most exchanges require 3 confirmations for deposits.6 confirmations: good for large payments between $10,000 - $1,000,000. Six is standard for most transactions to be considered secure.10 confirmations: suggested for large payments greater than $1,000,000.Use this tool to calculate risk from 51% attacks with different hashrate and number of confirmations.https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-confirmation-risk-calculator",

The proof of real ownership are the property documents that will be transferred to the new owner after a deal has been complete and an agreement met between buyer and seller. Anyone who possesses these documents in their name is the owner of the property recognized by the government.",

No other country has the same regulations as El Salvador. Many other countries are used only as commodity assets. In my country crypto is also as an asset, when I want to use it to buy a house then I have to exchange it with Fiat. But under certain conditions people who understand Bitcoin can agree to exchange each other. But this will not happen if one does not want. So the best transaction tool today is money which is recognized by the whole world.",

It's not just real estate, what I'm talking about is paying the daily bills. Everyone are exaggerating about bitcoin unnecessarily and senselessly. I wonder, does our exaggeration of bitcoin and badmouthing of other assets make bitcoin better? And is that what a bitcoin investor should do?",
