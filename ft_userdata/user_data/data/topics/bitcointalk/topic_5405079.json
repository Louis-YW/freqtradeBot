Instead of using your hourly/daily limits for sending your Discord address, why don't you just include it in your \"other thread\" and force them to contact you through there?- You can also use the URL part of your profile [like tranthidung, mk4 and me] to showcase your Discord address: Profile tab > Forum Profile Information (under \"Modify Profile\") > Fill in the \"Website title and URL\" fields > Click the \"Change profile\" button.",

Why should you snip unnecessary part of quoted posts?It reduces your post length, and a page length (one page contains 20 posts). Imagine one page with 20 posts like yours, it is a 'shit' page.It avoid distraction on readers.More about Bitcointalk posting etiquette",
