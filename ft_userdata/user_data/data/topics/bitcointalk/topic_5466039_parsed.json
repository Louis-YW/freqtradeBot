  "content": "Is no loner news that Bitcoin movement to cold wallet have been on the increase since 2022 when the Bitcoin market faced one of its most drained bear market, and the reason for such value decrease is not far-fetched as it is attributed to the collapse of several centralized platforms, ranging from the exchange and another investment platform such as Genesis and FTX crisis.Knowing this reality that Bitcoin on its own can not easily slide into such a bear market, and all the Bitcoin bear markets have been influenced by the activities of those centralized exchanges and their shortcomings, their inability has been the cause of all the crisis rocking Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market stabilities.Bitcoin holders are beginning to drive joy in the self-custody of their coins, and this has been reflected in the increase in Bitcoin movement from exchange to custodial wallets where the holder has 100% control. And for me, this action is going to bring about long-term stability and a minimal occurrence of a bear market most especially a market crash-like bear condition, because if a large number of Bitcoin holders move their Bitcoin into the cold wallet, it will reduce the over depends and trust issues that have to accompany exchange usage/ centralized non-custodial.",

If majority of folks don't keep their bitcoin is self custodial wallets, that could mean they are keeping more on CEXs and this can lead to more trading.However, the supply of bitcoin available on CEXs for trading doesn't denote a bear or bull market.

Maybe he do mean that if there would be less coins that would be traded up then there would be no such huge movements like declines but come to think that coin circulation is something that would be relevant.Even we do know that storing up our coins on wallets which we do have full control doesnt mean that we cant sent out back and forth with those coins to be used on trading. Therefore, this is a condition or situationwhich i dont see any sense at all on trying out to avoid bear markets just to have that switch up with those coin possessions into their hardware wallet or getting it out on market circulaiton.Bare in mind that bear markets or bull ones cant really be stopped on which there would really be cycles that would really be happening no matter what and this had been caused by several factors.As an individual who do have that kind of fear on putting up their coins on centralized places or simply they dont possess the keys then they would really be that paranoid when it comes to securitywhich its normal to have that approach on making use of those wallets but this is actually dont have any connection in between market conditions like bear market phase.",

I think so, if a good number of users hold their private keys they'll be lesser drastic fall of bitcoin price. Yet a lot of task is required here. These exchanges get hacked despite holding the keys that contains the funds of all who patronize the exchange. Self custody doesn't mean that a wallet can't be hacked, if the private key is carelessly stored. Hackers have multiple ways of accessing people's devices. Some users have their private keys stored on computers, written on different papers and not sure of the key's exact location. Thereby increasing the chances of getting hacked. If 90% of bitcoin users go self custody the loss of private keys and giving private keys to hackers by storing keys on sites and emails will definitely affect the loss of funds. Everyone can be thought about the risk of saving bitcoin on exchanges and they'll move to self custody, but they can't be schooled to always stay careful with their keys. Additionally, not every bitcoin user spend time reading about bitcoin.",

      "body": "This relation might be a little stretch since there's no direct correlation to bear market movements and the existence/increase in use of cold wallets. You might be seeing the effects of crashes happening within exchanges which drives the public to resort to self-custodial wallets, and the apparent recovery overtime, and then think that it's the switch from cold wallets that's causing this recovery when it's all just normal market behavior in the first place. It's great and all to think that and perhaps even promote the use of cold-wallet since it instills responsible investing and all that nice shit but at the same time, you're painting the wrong picture especially to newbies who aren't that aware of how bitcoin works just yet. This may make them think that just holding their bitcoins on cold-wallets will shoot its price up when that couldn't be any farther from the truth.",

      "body": "Moving your Bitcoins from your wallet to an exchange, in my opinion, has no effect on the price because there is no act of selling. However, moving a BTC, especially from a long-term address, is a little concerning because most of the time they probably sell it. If anyone sees it, it may create panic selling. And perhaps this is why holders will not relocate their BTC if it is not absolutely essential. I simply do not believe that this will result in a bear market because there is always support and resistance that can be respected, and those areas have a large number of sellers or buyers. So just because someone is transferring their BTC doesn't indicate they want to sell; sometimes they just want to manipulate the market to make the price goes to their desired direction.",

But if those Bitcoin are stored in a custodial cold wallet, even though such an incident happens,  the investors will only feel the impact in the short term,  because of market reaction but their Bitcoin holding will be protected since the BTC are in the investor's position and not on the third party wallet.",
