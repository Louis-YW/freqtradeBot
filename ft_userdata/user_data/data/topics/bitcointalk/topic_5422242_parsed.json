      "body": "Frankly speaking, most of us are into gambling not mainly to have fun or for leisure activity but rather we are gambling to earn and gain profit from it while playing and enjoying. The main issue because most of us get addicted to gambling is we lost control and we let our emotions get the best of us rather than thinking logically and stopping while we are ahead. Greediness makes us addicted to gambling especially when we are already winning or when we have lost and want to chase after it. Just as the article you've linked, having trouble controlling oneself is one of the signs that you are already having a gambling problem and unfortunately, we, ourselves are not the first people who will not see it but rather the people around us.",

Perhaps that makes me not an addict but rather someone who isn't really into gambling that much. It gives me leisure and it brings me enjoyment, but I can definitely live without it. Heck, I think I'm more addicted in coffee or in vaping even though I recently acquired my liking with it. One thing's for certain though: I'll never put my finances and my life at risk just because I gamble.",

Here's an interesting article about this subject.It's either someone will admit that they are addicted, or would be in denial. Personally, I do go to traditional land based casinos, have fun and of course try to make money. But in the end if my budget is busted, then I just go home, not my lucky day. So I would consider myself as a recreational gambler per se. However, I will admit that before I was really into gambling and consider myself as a addict. Until something it my life changes everything, lost my job and obviously my income and so I don't have the money that I used to gamble. So I definitely stop, however, when I was able to find a regular job, my addiction just simply stop, maybe I've learned the hard lessons already so I don't want to go to that experience again.",

Honestly anyway you enjoy gambling is fine as long as it doesn't negatively affect your mentality and your finances in life imo. If those aspects were affected then I'd consider one to be pretty addicted to it. E.g. if a rich person were just to gamble away every day I wouldn't necessarily think it was addiction, I'd only consider it if it was actually harming you but if you have the capability to enjoy it to that level then I say feel free to do so. I mostly do sports nowadays though so it's less of a gamble and more of a thinking game for me though.",
