Is there any precision data in this regard?Not really. You can't tell the difference between a bunch of coins sitting in an address that is a paper wallet sitting in someones safe vs coins that were lost when a PC crashed taking the wallet.dat (or whatever file) with it and coins that are sitting in a hot wallet that the owner has not wanted to spend since 2018 since they cashed out a lot then and are just sitting on the rest.The ones that are moving are also a guess. If I bought 2BTC on the dip last week from an exchange and withdrew them to stick them in a cold wallet for a decade you really have no way of knowing that either.There are some sites & people who can give you a really good guess / estimate but you can never be sure.-Dave",

Is there any precision data in this regard?If there would be any data then it would mean that the privacy is not really a choice here. The people sometimes hide their wallets and at the same time there are people who have lost their coins as well who might not have any idea where they are, some of them are also unfortunately passed on as well therefore their family might never know where those coins are hidden as well. Some people like the creator might be ' holding' it forever thus creating a balance between trading and stuff therefore I do think if someone was incharge of data he won't be accurate as well! Therefore I don't understand how one can answer it accurately.",

Is there any precision data in this regard?You can't know if a coin is in a cold wallet or in a hot wallet, only the owner knows it, from the outside view it's the same. What we can know is the rough estimate of coins in wallets of big exchanges like Coinbase, and we can assume that majority of those coins are actively traded, but even here some percentage of users actually use exchange accounts for long-term storage, even though it's a bad idea. Coins in self-hosted wallets could also be actively traded, this can be spotted if they are moved frequently.If I were to calculate an estimate for the circulating supply, I would look at all UTXO and consider all coins that haven't been moved in last 2 years as non-circulating, except for coins that belong to exchanges.",

So no coin is truly lost.No coin is truly untouchable.But many coins have not moved for more than 2 years.The better question might be.How many coins are frozen since 2009How many coins are frozen since 2010How many coins are frozen since 2011How many coins are frozen since 2012note first half ing was in 2012 so 10.5 mill coins are older than 2012.how many have not moved since that time is knowable.how of them will move is not knowable.sames for2013201420152016.    this is 5.25 million how many never moved is knowablehow many will move is also not possible to know.at the 2009-2016 zone we have 15.75 mined do we know the ones that never moved yes.do we know the stuck ones that will move no.",

Of the total number mined (19+ million), some are currently lost, some are in non-custodial wallets, and some are available for trading. If we take into account that according to available data this number is about 2.5 million BTC, then we can conclude that supply is far greater than demand, and that Bitcoin is not a sought-after commodity despite the limited max supply - which is ultimately reflected on price.Of course, we should not forget the OTC market, which has always been speculated to be of the order of magnitude as an open market, which would mean that at any given time in one way or another there are millions of BTCs that can be traded.",

The question makes sense if one wants to know (at least approximately) how much BTC is available on the market at a given time.Sure, but my argument is that every Bitcoin not provably burnt is technically on the market (sellable at any point in time) as e.g. I could be selling a UTXO that I haven't touched since 2010 to a forum user right now through private messages or whatnot. Or I might be meeting a buddy later today to give him this UTXO in exchange for his motorbike.Quote from: Lucius on May 20, 2022, 01:27:37 PMOf the total number mined (19+ million), some are currently lost, some are in non-custodial wallets, and some are available for trading.But how are the ones sitting in non-custodial wallets not available for trading?

Because I reckon this would be a pretty bad indicator since Bitcoin can be moved so fast and cheaply even in huge amounts. Like, I get it that when thinking about FOREX there may be limited amount of foreign currency currently available in a certain country and it has to be physically moved. But thousands of BTC could go from 10-year-not-moved-cold-storage to sold on Coinbase for $ in a matter of minutes.",

At the end of the day Bitcoin would have been the very first cryptocurrency that people had even heard of let alone used. So, early on when it was worth a couple of quid, meant that it got neglected. So, really in reality while coins might not be completely lost in the terms of what rational people would considered indefinitely lost i.e those that have died, coins being sent to burner addresses, and what not. Simply, a lot of users back then would have forgotten their passwords, and likely won't ever gain access to it again. However, they can't be as easily considered as lost. The next generation will have a better idea of how many were lost, but even then not without any uncertainty. I think it's probably best to just assume that all 21 million can be accessed, even though we know that isn't the case. Since, after all we aren't worried about it increasing beyond that theoretically supply of 21 million, whereas with fiat we're constantly seeing millions or even billions poured into circulation. The reassuring thing is; that'll never happen with Bitcoin.",
