Governments around the world want to regulate BTC and because of the decentralized nature of bitcoin, governments find it hard to regulate bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin has been associated with criminal activities and labeled as a scam by governments and big banks, leading investors to believe that Bitcoin is dangerous. It’s being perpetuated by the government that if you have nothing to hide, you shouldn’t use Bitcoin.",

      "body": "I feel like bitcoin is the better asset and normally the only challenge would be to teach people about the ways they can profit from buying and holding, but it's not that simple. Unfortunately the world revolves around fiat money and those responsible for it have unlimited funds. They can print as much as they can and they make the laws. If you haven't heard BlackRock is partially owned by Bank of America, which means that if you sell bitcoin to them you sell it to the guys who print money and want to sustain the current fiat system. They're slowly buying you out. That's the greatest challenge. IMO bitcoin will grow in value but by the time it reaches a million dollars it will be owned by states and they'll be able to do whatever they want with it.",

What challenges could Bitcoin face in becoming a universally accepted store of value? Any thoughts? Some people did view bitcoin as digital gold but for me it isn't a digital gold. Bitcoin is bitcoin and it is not digital gold. Gold is different from bitcoin and one of it is that it is not digital compared to bitcoin which is digital. I'd rather say that bitcoin is a digital currency although it is a digital but it is kinda similar to gold and many people are now adopting bitcoin. Well, we all have different point of view towards bitcoin on how we know it either as a digital gold or something like that.",

      "body": "Just very recently I started a thread called Bitcoin's roadmap towards Gold Flippening.My take is that the biggest obstacle is actually Bitcoin's high volatility. People are still too scared about Bitcoin's notorious crashes and dips. Until that doesn't change, most people will not recognize Bitcoin as an alternative to gold.The problem is that this is quite a re-inforcing spiral:- People buy Bitcoin as a speculative investment because \"it's volatile and risky, but I could get rich quickly if I'm lucky riding the waves\"- Often they leverage their long position to maximize short term gains- This highly leveraged positions create more sell pressure when massive liquidations take place (short sellers love that!)- The resulting crashes create fear.- And this fear is what makes people think that it's still \"volatile and risky\" and only suitable for a short term, speculative investment.- rinse and repeat.We have to break this cycle if we want Bitcoin to become a real digital gold alternative. I have listed some possible options in this post.The other factors that were mentioned, like the prevalence of scams and fraud, are already improving. The market is maturing and so is also regulation. In 2024, people would not buy a BitConnect, OneCoin or Generación Zoe that easily as 5-10 years ago.",

Or Bitcoin is not an effective inflation hedge when inflation hits a 40-year high in 2022. Bitcoin has been dumped heavily and lost more than 70% of its value during the crisis and if anyone uses it as a safe haven in 2022 it will be disastrous. Yes, nothing can stop the growth of bitcoin, it is still trying to prove it but we need more time to evaluate it accurately. But so far, it's just a highly volatile investment. People call it digital gold because of its potential, but to be fair it is not there yet and cannot be compared to gold.",

Any thoughts?the volatility is still too wild is I think the primary hindrance of bitcoin becoming universally accepted store of value, speaking about legality, I think so many countries already accept bitcoin as a commodity, some even already accept it as a currency.but so many people still consider storing their wealth in bitcoin as rather taboo because the infamous volatility where price swing so wide people gonna be scared out of it.eventually it will get better with the ever growing market capital and current bitcoin volatility isn't as bad as before, but I think it's still something to be considered regardless.everytime you talk with average people about storing wealth in bitcoin to fight inflation they always gets concerned with the volatility seeing from the monthly candle chart, though honestly since bitcoin has shown to be growing linearly over the course of decade,  it's still suited to be used as a store of value.",

Any thoughts?Gold was discovered around 3600 BC and has gone through thousands of years and millions of events around the world to reach its current level of reliability. Meanwhile, bitcoin is only 15 years old and has not even gained worldwide recognition and only a small fraction, less than 10% of the world's population, uses it. So bitcoin needs to overcome a myriad of challenges to become a store of value or a safe haven like gold. We need worldwide recognition, generation after generation, not just recognition from the bitcoin community, which is only a few percent of the world's population and thinks it is indeed digital gold.",
