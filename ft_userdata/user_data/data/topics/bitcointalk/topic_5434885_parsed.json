  "content": "Hi everyone, I have multiple S17+ (73TH) miners and all of them after a few weeks of running show that one of hashboards has 0 chips found. I then will swap the boards around and they will run fine but then again one of the hashboards show zero chips. I normally would blame the board but recently I have had two new boards stop working after a few days. I am not sure why these new boards keep going bad and I don’t have any devices to check them. The only thing I can do is swap them around and it doesn’t make sense to me why they work for a few days and then stop. I am running BRAIINS software on all machines. I suspect it may be the control board but I don’t know how to test that theory.Any troubleshooting advice would be appreciated.",

      "body": "Sometimes it is due to overheating your room doesn't have proper ventilation you need to take the heat/hot air out of the room.PSU is might be also the culprit but without the kernel logs we can't determine exactly what your miner issue is. Also, if you can access the dashboard copy the kernel logs and paste them here with \"insert code tag\" a # sharp button while editing your posts so that it won't look messy. Or you can use pastebin.com to paste the kernel logs there and share the link here.I have a few suggestions would you mind trying to flash it back to stock firmware and test it if it's running fine. If yes then possible you overclocked the miner with braiins OS that turn one of the hashboard overheating.",
