      "body": "I Think the physical bitcoin market is on the verge of expanding tremendously over the next 2-5 years. the small little collectible forum on bitcoin talk will one day never be what it is today. It will literally transform overnight and the nice small chill community we have on here will sadly be gone forever, just like auto dealers have a shortage of used cars so they higher employees to comb craiglist nonstop to find and buy cars off private seller so will this collectibles page be 24/7 poached by buyers that have been hired for one reason only and that is to buy up as much as they possibly can so they can market them themselves or to take what they purchase from here and move them to national auction houses like stacks bowers and heritage. Its only going to take one celebrity or high-end figure to talk about these coins and the market will go crazy, I have this prediction that you will see these coins in a movie like the \"Italian job\" but it will not be about stealing gold but physical Bitcoins like Lealana or Cas coins and that will create a large demand for these coins. I have already noticed a much lower number of auctions being held on here because collectors know if they want top dollar it is with stacks or heritage but of course the wait time sucks with those auctions compared to Mopar or miner jones listing and auction where a seller can liquidate and item and get paid within a week. and that will also create new companies that offer purchase of physical coins for cash/bank wires next day, just like carmax offers cash for your vehicle on the spot, so will people try and innovate and create ways to make it quick and easy for a seller to liquidate items extremely fast and get paid instantly. there are my two cents on the topic, my feeling is its a double edge sword. and sorry for all the automotive analogies, i was in the auto industry a majority of my life.  thank you RS",

The value of a MS62 1 Cas and a MS 66+ could be a big value difference. Always the grade is important for market value on the coins and most definitely for the future. Hopefully the grading companies will continue to embrace these coins and expand their coin base for grading to make room for even some of the newer coin makers. We have started to see a lot of newcomers in recent years with new designs and styles. I can't wait to see what else is in store for this awesome niche space.",

If people want to continue to see innovation in the space they should continue to support those who they want to see more coins from. Giving away things you can buy from makers here is a great way to show your support and share your hobby with friends and family. You never know who will catch the bug.",
