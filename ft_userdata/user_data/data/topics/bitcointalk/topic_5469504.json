  "content": "Just an idea, but I think it is worth implementing. If you want to get a block explorer, it requires storing the whole chain. That means, you need to have all blocks, and maintain full archival node, if you want to run a block explorer. As blockchain gets bigger and bigger, people no longer can use their internal HDD or SSD, permanently attached to their machines, because many devices have 256 GB or 512 GB storage. That means, some external disks are needed, for example connected via USB.So, what is the problem with external disks? Well, they are sometimes disconnected by the OS, for example when Bitcoin Core downloads a lot of data into memory, and processes all of that, without doing any I/O for a long time. Which means, some unexpected I/O error could easily kill Bitcoin Core, and then you end up reindexing the chain (which takes a lot of time, even if you have for example the first 500 GB already downloaded, and stored on your external disk). That also means, if you cannot turn \"energy efficient mode\" off, you are forced to monitor your Bitcoin Core client, and restart it every sometimes, just to dump everything into your disk, before your OS will detach it, because of external disk inactivity for N minutes.That means, the final setup looks like that: there is a full archival node, sitting on some external disk, just to be safe, and to have the whole blockchain, just in case. But on internal disk, on which OS is running, there is some pruned node, for daily operations. Also, when it comes to nodes running 24/7, those nodes usually can be placed on some servers, but their storage is usually not so big, to allow storing the whole chain. Which means, only a local node on external disk is full archive node, all other nodes are in pruning mode.As blockchain gets bigger and bigger, we can expect there will be more and more pruned nodes. Because using external block explorers is unsafe, it is usually a good idea to have your own block explorer, and just import addresses as watch-only, if you want to explore them. However, if your node is in pruning node, then some commands does not work, for example importing addresses, because there is not enough history for a full rescan. Which means, to have a full functionality, it is still needed to attach some external disk, and ask full archival node for some proofs, to import them into pruned node.However, pruned nodes already contain a lot of useful information. For example, each pruned node can verify, if a new incoming transaction is correct or not. That means, each pruned node contains a full UTXO database. And very often, what users really care about, is not the full history, related to some address. Users often just want to observe only some unspent transaction outputs, and not dig into the whole history of past transactions, and spend transaction outputs. All of that leads us to the idea from the topic: having UTXO explorer, instead of block explorers.",

But having our own blockchain aka node gives us the ultimate privacy and eliminate the reliance of third party servers.",

The cost is not the issue in case of local node, the problem is you usually don't get hardware with built-in 4 TB disk, so you need some external one. And then, OS can do some optimizations to turn it off, when it is not used, and then you need to reindex your full node, because of corrupted database, when Bitcoin Core is killed by some I/O error.Also, if you have any server, running 24/7, then it is not one-time-cost to buy some larger disk, because you pay monthly or yearly for that, so it is a cost, that will force you to pay more, for a longer time. Which means, having 4 TB of storage on your server in the cloud, will eventually be much more expensive than having 4 TB of local storage, because you are not the owner of that disk, but you pay for a service of having that storage, and then it quickly becomes more expensive than buying a disk and owning it.",

So for under $200 you can get a machine that can store / re-index / do whatever in under a couple of days.You CAN run core on less, but as you pointed out when things go wrong it takes longer to recover. You can also haul around lots of construction supplies in your compact car, but getting a pickup truck works better.The right tool for the right job.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5399730-Dave",

Because CPU speed is not much better than ten years ago.The speed of a single core hasn't gone up for ages but we are getting CPUs with many cores that can perform computations in parallel hence significantly increasing the computation time. Full nodes like bitcoin core utilize parallelism for verification.QuoteAnd now, I made a copy of the whole chain on my 4 TB external disk, and I spend next hours on getting it reindexed, to the point where it were before latest crash.

This could help any user in general who wants a comfortable way to search the balance of an address without the history of its UTXO. Basically, what you're suggesting here is to take advantage of the UTXO set every kind of full node necessarily carries, and make it accessible in a comfortable fashion, via a web page. I'm just going to say that I'm running full node on a 4GB RPi 4, and I have installed a mempool.space explorer, and it runs fine. And I do sometimes want to check information beyond the UTXO set, so I'm under the impression this won't be in great demand.",
