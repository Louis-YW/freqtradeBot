Your private keys are kept safe offline, so hackers can't get them online.2. They can't be tricked by online scams (phishing).3. You need to manually do transactions, so no accidental ones.4. They're great for long-term storage of your cryptocurrency.airgapped wallets are a very safe way to protect your digital money. If you want to keep your cryptocurrency secure, consider using one.Here's how to setup airgapped wallet in electrum.steps:1. Download Electrum onto an offline computer.2. Generate a wallet on the offline computer and write down the provided seed phrase.3. Use this wallet to create receiving addresses.4 .Create and sign transactions on the offline wallet.5. Transfer transaction details to an online computer for broadcasting.This process maintains the security of your private keys by keeping them offline.

You need to manually do transactions, so no accidental ones.The risk is reduced in minimal when trying to send from an airgapped device, but that doesn’t Eliminate the risk total because you would still need to verify or cross check the address(es) you are sending your bitcoins to. There is a little possibility of clipboard error especially when creating the unsigned transaction from a watch only wallet on the online device. Quote from: bitnote on October 25, 2023, 04:25:13 AM4 .Create and sign transactions on the offline wallet.You can limit the process to be done by the offline device to just signing of the transaction and not necessarily creating the transaction. The online watch only wallet can be used to create the and the transfer offline to the airgapped device for signing and then later back to the online device for broadcasting. Overall an airgapped device is the best for wallet storage if you are someone that feel uncomfortable with hardware wallets",

But as for newbie like OP, i would also second your opinion of him sticking to hardware maybe until he is sufficiently equipped with knowledge to set it up himself (if he still cares). The major hit back is always how the set up and unsigned transaction of offline wallet is carried out, an experienced person will go all the way to use an open source operating system like Linux, running away from using USBs for transferring and using Webcams as a means for that. One more thing is the hardware wallet is more portable and easier to move around than an offline device.

My account is absolutely secure. Your wallet isn't absolutely secure if it is in an online device, as anything that is online is prone to hacking, Electrum is an online wallet by default, so if you want to use Electrum wallet to store your main funds, you should run Electrum in an airgapped device.
