According to Education Ecosystem, a financial layer in gaming is inevitable as the internet gradually develops into a superpower economy. It's because there's already a foundation set in gaming, whether it's for Web3, NFT/P2E games, there has been a huge community that's already there.And these projects just have to make the most of it and connect it to the passionate gamers worldwide with what they have to offer.It's true that a financial layer could be just another big upgrade to it and many will likely to adopt it as it'll make purchasing and gaming easier. Although, it's already easy now but there could be a better thing about it and web3.",

Thats true. A gamer doesnt even need to have earnings and this isnt their first goal or even their priority. If they only care about the money after it then their not real gamers. When p2e on web3 started too many users become a gamer or even streamers. That means they are just associated with these due to potential revenues on ads or views. We need real people advocate the ideals of games on web3.",

The main aim for the gaming in the crypto was play to earn mechanism. I have seen bunch of games in crypto but they have no users caused by the demand was coming from play to earn mechanism. I just wanna try to remind OP if he has beens scamming some of his participants who participated in the education bounty. Better to let him pay those who already participated. lolGame has nothing to do with web 3 or whatever people called it",

So people should not get fooled by any play to earn using that thing and always do their research if the team really serious developing great with this upgrading technology.",

However, they have little usability outside their respective in-game ecosystems. Yet, if the gaming industry fully embraced Web3 and blockchain technologies, a new world of GameFi and Play-to-Earn (P2E) could be unlocked.GameFi and P2E (play-to-earn) are concepts within the Web3 gaming space that allow players to earn cryptocurrency through playing games including GameInfinity, Axie Infinity, Gala games",

Web3 gaming solves this by providing true ownership and interoperability. Under Web3, users could potentially own and monetize their own data, or receive payment for contributing to the platform. And, if you stop playing, you can sell or trade your assets and kick-off.",

It is for a fact that most of those what I've said that lost their money on the gamble are there because of FOMO and some only wants huge profits, so it is also much their fault for losing their money, coz if you think about it, it's already an unwritten rule in crypto industry that you are the ones liable for your own decisions, investments and your security.",

For example, they could create in-game currencies that players could purchase with cryptocurrency, further incentivizing players to engage with their games.By implementing blockchain technology, players could have ownership over their in-game assets and trade them freely without having to go through centralized platforms. I means, this would give players more control and flexibility over their gaming experiences. I think web3 has the potential to be a major force in the future of game and blockchain industries.",
