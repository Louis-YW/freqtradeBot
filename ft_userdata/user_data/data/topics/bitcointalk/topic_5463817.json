  "content": "Bitcoin is having a big advantage over Shitcoins: you know it’s a quality coin. Bitcoin doesn’t need excessive marketing (Bitcoin doesn’t even have a pre-mined stash to fund marketing from because Bitcoin doesn’t need it), Bitcoin is a quality coin itself. Bitcoin doesn’t require research if it’s a coin or a token. So, it’s very important to understand the difference between a coin and a token.  Due to new projects being launched on existing platforms, people started confusing terms how to call a cryptocurrency properly. In this topic we are going to debunk marketing buzzwords, which are used frequently to boost shit cryptocurrencies in a fraudulent way. So far, various new projects keep \"enriching\" us from the Shitcoin industry but a very big problem arose around it, that different terms like \"Coin\" or \"Token\" caused confusion for everyone. For this purpose, it is very important to have a look at what a \"Coin\" and a \"Token\" really is and why it is important to research if a cryptocurrency is a coin or a token. Coin A coin is an original cryptocurrency based on an independent blockchain, whose blockchain is operated independently from other blockchains. It does not matter whether this blockchain has been launched right away, copied or forked. A coin serves as a medium for transaction fees on that original blockchain. Examples of coins are: Bitcoin BTC, Bitcoin Cash [BCH], Litecoin [LTC], Ethereum [ETH], Ethereum Classic [ETC], Cardano [ADA], Avalanche [AVAX], Waves [WAVES], Tezos [XTZ] and Dogecoin [DOGE] etc. Token A token is based on a blockchain that already existed before the token was created. This token needs to follow all characteristics of this blockchain on which it is based on, you need some coins of the original platform to send tokens and all transactions of this token are also recorded in this existing blockchain. The best-known platform for tokens is Ethereum. Ethereum tokens can be created on it, whose transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Fees are paid in Ether Coins. Other examples of tokens include: Waves tokens, which are based on Waves (fees are paid in Waves Coins) or Binance tokens, which are based on Binance (fees are paid in Binance Coins) etc. So, if you want to move a token, you always need some original platform coins. All other coins except Bitcoin are therefore called \"Altcoins.\" This dates back at a time when new projects always had their own blockchain. The term \"Altcoin\" was therefore justified. Now, especially from the introduction of Ethereum, many projects have emerged, that will either stay for their entire existence on the Ethereum blockchain or later eventually switch to their own blockchain. Until then, they are on the Ethereum blockchain. So, for the sake of accuracy, these products are called \"Alttokens\" instead of \"Altcoins\" as long as they are still a token. The popular term for such products would then be \"Shittoken\" instead of \"Shitcoin\" accordingly. False marketing is deceiving buyersWhile the term \"Coin\" evokes more valuable properties, \"Token\" sounds rather of low quality. As a result, many projects are advertising their product as a \"Coin\" while in reality, it is (still) a \"Token\". One should not be deceived by this because projects are frequently doing this to shill their useless crap products. Projects doing this, should be avoided as it’s a big red flag.  In addition, there’s a new strategy from competing projects to trash competing projects. In a misguided effort, the competing coin is labelled as a token, but in reality, it’s a coin because it’s based on its own blockchain. But competing projects are labelling it as a token to trash it and provide an effort to scare and discourage potential buyers from buying the competing coin. It might even happen for competing projects to hire \"agents\" and place such agents in marketing departments of competitors, where in marketing material, these agents are wrongfully changing the term \"Coin\" into \"Token\" to make the competitor coin look bad by calling it \"Token\".  ICO, ITO, Shitcoin and ShittokenThe often-used term \"token sale\" is derived from a time, when many ICOs were using Ethereum and are as a result, assets have been tokens during its sale. For a better accuracy, it should be called ITO (Initial Token Offering) instead of ICO (Initial Coin Offering), since tokens are offered at this point in the majority of all cases. These only become coins eventually later. While it can be argued, that an ICO, where tokens are offered will also mean, that these tokens will definitely become coins later and their state as a token is just temporarily and the sale just serves as an event to have the earliest recording of the cryptocurrency, it can’t be argued that a token is a coin, when there’s no unique blockchain, where it’s based on. So, it’s important to get our facts right and look into a cryptocurrency if it’s a coin or a token and if it’s shit (which it is for most cases), call it Shitcoin or Shittoken, respectively. We need to address all technical details properly.

Like making shit posts with token tags instead of #coin tags would create bad image of a coin but still who do not even know the difference of Coin and Token will not bother to think the about such things but those who know the different like me I knew the difference of Coin and Token before but I did not knew that the price of each or value of Coin is more than the Token. I am asking it again are you saying a Coin has the more potential then a token just because token does not have its own blockchain. Let's say a coin just came into the market with some new blockchain with some old mechanism like POS etc. And there is a token based on ETH blockchain and that Token platform is also getting more investments and trust over that Coin base platform. Does it still mean coin is better one instead of token?Same thoughts goes for the ICO and ITO and I am agreed with your point that projects which are introducing a token but using the term of ICO should be changed to ITO. But what difference it will make as tokens or coin price is not solely drive by the dependency on Blockchain.",

Does it still mean coin is better one instead of token?We need to judge here from case to case. You are right that there can be a very bad Coin, for example, when weak, copied and outdated tech is implemented. And there can be a very good token, where the project is unique, like UniSwap. Sometimes, a project is better on an existing blockchain. But on an average basis, a coin is much better than a token: add up all coins and all tokens and you'll get an average. For example out of our top 10 cryptocurrencies, 7 cryptocurrencies are coins and 90%+ of crypto's market capitalisation is owned by coins. Reasons for this can be: - a coin has much more potential, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are providing a whole digital currency (BTC) or independent platform (ETH), where tokens can be launched on- a token is dependent on the plaform where it was launched on, it is limited to that platform and even can fail if the underlying platform fails...So, a coin has just more potential. If it's indeed better, needs to be judged from case to case by evaluating the tech of each coin. While we can't judge for every single project, the average is very clearly in favor of coin, like we can see on CoinMarketCap.",

It's better to assume that all altcoins and tokens are shitcoins because either the devs are scammers who create a coin/token to dump premine, or the coin/token will fail even if devs will honestly work on it, because blockchain doesn't really have any practical applications aside from currency, and we already have Bitcoin, so copying Bitcoin is pointless.",

We need to address all technical details properly. Back then we only have duplicates of Bitcoin when there are new coins launching but since the inception of Ethereum and how they can host a token and ICO we are flooded with thousands of tokens until now we are so many new tokens coming with ICO, they abused and continue to abuse the system.It's very important for new investors to first understand how Bitcoin works first before they dwell on other coins or tokens lest they get the impression that Bitcoin has a chain that can host other tokens when it's not.Scammers find it easy to launch a campaign because its easy to create a token and the supply is already created and easily distributed on ICO, for a project being hosted in a chain to prove that they have a use case needs to have a solid roadmap and skilled developers to back up the project, to set them apart from a developer who just created a token to make money.",

Well, that is something i likewise do; i know there might be some good Altcoins/tokens but finding them is like looking for a needle in a haystack, thus that sort of investment now becomes more like a gamble, and that's not something i want to do. Having said that, some Altcoiners might come up with the argument that Bitcoin is also risky, which is true, but Bitcoin has an actual utility as well, thus you can be pretty certain that it isn't going extinct, neither will it just disappear like some altcoins would, it will plunge in price as it usually does, but the price will definitely appreciate again. It is a perfect decision to stick to only Bitcoin if you can.",

They have learned the hard way that 90% of them will flop but they strongly believe out of the hundreds of tokens there will be one that does x1000 at least during a pump if not constant and that alone will make for all the losses and earn a bit of profit.Probably the majority has learned that the crypto space is impossible to predict, you might have a great idea but go public at the worst time possible, you might have a solid concept but it lacks traction, you get those right and when everything seems fine the launch is a fiasco so, again probably, most are just tired of analyzing each one of them and details or have already gone crazy for doing so!But I will add that few really care about the difference between token and coin, the driving factor here is the revenue, and with shiba inu and doge turning from meme coins into quite profitable investments if you knew when to buy, it's less about the technical behind the coin than the hype potential in it.Then again, I'm wondering what would be the ratio of launched crypto nowadays, tokens/coins?I would be a bit surprised if it's not something like 10:1.Quote from: 1miau on August 19, 2023, 03:25:55 PMSo, for the sake of accuracy, these products are called \"Alttokens\" instead of \"Altcoins\" as long as they are still a token.

So far, no Altcoin has shown to be \"better\" than Bitcoin. Not a single one in almost 15 years. Some Altcoins are very famous, have nice design and are good for cheap and fast transaction but there's always an important downside (like security or a lack of decentralisation).

Yes and we should also be aware of Shitcoin marketing. Shitcoins are great in marketing, where buzzwords, nice designs and deceiving metrics are presented to push a new cryptocurrency. Because new projects have a big stash of funds for marketing, it's very easy for such projects to deceive people by false marketing. But if we are aware of it and know about deceiving marketing tricks, we can avoid to fall for it.  In opposite, Bitcoin doesn't have a marketing stash. Bitcoin's \"marketing\" is good tech, decentralisation and a track record of being the original coin. And so far, no Shitcoin has beaten Bitcoin.",

      "body": "I'm pretty late to comment on this thread but I highly agree with you @1miau regarding Bitcoin. The things you have mentioned about Bitcoin are to the point and I also believe that none of those shit-coins is going to ever be close to Bitcoin even with additional features. Man, you have explained about coins and tokens in very detail in this thread and anyone who didn't knew that already should have learnt a lot by reading this thread. I agree that most people don't really know the difference between a token and a coin and they are in confusion that why those terms are used for newly launched cryptocurrencies. But, I'm quite sure that once they read this thread then they will know the difference between those without further research.Back to the original topic! The Bitcoin really doesn't need any kind of marketing because it's the king of the whole crypto-sphere and no other coin or token would ever be able to take its place ever. The shit-coins are mostly there because of the shady marketing tactics they are using to trap new investors, and they're paying huge sums to influencers to accomplish their shady goals. Bitcoin doesn't need any of that crap and it get's investors attention due to its own unique features and they community behind it. Almost everyone who is member of the crypto-community knows about Bitcoin, but I'm more than sure that there are so many members of the community who still don't know much about many shit-coins, and they will never know about them because the shit-coins are so many in number and most of them are totally useless. Some of those shit-coins are living because of the shady marketing they have been using for a long time while others are living because they already fooled out many investors who are holding those shit-coins.I must say that there are a very few good projects in shit-coin sphere and we can't neglect those but most of them are just useless craps which don't even offer a single good feature. Many of those coins are just rug-pulls and they are created to loot money from the pockets of the investors, and pre-sale sites like Pinksale are helping those shady projects to loot money out of investors pockets. The thing will continue in that way and many people will give up on cryptocurrencies because of such shady traps.",

The developing team can put in a little effort to creating a crap blockchain and investing loads on marketing. This is not false advertising cause it is actually a coin but a shitty one. Quote from: 1miau on August 19, 2023, 03:25:55 PMSo, for the sake of accuracy, these products are called \"Alttokens\" instead of \"Altcoins\" as long as they are still a token. The popular term for such products would then be \"Shittoken\" instead of \"Shitcoin\" accordingly. In your example it will be tokens and not alttokens, cause there is no top token the way we have Bitcoin and it is not an alternate version.I am okay lumping them all as shitcoins or altcoins, cause making a distinction makes some look more valuable than the others.- Jay -In reading through this thread, some similar kinds of ideas passed through my head in terms of considering how much value comes from making some of the subcategorizations of the various kinds of shitcoins and the various kinds of ways to scam people in various kinds of ways that largely amount to various kinds of affinity scams on bitcoin that either make comparisons or contrasts to bitcoin, whereby bitcoin is adding most of the value - while at the same time, the various shitcoins sometimes can end up serving as real world laboratories in order that if they do happen to come up with something that might work in bitcoin and provide value in bitcoin, then it could be added into bitcoin at the base layer or at a second or third layer.So does the difference between Coin and Token really matter in the whole scheme of things, maybe not in terms of BIGGER picture ideas, but sometimes in terms of the devils of implementing some kind of a potential non-scam feature, then how the feature functions and the extent to which it actually had been tested could make some differences to know whether it was on a token or a coin and to thereby consider the various incentives that might have played out on a scam project versus if it were to be attempted to be added to bitcoin where the incentives might already be different, and then will the scam token or coin or feature have some positive or negative affects on bitcoin and would it be able to add value.. or make money for whoever is able to implement it on bitcoin and to be able to tie it to bitcoin rather than to some having it connected to some project that has questionable underlying base layer features.",

      "body": "QuoteFalse marketing is deceiving buyersWhile the term \"Coin\" evokes more valuable properties, \"Token\" sounds rather of low quality. As a result, many projects are advertising their product as a \"Coin\" while in reality, it is (still) a \"Token\". One should not be deceived by this because projects are frequently doing this to shill their useless crap project.Sometimes people don't know the reason why some higher ranks members keeps emphasising on bitcoin because from the beginning of some projects they don't have any reasonable concepts but they will come with this idea of coin in order to decisive innocent people of their hard earned bitcoin and other valuable asset. Of lately I drastically draw myself away from any of those shity projects in romance of creating a coin instead of using real language of token they turned it to lure people into venturing on their project which I think is a total waste of time and energy as I don't see any good reason to sell ones bitcoin to invest in those good for nothing projects.",
