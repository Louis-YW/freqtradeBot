  "content": "Grapheneüëâ| Scalable Sharding BlockchainTelegram: https://t.me/GetGrapheneA Layer-1 Blockchain that allows for an endless amount of use cases.With the potential capacity to process over 100,000 transactions per second, Graphene is a revolutionary Blockchain architecture which makes use of sharding technology and the CASPER consensus protocol. The architecture has been developed using the modern programming language ‚ÄòGo‚Äô.Having the ability to support high-performance execution of Turing-complete smart contracts, Graphene can support complex decentralized applications (dApps), business models, and allow the creation of customized shards that are optimized for different use cases, while allowing full interoperability between shards. The potential use cases for Graphene are limitless.Graphene currently resides on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) but will be migrated to its own mainnet sometime in 2023. ¬†Tokens can be purchased on Pancake Swap. https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0xf209ce1960fb7e750ff30ba7794ea11c6acdc1f3Symbol: GFNTotal Supply: 112,095,436Maximum Supply: 230,000,000Contract Address: 0xf209ce1960fb7e750ff30ba7794ea11c6acdc1f3Chain: Binance Smart Chain (BEP20)Graphene Website: https://getgraphene.ioGraphene Telegram: https://t.me/GetGrapheneGraphene Announcement: https://t.me/GetGrapheneANNGraphene Discord: https://discord.gg/rzuBNsvVyVGraphene Twitter: https://twitter.com/getgrapheneGraphene Blog: https://getgraphene.medium.comGraphene CMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/grapheneGraphene Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/graphene Graphene Litepaper: https://getgraphene.medium.com/graphene-litepaper-785d8966fe1Graphene Roadmap: https://getgraphene.medium.com/graphene-roadmap-f7a375b4aa82",

Team has been consistently involved since since 2017. Initially, dev team was planning to add functionality to the Phore project. ¬†Once they saw what they had brewing, the opted to separate the projects and go full tilt into Graphene. ¬†Some of the coding for this project was shared with ETH 2.0. Almost all of my GFN tokens have come from airdrops. There is no premine. I highly suggest you keep an eye on this one.",
