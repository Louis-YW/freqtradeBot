He even made this statement \"Even if Craig lied in his court documents that doesn't mean he isn't Satoshi, you know?\" hahahhahahhaha I can't make this stuff up man. Honestly I want to say the youtube account he works for i'll give you a hint it starts with Crypto. That should narrow it down   haha. I am with you its obviously a scam and the fork was so long ago and Craig Wright is most definitely NOT Satoshi, I can't believe that this guy was so certain on BSV and this false theory. BTC and ETH all the way for me, the only 2 I am really into. I do like me some NFTs but I got lucky and found really good projects that give value. So far the only value Craig Wright has given to crypto is for others to buy in on a really great dip a bear market or so ago, lol.",

Again, I am so much convinced that Satoshi is not reappearing till eternity. Then, I am confident that Satoshi has never left us, he is still into crypto and bitcoin and probably in this group but with a different alias and identityOp, you didn't say about Monero. But I so much believe the potential of Monero. Though it may not make any head way now, but if bitcoin finishes all the battle, the world may see the need for total privacy and embrace Monero.",

If that someone do knows and make out some research in depth about CSW then for sure he would be definitely be laughing and telling tohimself that he was a fool on believing on something bullshit.For sure this guy had been blinded up with some BSV supporter out there or had been completely brainwashed by anyCSW video out there and been convinced. hehehe",

When someone asks why projects like this have not completely failed, one only needs to look at how many naive people still believe that they have real coins in their wallets.Source (CMC)",
