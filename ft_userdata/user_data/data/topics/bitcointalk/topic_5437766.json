The market women who don't know how to operate phones and other internet devices for transactions are crying seriously that they are dying for hunger. Since the banks are not paying cash and the AMT machines are already configured to pay only $43.45 (#20,000) per account and this also make some bank customers to use multiple accounts ATMs. And because of the long line to withdraw from the ATM, many customers who are already cryptocurrency friendly ones are now swapped to BTC to avoid the stress. That is, the cashless policy forces many customers to changed their Fiat currency for easy p2p transaction since the Fiat bank cashless transaction is not smooth because of network issue. Nigeria age group is crying for help. Nigeria government did not plan it well before implementing it in the country. But if it continues Nigerians will adapt to it.Banking hall drama as cashless policy kick off.ATM queue",

Cashless policy is a way of making use of online payment dominating the traditional paper cash fiat means if exchange, people that know about bitcoin are educated enough to know how to use bank apps or making use of web payment. All banks in Nigeria have apps that can be used for online payment. I am not affected because I paid 99% of the goods I am buy using using online transactions, I can not because of that think of bitcoin, we think of bitcoin because it is a means of investing, and in the process of investing, we also use it to make transaction with bitcoin lovers.",

I don't think those market women would go as far starting to transact with bitcoin, either to those who are not into digital currency to have the idea to immediately start using bitcoin as means of payment. As a matter of fact, I don't think it has anything to do with bitcoin transaction because, you and I are still free to send and receive money via local banks, I think the only issues there is having physical cash at hands; However, the system is still functional you can decide to use bitcoin or you can use your ATM cards for shopping and paying any amount of bills you want, besides since the cashless policies I have been using my cards for spending, like buying Fuel, food stuff, and paying my utility bill as well as paying for my movement within the city by ordering BOLT, I don't feel any stress.",

On Tuesday, January 31st, I had a nearly identical experience in which I was unable to use my UBA debit card to pay for my purchases because I had previously used the card to withdraw $10,000, which I believe is the card's daily limit, and I also attempted to use my mobile app, which was also experiencing network downtime. My saving grace that day was that I didn't rely on one bank, which gave me the option of using my KUDA to make a transfer; however, did you know that the party to whom I transferred had to wait about 32 minutes before he could see it?

This doesn't make sense!Somebody who can't shop with a debit card or isn't able to implement a debit card payment for his shop will definitely not be able to pay or receive bitcoins either, common, it's not like it gets any easier than using a debit card nowadays. If one can't master that bitcoin is on a completely new level!It's like telling a person who can't remember his pin number how to enroll his card in Gpay and use his phone at a terminal, what do you think the rate of success is? Besides, if there are enough merchants tech savvy to allow people to convert their cash or their debit funds to cryptocurrencies through portable PoS, why aren't merchants implementing card payments directly? I agree that some will explore alternatives to avoid wasting time there but I don't think the conversion rates from fiat to BTC would be anything spectacular.

I agree with you, the most challenging aspect right now, is the inability of the internet banking systems to meat up to the demands of customers as there have been massive outcry of bad bank network over the last few days, and since the beginning of this new month of February when the cashless policy received its most attention due to the inability of Nigerians to make financial transactions due to lack of banknotes in circulation and bad internet banking networks it now look as if the bank is in collaboration with some individuals and corrupt citizens to sabotage government efforts by holding the banknote and selling it to Nigerians, this has led to the hard conditions for many Nigerians but I believe, as time goes on everyone will get used to the new system and the panic withdrawals will be normalized for us to see the real effect of this new policy.",

If the bank's mobile application and online banking activities not working as supposed how is it possible that the concept of what is happening is just to promote the country CBDC?I believe the cause of this is just mismanagement done by the country's Central Bank and the institutional bank in the mobile application area.",
