However, kcud_dab found out that there are security issues with this, so I removed it. You'll have to middle-click links if you want them to open in a new tab.If people find this disruptive, I could add rel=noreferrer to some of the target=_blank links, but then referrer info would never be sent, which might be undesirable.@theymos That was years ago and nowadays any decent browser support <rel=noopener> for <target=_blank> links. It tells to open the target resource \"without the new browsing context access the previous document (the engine does not set Window.opener on the new context, its value will be null).\"Exemple with Chrome, Anchor target=_blank implies rel=noopener by default",

So they just make the updates that are strictly necessary for everything to work with the new technologies that are emerging in aviation. But the base system is the same, no big extras.It is better to have an older and more secure system than to have something very modern and more likely to be hacked.",

Otherwise there is no threat and the blank-target link is completely safe and secure. So itâ€™s all about trust: do you 100% trust the pages that youâ€™re linking to? If so, you have absolutely nothing to worry about. If the link has some badass scripts it doesn't matter if it opens in a new tab or in the same one, the result will be the same, and as the article says, we need to trust the links we are opening before doing it. We all know the risks about open random links on internet, is not a safe place at all. And rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" is something new for me, I didn't know that exist but I like those functions. Looks like it's the right way to work with target blank nowadays and i will incorporate it in my next web designs, so, as always, thanks for sharing the knowledge.",

We don't go outside the forum all the time. Maybe we visit one or two websites daily on the forum. If you visit a casino link, exchange link or whatever link, You may click on the Middle mouse button to open a new tab. I agree that sometimes we lose concentration in the forum once we visit casinos or other websites. But we have solutions, too, without modifying the forum.",

It should be noted though, that the vulnerability is available only to those who have access to the site that is using target=\"_blank\"Quote from: perishablepress.comThink of it this way. In order for the blank-target hack to work, the attacker must have control of the target page. For example, if I have a blank-target link pointing at Facebook, like this:<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a>For this blank-target link to be exploited, the attacker must have control of the Facebook homepage, in order to execute whatever malicious script...So unless someone has control over bitcointalk.org's server, it isn't really a vulnerability that would be active at all times. Nonetheless, a vulnerability is a vulnerability and the door shouldn't be opened if it doesn't need to be....and it's an easy solve with rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" as you said.Either way, I am with LoyceV on this one. Right click, open in new tab. If on mobile, hold the link/copy the link, open it in a new tab. The convenience of skipping one or two clicks is really not necessary.

Make use of the bookmarks function that is available in almost any browser.2. Make use of the right side of your mouse, which when you click a link, will offer the \"Open in new tab\" option. If you don't have a right click for some reason, hold CTRL and click the link (or CMD/alt depending on your OS/browser). There's no need to enforce a feature something that is already functional, optional and only a click away in every OS and browser.",
