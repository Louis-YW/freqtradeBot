  "content": "I have been thinking about for a while, how we can have something like Bisq, but on mobile. The P2P nature of Bisq makes it really difficult to run in a mobile environment. I have engaged with the Bisq 2 team and there's little to nothing that would improve this situation any time soon. This is especially relevant as no KYC exchanges like LocalBitcoins, etc have been getting shutdown or getting KYC regime imposed on them one after the other. While most users really just go to CEX as the UX is just so much superior.On the other hand, Nostr have been developing extremely rapidly the past 6 months, and recently the Damus iOS client have increased the adoption of Nostr drastically. I was thinking if a similar architecture can be used for a Bitcoin/Fiat DEX. In fact, what if we pipe DEX orders and trade information directly through existing Nostr relays? Potentially creating plausible deniability for node runners that they are facilitating any sort of trades whatsoever?I haven't got everything figured out yet, especially on how to strengthen plausible deniability on the part of Nostr relay runners. But I did write an initial proposal on Github. Would love to get some feedback before I actually try to build an iOS client that actually implements the protocol proposed!

I was hoping something would change after Bisq 2.0 get released, but your post crush my last hope.Only way would be using some remote software to control Bisq that ins installed on your computer, but that is not the same thing.Quote from: Nobu.maeda on February 24, 2023, 06:28:10 AMOn the other hand, Nostr have been developing extremely rapidly the past 6 months, and recently the Damus iOS client have increased the adoption of Nostr drastically.

So is Bitcoin tho however. If you are familiar with Robosat, the platform doesn't really touch the payment, it just relays information between the Maker and Taker. What protects the trade is a fidelity bond either implemented through a multi-sig (no 3rd party unless dispute arises/trade times-out), or through a trusted intermediary. Both schemes are explained in my Github. These schemes aren't new, they are used in both Bisq and Robosat currently. My proposal merely makes all this an open protocol that can be routed in a federated redundant manner.Quote from: dkbit98 on February 24, 2023, 05:05:16 PMCan this work on Android devices or only for iOS devices?Its meant to be an open protocol that anyone can implement. Just like Nostr, someone made the Damus iOS client. And then someone else made the Amerthyst Android client, amongst many other web clients. I am better at iOS myself, so I think I'll probably start there. Might consider writing a core library of sort in Kotlin or Go or Rust so it can make implementing on a separate platform easier down the road, but it will slow down iOS development itself.For now I just want to get some feedback on architecture, whether there's even a demand for the end product and if its sufficiently differentiated from Bisq / Robosat as it is, etc.",

This is no different than Bisq or Robosat. In Bisq's case a trusted 3rd party doesn't come into the picture at all, not even as a bond holder, unless the two traders cannot get the transaction done in a 4 days period (aka, there's dispute between whether either side have fulfilled their Bitcoin or fiat obligation in the trade). The multi-sig can be structured in a mutually assured destructive way so that all bonds are loss if the two traders does not come into agreement whether both parties have completed their part in the trad. In this scheme no 3rd party is involved at all.I'd say this is a non-custodial, trust minimized way to trade and have had extremely low trade dispute rate, and no trade failures thus far in either Bisq and Robosat.The real problem of Bisq and Robosat is UX and liquidity. N3XB aims to improve on both these issues, and more.",

Any trade mechanics can be communicated through the protocol. Can be on-chain, can be LN can be fiat, can even be mailing a check, etc. The key is the protocol being open - anyone can build their project on top and tap from / contribute to the liquidity in the network. Unlike the way it is currently now, Robosat has their order book, and Bisq has their's (albeit distributed P2P), and then Paxful has their's, etc. They are all siloed. Why can't we build one giant orderbook together, but stored in a federated redundant and censorship resistant manner across many relays, just like (in fact through) Nostr?Not to mention both Paxful and Robosat is really a single web server. Just because its Tor doesn't mean much. Silk road was behind Tor and got nuked. Not a good idea for the dev to also be the sole node (Robosat web server) runner and also the dispute resolution entity in one... N3XB makes it so anyone can be in any distinct roles, and probably get paid to do these roles.Quote from: dkbit98 on February 24, 2023, 06:08:16 PMI am not an expert or developer, but I will take a look and try to spread the word about this.We certainly need more real DEX options for trading BTC, that are easy to use and can work on all devices, including mobile phones.Please do. I created a brand new anon identity for this project and has been difficult to draw attention to the proposal. Last thing I want to do is to spend the next 6 months building something that's not well thought through, not well scrutinized, and the community at large doesn't find it useful. Thanks!",
