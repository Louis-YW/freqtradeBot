However, we know that history repeats itself. So, despite a lot of bad news, there are many reasons to believe that Bitcoin will recover in the near future. Just keep in mind that we are now struggling with a massive bear eight. It would take some time to recover, and the picture is meaningless.",

It would take some time to recover, and the picture is meaningless.Exactly, there is no correlation, but I guess there are still individual and it's the majority here that bitcoin bull run will happen later, right after the halving.So I this same people could be looking forward for the next bull run despite what is the current price that we are experiencing. And with that, for me this picture is taken perhaps just a souvenir for this young people that they have attended the conference in 2022, simply as that.Again, bitcoin will continue regardless of what we are experiencing right now.",

It would take some time to recover, and the picture is meaningless.Images has the tendency of meaning or insinuating different thing to different people. An image might mean a lot to me, while it is meaningless to someone else. Maybe the statue of the bull behind the people in the picture gives the writer the needed motivation that there is better days is ahead. I don't also see the connection between the picture and the bitcoin market. I am viewing it as an image that was used to beautify the bitcoin conference venue.   Every true believer of bitcoin understands that this bearish run will not last forever. Which means that there is need for patience and perseverance. The brave in the bitcoin industry are buying and hodling because the bullish run would definitely come.",
