  "content": "First of thanks to Smoothie for organizing this Charity auction for anyone who was YOGGED! and also to everyone who donated their precious collectable ¬†¬†to this event.¬†¬† I wanted to create this thread so all affected parties can place their input and then we can decide what is the appropriate and fair way to give out the ¬† proceeds.¬†¬† SO the question now is, how are or should the proceeds ¬†be distributed. ¬†¬†My thinking is as follows....¬†¬† ¬†For anyone whose cards were swept and did not get reimbursed by CYGAN, then they should be made whole.¬†¬† ¬†Once that is done, I feel CYGAN should be given back the BTC he doled out to cover guys like myself who did accept¬†¬† his BTC as they only wanted it back from Dogg.¬†¬† ¬†If there is any BTC leftover, then I say it should be given to the people who ordered cards and never received them.¬†¬† ¬†Those are just my two satoshi....Please feel free to add your thoughts and ideas and I am sure a consensus will be ¬†¬† ¬†reached eventually that everyone is happy with.",

      "body": "Thank you krogothmanhattan for posting this as I didn't see us getting far without some sort of game plan.I never accepted funds from cygan as I saw it as taking from another innocent victim but the auction made much more sense to me about getting some reimbursement for holding the directly affected halving sets that got yogged. I know the auction funds would not cover all the yogged sets but I made a list of all the ones I could find so members could post which they hold and obviously cygan being repaid for all the ones he covered There may be more but these are the txids i could find from checking my affected halving setsJan 12 8:00 txid:

assembledhttps://imgur.com/a/T5mC9i8Thanks a lot to smoothie, minerjones, cygan, krogothmanhattan, and everyone else that made this come together for the victims and have done what they can to help since the issueüôèMaybe they can be crossed off or deleted as repaid ü§îI also paid for and never recieved a set of the personal basorexia cards for 625 and 2 sets of crypto bonds, one for each of my daughter's future birthdays to be unlocked .001,.0025, and .005 funding and 100$ worth of btc for each set, all funding and fees paid up front but never recieved. There are other orders I never recieved but I don't care as these are the main 2 I was excited about If someone can copy my list and cross-reference the cygan paid for wallets that would be great it's not very easy to do this using my phone and my boss has me working more than full time these days",

You don't get it and you clearly don't read replies. Yogg is NOT looking or logging into this forum at all. How Do I know that? Because I've posted it 10 times already and you're just a lazy shitposter for your 1 BTC a month from Stake.com... Get a real job loser...  <end shit on Ognasty shitposts> For the record I was ONLY rugged of a silver set. Did I seek refund from cygan? No. Do I want him to refund me? Hell no. Do I care if I get refunded? Not really, I've suffered much greater losses TBH. Anyhow, yogg will shortly be living in the shitty parts of paris with probably a needle in his arma few times a day. Fuck that guy.I don't believe in dwelling on anger and negativity. I've already moved on. I suggest you all try to as well, as dwelling on this POS is not worth the time or typing energy.

SO I was very lenient when it came to repaying me back....figuring his depression had something to do with it. But hindsight is 20/20....lesson learned at my end and never again. ¬† And I agree....personal loans should not be covered as it was personal and not business.",
