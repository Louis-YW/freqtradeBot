I will be glad to have many pieces of advice for other members of the forum.Good thing you want to know more about the forum first before any other thing because the mistake most newbies make when they join the forum is not get familiar with the forum, they just feel once you are a member you can do whatever you wish and they assume there are no rules guiding the forum. There are rules here and there are some things we all avoid here that are not tolerated and once you break those rules things will not be taken lightly with you so try to follow the rules of the forum.Just as mk4 mentioned, avoid spamming, avoid plagiarism (copying and pasting of other people's work) from within or outside the forum and don’t try to scam other users. there are several rules so you just have to abide by them. I can see other users have shared you some links already that contains rules and some and other information about the forum so make sure you read them carefully.",

I will be glad to have many pieces of advice for other members of the forum. If you want to be aware about the rules, then everything is laid dow in the forum, just read and understand every details listed in the forum. As long as you follow them, you’re safe and free from any forms of ban. And to tell you frankly, you don’t have to be instantly good at posting. Everything has its own process and by doing all your due diligence to learn about the insights in the forum, rest assured that you’ll be a great poster in the making. Be patient and never rush in profits. You’ll end up earning a good compensation when you are well equipped with knowledge and skills later on.",

I would bet that the percentage is very low. How often do we get questions like this? Weekly at least. I have been and still am a member of other forums and I never see this question asked on them. I imagine the economic component in this one is what accounts for it. OP, I too welcome you to the forum but my advice is to search for yourself, be self-reliant, and if you have to ask specific questions ask them after you have done some research.",

I will be glad to have many pieces of advice for other members of the forum.The issue is not about receiving advice the main issue here is; will you read and put them into action? I have seen so many users come to the forum and ask the same questions and got good responses like, don’t spam, don’t plagiarise read the forum rules etc and before they spent a month in the forum their account got ban from plagiarism. If you can take your time to follow the advice that has been provided here you’ll be able to get the best from the forum but if you pay a fldeaf ear to the rules and think you can get away from breaking the rules you’ll only end up regretting it. So just keep it at the back of your mind that if you ever go against the rules of the forum you’ll surely get the punishment no matter how long it takes it will surely come out.",

We need people who are not afraid to question. & look OP successfully posted his/her first post without violation any rules. It's a really big achievement. When I first joined this forum I didn't even knew what BBcode was! Now look at me I'm pretty good at it. Everyday I'm learning something. It doesn't matter whether it's big or small. You just have to be keep learning & have that determination. I think OP already got answer to his/her questions. So you probably lock this topic.",
