  "content": "What happened:: Found that site after researching this forum and for the good references seen.In the begining all seems to be ok. I was able to deposit, place some bets and all without problem. They warn me that first withdrawal can take up to 48h and next ones within 15 min, it takes more than that, I had to ask for my first withdrawal several times but finally arrived. Later I've made more withdrawals and arrived in less than an hour. Ok, fine for now. After a month, suddenly I cannot login to my page. Chat supports said to contact support by mail, and after doing the KYC they said that \"Hello, your account is permanently closed, based on our terms of service with regard to arbitrage betting\" and \"As you have already received considerably more than your deposit in withdrawals, this matter is considered closed.\" On time on closure I've about 0.04 BTCTheir accusation is completely false, I never made arbitrageHere is my track of the bets made, last week bets are missing because closurehttps://imgur.com/xkEePAEhttps://imgur.com/prsdWYbAnyone can see that there didn't look arbitrage bets at allAll bets are low stake, about 0.001 to 0.006 btcThere are a lot of combo betsI's easy to find the odds of my bets and see that there was no opposite bet to reach global winningsI've posted on their thread and the reply was the tipical of a spamer, user was violated the terms bla bla bla. The justification was so ridiculous that they deleted my next replyScammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=562960Amount Scammed: About 0.04 BTCPayment Method: BTC depositProof of Payment: b7272dfe65aae0602d27d3ee53fc3be2783cbad07945883863a507667c862252PM/Chat Logs: https://imgur.com/hV6hpZvhttps://imgur.com/sMKie1v",

      "body": "We replied once on our thread, once on the sportsbook ratings thread and we will reply once here. We have already spent more time and money dealing with this matter than the very small amount in his account (0.0159 BTC).The account was closed at the time the sports provider independently confirmed and advised us that he was using banned technology to achieve his wins. He made 1 deposit of 0.005 BTC and had successful withdrawals of 0.005 BTC, 0.005 BTC, 0.00147567 BTC and 0.03 BTC prior to the notification. Â In this case, the deposit does not need to be returned, as the player has already received 8x that amount in withdrawals. This shouldn't even be in scam accusations. The amount we have paid him is far more than what was in his account when it was closed. If this was a scam, we would not have paid him anything to begin with. Why would we possibly scam $300 from someone when we have paid tens of thousands in promos this year? The reputational damage alone is worth more than that, but we need to stand tall against abusive players so they get the message. This is not a scam accusation, this is a dispute, and our sports provider has evidence that he has violated our terms of service. We have informed the player that we will submit evidence to a 3rd party mediator of his choice and abide by their decision. He has not done that. Instead he has been ranting on forums for a week. The last guy who did an accusation submitted and lost. We are confident that will be the case here, as well, if he decides to go forward.",

Asking to support said that I was making arbitrage bets. I can be easily demostrate that this is false. All bets was quoted from 1,6 to 2,1. The amount of the bets was not very high, from 10$ to 50$, and more than 50% of my bets was multipleThe amount stolen was insignificant, about 200$, they are just poor scammers.(Lets see if they also deletes that post)We always respond to any accusation. In this case, we will let the community know the same thing we told you. Your account was suspended after our odds provider confirmed that you were using banned technology to guarantee yourself wins. This is a violation of our terms. Your deposit was refunded. This matter is closed. If you continue posting on our thread, yes we will delete them, as they are considered spam.",

Why is it that he was being paid, without issue, up until the last week, where he curiously no longer has a record of the bets? As usual, the accuser is saying half-truths to try and gain sympathy, when a simple solution would be to contact a mediator. This is a professional sports bettor (cannot call him a gambler, because with the tools he uses, he cannot lose). He is well aware of who can mediate disputes, but knows he cannot win. Don't let his talking in circles distract you from the fact that he knows exactly what he was doing, as he was doing it and is simply using this forum as a way to extort money.",

I actually don't think he is lying here. What has likely happened here is that his time zone is 2 hours ahead of UTC, and he doesn't realize that his email updates to his time zone and BitcoinTalk does not. Regardless, we followed the recommendation of sports industry mediation professionals, which is to return the deposit of an abusive player (as long as it is their first account), unless their withdrawals exceed the deposit value. It had nothing to do with his threats and we will never be the victim of extortion from abusive players. Quote from: paxaman on October 28, 2022, 08:40:38 AMBetting is just one of my hobbiesAccording to the numbers provided by the Playbetr rep, you earned 1000% ROI from your first deposit, betting what what you admitted were small stakes. You are primarily betting on 3rd and 4th tier leagues. Anyone who knows anything about sports betting can see that betting is not just one of your hobbies.",
