  "content": "I has already described my understanding of \"Kropotkin's anarchism\", the essence of which is not the withering away of the state, but the development of people's communities at the bottom level. I wrote that such communities will be effective if they have the opportunity to punish individual members for selfishness (with fines) by the decision of the majority. This is the principle of any state: in it people are forced to pay taxes and comply with laws, or rather, those who do not do this are punished, and no one asks if you need to pay these taxes. I think, theoretically, with the help of DeFi, communities that work on the same principle can be organized. It will look like this: members of the commune must keep some amount of money in special coins. These coins will be like ordinary bank accounts, with the ability to transfer to another participant, and with two conditions:1) By the decision of the majority, forced transactions can be carried out, i.e. money in your account can be transferred to another account;2) You can withdraw your coins into real money only with the consent of the majority.Such a commune can unite from 20 to thousands of people, and it will quickly become clear that the leaders of such groups will force the members of the commune to help each other in every possible way, to get to know each other first, and this will be very beneficial for everyone. Those who refuse to work for the benefit of the commune will be fined by the commune.",

Both DeFi and anarchism aim to empower individuals and communities to control their own resources and decisions. Both DeFi and anarchism challenge the existing power structures and offer alternatives that are more fair, efficient, and inclusive.Therefore, I think DeFi and anarchism are not only compatible, but complementary. DeFi can provide the technological infrastructure for anarchism to flourish. Anarchism can provide the ethical framework for DeFi to be used responsibly. Together, DeFi and anarchism can create a more decentralized and democratic society that respects the freedom and dignity of all people.",

I don't want the majority to decide for me. I don't want to live in a system where people can force me to do anything. This thread is about money, but it's a great moment to mention covid, as people were forced out of their homes, denied services and money because others feared the virus. Fear is a very easy and efficient way of controlling populations. When threatened from the outside, your perfect commune is going to turn into chaotic state of lockdowns and terror.Even if you buy a piece of land and make it your own state, what's going to stop your neighbors (nation states) from taking over with military and forcing you to pay taxes?",

I would think that would devalue proposition quite significantly.If I understand you correctly, this is a theoretical problem of a democracy: theoretically, 90% of citizens can vote to make the remaining 10% slaves. I suggest using the lie detector for a random group of votes for preventing this. Anyway, I think this is probably not a real problem, because if 90% \"dekulakize\" remaining 10%, after that 80% will  \"dekulakize\" remaining 10% and so on.",

I am not sure that anonymity of a cryptocurrency is a good idea.It certainly goes beyond anonymity in my opinion. You are right when you say that governments do not like currencies which offer the option of obscured transactions or blockchains, but unlike Monero, the Dash anonymity was an optional feature, with Monero it is not optional.The apparent failure of Dash has more to do with lack of innovation in comparison to other altcoins, when Dash was popular it was a novelty to have coins which allowed to send small amounts at low fees and as fast as possible, added to their master nodes.
