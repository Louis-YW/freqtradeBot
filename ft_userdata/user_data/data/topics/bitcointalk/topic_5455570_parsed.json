So Is it possible to sue the SEC somehow?  US SEC is not on your country jurisdiction also it’s impossible to sue the SEC as an individual because you only have a limited resources to do that while the damage you are pertaining is just a collateral damage due to their action towards their movement on crypto exchange crack down.This is crypto which is heavily affected with news. You should adapt on this kind of FUD that hitting the market or else you will ended up in losses. Just purchase Bitcoin and keep holdin. That’s a better alternative rather than suing the impossible. I don’t know if judge will even consider case like this.",

Try to sue the federal government and your case gets added to the docket of many others, held up for years, all the meanwhile you incur hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more, in legal fees. That's if you have jurisdiction -- pass the case on to a U.S. citizen and they get to deal with the same burden.If you want change within the SEC, best it goes through the executive (U.S. President appoints the SEC commissioners). But if you're German that has some obvious hurdles",

So Is it possible to sue the SEC somehow?  Sure, you can sue the SEC.  Is that something anyone should ever want to do though?  Unless you're facing dire circumstances like the end of your business, or your livelihood being completely stripped from you, I couldn't see any reason why a sane person would ever want to be in a lawsuit with the government.  The rules apply to you, not them.  They have endless amounts of your money to spend to beat you.  Unless you have an iron clad case and get lucky with the judge and jury, you'd have no chance of winning even if you are in the right.  It's best to avoid the government at all costs in my opinion.",

Quote from: SolomonF5 on June 07, 2023, 06:57:03 AMActually i think the Sec is manipulating the crypto market since month/years, as specially garry ganssler is abusing his power. I see this as a PR move by Gensler, whose reputation was tarnished by FTX. He was in fact attacked in the congress for talking with SBF in private. His attack on crypto exchanges is a way of showing his superiors that he's not in cahoots with the biggest players in this industry.",

I dont even know why crypto still standing in the US.... i know it sucks that all crypto industry leaders seem to be criminals, but these people got extremely rhich in no time, so what did anyone expect, a gloriole? And people like Donald Trump are even worse than CZ ore the others, and they made him their president so.....yeah...i mean the SEC is talking about protection but actually they do not protect anything. Not even themselfes. The USA are in fact insolvent. They did not solute this problem they just postponed it. And now they want to protect MY money? what a laugh. But when i see HOW they try to protect us, i know why the USA are insolvent.But hey the thought counts right ?",

So Is it possible to sue the SEC somehow?  You will get the best legal advice if you consult a lawyer that is practicing in the United States of America. From the little I know it might be possible to sue the SEC in a US court and not in Germany. But I doubt if you can win this case because the SEC is claiming that it is protecting US citizens from loss of funds that might result due to the financial malpractice of Binance. Taking legal action against Binance and seeking a court injunction to freeze the assets of the company is within their legal scope of operation. So every court will rule that the government agency is performing its function except your legal team was able to prove otherwise. I will suggest you save your money and time instead of chasing shadows.",
