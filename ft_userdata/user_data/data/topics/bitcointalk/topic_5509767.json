I checked and they did not move the Bitcoin Cash (yet -- its a piddly $17k).That's very interesting. I couldn't imagine if someone had access to such an old wallet but what makes this accident interesting is that they didn't move Bitcoins until this day while there were lots of bull runs and lots of attractive moments to move those coins. I believe that the owner didn't have access to it but somehow managed to gain access, probably by brute force.

It's very interesting who gained access to this wallet, is it the official owner of the address? And if yes, then why didn't he/she move coins before? I think that they didn't touch other inputs because they don't know the history of those 2 transactions and didn't risk it.",

Tor will be his tool for defending his privacy.Self leaking actual IP addresses sounds not like Satoshi Nakamoto.",

Maybe it was that HDD guy who threw it away.This is proof that all those estimates about \"bitcoins lost forever\" are inaccurate because you got transactions like this happening which many assumed it was a long lost private key. Many are estimating that around 3 Million bitcoins are lost this way but as you can see, these coins can wake up at anytime. Even Satoshi coins themselves could one day get spent.
