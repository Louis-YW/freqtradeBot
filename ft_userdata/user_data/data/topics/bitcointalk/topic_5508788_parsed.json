I can see my mom is very unsure of how to manage the financials and it‚Äôs a very tricky spot to navigate with my dad only being able to spit out a few words at a time, I am hopeful for a full recovery. My dad is getting better by the day which is good but it‚Äôs a long road to recovery. My family can tell that he is worried about his assets and he has made attempts to tell my mother and brothers what to do, we believe he was trading all his coins into a volatile crypto right now and want to help him stabilize that. I have my flight booked and I‚Äôll be there in a few days to help with everything but now more so than ever if you haven‚Äôt taken the time to fill in your significant other or trusted family member what to do in the event of something like this happening then you need to make sure that is in place not only for all your crypto assets but physical and anything you can pass on. We are not promised tomorrow, I am thankful my dad is alright. I believe he will recover. If you can please send prayers for him and my family üôèMake sure you have a plan in place so your loved ones are set up for success and never be in this type of situation.",

In such a case, a note book to write down our activities is really important as it can help anyone who is close to the person know what to do.",

MNow to the question of having your asset actually announced, i think we have emphasized on this topic enough most especially from the beginning of how or where you store your private key or seed phrase. There are people who disagree that this things need to be kept secret as not everyone can be trusted even family members. But for me I think we need to at least have that one person we know will be able to keep the secrets and uphold them, this is much safer than any backstabbing That will even Happen. It will be more painful to have your asset lost due to only you having access to it than it been misuse.",

Currently, the crypto market has gotten very volatile, especially with big assets like Bitcoin last August, things really seemed to show high volatility. Experts suggest that investor caution is growing due to economic uncertainties like potential interest rate changes, which makes the crypto market unpredictable. Considering this, moving his investments into more stable options like stablecoins could help reduce risk.It is important that there is a clear plan as to how the crypto and other assets are to be managed, especially when events catch one by surprise. In doing so, having a strategy for asset management may involve the creation of provisions for accessing such assets by close family members with you so as to avoid confusion and ensure long-term financial stability.",
