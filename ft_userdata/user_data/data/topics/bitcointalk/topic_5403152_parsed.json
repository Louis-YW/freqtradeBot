For now, I'm not interested in jumping deeper into bitcoin but I'm not selling either, and I'm sure I would still like to see its price increase as a digital gold currency in the future.",

When less than 10% of total supply left for mining, it will be not easy to own 1 Bitcoin.QuoteBTC is being too nice because most people don't deserve another chance after they had thousands of chances to buy it cheap and did nothing.1 BTC is 1 BTC, always but it does not mean if people enter and exit with loss. They mostly care about their loss in a very limited time like a few months, 1 year or less than years.As an asset, Bitcoin is cheap in eyes of people who love it and understand its value but it is expensive, unacceptable expensive with people who consider it as a scam and don't believe Bitcoin has any value.",

You can look at the historical charts and make some inferences if you're in to analytics and even if you're not, the global economic metrics are enough to give you insight as to how long the slump will last. Institutional investors are out of crypto for the time being (a lot of them are, not all) as people make preparations for a recession. As long as the economy is down, entire crypto market will be down.Quote from: virtualdn on June 18, 2022, 08:26:39 PMBTC is being too nice because most people don't deserve another chance after they had thousands of chances to buy it cheap and did nothing.Why be so harsh?

      "body": "If I think about the type of person that seeks to get rich quick I agree.  Granted that could be most people.  To be more specific as to what that type of person that is- it is one that can not even give a respectable definition of what a true crypto is. They probably have no clue about any of the basic components of BTC.  The dynamics between the blockchain, the software, the miners and the coin itself and how they effect each other.BUT, to maintain the vision I have understood regarding BTC I have to disagree.The global economy is on a downturn.  If we are on the verge of a global economic meltdown, we will see many different types of markets crash.  If this happens, it will hurt many but it will be weathered.  However if (big if) we see this happen -and then- this spirals into fiat currencies this could be a disaster.  How much fiat has been printed to combat the economic downturns caused by covid?   Fiat may be ripe for the picking.  In my opinion, when I step back and look at the big picture, covid could be hidden economic warfare.  Designed to level the global economic playing field.  This just happens to be at the same time governments and financial entities see the writing on the wall. Due to the decentralized nature of crypto, their hold is slipping and entire sectors can go the way of Kodak film, we just don't need them anymore.  Even if we did like them.So for the people in a country that could utilize BTC to escape bank withdraw halts/restrictions or fiat crashes (like Cyprus or Argentina)  I would rather they got in at 15k vs 70k and fulfill the lifeboat \"outside the system\" vision that influenced the birth of BTC.So in that sense, I'm happy to ride another dip vs economically decimating people who are in dire need by being forced to flee fiat at BTC all time highs.  I understand what effect this would have on the price of BTC, unforeseen all time highs.  But those who have to flee first (and probably the hardest hit) will benefit most because they got in at lower prices, thus providing much needed aid to that population.Lighten up",

On a more serious note I think the fact that the peak of this cycle was only 3.5 times the peak of the previous cycle and that the price has now dropped below USD 18,000 dismantles many of the narratives we have been believing about bitcoin.I think the narrative that the little man is going to get rich buying a little bitcoin every month is never going to be true again, because the future returns are not going to be like they were in the early years. And I don't think it was true before either, because the working man without much money who bought bitcoin at 1 USD probably sold at most when it reached 10 USD (if he didn't sell at a loss during a downturn).I think bitcoin has unique properties and is worth owning, but the stories about reaching 1 million USD in a short time nowadays seem further from reality than ever.",

You can think of it as being nice and its give you another chance to get BTC at discounted price but its still going to give anyone a chance after next halving but it might a bit pricey than today. Cheap as it may be right now but this bear run is yet not over though. I wouldn't really see this to be a nice market to get into so you better be great at trading when you come. Best not to buy yet we all get to have a chance, everyone should have a chance after all its decentralize.",

The market itself will determine the direction of the price. The best you can do is wait for your opportunity to profit. And as I said before, I think the price will move to more spectacular heights in the upcoming years. So I would go long now and buy more on dip, as prices are very interesting to see what will happen in the next weeks and months.",

The price is very nice, and I think those you the op might refer to as not deserving to buy at such a good price won't buy anyway because they're skeptics and despite multiple times when Bitcoin recovered from situations that were no better than this one, they're probably thinking that this is the end, and that it will never go up. I, however, think the current situation is no different from any previous major fall. I did think the new low would be higher than it already is, and who knows where the bottom will be this time, but Bitcoin can absolutely go to $100k-$200k, and once again many will regret not believing in it.",
