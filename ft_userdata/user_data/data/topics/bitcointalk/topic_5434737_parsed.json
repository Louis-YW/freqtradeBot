Every time I hear about them in the news, they're reporting MILLIONS in scammed funds. How can people be so gullible?The reported numbers of people who have become victims of these scams are really high, but what about the unreported cases, they surely must be higher than those the authorities can track and find out, and while reading the link in the op, it says the same thing:QuoteThe investigation suggests that the number of unreported cases is likely to be much higher. This would mean that the illegal gains generated by the criminal groups, with at least four call centres in eastern Europe, may be in the hundreds of millions of euro.There are so many cases of these crypto scams going on all over the world without any trace, some are carried out in a sophisticated way, while others may just be carried out locally by a small group of people. The lesson is that there are still many people who believe in unrealistic profit through crypto, and as long as people think crypto is a form of get rich opportunity for them, these scams would remain popular and successful.",

These aren't ponzi schemes at all, as they are literally scamming people out of their own money. Most probably they promise some sort of already existing crypto like bitcoin for instance, in exchange for real life pesos but when things start rolling they don't give the people their due crypto, because they don't have it in them. These people most likely have connections and possible ponds to fish in which would be very integral as these are the literal things that empower such scammers.

Once the authorities get a hold of this list, they won't have control anymore. It looks a ponzi to me:QuoteThe suspects used advertisements on social networks to lure victims to websites covertly operated by the criminals, which offered seemingly exceptional investment opportunities in cryptocurrencies. The victims, mainly from Germany, would first invest low, three-digit sums. Fake price hikes leading to supposedly lucrative profits for investors then persuaded them to make transfers of higher amounts.When the depositor sends them 3 digits money, he is paid back. That is the bait, so he feels encouraged to deposit larger sums of money, but when he does it, the scammers don't pay him anymore. And to keep the scheme working scammers must use the money they earned with the first victim to pay the second initial investment, and so on... That is what I understood about the method applied by the thieves.",

These scammers offer mouth-watery profits that look irresistible. Greed also motivates people to invest in these fake crypto enterprises. And immediately you invest in these scam schemes, you would keep putting in more funds because you want to make more profit or recover what was lost. They would even ask for money for you to claim a huge profit from the investment. I am sure these dubious firms would keep increasing because most people are not willing to learn about cryptocurrencies but they are just interested in making quick money from the sector. The solution to this problem is buying only Bitcoin from well-known and reliable crypto firms and shunning cheap and get-rich-quick schemes. Kudos to these law enforcement agencies for bringing down these criminal networks that are giving the crypto space a bad name.",
