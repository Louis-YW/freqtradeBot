  "content": "After my father died 3 weeks ago, we as 5 brothers agreed to fulfill my father's wishes by selling part of his land to be sold and distributed to 5 members. So my parents' house still has 250 meters of land next to my parents' house which is currently still occupied by my mother and two younger siblings and the land area of the house is also quite large.Long story short, from the sale of 250 meters of land, 5 family members each received $4,400. And I have plans to buy Bitcoin to increase my Bitcoin amount in the near future so that the money is not reduced for unimportant purposes. Because it cannot be denied that if I see large amounts of cash, I will definitely want to buy what I want, not what I need.And what confused me was that 2 of my family members, namely 1 older brother and 1 younger brother, wanted to share some of their money to invest in my Bitcoin. And they themselves don't want to do it for reasons, they don't want to bother.Even if he wants, I will teach him to make a Bitcoin wallet. But they still don't want to and want to combine their money with my money to invest in Bitcoin, and they already know that I have been involved with Bitcoin for a long time and they also know about my changes. And maybe that's what makes them want to do it, so that their money will increase.And this makes me confused and I haven't made up my mind about their money that they want to put into my Bitcoin, and they also know that investing in Bitcoin takes a long time to get good profits. And I'm always in this for the long term, and I need a way or an opinion so I can make good decisions.And to be honest, I'm still in a state of mourning because of many things and stories that I can't just forget.",

Money breeds enmity even among family members as you grow. If things don't work out, you will be in a tight spot. It's better you just guide them through, and they also do the fishing for themselves.",

      "body": "I think the reason why they don't want to have or make own a Bitcoin is because they have zero knowledge of how to protect the wallet that is why they decided to put their money into you because they know you have knowledge of how to protect them. It is just likely the same happened to me with my friend since he doesn't know much about Bitcoin and the risk of the internet he wants to buy Bitcoin and wants to send it to me and hold it for him because I know how to protect his Bitcoin.Meaning your two brother trust you about their investment in Bitcoin.What I would like to suggest make an offline wallet with two different and seed backups using the Electrum wallet make sure that you write them on the piece of paper put their Bitcoin in each of these wallets and then try to give the piece of paper to your two brothers and tell them that this is their wallet backup.If they don't want then keep them in a safe place where no one knows where you hide them. Also don't forget to take one of the BTC addresses (Public key) from each wallet where you deposited BTC and then don't forget to erase the wallet from the offline device where you created these two wallets or format the hard drive for safety purposes.If you didn't do that if someone uses that device that knows about Bitcoin they can take advantage to extract the seed phrase or make a copy of the wallet into a USB flash drive without your consent. So make sure to format the hard drive and later recover it using the seed phrase once your two brothers decide to sell it.",

But you know exactly the nature of bitcoin investment, it can instantly make you rich in the long run but it can also lose all your capital if the price drops significantly and you started selling at a loss. I guess if they can see it with their own two eyes how bitcoin is so much volatile, then they will not take the risk investing their money.But what they see in you is different from what everyone say. Your life has become in progress, and most probably they also want to experience the same that's why they are determined to invest in bitcoin as well.For now, tell them to educate theirselves first and let them enter the bitcointalk forum so they will know exactly what you are talking about. If they become active members in the forum, I guess that's the only time they will know that investing in bitcoin is not a get rich quick unlike most crypto influencers say in the social media.",

      "body": "If that's the case for you both right now and your brothers are still insistent about pooling money, you might want to think about coming to an agreement. I mean, you may suggest setting up a shared wallet with explicit guidelines for making decisions and allocating gains and losses. You guys can set clear and mutually understood terms to prevent future misunderstandings.You mentioned that you have been investing in bitcoin for a long time, so perhaps they wanted to learn about it step-by-step with your guidance and informational conversations. This is why, in my opinion, they have been doing it like combining their money with your money to invest in bitcoin because they are complete beginners, and that may be their alternative choice to come to you and invest using your bitcoin wallet. I think that regularly updating your brothers on the status of the investment allows you to revisit the decision-making process and impart knowledge to them.",

They will end up blaming you because you never warn them of its possible risks, when in reality you did but they are blinded by greed. Same like they will also blame you if they see you profiting while leaving them not growing their money at all.There's no way you can win from this type of mindset. The best solution is let them invest but only on the amount that they can afford to lose. Otherwise, they will lose everything they have in just a blink of an eye.",

However, my decision to invest my own money will soon be implemented and I just have to wait for the right time, and for now what comes to my mind is that when the time is right, I will advise them to do it themselves. And keep it under my supervision until they really understand everything including the risks, and all that after I educate them how to use it and all the basics.Once again, thank you everyone.

Acting as a middleman or manager may give them the wrong sense of what Bitcoin is. They already have an idea of bitcoin being an investment, which is true but there is more to Bitcoin than being an asset. We should advocate for self custody, this will help them a lot as they come into the crypto space.",
