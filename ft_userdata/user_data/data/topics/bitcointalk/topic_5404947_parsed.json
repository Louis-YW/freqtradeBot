  "content": "What happened: While I was browsing the \"Trezor's subreddit\" page, I noticed there's a warning from a few days back, and since some of the users might not be frequent visitors of that page, I'm going to extend the warning here [credit goes to @dpeacock93]!Reference Link: - warning scam site- Archived version of trez0r.ioCode:trez0r.ioAdditional Notes: If you hover over some of the texts on the header and footer area, you'll see there's also another phishing website (archived version of trezo≈ó.org)!- Unfortunately, the main one is using NameCheap services, so it'd probably take a while to take it down [please take a minute to report them].Code:trezo≈ó.orgQuote from: https://www.namecheap.com/domains/whois/result?domain=trez0r.ioDomain name: trez0r.ioRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.namecheap.comRegistrar URL: http://www.namecheap.comCreation Date: 2022-06-21T16:14:34.03ZRegistrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse@namecheap.comRegistrar Abuse Contact Phone: +1.9854014545Quote from: https://www.namecheap.com/domains/whois/result?domain=trezo%C5%97.orgDomain name: trezo≈ó.orgRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.reg.comRegistrar URL: https://www.reg.comRegistrar URL: https://www.reg.ruCreation Date: 2022-05-31T08:14:26ZRegistrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse@reg.ruRegistrar Abuse Contact Phone: +7.4955801111",

      "body": "Yes right, the best way to avoid phishing sites is to use Trezor-Suite, the latest version can be downloaded from the official website \"Trezor-Suite-22.6.5-win-x64\" There are different versions for Windows, Mac and Linux users, personally I own a Trezor wallet \"Model T\" And since the Trezor-Suite program was released, enter the wallet through the program only because it is safer and easier to control the wallet. I also recommend adding the official website to the favorites and entering the site from there only because entering from Google makes some people fall into the trap of phishing sites because they use very similar names With the names of the official sites as in this case.",

Too bad Trezor can't get a handle on that. ¬†Unfortunately, you're correct... I don't think I've ever seen Trezor spend a significant amount for something [e.g. a proper ad, unlike Ledger] that could potentially lead to more sales and that makes me believe they'll never buy the remaining domain extensions with their premium price tags [unfortunately].Quote from: DireWolfM14 on July 02, 2022, 05:44:16 PMIf I may make a suggestion; please put the scam sites' link in code brackets, it'll help prevent someone from inadvertently clicking on them.Did as requested, but kept the archived versions [thank you for the suggestion]",
