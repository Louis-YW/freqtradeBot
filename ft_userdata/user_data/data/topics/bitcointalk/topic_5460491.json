      "body": "One thing I have noticed about some hardware wallets is that they start out as very good, trustable, open-source and highly privacy conscious wallets only for them to turn around on their customers later after they have purchased the devices because of greed.I believe you can attest to this after purchasing the Ledger x back in the day vs the situation today. I am personally ashamed of recommending people to use ledger hardware wallets back then.My suggestion is that you get one of your devices with a clean OS that you will never connect to the internet or install in any random app, and then create a wallet in that air-gapped device (electrum, unstoppable wallet, sparrow wallet etc.) and then carefully and securly keep your seeds. This way you avoid this greedy hardware wallet company disappointments.",

They have both, Bitcoin only and multicoin versions of the hardware wallet, the software and firmware is open source and the price is comparable to the Ledger Nano X.

Your assistance will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.As long as there is an industry of crypto currencies, the question \"Which Wallet is the Most Suitable Option When Switching from Ledger any other brand, and What Are the Reasons Behind This Choice?\" will always be relevant, with the only difference being that the brand name in the question will change. Today it is a ledger, and tomorrow it will be some other one. And also, it will change depending on the user who has opted for one or another model of hardware wallet.There are quite a few devices, but in fact, there is nothing to choose from: there are few truly reliable and trusted devices. Almost all models have some flaws, dubious design and technical solutions, troubles with hacked databases, suspicious collaborations, and so on. Devices on which, with a clear conscience, one could store crypto assets - a few and go and figure out which of this list [BIG LIST] Hardware wallets (80+) is included in this number.OP limits his question to 1 device, but what if we expand the number of devices and use multi-signature for storage of crypto? This has been discussed many times on the forum and has its advantages. That is, buy 2-3 devices instead of one and use it with a multi-signature, which will not allow one or another manufacturer to access your wallets. In this case, even the problem with the closed source code of the ledger will be leveled.",

Luckily I don't have to think about altcoins, and what little I have from the past is not worth much, and I guess in the future it will be worth even less. If I were you, I would definitely move BTC (if you own it) to a more secure device, and if you have a significant value in altcoins and feel that Ledger is too much of a risk, choose any open-source HW with a good reputation.",

Than, it is open in both way - hardware and software, the latter is characterized by reproducible builds . Worth to mention also its TRNG fed by Avalanche diode,  BIP85 compliance, user-friendly interface, durability of its build, sharp color display with the build-in controller, the opt to backup  SEED and device settings  in the form of encrypted zip file, removable  Lithium  battery in Nokia BL-5C form factor.",

As long as the mempool condition is the same, any decent wallet should give you the same recommendation fees (not to mention you can change it yourself most of the time). So I don't think a cheaper transaction fee is a key feature to select your HW wallet. Maybe things will change if too many HW releases with exclusive software that doesn't allow you to change fees.
