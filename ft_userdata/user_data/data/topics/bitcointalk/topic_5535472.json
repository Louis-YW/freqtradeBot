  "content": "Question to the Crypto Community:Have we been deceived about the true purpose of the crypto space?For years, many have speculated about the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto—the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. What if this person (or group) was never the benevolent innovator we were led to believe? What if, instead, Bitcoin was designed as a tool for global manipulation—an elaborate scheme to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and ultimately enslave people under a new financial order?In recent years, we’ve witnessed an alarming rise of radical right-wing influence in crypto. Today, the space is overrun with scams—99% of projects are fraudulent, from ICOs and NFTs to meme coins—designed not for decentralization, but as a means to extract more fiat currency. This contradicts the original vision of Bitcoin and raises the question: Was this the plan all along?Governments and powerful institutions have increasingly entered the crypto space, not to empower people, but to guide them toward predatory schemes. Crypto, once seen as a path to financial freedom, is now being weaponized to deepen economic enslavement—driving people into debt and ensuring they remain prisoners of a collapsing system.We've also witnessed global events that suggest an orchestrated effort to dismantle democracy. An empire has recently fallen under the control of a single leader, who is dismantling institutions, plunging citizens into poverty, and pushing nations into unnecessary wars. Meanwhile, my own country is being threatened by foreign intervention—an invasion motivated by the desire to seize resources and impose control, ensuring the rich become richer while the rest suffer.Adding to the suspicion, we now know that governments hold Bitcoin reserves—not as a tool for public benefit, but as a mechanism to hoard wealth for the elite while depriving ordinary citizens of financial power. This aligns with a disturbing trend within the crypto space itself, where major influencers and public figures have been exposed as dishonest operatives with ties to hate groups, oppression movements, and extreme ideologies. Is crypto being used as a weapon to usher in a global system of authoritarianism, racism, fascism, and communism—disguised as financial innovation?Could it be that Bitcoin was never meant to liberate the people, but instead to serve as the ultimate tool for economic enslavement? Was Satoshi Nakamoto not a visionary, but a hidden world leader—one whose influence we now see on a global scale, yet whose identity remains deliberately concealed?Was Bitcoin an elaborate scheme from the very beginning—a calculated ploy to create wealth for the few while robbing the many of their freedom and democracy?What do you think? Have we all been deceived?",

But when developed, the lands are no more cheap but become expensive. Are people that bought land there later when it is expensive are deceived? This is applicable to assets like bitcoin, silver and gold. I am talking about bitcoin and not altcoins that are pump and dump scheme.",

Despite the regulation agenda that could be coming from Trump administration and his strategic reserve propaganda, it is just political because whether exchanges are mandated for KYC, you can still deal without exchange, P2P transaction are still valid with btc and you can hodl btc on your noncustodial wallet.Moreover, it is greed that make people to invest in shit projects. If you want to be guaranteed of your crypto investment then putting your money in btc is the best.",

Bitcoin is that 1% that is not a scam. There is not sector of the economy that you will not see scam. There will always be people who will take advantage of what was intended for good, and use it in a bad way. That few elements are using bitcoin for the wrong purpose, doesn't mean that the entirety of bitcoin and the idea behind it is a scam. Everything that Satoshi Nakamoto intended for bitcoin is still serving it's purposes till date. For the first time people now have full control of their money. They have freedom and not enslaved. Bitcoin is accessable to everyone, so your idea that it was designed to create wealth for the few is false.",

Satoshi never developed ICOs and NFTs to meme coins, he was never involved or related to that. so when people suffer losses when they are involved in those things, then that is their full responsibility, and there is no need to link it to bitcoin because it has nothing to do with it at all.And I think you are reading too much into speculation. no need to be too exaggerated I think. Satoshi only developed bitcoin as an alternative to a decentralized payment system, allowing people to transact without a central authority or central bank. it is not a ploy to create wealth for the few or whatever you say.",

For me, Satoshi Nakamoto is a kind of Prometheus. The Titan Prometheus gave people divine fire, and Satoshi Nakamoto gave digital decentralized money. The problem is not with Satoshi Nakamoto at all, but with people themselves, who show their worst qualities in life (greed, hypocrisy, arrogance, servility). With the help of Bitcoin, people had a chance to radically change the world, but instead they used it for meaningless speculation. As for those in power, in my opinion, they simply missed the creation of Bitcoin. In 2009, they were busy eliminating the consequences of the global financial crisis. When the elites came to their senses, Bitcoin had already spread among people so much that it was too late to ban it.  A decision was made to \"tame\" the first cryptocurrency with the help of derivatives, futures, options, ETF funds, legislative regulation, KYC and AML procedures.",

But the store of value made people to purchase it and hodle it for the future use when the price rise above the capital investment price. And bitcoin has never been a scam but people used it to scam others. And bitcoin is the number one legit crypto in the world as of now. So as for me we have not not been deceived but those who are running from one crypto to another getting into scam. If you are investing in one and not anyone that came your way, you won't be scammed.

Satoshi created Bitcoin and started to gain popularity while other people saw that as a way to make money from creating other projects. So we see from that moment that many projects have been released and say that they will be the best projects.But after some time running, more projects were created by other developers and their teams but Bitcoin still remain at the top of the crypto. While the other project competes with each other, Bitcoin still leads the crypto and difficult to replace its position. We don't know what is the reason behind Bitcoin's creation but Bitcoin gave us the opportunity to have alternative currency and investment. However, Bitcoin is not going to replace all currencies in the world.Choosing Bitcoin is personal decision and there is no forcing to involve in Bitcoin. So we can see many people are not yet involve in Bitcoin because they don't want to be part of Bitcoin itself. If you think Bitcoin deceive you, it is better you leave Bitcoin as it was.",

Yes bitcoin can not be controlled by the government, but remember if they hold majority of the coins they can control it since they literally own them.
