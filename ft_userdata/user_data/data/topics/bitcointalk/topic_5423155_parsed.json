  "content": "Good evening everyone, I want to present you a different defi project and that is ADO.Network, the first with dual liquidity and blockchain affiliate marketing mechanisms. 1. COMPANY PURPOSEOur purpose at Ado.Network is to increase crypto adoption.2. PROBLEMOver 95% of the projects in crypto are focused on technology alone and are built on bad economic models that make them prone to crumbling when there are unfavorable conditions.If people continue to build technology and share the same user base there is a zero-sum game. This discussion is not about who builds a better blockchain, which blockchain is faster, which is more decentralized, or which is more scalable. This discussion is about pushing to build products for the people that are not already here. Only with a big push for adoption, this industry is going to succeed and so far we're only seeing Binance and BNB as the ones pushing for adoption. The rest of the projects are contempt of having a zero-sum game and drawing users from other projects.Ado.Network (ADO) is built as a multi-utility token. We share the same values as Binance (BNB) for transparency and utility. We need to build products that people use. To push for adoption, we need to build products for the general public. A large majority of the population hasn't bought crypto yet.The road for us ahead might be tougher than it is for other projects but our destination has no limits.3. SOLUTIONThe utility is when your holders are not exit liquidity or they are not the product. For us to realize that we need to give people a better alternative than they already have.Keep in mind that we're building technology but we are also building a great economy. We want to give everyone a great reason to hold the token. To provide them ways of passive income by just holding ADO.We view ourselves just as investors/holders, each having his bag of ADO and gaining passive income from it.The important thing to note is that the community/user base is the most important. Everything we build is centered around the Ado.Network ecosystem and a part of the revenue will be shared back within the entire ecosystem. Once the community is large enough, we're going to decentralize the applications and built them on our blockchain.4. TEAMBogdan Paduraru - CEO and Co-founder, majority owner of travel agency and tour operator Travel Meridian Zero with trademarks Flightway and TripionGeorge Enea - CTO and Co-founder, owner B9 mediaWe're also partners with the Euro Games team and benefit their experience in the gambling department. They have 12 live casinos in Romania and they are already advertising Ado.Network in their casinos.5. PRODUCTWe have about 500 holders right now, we're counting only those that invested over 100$. 80% of the holders are through our affiliate commission, no marketing was done so far due to the market conditions.https://www.ado.network/Telegram: https://t.me/ADONetworkEnglishTwitter: https://twitter.com/NetworkAdoFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AdoNetworkDeFi6. BUSINESS MODELTechnology:- first affiliate program made in smart contracts (built already)- custom swap (built already)- creating an affiliate network and providing every token a white-label solution for affiliates, this requires building a large community first, so unless Binance Labs is supporting us, we willreconsider it at a later date- blockchain + dex + block explorer; this is ready for our TestNet V1.0; it requires community and economy to be built first to avoid inflation- if we manage to get Binance Labs as investors, we might build that as a BNB Application Sidechain- NFT Marketplace and NFT collections with real utility (Travel, Sports Betting, Adult entertainment)Economy:1. There is already a utility built through our novel double Liquidity Pool, which means that ADO has protection when there is market pressure (like now) by switching 99% of the money from BNB to BUSD andthus preventing a decrease in value. By switching back to BNB at a lower price, we can even provide an increase in value when BNB is appreciating from the point where we bought it.2. Travel: there are many possibilities for revenue here. - about 50% of the commission for a travel agency/tour operator is spent on marketing; if people come through ado.network, that spending is eliminated, which means there are funds to be shared back with the ecosystem- a large userbase, allows you to negotiate prices further for your travel products, depending on the volume you have for certain destinations or companies- we also want to centralize tour operator offerings in one place, in case we can't negotiate the price, we'll build the offer directly through our tour operator- in travel, it's all about the userbase and community3. Gambling:- Sports Betting and Online Casino4. Investment:- Market-making teams, arbitrage teams, trading bots, crypto trading teams7. MARKET/TAMThere is a large userbase for both Travel and Gambling industries outside of crypto. The investing part is addressed to anyone.8. FINANCIALSWe do have resources for development at this stage. However, considering the market conditions and our strengths, with an investment of 1.000.000$, we could do a lot of marketing for the project.This budget includes hiring a big marketing firm for 3 months and a couple of tier 1-2 CEX listings.Please keep in mind that there are no previous investors, no seed rounds, no private rounds, and no pre-sale. Everything was sustained out of our money.9. COMPETITORSTravala is a competitor in the crypto space. However, they are contempt of selling travel products only to crypto enthusiasts. We're planning to address ourselves to the crypto market only until a market cap of 50M, after that we will start pushing for adoption and addressing our products to the general market.For example, the travel platform alone has already 350.000 hotels in Europe with prices directly negotiated. We're going to expand on this with community growth.I would say that the end purpose is to build competitors for Booking.com, Bet365.com, but decentralized, on our blockchain.",
