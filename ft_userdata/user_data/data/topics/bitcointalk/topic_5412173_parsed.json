  "content": "Start of New Meta: Sleep to EarnYear 2022 will be written in history books as a start of new Meta â€” Sleep to Earn and WeSleep aims to be a pioneer of such approach. In order to achieve our goals we are not only building a Web3 app with inbuilt Game-Fi elements which awards users for their sleep time, instead we are building a worldwide brand by positioning ourselves as an app-assistant for users to look after their sleep quality as well as build a healthier and more active lifestyle.Sweet RewardsAt its core WeSleep app will allow users to monetise their sleep time by rewarding them with $ZZZ tokens. However, in order to be eligible for rewards users will need to hold at least one Sleepie, which has a specific set of attributes such as drowsiness, fatigue, luck or devotion. In addition, WeSleep is aiming to provide a tool for its users which would not only enable them to monetise their sleep time, but at the same time would encourage them to build a healthier, more active lifestyle. In order to achieve such goal, users will be getting Daily Tasks to complete on a daily basis, which would then generate their rewards in Moons.Daily task examples:- Walk at least 3 000 steps;- Run 1 mile;- Go for a 45 minutes walk;- Have a swim;- Have a gym session;- Burn at least 1 200 calories;- Etc.Every time a daily task is completed, a specific amount of Moons are credited to the Profile, which then are to be used to level up the Profile itself.Join us and become part of New Meta:- Twitter: https://twitter.com/WeSleepOfficial- Website: https://wesleep.io/ - Medium: https://medium.com/@WeSleep - Whitepaper: https://motpovilas.gitbook.io/wesleep-whitepaper-v1",

I guess my prediction has really come. Now, I am giving this kind of concept a chance since I am always a big fan of anything for a healthy lifestyle. I am wishing WeSleep a big success though am not anymore an admirer of this type of rewards programs since success here will not really that last.",

Such approach allows to build a self-sustainable business model without fully counting on token success. However, if tokenomics put right, including sinks and balancing, model might be self-sustainable as well.Having said that, e-commerce/partners side of the business together with a well balanced in-app economics will allow WeSleep to support its utility token and keep the value in a long term.",

People are trying to squeeze ideas from daily activities to create money-making projects, this is going nowhere, ends up being just a hype and then disappears nothing more. I like the idea of move to earn, it's really helpful in our life, we can both improve our health and earn money. That's the crazy thing in the crypto market that no traditional company has done yet but look, it can't exist either because its ultimate nature is profit and not a health project. Sleep to earn, I think lazy people who don't like to work will love this idea.",

Sleep to earn, I think lazy people who don't like to work will love this idea.If you actually read the OP post, the requirements is not only sleep. The participant should also perform a significant amount of activity. Also, maybe you are not familiar but outside of the blockchain industry, there are actually some people that are being paid to sleep after doing certain activity. Similar to this project, those people paid to sleep and then their physical data is collected to conduct some research.

The only bad thing about this model is the lack of earnings, which is exactly half of the model. The problem with these tokens is that they are almost nowhere represented and have very little trading liquidity. So it is possible to earn tokens, but selling them and converting them into a valuable currency is still a big problem.",

They're all for the hype and start but when they become crowded, they don't know what to do or if they do know. It's only about them, the devs and how they can muster that capitalized moment of them. That's why many of these projects do get the attention at the beginning but fails to maintain as what they've promised to their investors.",
