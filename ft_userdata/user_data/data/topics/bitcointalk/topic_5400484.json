Though rules can be changed every time and every day as they want since they're reserve the right to modify or change it, but change a rules without giving a notifications, any gamblers wouldn't know there's a change since TOS is really long and we can't wasting our time to read it every day. I think Betfury should look into this matter if they want to continue their journey in this forum.",

It would have been more better to have these terms cleared out before working a partnership.",

The wagering metric is too unstable, first because lifetimes of players are rather short and second, the calculation might be wager with an additional factor of GGR, the only ones who profit from high wager values are the casinos, keep in mind this advise is coming from a casino.Just stick to rev share deals based on GGR, under no circumstances rev share based on wager.

Can I ask for your contacts to clarify the circumstances and resolve this issue? Thank you Yours sincerely, BetFury Hi,now that`s a surprise and I am not sure if you are serious about it, willing to really find a \"solution\"... We tried to find a solution multiple times. In September 2022, some employee of yours reached out via email, we responded like this:\"Hi X,thank you for your message.This is what happened:https://medium.com/@BTCGOSU/btcgosu-ends-partnership-with-betfury-with-immediate-effect-e33df658c713https://medium.com/@BTCGOSU/betfury-cheats-players-in-terms-of-cashback-btcgosu-1441ca1b4eac\"Your response was this:\"Thank you. Considering all our reputational damage after these articles were published, we could not let this happen again. Best regards,X.\"Then, a month later, you came up with the below:Quote from: BetFury.io on October 25, 2022, 12:14:10 PMQuote from: efialtis on October 25, 2022, 11:55:57 AMI have never blackmailed anyone, including Betfury. The act of retroactively changing an affiliate deal is unethical unless there is a mutual agreement on how this is going to be handled, ie paying out a lump sum and letting it go, full stop. And that is when I shared this in public (Medium). So is not following up on cashback promises and selectively making up some terms that do not exist, not to this very day. That is when I shared this 2nd story in public (Medium).For what it is worth, I am long over this story and I could not care less about it nowadays. Nb. It is hilarious that you seem to be playing the victim card now when it is YOU literally taking massive advantage of the big traffic we have sent you --> not honoring the negotiated dealNb 2. I am removing the negative tag here on the forum anyway, not because it did not happen but simply because there are way more brands that have acted similarly shady and whom I never tagged Nb 3. Any discussion on the subject on a professional base shall happen via email (you know our official email address) in case you ever want to solve this. We have tried more than once, with no success.Thanks, we're not interested in talking about it anymore. Just like you, we are not interested in discussing this case. Users ask - we/you answer. I hope we will continue to discuss the platform and token here. Wish you all the best 🤗So yeah, if you really want to discuss a solution, please hit us up via email using the contact form on our website (or by checking previous email conversation) - let`s just not waste each other`s time. Generally, as you know, I have always been keen to resolve this, that`s how I operate.",
