Why don't you try to teach traders how to do it instead you want to start sending signals for money but I think people here won't really give it too much of a thought to pay for signals.I saw his last thread and I now understand why he created the current one. OP seems very sure that he understands the market so much that he can send signals that can assist members to make a profit from trading. But we need proof to certain the authenticity of his claims and he is yet to produce one. Currently, people are looking for ways to meet their basic needs and less attention is given to trading. Basically trading would not be a bad idea as an alternative source of income. But the truth is that I have never come across any trader that can comfortable or boldly claim that he understands trading to the extent of not incurring losses. I think it would be better for me to learn how to trade by myself so that I would take full responsibility for my actions if I incur any loss.",

So what do you think will be a more important and more attractive long run in a crisis situation?  I pay for GAs and electricity i dont know about \" how long last without \" Im not in some forest Im in city so i dont Even Care i pay and i get my gas and electricity.USD and stablecoins liquity are very important becouse most of the binance futures are paired USDT But Also all the capital inflow are important in crypto.Dont worry If retail got no money that's why we have BIG instutions in crypto to supply the funds we need in order to keep futures and spot trading system alive.The instutions will take care of us  about this that we gona have nice liquity.Things are good in the markets Even the Joe Biden administratsion connection with FTX it shows that big guys want to keep it crypto markets very alive. Btw... fed still giving out huge loans to instutions and daily margins are even bigger then it was covid 19 stimulus times off course we dont see that much of market pump now but it means FED money not going in spot and long but in to bears and shorts wich is now been about 2.2 in covid time was 1.5- 1.7 They can announce on the news that rate hikes and mortgage rates going higher but inside the markets and derivates still funding going on and ammounts are getting Even bigger then before only thing is that in bear market those funds goes for the bears and shorts mostly.I dont provide you just the trading signals i do have insights and full knowledge about how the markets work.Its a long experince on this field and that's why our team is confident about everthing we say.",

Trading is not possible if you mean business, if you mean trading for your basic needs that's makes sense than.If you have anything left after daily expenses it's preferable to save your income for future and emergency uses. Investments and business are all extremely risky nowadays.In general it will be difficult for sure to save when in inflationary conditions and the overall economic condition is in crisis,they do not have time to think about it and prefer how to make ends meet,as much as possible from now on to reduce expenses",

You would really definitely still need to work hard and be wise on making up decisions towards trading.Recession and inflation is a problem that cant really be resolved out which it would really be just common sense that you would really be saving up and find another source of incomewhich would really make you able to survive whatever financial problems that you might faced on and since you d o have the money or funds then you wont really be making yourself get easily stressed with these type of conditions.",

Would it be better if you can provide a capital too because people will prioritize food and other basic necessities in life in tough times like this. With that said, how can you say that exchanges will be full of money? There's no way people will store their funds inside the exchange if they won't use it because that's risky but they will just pull it out.Another reason on why they will pull it out is because they also need it. They will use it for a while because trading is also tough to do now, now that cryptos are going down and sometimes stable.
