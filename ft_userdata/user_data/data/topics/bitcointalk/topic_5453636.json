      "body": "Some hurdles I believe that most new Bitcoin users would face:Security: Most standard internet users still use Windows, which include large vulnerabilities especially for those who are not well-versed in keeping their PC safe. Using online wallets, or storing Bitcoin in insecure systems are common precursors to problems for newbies who are using Bitcoin.Network fees & spend-ability: A common new user probably just obliges with the stated/recommended fee and hits send. Learning about how to customize the fee and taking advantage of low network-activity periods to send transactions with minimal fees is a technique that new users probably do not learn prior to using Bitcoin.Privacy: Providing personal information is not required to use Bitcoin, however many users will probably submit their identification documents to exchanges because they think that this is the only way. Maintaining privacy is probably a challenge that a newbie would face, if they have in mind that they would like to retain it.Exchanging: Linking with the above point, exchanging can be done in two ways. Non-privately and for convenience, meaning you submit your info and sacrifice your privacy to use mainstream exchanges, or, privately by using kyc-free exchanges and p2p marketplaces. The latter is usually only learned after digging a little deeper than \"Where to buy bitcoin\" and \"how to store Bitcoin\". Security, network fees and spend-ability are the top challenges that might deter a person from using Bitcoin after their first experiences. Privacy and exchanging would be next learning curves after these mentioned challenges. If you agree with my Security, Privacy and Exchanging points, I've suggested to introduce a Cybersecurity & Privacy board, which would include knowledge to help Bitcoin users resolve these learning curves faster than if they were to try and learn/explore solutions on their own (if they make it this far to begin with).",

      "body": "Some common challenges as a beginner in Bitcoin are the technological knowledge on how the wallet can be securely operated or used.  To address the issue, a user must take time in learning the ropes of securely installing the wallet.  It won't be a problem for people who have the initial technical knowledge but for those who are not tech-savvy will find it difficult.  So it is suggested to do thorough research and give time to study how it can be done.  Resources or information about Bitcoin wallet security isn't hard to find since it is everywhere in the internet.Another common challenge is network congestion and transaction fee.  For a beginner, it will be troublesome if we sent our transaction and it does not confirm after many hours.  Again for non-tech-savvy users will find this situation difficult but there are instructions on the internet that can give a solution to the problem.Quote from: Dunamisx on May 22, 2023, 09:56:05 AMQuote from: Bruce4 on May 22, 2023, 08:18:19 AMHi mates,what are some common challenges most of you have faced in bitcoin and how they can be addressed...Why not make it more clear and straight forward in your request, are you referring to learning  about bitcoin or handling the bitcoin you have invested, or is it on security to bitcoin or where bitcoin is more applicable for use, because your question is a broad topic and to begin to give you reply is not an easy task because you're not being specific in your question, you can read more about bitcoin threads on this link to beginners and help encyclopedia Beginners and Help Encyclopedia https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5364418.0#post_point118@OP is asking us about the difficulties we encounter, the question is subjective so each one may have different challenges.  Probably @OP wanted to know our experiences and how we dealt with it.  I think it is a better way of asking for information since he can get varieties of challenging situation and how each one of us dealt it and came for a solution.",

There's no solution for those that have been in remote areas and they're not versed with using the technology. At least, this is the very one thing that Bitcoin can be said of challenging. There's solution about satellite connectivity but devices and even the connection itself won't cost just a penny but it's more than that. And one other challenge about still, the most common about many people that are still not yet educated about Bitcoin. The resolution on this one is to keep them informed about Bitcoin but then there goes the other challenge that will made from there, and that's when you're educating the wrong people that are not eager on learning on it as it seems you're wasting your vocals, time and efforts on them.",

      "body": "A common challenge that most of us face in Bitcoin is when we decide to buy Bitcoin because if I observe the conversations in my groups, they often ask this. Even though they know that when the price hits the big red candle, they can buy it immediately if their goal is a long-term investment.But they didn't buy it and instead asked other friends when they could. And unfortunately, if they get any advice on when to buy it, they will immediately buy all-in, which is highly discouraged.Other friends have suggested that you buy in stages so you can get a low price on many occasions but they have not followed suit. We can't do anything about it because it will be their responsibility. To overcome this, we must be able to analyze ourselves so we don't use their advice and can find the right time to buy Bitcoin.",

If you are using a trust wallet the link below would guide you through with some explanatory.Although it was explained in Nigeria local language but I would still explain it here for youhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452546.msg62257960#msg62257960I believe you have a trust wallet as it is the most commonly used wallet for holding funds and assets.If you have already put your  amount of BTC you want to withdraw the you click on continue, it would take you to the next page which is where you would see the settings at the upper right corner facing you. To set the fee, you will have to click it and reduce or adjust the fee yourself as it suits you for your transaction.I hope this little explanations would guide you through if you see your transaction fee way too high and you want to reduce or adjust it.",

So Bitcoin is definitely behind the processing of transaction and that is the reason why we are facing high fee for a transaction to proceed so if the earlier gets a solution then there won't be a clog in the network and also high fee.Volatility is also big challenge because we always wanted a monetary system to have stable value so we may not worry about the inflation, etc while this is actually benefiting the users now by gaining more value when they hold but from the perspective of money it is a red mark that needs to be resolved.",

Since Bitcoin and it's technology is just a new invention, people are having a hard time understanding it even only just the basics of it. The solution? Constant learning.It being used for scams - People around the world have been using Bitcoin to scam newbie investors, and as a result, investors especially those new ones are having a hard time to decide whether they will invest into it or not. Solution? Proper teaching.Storing - Nowadays, there are lots of hacks happening around the crypto space, and because of that, investors are having a hard time picking which wallet they will put their holdings on that is also less prone to hacks. Solution? The internet.High Transaction fee - Just a few weeks ago, we've seen Bitcoin's transaction fee went to as high as 20$, and because of that, there are many who prefer to just hold their Bitcoins instead of selling it. The good thing though is that, the fees are already at it's normal (below 1$). The solution? I guess wait for the fees to go down then transfer your Bitcoins.I guess it's good for the OP to ask so many questions here with regards to Bitcoin, and the basics of it. I mean you're also the one who posted that \"Convincing\" thing where you want to gave us one reason to convince you to buy Bitcoin. All of the challenges that I shared have one common solution, and that is learning. Learning even only the basics will help you a lot already.",

      "body": "To me the biggest challenge in Bitcoin is that its value can't be objectively estimated, so there's no guarantee that it will not lose 99% of its value. With other assets like real estate or stocks you can look at the demand, look at the factor that will influence it, look at supply, etc. With Bitcoin supply is fixed and demand in completely unknown. We can see the daily number of transactions on blockchain, but we have no idea how many of those transactions are payments for goods and services, and how many is just arbitrage trading or some other activity that is useless to society and thus isn't creating Bitcoin's value.If a lot of bitcoin hodlers only wait to dump the coins in the future, that could create a scenario where Bitcoin market is just a big long tulip mania.",
