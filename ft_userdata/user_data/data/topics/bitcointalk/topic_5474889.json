  "content": "Hi everyone,I've added a few new algorithms to Patrick Marie's genesis block generator, written in Go.  My fork is here: https://github.com/catcoin-project/generate-genesis.If you download and install go from https://go.dev, you can clone the repo, then run Code:go mod tidy, then Code:go build.  You will end up with a .exe file you can run.  Run it without any arguments to see the original demo, or with -h to see a print out of the program options.If you get any problems open an issue on github.  I might have left a few edits uncommitted somewhere... in particular builds can be different between Windows and Linux systems because of assumptions about integers which may be unsigned long int on some systems and unsigned long long int on others.  I will try and fix any issues like that as I come across them.",
