Twitter had a policy and every user must abide by it and violation of these rules attracts deserved sanctions.Elon Musk is a businessman that is driven by profit and power. These top class CEOs cannot be trusted because they can be influenced by government. There is no guarantee that Twitter under Musk would promote freedom of speech and expression. There is no prove that the current leadership of Twitter would not silence opposition and promote inequality among users. Lets seat back and watch what would happen in the nearest future. I am sure that in few years a certain group would claim that Twitter is silencing them",

I am sure that in few years a certain group would claim that Twitter is silencing them  Well, of course there isn't any guarantee that twitter will always be this way or that. But for the moment, twitter is opening up to freedom.Could say it simple like this. Before Musk twitter was turning into Democrats/socialism/Communism/anti-American/anti-freedom. After Musk twitter has become Republican/American-freedom/the-American-dream.In the future, there absolutely will be silencing of the opposition, and inequity among users. But it will be done from the outside... vast numbers of average freedom-loving people out-talking the slave makers... rather than the slave-makers censoring freedom-loving people, as it was before Musk.",

Clear double standard in enforcing Twitter rules which invalidate some number of suspensions. Though, Elon said he wouldn't bring Alex Jones back. I find Alex Jones distasteful, but he never broke any laws.",

Basically 20% of the Republican Party are robbing the other 80%. That 80% getting robbed would be what Hillary calls deplorable. Donald Trump called some of them (dead veterans) suckers and losers.Unfortunate that Trump is correct as I could bet the universe that people will disagree and argue with this post. Note I am not pro Hillary or pro Biden or Pro or anti Trump. I just call this the way I see it. Lets see how many go thumbs down and prove my point.\"",

But the focus isn't only Trump. The focus is the blocking of all kinds of things that were different than their political and propaganda opinion. And there would be nothing wrong with this, if they had not become world-renowned first.Musk has taken twitter out of the form of the propaganda machine that it was. He has opened it up to free speech, at least a whole lot more. That's the American way in the media.",
