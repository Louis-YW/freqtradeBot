To be exact, is there any reason for such restrictions?",

Or still people feel maintaining the recovery seeds is overwhelming as these platforms claim?",

They have a messy user experience, and users are responsible for managing their own setup, security, and backup keys.Managing your security, keys, seed phrase, etc should not be a problem and looking for a solution to that is creating problems and ways for people to lose their money, just as ledger came up with their recover service, Theya's solution to all this by the way is:QuoteTheya is simplifying the self-custody experience through a mobile-first multisig wallet that families can set up using iPhones and Apple Watches.",
