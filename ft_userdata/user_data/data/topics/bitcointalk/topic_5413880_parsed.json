You can check all the address balance included in your seed phrase under the list of address in your electrum wallet. Thereâ€™s might be a chance that you use different address to receive Bitcoin before you use your current wallet address to received the current balance.",

It is also possible that the problem is because of the difference in underlying code in different languages (the code doesn't exist in English view but is in Russian):https://github.com/blockchain/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend/blob/0b94eb98568ef08e012f32a0bf6dc8e83c5bd5c9/packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend/src/assets/locales/ru.json#L2603",

Blockchain.com does allow using both legacy and segwit at once though, which obviously Electrum does not, so it could be this issue as nc50lc has pointed out above.",
