  "content": "While we've seen other models more or less break, or become irrelevant, such as Stock to Flow and Logarithmic Growth Curve, but do you think the Bitcoin Rainbow chart is still accurate?Although based on a logarithmic growth curve, it does appear to be more accurate than the alternative log growth that effectively became invalidated in March 2020 (despite price recovering afterwards). Currently the model suggests that price is \"basically a fire sale\" around $20K, with current bubble territory @ $240K and a maximum low of $41K by the next halving in 2024. It otherwise consider <$37K as accumulation territory and $50K as still cheap, which feels a bit ironic at current prices. What are your thoughts?",

Even out that particular point you mentioned I don't think that bitcoin can resurrect from that time. If bitcoin are to be corrected in the market our expectation should be waiting until the end of the year because the bottom or Bitcoin is not something that we can conclude this time for bottom value because it seems that bitcoin will fall again to 12k before it will conclude falling",

I can see how a more regressive upper band could easily connect the three peaks, which would factor in reduced volatility as well. Even with two peaks that most recent peak could have been much better anticipated. Given that was created in late 2014 though, and price exceeded the upper band in late 2013, it didn't fail anyone...But this isn't relevant to the lower band that's still in tact (and what I'm referring to).

If your mechanic says your bike will blow @ X, what they really mean is it can blow @ X, as it's unlikely they definitively know what would happen. They probably have a duty to warn you about the potential risk of doing so as well, as could be very dangerous to push a bike beyond it's limits. Imagine if they didn't warn you? How would they feel if you ended up in hospital over it? Maybe they just want to sell you a more expensive bike. But really, the mechanic oversimplified the situation. Did he say it will blow immediately? Of course not. Would you be damaging your bike if it's only guaranteeing 10k RPM? It's possible.Should you take this one mechanics opinion as truth? Of course not. You could take a second opinion, someone else with more experience might tell you it'll be fine, but would wear your bike out sooner. Then you can make a better informed decision on whether you want to take the risk of wearing out your bike much quicker (if that is indeed the case), or get a bike that can guarantee 14k RPM.I have no idea what this has to do with Bitcoin's rainbow chart though  Quote from: stompix on July 01, 2022, 04:10:12 AMQuote from: dragonvslinux on June 30, 2022, 04:13:34 PMQuote from: stompix on June 30, 2022, 04:08:00 AMit's just a drawing, if everything in the world could be predicted as such we wouldn't have \"speculation\".I think you'll find your first line invalidates your second.

Any model, despite how accurate it's been over the years or decades, can always fail at any time. Predictions, by definition, are never guarantees, so it'd still be speculation despite it's accuracy. In summary, the contradiction comes from fundamentally not recognising that correct predictions are still based on speculation.",

It couldn't have failed as it never existed back then  It was created with this inaccuracy, while the lower bands have remained accurate since then and until now at least. Even the upper bands weren't wrong in 2021, it merely suggested that price wasn't in maximum bubble territory, only reaching a FOMO stage, which many people agree with ironically.

Have replaced my quote back in it for you to read properly. I clearly said what they mean, not what they said, which are two completely different concepts.

So if your mechanic knew better, he should have said your bike would properly blow, because the probability based on statistical data means that should probably happen. Does it mean it would happen? Of course not. Even with a 99% chance it obviously doesn't mean it would happen...Maybe a better understanding of what statistical projections implies would be better, for yourself as well as the mechanic, so as to avoid confusion ? Ultimately, if he was referencing charts to argue his point, it should have been obvious (to both you and the mechanic) that there was an element of probability involved, even if there had been rigorous testing etc. You can never take statistical projections as facts, obviously.Something can be right 100 times, even a billion times, and can still be wrong eventually. It simply comes down to the probability of it becoming wrong, whether that be 1% or 0.000001% chance.",
