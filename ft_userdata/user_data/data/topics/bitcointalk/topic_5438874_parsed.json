I returned to the board no less than 30 minutes after the post to view user replies, but my post was nowhere to be found. It just vanished off the board totally. It was not stated whether it was moved to the Off-Topic or Archival boards. In addition, I received no email notification of the deletion. This doesn't seem right at all. So, I'm wondering are there bots on the forum that are designed to delete topics based on certain keywords?",

It was not stated whether it was moved to the Off-Topic or Archival boards. As others have said, your post has been trashed by the moderators. This forum isn't a place to promote your links for free or use as your personal playground. Keep that in mind.Quote from: alastantiger on February 08, 2023, 07:24:13 PMIn addition, I received no email notification of the deletion. This doesn't seem right at all. The fact that you were not notified does not make the decision to remove your post any less valid. The moderators have the right to remove any content that violates the rules of the forum, and it's up to you to familiarize yourself with those rules.Quote from: alastantiger on February 08, 2023, 07:24:13 PMSo, I'm wondering are there bots on the forum that are designed to delete topics based on certain keywords?

It was just an innocent mistake. The points have been noted and the thread will be locked now. Thank you all.",
