  "content": "So this was a little thought that has been going through my mind today and figured it appropriate to give it it's own thread...I understand there is a lot of different ways to interpret the question, but when I think about it, it sort of boils down to three main categories: 1) Which creator has 'locked up'/secured the most Bitcoin on physical collectibles?2) Which creator has 'locked up'/secured the most crypto on physical collectibles?  Meaning 1 unit of crypto = any other unit of crypto.  1 Bitcoin = 1 Dogecoin, etc.3) Which creator has 'locked up'/secure the most wealth on physical collectibles?  Meaning the total fiat value of collectibles across the board....I would imagine Mike has 1 & 3 in the bag, but when thinking about just how many other creators continued making coins past 2013, I figured someone like smoothie might be in the running for those.And in regards to 2, well that's the main part I'm really interested in when you consider someone like CryptoImperator who made the 1 million dogecoin coins.Thoughts?",
