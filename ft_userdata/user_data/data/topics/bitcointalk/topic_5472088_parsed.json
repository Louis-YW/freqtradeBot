  "content": "I did start a simulation at Pragmatic Play website and played long hours,changing every hour (meaning starting again),the bet was always the same IDR 1000 and it kept giving me the bonus in no more than 300 spins usually from 220-275 I used to get the bonus,this was done a really long time and the average was this.Happy to know about this I got to at some major casinos and started playing with this bet there also,boom not even the slightest appearance of the bonus round in over 500 spins in both these casinos which happen to be reputable and trusted by the way.Who is to blame the casino operator or Pragmatic as one of them clearly is \"cheating\" in their own way?",

I'm not sure how Pragmatic Play does their deals with the casinos but it certainly has something to do with it I think.",

I'm not sure how Pragmatic Play does their deals with the casinos but it certainly has something to do with it I think.That is what I think the more to be at fault here is Pragmatic Play as they say they cannot change the RTP of that specific game I am talking about which I did the simulation but in reality must me much different,how come I am surprised the same situation happened in major well reputable casinos playing this game of theirs.The bad thing is that they don't let you contact them unless you are a company that want to implement their solutions in the casino you operate.I am sure not many people have time,a lot of time to conduct so long hours simulations but if many of us do the slot providers will be exposed I am sure to their \"secrets\" that they use.It is not a case of luck when you hit well over 500 spins and you don't get the bonus,may be they have programmed it wrong,they also some not rare times when you buy the bonus you get 0 money,so I mean I have lots of questions of the slot provider operations.",

      "body": "I always think that whenever there's no money involved slot providers will give you the best show. I mean winning the bonuses more often than it is when you put money in it. I tried playing Fun Play before and it was the reason why I got interested in playing slots. I think they made it that way for the game to be attractive to gamblers but the truth will remain when you make a bet on it, they will never just give away all those big prizes in the short run unless we are really lucky. Regarding who is to blame for this, that will be hard to answer, both casino and slot providers may have a contract about how the RTP will work and I doubt that will be leaked out. I won't get stressed about this because that's how gambling games should work, it's always rigged because this is a business, not a charity and gamblers will keep on playing even with those facts in front of them.",

      "body": "Nobody likes and nobody wants to lose in gambling, whether in slot gambling or other types of gambling. However, bookies certainly don't want to lose. What is called a slot is a type of gambling that uses a machine and the machine can be adjusted or controlled in such a way that the slot machine can provide benefits for the owner. and I am sure that those who join and play in this type of gambling know this, but even so, this does not make them stop or switch to other types of gambling that can at least enable them to increase their chances of winning, such as sports betting or gambling. card.So in my opinion, casino operators or Pragmatists do not cheat gamblers because the rules of the game and the game system are clear. What is clear is that we are too stupid because we already know that slot gambling is detrimental but we still play it.",

      "body": "I know my chances but they cannot behave differently and in fact I tried one simple more game for fun now at Pragmatic Play website and it took exactly 785 spins to give me the bonus game.I guess it was me who made the error to get early to the conclusion that since it happened many hours in a row to give the bonus no more than 300 spins it should do so always,I forgot to put the randomness factor to it,while in general the longer we play the better the average of the bonus spins will be when we start our session it can be totally random the bonus round,it can fall on the reels early or much later,what the conclusion should be from this thread is that if we want to stand a chance to win we should have a hefty bankroll to start with.",
