  "content": "Whats UTXO and why should I care?.40,000 Sats = $10.63 UTXOs is very common and some of you don't know why you're always paying high fees anytime you send out bitcoin from your wallet, I will explain. Assume you're going to buy Bitcoin on an exchange. Assume you buy 40.000 Sats per day, therefore you purchased 40,000 Sats. The next day, you buy another 40,000 Sats at the exchange and transfer it to your hardware wallet. The next day, you buy another 40,000 sats at the exchange and transfer them to your hardware wallet, giving you 120,000 sats of Bitcoin in your hardware wallet that is safe and secure. That's fantastic. But there's a small problem here. So, every time you sent Bitcoin from the exchange to your hardware wallet, you generated a UTXO (unspent transaction output).Consider this to be a tiny fraction of Bitcoin; in essence, you have three pieces of Bitcoin here. The trouble is, if you want to send out these three chunks of Bitcoin, you'll have to pay a reasonable amount in fees because each chunk of Bitcoin takes up space in a block on the blockchain, and you have to pay money for the space you're taking up in those blocks. So if you have a lot of UTXOs, you'll take up a lot more space in the block and you'll have to charge for each of these UTXOs in order to send your Bitcoin out.Bitcoin doesn't care how much Bitcoin you transferred; you can send a million Bitcoin, but if it's all within one UTXO, you'll just be charged a little fee.Practical.1. I transferred 3 chunks of Bitcoin; 40,000. 40,000, 40,000 sats (120,000 sats total) from my first sparrow wallet to my second sparrow wallet and in the process i created 3 UTXOs in my wallet, I took three block space on the blockchain in the process. 1a. Then I transferred another 120,000 sats in a single transaction to my second wallet thus creating only 1 UTXOSending the Bitcoin.2. I started with the first transaction, I marked the 3 chunks of bitcoin input of 40,000, 40,000, 40,000 sats a total of 120,000 sats and send at the current network fee of 14.14sats/Vb (as of when I tried it) and the total fees to send out this 120,000 sats was $0.91 beacuse I was charged for the 3 UTXOs I created, now lets compared this fee to that of the single transaction of 120,000 sats (1 UTXO)2a. I transfer the second transaction of 120,000 sats at the same network fees of 14.14 Sats/Vb and the total fees to send out this bitcoin was $0.41 I saved $0.5 on fee for the same amount of Bitcoin.Conclusion.For every bitcoin you send to your wallet you are renting a space in the block if you're sending maybe $100 worth of bitcoin, and you have it spread across 6 UTXOs, thats $10, $10, $10, $10, $10, $50 well, you're going to be eaten alive by fees cause you're going to be paying for each of the block space you rented. So instead of spreading across 6 UTXOs you should wait till you accumulate your $100 Bitcoin and send it to your wallet in a single transaction.  For those of you saving your signature payment, you will receive 1 UTXO every week and as network fees rise, you will have to pay high fees to get those out. If the network becomes congested again, you may not have enough to cover the amount of UTXOs in your wallet, preventing you from withdrawing your coins.UTXO Consolidation.Okay, I've already created a bunch of UTXOs from my signature earnings and daily bitcoin transfers from CEX to my wallet. What do I need to do to get rid of these UTXOs and consolidate my UTXOs into one?1. Copy your receiver address from the same wallet ( where you sent your coins) and 2. Click UTXO on your sparrow wallet and press Command on your Keyboard and select all the UTXOs and click send 3. Paste the receiver address you copied as the recipient, set your fees and click send and broadcast the transaction and as you can see on the screenshot I've already consolidated 5 UTXOs in my wallet into 1 UTXO.Dowload verified Sparrow wallet here https://sparrowwallet.com/download/You are welcome.",

Although if comparing the same input and output between segwit version 0 and pay-to-taproot, segwit version 0 has slightly low fee.

Although the fees are low, you will still be charged for the UTXOs generated regardless of the type of address used. It's important to understand that generating more UTXOs is harmful to your wallet and assets over time. A few months ago, network fees surged to 30,000 sats/vbs and higher, and this could happen again. I had about $30 in my Trustwallet and could not withdraw due to the level of UTXOs in my wallet and the fee rate as of then.

      "body": "Great thread, more of these threads on the local board to help educate us about the bitcoin technical knowledge. To clarify the whole explanation by Charles-Tim in simple term you can save more fees by using taproot address when the number of inputs (sending addresses) are greater than the number of outputs (receiving addresse(s)), other than that the best address to use is the native segwit address.

And, while it is not recommended to use low fees while consolidating, it will do a lot more good than leaving those UTXOs in your wallet. Use the standard charge rate and get into the next block as soon as possible. The major reason for consolidating UTXOs is to generally save future transaction fees so it would not be proper to pay higher fees when consolidating the UTXOs. So the best time to actually consolidate is when the mempool is less congested probably with fees less than 5sats/vbyte. If the number of UTXOs are much and maybe the wallet keeps selecting just too many for every transaction before you consolidate then you can use the coin control feature to lock some certain address from spending and probably use only two addresses to be spending from before consolidation",

You can freeze just any UTXOs from been spent. The main point of coin control on this topic is when you have multiple chunks of  little Sats and with the mempool congested resulting into high transaction fees where you don’t feel it is necessary to consolidate your UTXOs at tht time you can freeze some of the this little sats (most of which are change addresses). But with your case of having same number of sats and also having to spend almost all the UTXOs in one transaction then you don’t have any choice but to either consolidate or spend the UTXOs on that transactions (both of which in this case are almost similar in terms of fees to be paid) even if the the transaction fee is high. Also I don’t see it logical to have left those chunks there with equal sats without consolidating them until when the pool get congested or when you need to use almost all of it, probably because of DCAing?",

However,  the words SATS - I guess it's satoshi and if its not you can correct me but you should have keys to define your short acronyms because of we beginners as we might find it hard to comprehend with all the acronym .You're right, Sats stands for Satoshi and Sats is the smallest meansure of Bitcoin;1Sat = 0.00000001 BTC1Million Sats = 1BTCI'm not sure any of us has up to 1BTC yet, what we have in our wallets are fraction of Bitcoin (Sats). The 40,000 Sats in my Op is equal to $10.68 worth of BTC. I didn't want to use the dollar sign as a Bitcoiner.",

If you want to spend UXTO 1, 2 and 3 on wallet 1, highest fee will be required. The more the UTXO counts required in a transaction, the higher the fee. Much more clearer now, so can we transfer the Sats along with a utxo at a time or only UTXO can be transact at a session.Quote from: Igebotz on September 19, 2023, 08:35:04 AMThe 40,000 Sats in my Op is equal to $10.68 worth of BTC. I didn't want to use the dollar sign as a Bitcoiner. I understand I just want others who don't know the short term to know it too and to be sure of myself too,besides i've never tried sparrow wallet. I believe also that sparrow  wallet support  only btc since it's in smaller units (sats) .",

On mobile, you can make use of Bluewallet, but it does not have testnet. Send bitcoin to the same address two times and send bitcoin to another address on the same wallet one time. After doing that:If you use Sparrow, click on UTXO on Sparrow wallet and you will see what is regarded as UTXO.If it is Electrum, click on view -> coins, and coin tab will appear which you can click on to show the UTXOsIf you use Bluewallet, click on your wallet in blue -> send -> the three dots menu -> coin control.

You can change the unit from sat to BTC if you want. To do that, click on view -> bitcoin unit -> BTC to change it to BTC.",

      "body": "Quote from: Igebotz on September 17, 2023, 01:12:21 AMSo, every time you sent Bitcoin from the exchange to your hardware wallet, you generated a UTXO (unspent transaction output).This thread made me to read materials and I thank Charles-Tim for the material he sent to me for a long time again, I made a review on them and I saw everything in UTXO and from the above quoted statement is the meaning of UTXO. But let meak it clear for those who are still confusing. The bitcoin that was send to you which you have not spent is the UTXO output because it was send to you from another user which is the STXO. The user that spend (Sender) the bitcoin is called Spend Transaction Output. When bitcoin is send, the chunks will detect the blockchain. In the computing system there are always two concepts to know. Input and output. The input is the bitcoin you have and once you see them on your screen it becomes output. And from my first comment, I made mentioned of \"change\". Now when you are send out bitcoin, you send out to two addresses, one to the recipient address and one to yourself and the one to yourself is called the \"change\" which leftover for you or the remaining balance which is also known as UTXO. Example, if I am sending 0.004 bitcoin to Charles-Tim out of 0.098 bitcoin the leftover is the change for me which is also unspend Transaction Output (UTXO) and also Charles-Tim too.",
