  "content": "Hello all,Is there a way to dynamically tell Antminer s9 to change power consumption (clock rate, hash rate) for example every 30min or an hour so no reboots, just some command to the API, and boom power goes from 1200w down to 400w with hopefully somewhat linear change in hash rate (in this eg. from 12 to 4TH)?I hope you get the Idea it does not to be perfect obviously there is some power consumption for the control board and efficiency is changing when hash rate and temperatures change etc...Everything is on the table. Custom binaries, patching firmware, or custom firmware like Braiins os but it would be nice to be FOSS...Hardware modifications are also possible for me. I was thinking to make some relay/MOSFETs circuits to disconnect hashing board control wires or if needed even power wires.But I don't know how would Antminer react to that? So in that way I get full power, 2/3 and 1/3 power which is good but even better would be to control it with software so I can have more discrete power steps for eg. 100w steps with let's say min of 300w in steps by 100w up to max.Thank you so so much to anyone with experience who wants to share some information with me.Cheers!P.S. Yes this has to do with changing power produced by solar energy, and trying to get input power from the sun == power used by the miners...",

      "body": "Everything you mentioned can be done using AwesomeMiner, it's the best tool for this job, hands down.You will, of course, have to use Vnish firmware to use most of the functions, AwesomeMiner has its own distribution of Vnish and you don't have to buy AwesomeMiner license if you use it which is a plus.With AM you can set your target profile hashrate which gets activated based on many factors, like time of the day, temps of the miner, number of shares found, profitability, and a lot more, if you don't want to use the already configured profiles you can just change the frequency and/or voltage.The way it works is like this, you have what's called triggers and actions, the former watches for something to happen in order to activate the latter, there are many ready-to-use triggers but you can even write your own c# script to get inputs from your solar inverter and adjust the hashrate accordingly.",
