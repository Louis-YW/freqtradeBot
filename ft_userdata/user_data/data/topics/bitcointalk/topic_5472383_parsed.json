  "content": "Dear valued members,I wanted to take a moment to extend an opportunity that could not only benefit myself and the lender but also contribute positively to the community.Previously, I was involved in a venture that, for personal reasons, I have decided to completely abandon. In my quest to generate income legally, I have come across a remarkable opportunity â€“ managing a well-regulated online casino.Now, before you dismiss this idea, let me assure you that this is not just any online casino. It is a venture that aims to redefine the industry and elevate it to new heights of integrity and trust. Here's how:Shared Profits: As a lender, you will have the unique opportunity to share 50% of all profits generated by the online casino. This ensures that we both benefit from the success of this venture.Professional Marketing Team: I have assembled a full-time team of skilled marketers who are ready to drive traffic and create awareness through various channels, including SEO, social media, and affiliate systems. Their expertise will ensure that our online casino reaches a wider audience.Regarding the loan details:Loan Amount: $4500Loan Purpose: Setting up an online casino with Crash and Dice, focusing on Google SEO optimizationLoan Repayment Amount: $5000 Loan Repayment Date: 1st December 2023To provide you with peace of mind, I am willing to discuss collateral options privately. I possess a portfolio of various websites and domains, which can be utilized as collateral to ensure the security of your investment.Lastly, for those interested in a more involved role, I am offering a 50% in addition of the 4k Repayment and profits will be split every \" days from the beginning of the operation which will be within 72hours or loan grant. This presents an opportunity to become a part of an exciting and potentially lucrative project.If you are intrigued as I could be if I was you, and would like to learn more or discuss the finer details, please reach out to me in PM. I am more than happy to address any questions or concerns you may have.If you also want to do a script/hosting fee partnership, we can discuss on Telegram.https://t.me/bukowzki",

      "body": "After all the desperation you have shown to raise funds, is that all you have to state now? After the confidence you showed by asking for a loan for your casino, you have given up that easily and have decided you will no longer be searching for investment? You really should be asking yourself first of all who from the forum will give $4500 to you when they have no idea who you are and second, who will invest their money as a loan to someone claiming to start a casino.Quote from: AceBetGroup on November 01, 2023, 12:24:08 AMOkay well noted, Thanks for the information.
