How can one person be the sole major distributor, government should welcome competition in the business sector, every business person should be allowed to produce. Monopolies can manipulate the price of foods and if government let a single food distributor control the market this will likely to happens. If there isn't any competition in the market then a single controller will raise the price and govt can't do anything about it. To prevent this kind of issue govt needs to motivate other player to come to this sector and create a friendly environment to join the competition. This type of action will force the market to balance between cost and customer needs.",

      "body": "I think you should've posted this on the Nigeria board since it's about Nigeria's economy. Anyway, the high cost of food in Nigeria comes from several reasons. One is the high cost of  transportation, which happened because increase in price of petrol. Also, big farms and food factories use machines that need a lot of energy, and since petrol is costly, they have to charge more for their products. The cost of electricity in Nigeria is also high, and some machines need it to work. People try to find other power source e.g solar, which raises product prices. Insecurity is also  big issue, as farmers who are the primary producers are scared to go to their farms due to the fear of the unknown. Lastly, there are high taxes on production. all these put together i think is the cause of high price of goods in the country.",

In short: stop the Russo-Ukrainian war. War makes fuel and energy prices soar, that causes inflation and prices are going up. Grain and fertilizers are getting more expensive due to port siege and sanctions. This war should be stopped ASAP and at any cost, while it's still possible to save Global economy from crumbling.",

How can one person be the sole major distributor, government should welcome competition in the business sector, every business person should be allowed to produce. The law of supply and demand is what makes things cheap and expensive. If there's no competition in your area now and there are only a few sellers or producers of those goods. That makes sense as to why they're expensive. But if there are a lot of supplies of those goods then the market is free and will make it cheaper for the cost of it. And that's why when there's a bunch of supply in the market. Hoarding is one reason why there will be less supply of a certain good and that's what the government should watch out. But when these hoarders will just do under the tables and the problem is also on the officials, the problem can't be gone and consumers like you and me will have to deal with the effect of it.",

      "body": "Monopoly is not the only problem that Nigeria has. One of the major issues that the country faces in terms of goods prices is that there are more consumers than producers. Let's take Nigeria and its mentality aside. In a place with about 10,000 populations, only 10 are producers, and the rest of the people are purely dependent on what the 10 produce for themselves to buy and feed themselves. What do you expect from a society where there is a large increase in demand for goods every day and a low quantity of production? They will have to make the only available goods more expensive in order for those who are desperately in need of them to buy them off, leaving the poor to live on hunger and starvation. Let's also look at the northern part of Nigeria. Other parts of the country are experiencing a high cost of goods, but this is not the case as there are a lot of farmers available in that area and a lot of consumable farm produce comes from there, which makes life easier for those who are based in the northern part of the country. If any country can be more productive in the aspect of their consumable goods and deal less on importation, they are likely to experience price reductions on goods even if the distribution is done by one licensed body.Wished this is on the local board.. make I carry pidgin explain to ur understanding..",

How can one person be the sole major distributor, government should welcome competition in the business sector, every business person should be allowed to produce. So, what will you do when you know that now? And if the government supports monopoly efforts, it seems you also need to find out why the government can support monopoly in business cases that only involve a single distributor. Because if other business actors can make their own production there, I think you and the community will definitely have a way out to fight the monopoly efforts of the sole distributor. If we don't fight against it, food prices will always increase and become high every month, because a single distributor can make the prices whatever he wants.",

Competition does reduce the price of the service or products of a company, it also makes these company to do their best in terms of service but sadly those who have the money and influence are able to buy the rights to solely capture that market.  Making them the mere force that can manipulate and decide the price they want.I think the solution for this kind of problem is to find a leader that is just and fair and doesn't tolerate corruption since this kind of problem cannot be solved by any common citizen but the leader that commands the government of a country.",

Some are much easier to address, some are even impossible. However, what's frustrating or annoying, or even mind-boggling, is that there are factors that seem to be very much within the government's power to address and yet they either do nothing or implement something else. Many governments operate like the Mafia. I think yours and mine are good examples. Many problems are left unattended because they benefit from it one way or another. They implement programs that are either useless or unsustainable because they get something from it. Or perhaps these problems are effects of the kind business or dealings they have.",

Or did Nigeria become one of the best nations in the world? I've never witnessed that outcome because, if Nigeria were to change, it would already have changed by now. Food prices are rising daily, and whenever a new administration takes power, its policies will be stricter than those of the outgoing one. If a nation is changing, you can tell right away when a new administration takes office by the way he treats the nation.Since the beginning of 2023, the price of goods in Nigeria has changed and increased, most notably the price of fuel, which is the most important commodity in every nation and is especially so in Nigeria. Fuel in Nigeria is the root cause of all price increases for goods because, no matter how things are, if the price of fuel remains the same, nothing will change, but if the fuel price decreases, I don't believe the price of goods will follow suit.",

Monopoly is not only a problem in Nigeria, but most developing countries feel the same way. Business people who become collectors and accumulate certain products become price manipulators which cause prices to soar higher than they should. The government should be able to act as a regulator that limits business people from manipulating prices, but the problem is that business people have lobbied many parties so that no one disturbs their business.

They control the price and availability of goods and distribute them to the public.So it is not surprising that if there is only one distributor for a particular item or even if the distributor has many items, they will dominate the market. This monopoly on goods and prices often makes it difficult for people to buy because prices can rise high or the goods are not available on the market. If the government gives permission to more distributors to provide goods, of course, distributors cannot play with prices and always provide goods. Otherwise, other distributors will try to meet market demand.And it's true, it's a difficult thing to resolve because there are so many parties involved. Only by having a government that truly works for the people can it solve the problem.",

There are three main ways to reduce the price of goods.1.Reduce money printing from the central bank in order to lower the inflation.2.Fight monopolies and cartels, which are controlling the market prices.3.Subsidize the agricultural sector. I'm not a big fan of agricultural subsidies, but most of the countries around the world are going it anyway.Food prices went thru the roof because of the increased prices of fuel and fertilizers for the farmers. The global climate change also has a negative role.
