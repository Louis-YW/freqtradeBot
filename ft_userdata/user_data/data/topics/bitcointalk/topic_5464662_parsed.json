  "content": "I came across this post on X, the post was made by a user by the X handle Bitcoin_apex, I found this post really thoughtful and decided to share the same here ,the post indeed changed my reasoning, that is, what may perception or perspective used to be when ever the discussion of how early we are with Bitcoin comes up ..Let's all read what Bitcoin_Apex has to say ...Every Bitcoiner knows about the famous 10,000 Bitcoin for two pizzas (~$40) - the exchange in 2010 where Bitcoin was first used as money.Even though 10,000 Bitcoin now means complete financial freedom, many people see this as a reason to believe that the Bitcoin train to financial freedom has sailed.This is not the case, and the answer lies in Bitcoin's monetary policy. Bitcoin Pizza Day happens many hundreds if not thousands of times every single day around the world. What was 10,000 Bitcoin in 2010 is ~150,000 Satoshi today and 10,000 Satoshi instead of 10,000 Bitcoin for two pizzas in the not too distant future.Due to Bitcoin's absolute scarcity and clearly defined inflation plan that can always be determined in terms of time, it cannot be otherwise than that a unit of these 21,000,000 steadily becomes more valuable and thus fragments of these units as well.Not even 1% of people on the planet are familiar with the fundamental strength of Bitcoin. Over 99% don't know anything yet. The halvings can NOT be priced in if 99% of people don't even understand Bitcoin.Bitcoin as network effect and the economically highest incentive structure that a money and commodity has ever been able to achieve since humans have existed, will create extreme demand and need, so that the one percent will become 2, 4, 8, 16...We spend 150,000 Satoshi today. Maybe even for two pizzas. In the year 2068, those two pizzas will be a whole block subsidy and certainly more than 1% of humanity will have discovered the final step in the evolution of money by then.We're not even in the infancy of this Bitcoin evolution, we're only just putting it on.The end..Bitcoin_apexWhat thing I've leant from this comment is to be long sighted when it comes to Bitcoin , many of us investing in Bitcoin are short sighted about it, Bitcoin has the power to live and become as old as gold is, think of what the value of Bitcoin would by the time it becomes 50 years old , 100 years old, 200 years old and even more with a limited supply of 21 million coins? Many of us are investing in Bitcoin with a mindset like \"let's have our own slice of the cake as quick as possible before Bitcoin disappears in a few years to come\", what an error ðŸ™ƒ..Freely chip in your thoughts/contributions .",

Everyone who is in bitcoin must see the potential and views must also be put forward to believe that this system is far more perfect than any system that has ever existed before. The limited amount of supply that cannot be manipulated, the tendency to maintain value and resistance to inflation and recession are its strengths. This is where the added value makes bitcoin look different, but its advantages and functions will not provide any results for everyone who is not involved in it because bitcoin needs a process in terms of supply and demand to stay alive.Forming a belief in bitcoin is not easy, it requires consideration and scrutiny through knowledge so that when you decide to accept bitcoin as an investment, you are no longer talking about the risks and impacts, but how to try to minimize these risks to achieve profits. Remember, if bitcoins were worthless in the past, why are they one of the best investments today the answer is in each of us.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on August 26, 2023, 01:46:33 PMMany of us are investing in Bitcoin with a mindset like \"let's have our own slice of the cake as quick as possible before Bitcoin disappears in a few years to come\", what an errorThere's nothing wrong with thinking about taking part as quickly as possible before bitcoin disappears because any product has its time and in the end no one can guarantee how long bitcoin will last. This kind of thinking does not substantially show the strength of bitcoin in the future because if you look at the process, something that is of value is definitely influenced by demand and supply, but it is important to gain trust and more potential answers, why can bitcoin survive in the long term.",

I am not even from the technology field yet I started learning about how to perform mining. What is the OS required, how to set up the pool, the hardware and almost every bit of it. It was hard level for me but I did it anyways and kept my learning mode on for Bitcoin. This might read as indifferent thought and it is because I am that much motivated about Bitcoin and hence I ate Forward to learn it in deep pockets. This is just start. Imagine what will happen in the future when there will be students who are passing out with degree in Blockchain or Bitcoin? It would be enormous era for Bitcoin. They will create something so sophisticated that current peeps are not even imagining it right. It might not even be just dominating financial market but could change entire face of the monetary system.",

There is more expectation that the opportunity to get your share of bitcoin will become less accessible to many. If anyone reads enough discussions here on the forum, they will see that many countries and large companies are building the infrastructure to support mining for a very long time, and it is unlikely that they are doing this in order to lose everything in a few years. Thus, even if you do not study bitcoin deeply enough, you can draw your own conclusions based on how many very large and significant players in the world feel about bitcoin.I definitely don't expect bitcoin to go anywhere in a few years. I'm sure it'll be with us for a very long time. Not forever just because nothing is forever.",

Point is, we have to work and get BTC or buy BTC whatever the purpose is same. ---> \"let's have our own slice of the cake as quick\".I just made a similar post here in which I said to the OP of that topic that your history book might not run or gain any traffic now as BTC did not become history instead it is still making history and no one likes to read books which consists of half history knowledge. But the sad reality is we might not be alive to see the mass adoption and how far BTC has went. But hey at least we are enjoying the present.",

And these people want more. It is their right to ask for it. But when there are no more jobs or higher salary options left, all that's left is to invest. This brings us to the answer to your question. People want good things to happen immediately or in the short term, not in the very long term. That's why they can't keep Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in their wallets for very long. Now they sell their crypto and try to live that life as soon as they get a chance to live a little better than theirs.We don't know how long our lives will last. We know that some cryptocurrencies will reach very high levels in 10 years, but we do not know if we will live 10 years. For this reason, investors' long or short-term investment preferences will always be different. Everyone lives their own preferences.",
