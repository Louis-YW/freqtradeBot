      "body": "You are taking on a giant task to change people's perception on AI assisted Crypto trading platforms and tools. There are so many scams doing the rounds with supposed AI algorithms being used to trade successfully, with many people who have burnt their fingers and telling everyone about their bad experience. A friend of mine are part of a large forex trading community and they are actively warning people against these scams. You will have to get solid proof that the AI that you are using are legit and that it will work for other people. Good luck with you project..... but it's a hot potato scene for me.... and I think you have a huge task in front of you.",

      "body": "It's an MLM system. Everyone on Bitcointalk knows how Multi-level marketing works:- You start a business to sell \"products\"- Recruit some people, so that you can get a commission from their sales (and everyone they recruit)- Have those people recruit MORE people, so that you can get even more commission from their sales (and everyone they recruit)etc...At the end of the day, only those at the top earn money, everyone else ends up losing some amount of money.I don't think you will find anyone here to promote your scheme.",
