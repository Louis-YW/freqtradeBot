I think it’s something that should be promoted more. What exactly are the costs of running a miner? Other than electricity and internet access? Do those things use that much power if it’s just a single miner running?Or are you more-so referring to the actual up front cost of buying the miner? I wonder if a single miner would need to be upgraded everytime a newer model is released for it to still benefit the network? Or would a million miners that are a few generation old still have the same effect on decentralization as a million brand new, current generation of miners?",

Other than electricity and internet access? Do those things use that much power if it’s just a single miner running?It would cost you a couple thousand dollars to set up a single miner, like an Antminer S19 Pro, to set up a profitable one that can be competitive in finding a valid block would cost a couple more that that. Setting up a miner for the sake of securing the network is expensive and as such is not feasible, the above suggestion of joining a pool that has lower hashrate to make them more competitive is a good idea.Quote from: Oprahsbutthole on April 14, 2023, 06:48:37 AMI wonder if a single miner would need to be upgraded everytime a newer model is released for it to still benefit the network?

Also, they don't have to pay for the best of the best gear, and not at Bitmain prices, they could simply pick up old miners that go on cheaper prices per TH/s and just install those as the energy is simply no problem at these levels, they could simply fire up some old powerplant and just cover it up.But, why would anyone do it, and what it would solve?",

We have seen ETC get that before, and look how they recovered.Because people could just handle that when they get together, and that would be what BTC would do and in a big situation as well, multiple times bigger than ETC.

The only issue is that a lot of these solo miners would probably join pools, which centralizes their hash rate to one place. However, it's still better than one party controlling all of the hashpower. Quote from: stompix on April 14, 2023, 03:59:19 PMBut, why would anyone do it, and what it would solve?A group interested in hurting Bitcoin's integrity or security could severely hurt the price of Bitcoin in the short term if they successfully carried out a 51% attack and/or modified the Bitcoin blockchain by doing so. These groups definitely exist. In fact, these groups are still more powerful than the Bitcoin community to this day and would have the resources to make an attempt at doing so. I'd say it's highly unlikely that it will happen or could be coordinated though. It's expensive to try.",

If we have 1 million people running 1 USB miner that will not be even the 1% of the hashing power and they will not be able to do anything about the 51% attack, but if each miner is running one of the last miner's machines from antminer, then they will have a big contribution in the network and that would be some help to avoid the attack.The point here is while more spilt is the hashing power between miners then would be harder to see the 51% attack.",

There's a calculation here about $5 billion, but that's just based on the required number of Antminers. I don't think the supply is nearly high enough to realistically purchase 713k miners, and then I can't imagine the sort of facility that would be needed (or, more likely, many facilities) to actually put the machines there, to not overpower the local electricity grids, to rent the places, hire the maintenance people, keep the operation steady for at least some time but also succeed fast enough for the difficulty rate to not adjust to a sudden huge surge of miners. If someone tries buying out existing mining operations, the prices will go up, more people will feel the need to join mining out of FOMO, etc. So there's much more to it, I think, and it might be impossible to account for all of it to say whether it's practically possible (rather than hypothetically possible) to perform a 51% attack on Bitcoin.",
