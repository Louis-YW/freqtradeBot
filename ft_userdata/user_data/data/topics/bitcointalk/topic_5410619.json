Therefore, my humble request to the every one just use Bitcoin and become prosperous. Those who have contributed in his Bitcoin and Blockchain projects they also will get rewards and recognitions. Remember, you were poor, it is Satoshi Nakamoto has made you rich, please do not attack and harm Satoshi Nakamoto. Governments works for public wellfare. Satoshi Nakamoto also works for public wellfare. So, he is not anti government. He believe in good governance and justifiable economic system.

It is the Bitcoin community who are scared off Satoshi Nakamoto. They thinks, Satoshi Nakamoto will excell above them. Also they are afraid of Satoshi Nakamoto that he might sue those who have done evil against him. Satoshi Nakamoto did not invent Bitcoin to become super rich like Elon Musk, Bill Gate and Facebook founder. He created an industry and made hundreds of thousands of people rich.

Haha he will definitely not get any Nobel prize, at least not very soon after he reveals his identity, I am sure the government lobby will make sure that he is not popularized and definitely not made a hero. But yes this also I am sure that the bitcoin price will definitely not crash after he reveals his identity. In fact it will be so hard to actually believe who is real Satoshi the only way one will be able to recognize that he is the one if he signs a message from some of his old crypto addresses. Other than that there is absolutely no way to believe anyone who says he is real satoshi.",

There was a reason why Satoshi elected to remain anonymous, and most likely it is because he feared the consequences of his identity being known to everyone and what this would mean for his life, basically he was afraid to end up at jail in a cell from which it is impossible to escape, and I find those fears to be reasonable even today, so I think you are being too naive thinking he can get institutions to recognize his work when what they want to do is to destroy it.",

I also doubt that he would liquidate majority of his BTCs as this would go against his vision. Market may crash and I doubt that he would be selfish as to let such thing happen.Even though I am as clueless as anyone else regarding Satoshi's identity, I am wondering why some people seem to rule out the possibility that Bitcoin is the invention of a government? Couldn't it very well be that a national government launched Bitcoin as a top secret project? Maybe that government is sitting on millions of Bitcoin, smartly hiding any relationship between addresses. It would certainly be possible if there are professionals at work. They could be holding the majority of the supply and turn into a financial superpower one day if Bitcoin goes through the roof. I mean since we have no idea thus far (except for the shenanigans CSW has been doing over the years), couldn't it also be a group of computer scientists from North Korea? Russia? USA? There have already been tremendous amounts at stake when Bitcoin was around 70k USD. When a smaller country was then holding a large amount, that is already a lot of money even for a country. The only issue would probably be to get rid of extremely high amounts of Bitcoin. But generally speaking it could be anyone behind Bitcoin. There are some more and some less likely scenarios of course, but ruling something out entirely doesn't make sense to me. I just don't believe in the idea that Satoshi (whoever or whatever that is) is already dead without passing on the keys to those loaded wallet addresses. In contrast, a government could have all the patience in the world and a decade or two is nothing for a top secret project to fully enfold globally, while it is much harder to believe that a single individual can stay silent or leave so many coins dormant in those addresses.",

There is absolutely no worry about him/her selling his/her Bitcoins. Sure that will cause a dump. But his entire Bitcoin holdings is a bit higher than 5% of the market cap of Bitcoin.

For government they could have launched it as an experimental project through a central Bank. But that is not the case. Government may be tried to stop the Bitcoin development  but some how may be some Governments contractors from intelligencia like to exploit it after it was created by a individual and may be he hired few coders and spent more than half a million dollars to finally launch it. According to metadatas many researchers found that only one single computer mined more than 40,000 blocks. Therefore, most of the journalist are convinced it is the work of an individual but few people joined with Mr Nakamoto and push it to the market. Then the market went viral and Bitcoin reached five continent very shortly. Bitcoin and blockchain development is not illegal but few bad guys entered in the Bitcoin market earlier and exploited it for their ill motives. Bitcoin is financial product same as financial bonds produced by company or bank. There fore bitcoin is under the legal framework of financial asset class. Suppose Mr Nakamoto patented the Bitcoin and blockchain then start to trade as a corporate financial product and pay taxes to the government then he could have become the first trillionaire. But there is some libertarian elements involved in Bitcoin and blockchain development. Few cypherpunks wrongly cited that bitcoin over take fiat currency produced by the central banks. This has damaged the bitcoin's fundamental good reputation. Bitcoin is not money. It is a kind of transaction methods. But it involved market demand this is why its value rises faster. Satoshi Nakamoto is ground breaking inventor in the fintech industry.",
