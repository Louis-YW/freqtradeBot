  "content": "It is no longer news that the German government have been lately In the news of recent bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency price dump due to their sells. According to ARKHAM the wallet belonging to them has just been emptied which means they have sold everything. They had a total of 49,860 bitcoin as at 17 June which totals to around $3B. With their daily sells they have officially sold off everything. My take on this; is that around $3B worth of bitcoins were sold and it just dumped the price by nearly -12%. i don’t even think it’s the sell pressure that took bitcoin to this level i think it was the fud from it and the whole Mt.Gox sell. This is to tell you that bitcoin can’t just be manipulated like other Altcoins. This is more than enough bullish news to hold on to bitcoin and don’t be chicken out by FUDs",

Unless solid data is given from those exchanges they sent their BTC to that all have been sold, I will still consider every other news story as speculation.",

I mean the bitcoin could simply be sitting on whatever exchange they sent the funds to, and still have not been sold yet. Right?Two things are involved: either it was completely sold or it was moved to another wallet. Whatever be the case, it generated negative market sentiment and the market responded accordingly. If the coins were deliberately moved to another wallet, the purpose will not be far from market manipulation like many people suggested when this whole thing started. They did not dump outright, instead, they were selling and also buying. Nevertheless, with empty wallet at this point, there are high chances they sold off.",

If this is what makes prices continue to decline, then this situation will be resolved and the market will be good again.",

I mean the bitcoin could simply be sitting on whatever exchange they sent the funds to, and still have not been sold yet. Right?You’re definitely right, before the news was brought out there was other news earlier that they had moved this some coins to kraken, 139Po (this was rumored to be for OTC services/institutional deposit) and another address bc1qu, this was a total of 2,300 bitcoin and then the rest 3k bitcoin were later moved out to other exchanges. Why the news was about them totally selling off was because they usually bring back the remaining coins they don’t sell off the exchanges before the close of the day but this time around they didn’t. So it means they sold off. But the once set to those two special address might be for hold.",

Until FUD happens and become FOMO then price getting dump in domino effect because of that lol. Until some announcement happen from their team to clarify what really happens, sometimes there's no explanation, they let people decide lol",

Here things are not the same, I would call it a panic phase where maximum weak hands are liquidated. #keephodling",

However, since that news Bitcoin has recovered quite high and now it is at 57K USD, it proves how Bitcoin as a pioneer in this market is quite capable of withstanding negative sentiment like that - and that makes Bitcoin not a very volatile asset as it is said by many people.

It's 4,295 BTC as of writing. You have to double check this information to confirm accuracy of the given number from Bitcointreasuries.net. I did not double check it and simply took that number from their website.With high Bitcoin trading volume nowadays in average 400,000 bitcoin a day. Selling pressure from German government can be absorbed by market participants. A bigger challenge is their panic that can not be calmed down easily and can be abused for market manipulations from market makers.https://coinmarketcap.com/",

And now that Germany is detected not having Bitcoin in its wallet anymore, of course this will be an indication that they may buy it back or just abandon it. Because it is likely that some bitcoins are also hidden in some CEXs. Is it time for Bitcoin price reversal direction after massive declines in recent days?TF 1D shows this could be a good reversal direction when Bitcoin Price could break $60k to enter the Flip point of the trend.",

When compared to other altcoins is the largest. And because the Germany couldn't control a significant portion of its trading volume, it couldn't be manipulated. Therefore I agree with you that it was more of FUD and Mt. Gox effect. And the FUD in my estimation, are from people who thought that the market was going to be manipulated because of the sales of bitcoin from the German government sales.",
