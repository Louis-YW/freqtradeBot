      "body": "I guess most procrastinate in Bitcoin investing not because they needed more time or money but because they want to enter at a pretty low price. The problem, however, is that by the time Bitcoin fell to their preferred price, fear gets the better of them. They end up setting a much lower buying price, oftentimes too low that Bitcoin can't anymore hit. In the end, they fail to buy. Then they look forward to another time, but then bull run comes. Many feel FOMO, ending up buying at a much higher price instead. The tip is just buy right away regardless of the price. And hodl. You will certainly be rewarded.",

A wealthy dude ones said, the poor folks works to get their money. While the money works for the rich. For you to partake in any investment you must have a certain amount. No one would tell you though that you should. It's something that you personally should work on. Having just little money and risking it all on crypto investment would do you no good as you are going to likely sell off at the wrong time due to fear Or when an emergency comes up, you sell to settle off thing. FUD is something that you cannot totally eliminate as a trader because price would surly manipulate your decisions.",

I think whether to invest or not does not depend entirely on capital but on each person's thinking and understanding. If poor people take the time to learn about investing and realize its potential, even with low income, their savings are small and life is still difficult. They will still find ways to invest because they know it is the only way to help them escape poverty. The key to overcoming procrastination is awareness, IMO.",

The same people would never invest in a bearish market, when the price is dropping. This is just a \"sheep\" mentality, when the people are just following the trend, without having any strategy or goals in mind. The \"sheep\" investors almost always end up losing their money. Procrastination or the \"I'll do it later\" attitude is a major problem not only for investing, but for you everyday life.I don't have a cure for procrastination. I also procrastinating a lot and it affects my life. I can tell you from personal experience that watching motivational videos on Youtube doesn't help at all.",

But in reality, every day we delay is a missed opportunity for growth.Procrastination is a thief of time and should be overcome totally. In investment timing is important and it is not the same in every asset. Like buying Bitcoin during the bear market is ideal and might give you profit during the bull run.

If I have extra funds, I invest immediately and don't procrastinate. If I see a good land that is destress sale, I buy. If we are in the bear season when the price of Bitcoin is cheap, it will be good to buy if I have the money. No need to keep money that would have been invested for a long time because it would be eaten up by inflation.",

After learning from my experience, which also postponed investing in Bitcoin, I have often regretted it and finally got the answer to it. And after I realized, the thing that made me postpone investing in Bitcoin was because of the lack of understanding and the great potential that Bitcoin has, so that I underestimated it and postponed it with the excuse that I would start it when I had more money, when in fact what we postponed would actually make more money.So, in essence I only suggest studying Bitcoin fundamentally to know and realize its potential in the future, so that when the time comes, we will not regret the delay that was made, as you said.",

But even now this was priced in and the so called Trump effect may have started passing already. What is going to support crypto beyond this point? Could something even better happen? Not so easily.

What strategies do you use to stay motivated and take action now?the rule is as simple as ABC, just get started. you don't need to know everything and don't need to have a very perfect plan in place before getting started both in bitcoin investment and in any other form of investment. after you have started, you can then learn a lot of things along your investment journey and even if you make some mistakes that leads you to some losses, they will eventually help you become a better and a more experienced investor.instead of overthinking it and eventually procrastinating till you are unable to carry out your investment plan, it is better to start investing with a very small amount and along the line you can increase your invested amount based on the extent of knowledge you have acquire and in the long run you can buy a bulky BTC because you have set the basic things in place that will make you a better investor.procrastination tells you to do things at your comfort zone that never comes. just look at the market condition that went a bit bearish, some investors that are procrastinators would have missed out on good buying opportunity and will still miss out on some good buying opportunity because for the procrastinator, tomorrow is always the best time to buy and when that tomorrow eventually comes, another tomorrow becomes the best next time to buy till he finds another reason why today is not the best time to buy. as long as life is concern, if you don't want to pay the price today and do the needful now, it will only get more difficult tomorrow and if you can't do it today, your chance of doing it in the future will be even more slim.",

When I look at Bitcoin's price charts, starting from 2011, I see that this is the currency in which I have to invest because it's always going up. What gives me motivation also is that countries talk about creating Bitcoin strategic reserves. Bitcoin is still severely unadopted and it has a huge potential, I'm sure it will become a financial reserve like gold. So, I simply invest in Bitcoin and keep calm. Sadly, I bought some Bitcoins at $100K but it's okay for me, I bought some in 28 February at 80K. I feel fine because I know it will rise.",
