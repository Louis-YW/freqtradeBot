  "content": "Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao believes the cryptocurrency industry is still growing despite the volatility shown in recent times. He also said the next Bitcoin all time high could be in after a while. However, he said some companies launched at the peak of the market could have difficult times going forward. Speaking to The Guardian, Zhao made some interesting comments around the next occurrence of Bitcoin all time high. The CEO also warned that no one can predict the future of Bitcoin, stating that the next all time high could take as long as two years.“I think given this price drop, from the all-time high of 68k to 20k now, it will probably take a while to get back. It probably will take a few months or a couple of years.”Zhao felt the current Bitcoin price is not bad after all, admitting that the $20,000 range is relatively low. But, if people were told in 2018 or 2019 that Bitcoin could reach $20,000 in 2022, they would have been very happy, he explained.Next Bitcoin Peak Around $420K?Although it is not precisely clear as to when would be the next Bitcoin all time high, analysts are making strong predictions around what could be the peak. Many believe it could be around $4,20,000. Proof of Steve, a crypto investor, said the same. “Since Bitcoin topped at $69,000, it is clear to me the next target can only be $4,20,000. There is no in between. No fire without smoke.” Another crypto enthusiast DrNick wondered whether the next Bitcoin peak is going to be around the $4,20,000 level. Similarly, another enthusiast Rssi predicted a $420k Bitcoin peak based on the $69k top. “The BTC top was $69k. Next cycle pico top will be @420k obviously.” Details: https://coingape.com/when-will-bitcoin-price-break-69k-all-time-high/_Will_Bitcoin_Price_Break_%2469",

He doesn't want investors to keep bugging him with his prediction like eating a dick. It coukd be true though maybe 2 years from now could be a better prediction but this will not go sideays the whole 2 years. So there is a way to make money in the market.",

However, one thing I can assure you is that bitcoin will rise again and there will be a new ATH, but how much and when will only time tell. The most talked about prediction is probably the bitcoin halving in 2024, so let's wait until then.",

As the article said, the drop from $6k to $20k is pretty big and we're not really seeing any recovery at the moment, and I doubt we will.The most waited time frame would be the halving season again, it's never failed before in showing that Bitcoin would hit new heights during it after all.",

I don't know anyone here still believe the bull run after halving in 2020 has yet finished.Consider that it already finished and Bitcoin is in its bear market, the next bull run, if history won't be broken, Bitcoin will reclaim 2021 all time high $69 and make a new one. Next bull run will be in 2024, next halving, some time in 2024. New all time high will occur a few months after a halving, so it can be in late of 2024 or in first half of 2025.",

You'd better fix that  $4,20,000 crap. It's just $420,000 otherwise looks confusing.Going to the point, it is quite laughable that $420k prediction. People seem to forget that some predicted last year (the supercycle theory) that this year we would already be around that price. Then the ath was only $69 and now we are in bear market.I agree with Wexnident and SquirrelJulietGarden that we will break that ath after the next halving, and hopefully we will be able to break the $100k mark.",

I thought it was way too risky, but for a while it went quite okay. Now, of course, if they need the funds and didn't take them our before the drop, they'll face great difficulties and probably won't be inclined to invest in Bitcoin anymore. Then again, they broke the rule of never investing what they can't afford to lose, so it can't really be blamed on Bitcoin. As for the peak, I think it'll indeed take time, either months or years, and that it won't be $420k because the multiplier tends to shrink with every next ATH. So I'd expect something around $100k.",

Historically, Bitcoin always reclaims its ATH in the year following the halving, which suggests that we may need to wait until at least 2024 for a new bull run. HODL is one of my favorite sayings. It describes someone who knows their position, sticks to it, and then gets really happy about the market's growth. So, yes, I believe there will be a Bitcoin boom in the future. We just have to stay focused on our strategy and think about it in this perspective.",

No. But it will certainly go higher and we all know this.Lastly, it is clear that people will try to pin the current situation on anything crypto related, but the reality is that we are all doing terrible as a whole world, no nation is surviving without damage, everything is going to sh-ts right now, so its really just a regular thing for bitcoin and crypto to be bad as well.
