Hi, As I wasn't part of the initial conversations between yourself and sportsbet support team, I asked them to give me a brief on what happened..The below is what they were able to investigate for us..I honestly believe this is a situation that has been lost in communication, but it seems that you are indeed credited for the free spins that you wish to be. Plus a few more.See the response below from my team, and for some reason you need further clarification, let me know and I will try to help you out.best regards, Steve.Sportsbet.Hello shoppingsherlock,We have reviewed your correspondence with our agents as of last week, and we can see beginning Tuesday, September 6th you contacted regarding reward offers you had available.An Agent credited you with free spins on Moon Princess as per checking your available rewards (a total of 40 free spins). On September 8th, you contacted again asking about available reward offers for your account, and as per checking, one of our agents credited 140 free spins in the game Moon Princess.On September 9th, you contacted once more, and due to a human error, an additional set of 140 free spins were credited to your account. These free spins should have been cancelled, however as a gesture we did not remove any winnings received as a result.On September 10th, you were asking on live chat regarding a notification for 500 free spins. As per checking, this notification was a technical error, as such after reviewing, we have not issued any additional rewards at this time.We apologise for any confusion caused by this, we will endeavor to improve our services and processes internally. Currently, we can see that you have been credited 140 free spins due to a previous error we chose not to rectify.",
