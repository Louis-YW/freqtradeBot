But people should be very careful too, so people that have experience and know about this type of scam can easily be suspecting that the account as been hacked because the hackers can tweet that people should pay certain amount of money to receive double, or asking for what that can result to money loss from you which any Kucoin official will never ask. It is a shame on Kucoin because the exchange failed to protect its official Twitter account, but also humans should have the experience to stop being greedy. As for me, I can not fall for this cheap scam, it is even not a new scam.",

On February 17, Twitter announced plans to block people from using SMS-based two-factor authentication to secure their accounts — unless they start paying for a Twitter Blue subscription. However, there are safer, free, and easier ways to continue protecting your Twitter account with two-factor authentication.The full article can be read here:How to Protect Yourself From Twitter’s 2FA Crackdownhttps://www.wired.com/story/twitter-2fa-sms-alternatives-twitter-blue/",

Its one thing to try to hack 2FA and entirely different thing to actually succeed in it, and bigger the account (presumably) better the protection. Btw, Kucoin Twitter account is far from small.
