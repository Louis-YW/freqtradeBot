It's up to the users to decide when the dev had to push for Layer 2 or not since the increase in demand or the overall goal and planning for that coin. Heck, I think I remember CZ BNB has something like zkBNB that is also Layer 2 as well. What I want to say is you have to have some plan for Layer 2 in the future. Cause right now, the number of transactions is only a fracture of later where thousand of thousand people have to use the chain on the daily basis. From small value to big value transactions. If your coin truly wants to be the main currency for the future, you ought to have high TPS and scaling for a low fee.",

Layer 1 solutions to scaling may be out there by the time Ethereum scales but everyone has a different opinion so it will be interesting to see how things play out. There is a case to be made that layer two projects are not needed. But I think we're going to need a lot more experimentation to learn how they work and how they'll be used in the future.",

Layer 2 blockchain was a garbage useless blockchain. There are so many layer 1 that already made bridge to the mainstream blockchain even these days the coin like bitcoin can be bridged as well. We didn't really need blockchain layer 2 solution. It's pure gimmick created by the developers. So many projects were aiming to fix the problem from 1 blockchain. IMO we didn't need bunch of developers created so many second layer solutions",

Not sure what he meant by that as most layer 1 projects would get clogged by the huge amount of not so important transactions that could be easily done in layer 2. Was he talking about BNB or cryptos in general? Where did he say this because i can't find that by googling and it would make more sense to answer to your question if we saw what he actually said rather then hearing vague recap of the statement.If anyone can find the original statement would be interested to check it out.",

Just end up realizing that layer 2 was needed, but MAYBE it's not needed right now which is going to be the case right now with the PoS change in crypto.",

First of all, I am not a techy person, but using new technology is always an adventure for me. Though CZ is also a very tech-savvy person, why should we welcome a new idea? Obviously, the layer2 concept drew a lot of attention. We know all these things happen only because of layer 1's highest gas fees. And in this case, layer 2 gives us the very same result. That is why I was drawn to the concept of layer 2. Now I don't know why he said that we didn't need layer 2. But yeah, the hype layer 2 actually got from the users shows that obviously we need layer 2. Now let's see what happens next. I'm hoping everything goes smoothly. That's my opinion; others' might be different. Thank you.",

Cz knows how to timing the market, and of course he knows what he is saying along with the back up data, if itâ€™s not the right time yet for them, then we have no choice but to wait for their next innovation. Layer 2 might still happen, we are too close for that and other project already shows their interest for that update.",
