I believed everybodi do well last month and this month you will be smiling to the end. No forget to pray for di local board.Base on the rising spamming, shitposts and off topics in the local board, there were murmuring and reporting threads against that. So we decided to make things easy for everyone in the local board by requesting to create some Sub-boards and we pm a reputable and prestige personnel of local boards analyst in the forum and he suggested that we should first create a thread here to know the public opinion and take note on the most important ones before creating the mega thread in META and he also said we should not request many child boards but just few and wait for a while for the administration to take action (grand our request). Therefore, I am suggesting 3 sub local boards which are:Naija Politics: Where all the political gbengbotigbo (Matters) Should be discussed Economics: Any Economic related matters should be discussed here. Bitcoin, Politics, and Economics are working in Pari-Passu therefore if it is to create child boards these above mentioned two must follow then Off Topic: This is where any post or topic that is not related to bitcoin, politics and economics will be posted in to make the other boards clean. Remember, he advised us not to ask many but few and I suggested the 3 above. So you can also suggest your own and give reasons why your is good to be created. The floor is open for everyone except newbies and members because they have not gotten enough knowledge to discuss such a sensitive matter in the local board.",

I think is a welcome Idea, because I've seen most post recently that have low quality always resurfacing on the board, so if there are segmentations where members can easily post the topics they want, if it is off topic, if it is economics if it is politics, it will help in the overall engagement of the local board, because it will reduce spamming and also help members to know the best segment to post whatever topic they intend.",

      "body": "uchegod-21 suggested for off-topic child board in the past, Off Topic child board.. At the time, I also wished theymos can give use a child board like that because there were many posts that were off-topic, but we did not requested for it at the time.From my findings, I noticed that we have many new topics about discussion related to politics and society on our local board.Normally, what moderator like mprep has said in the past is that, if most of what is discussed on the first page of a board is more related to a particular discussion, that such discussion is worth to be given a board. When uchegod-21 suggested we should request for off-topic board, I went through the first page of this local board and this was what I found out:Quote from: Charles-Tim on July 19, 2023, 01:20:06 PMQuote from: uchegod-21 on May 18, 2023, 10:04:50 PME get when this matter been raise but we been no know the importance of it. Now we don get our board I think we need Off topic and Politics and Society. These two children board dey important because due to how our government dey treat us, an average Nigerian love to talk about politics and government. We need politics and society board. If off-topic is included as another board, I will thank theymos for that.All the links below from the first page on the main board of our local board.

Out of 40 topics on the frist page, we discussed mostly about something related to politics and society, also there were many off-topics. There has always been many posts that we supposed to be reported and be moved to off-topic and political and societal boards. Because of this, I will like if we request from theymos to create two boards for us, the first should be about something related to politics and society and the second should be nothing but off-topic board. I like your suggestion, but I will prefer if we include something like society to the politics. Do not get me wrong, we can call it another name but in a way people will know that what is discussed there is about politics and society which is what many people are discussing on the local board. For the economics board, I do not think there is a need for it for now because topics related to it are not many. The reason I also said that is because we should not request for too many boards, in a way the main board will not be that active again. And we can still later request for other boards if there is any need.Let us see what other people will suggest.",

While looking at the positive part of creating these boards, we shouldn’t forget the main part why the forum exist, which is solely about Bitcoin Discussion in general. If we make the general board we have now to be for posts relating to bitcoin discussion; what about the Beginners & Help board that we have in the general forum? It is a very resourceful place for newbies to ask their questions on also. Since we are advised not to request for too many child boards, why don’t we have a topic pinned on the board, that will only be for beginners to ask questions, they can easily locate it at the top of the board without navigating throughout the local board.

But one thing wey I dey also consider be say if this subforum or child board are being created how do we still managed them? This shows we are indirectly requesting for local moderator because this our 9ja section need them. Na we go only analysis any post wey no good except we go report those posts but if we get mod e go dey easy us to handle than anyone else even though the mods are active there to do their task but we needs ours while requesting for childboard.Then if not that you have posted this you for make as pool then list others then make we vote.",

So that whenever we get newbies wey join the forum wey wan ask questions, dem fit ask for the pinned thread otherwise, I would have suggested say make the Beginners and Help child board dey him dey on its own but since again, the advice be say make e no plenty, den make we just pin one good thread for newbies and members.Gambling Discussion too nko? That one go make sense, make we get one board where we go dey discuss our local Naija leagues and men (Super Eagles) and women's (Super Falcons) national team.For instance now, na Enugu Rangers, Shooting Stars and Lobi Stars dem dey lead the league table standing now but since for the general gambling board, dem get other plenty leagues wey dey ahead of our own, e no go be bad idea.",

You should have read before commenting as it was stated in the OP that newbies and members shouldn't comment on this thread because they are new here and wouldn't understand much on what to say. Off topic is needed because so many newbies will want us to identify themselves by their post, and most times, their posts are always off topic.

Although, Agbe contacted me and we discussed about it which I said anything they call it. But if we think about it very well, the Nigerian local board on its own consists of bitcoin topics and other discussions. But if the discussion on the main (Nigeria local) board are more related to certain boards, like off-topic and naija politics and society, such boards can be requested for, which we did. We should not have the main local board and still have other discussion that supposed to be off-topic. With proves, we know that we need a board called off-topic. If the boards that we requested for are given, other threads not related to it can still be under that main local board. And if need be, we can later request for other boards if necessary. It would be good to edit it to off-topic before it is too late.",
