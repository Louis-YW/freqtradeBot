You disagree or agree?It’s been hell for me, price of fuel has increased to 500/L and you can’t get cash from the banks to even pay for stuff. Today I had to stay in a long queue at the bank to withdraw, the withdrawal limit imposed by the banks was 5000naira. Can you imagine? 5000 naira. Of course a fight broke out eventually when the money was exhausted and I had to go to POS centers, paid 3000naira charge to withdraw 10k. It was so annoying. We were not ready for this change the government is forcing on us, imagine having money in the account and yet unable to use it.",

How you take reason am? You disagree or agree?I like the fact that this topic was brought back to life by Mate2237, na topics like this wey I dey expect we to dey discuss here. Topics wey revolves around bitcoin and still no need too much cracking of brain for we to dey fit dey discuss on the topics. As dis topic dey so you no fit call am offtopic as e get to do about bitcoin and wen people talk you go understand how dem see Bitcoin. Although the topics get other discussion wey dun die but make we concentrate on the topic instead of the thread itself. As mate dum talk, Bitcoin wasn't made to replace any fiats as many people dey talk. Satoshi just talk say instead of we to dey use only the fiats dem say make wey use an alternative way better pass cash but two of dem supposed dey move together. E just dey like if you no wan use Taxi you go use bot but you go still get to ur destination. Our government no like Bitcoin, dem never come out talk am but everything wey dem dey do so just dey show say dem no like bitcoin. All the bodies of the government follow for this one so we expecting them to pass a bill that favors bitcoin go be very hard thing to do. Our government wey like control, dem dun talk say make we link our banks to social media self and dun do all the verification wey we get for this world from Bank (BVN) to Phone to NIN. Na this same people wey we dey expect make dem embrace a currency wey dem no go fit hold your money wan you talk rubbish about them for internet. Nigeria government like control and accepting bitcoin go commot dat power for their hand so e no fit replace naira unless something miraculous happen.",

Cryptocurrency is good but I think everything get limit and cryptocurrency isn't exempted from this.I agree with op that bitcoin  wouldn't replace naira which I believe wasn't  intended to do so but I think they can both easily compliment each other to achieve some incredible results and heights.",

The Nigeria we grow up and know is no more. The one we have now is artificial. Irony is displaying everything president comes to the country as a leader. I don stop one of my businesses because there is no money to collect in di bank and dis cashless policy e don crashed many businesses in kwantry. POS business is not like before again because many retails stores owners who were patronizing this POS bots are now using their personal POS for their business transactions so customers also take their cards to the retail shops and do the direct travel. Bitcoin just came to the monetary system so it will not just over take the Fiat Currency like that. Fiat has been in the system for a long time so people cannot just leave Fiat to bitcoin the matter. Bitcoin might take over Fiat only on the new generation.",

Secondly, we lack de necessary infrastructures to support de use of Bitcoin. Apart from P2P, no oda way to use Bitcoin for our country. If you go developed countries like china, for instance dem get their own Chinese Yen wey be the number one currency and de most accepted medium of payment for goods and services but u still no need to enter big shopping mall before u fit use Bitcoin or any other crypto currencies. You buy small tin for street Bitcoin POS dey to carry out de transactions, abi na Bitcoin ATM machine wey de scattered everywhere? Coming back home... As we big finish na only one Bitcoin ATM machine wey we get and I no no weda e dey work. Lightning Network nkur?... I no no weda e don enta Nigeria abi e dey trek de come for road.

So Bitcoin is a decentralized alternative currency to the naira and there is no doubt that the government will continue to fight against Bitcoin since most Bitcoin transactions are in taxable and at that the government will constantly push against the usage of Bitcoin.",
