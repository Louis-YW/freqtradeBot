Why is there no information about team members and early investors of the project? This is important information for those who decide to invest in your project. Because projects like this don't have any organised team members that handles the projects. From the look of it, this a quick money pump and dump project for short term only.Don't be surprised those six pictures does not actually represent any team member in the project. These type of project are not worthy of consideration.",

      "body": "Some dubious project offering me to buy tokens on Uniswap, via ETH swap. Tokenomics implies 80% of the entire supply in the Uniswap pool. There are no advisors, investors, etc. That is, almost all the supply will be concentrated on one exchange. What are the prospects of development of the project with such tokenomics, which keeps almost all its proposal in pool of one exchange and offers there to buy tokens in unlimited quantities? In my opinion, almost none. There are a lot of such projects that appear on DEX exchanges, but they die very quickly.",
