Even then it would just be the difference between your cost basis and what your purchase price was.Mining is an interesting case though. There would be two ways to look at it:You just received goods for services (barter income) and it is taxable immediately OR you have a gain when you sell with a cost basis of 0$.Either way I imagine you could write off what it takes to run your mining operation.Very interesting question.",

Would you have been entitled to a tax deduction for your losses? If not, it hardly seems fair for you to be taxed on your gains.In the US, you would.You would be entitled to claim a capital loss to offset any capital gains made during the year (so if you made $1,000 profit from a sale of Google stock, you could then make a sale of BTC that loses $1,000 (provided that the BTC sale has the same long-term/short-term holding status as the Google shares) and wipe out the capital gains tax liability from the Google... this is known as Tax-loss harvesting and is quite common).  Beyond that, you can use up to $3,000 of a net capital loss to offset personal income (I forget whether the AMT disallows that deduction...) a year.  If the net capital loss is greater than $3,000, you would use $3,000 to reduce your income tax and then carry the loss forward to offset against any capital gains realized the next year.  If your cumulative capital loss remains after that next year, then you can take another $3,000 to offset your regular income for that year and carry the remainder forward and so on.Example:year 1: net capital gain of $10k => you pay capital gains tax on that at whatever the appropriate rate isyear 2: net capital loss of $2k => deduct $2k from your taxable incomeyear 3: net capital loss of $5k => deduct $3k from your taxable income, carry the other $2k forwardyear 4: net realized capital gain of $1k => use the $2k carry-forward to fully offset the $1k gain (so no capital gains tax is owed) and deduct $1k from your taxable incomeyear 5: net capital loss of $7k => deduct $3k from your taxable income, carry the other $4k forwardyear 6: no net realized capital gain or loss => use the $4k carry-forward to deduct $3k, carry the remaining $1k forwardIt is true that there is an element of \"heads we win, tails you lose\" at play here: tax on a net gain is immediately due, while a large capital loss may result in the entirety of the tax deduction not being claimed because you die before using up your $3k a year (to say nothing of opportunity and lost time-value of money considerations!).  This is slightly ameliorated by the fact that the tax rate on regular income is generally markedly higher than that on long-term (held for at least a year) capital gains: at the moment, the long-term capital gains tax rate is capped at 15% (assuming that bitcoin is not classed as a collectible, as gold is...) while if your income is between roughly $35k and $80k (as a single person), the tax deduction effectively operates at a 25% rate... if you're making $200k a year or more (as a single person), then deducting against regular income saves you more than double what it saves you as a gain offset.IANATA and IANAA, but I would suspect that (assuming bitcoin is not considered a collectible...) the tax-efficient strategy would be to use LIFO accounting (considering each sale to use the cost-basis of the earliest unsold transaction) and try to hold for a year before selling for USD (otherwise it becomes a short-term capital gain and is essentially treated as regular income).The lower long-term capital-gains tax rate also makes it rather foolhardy, imo, to put a lot of your 401(k) or IRA into investments that realize most of their gain via long-term capital gains (as opposed to short-term trading or dividends/interest).",

      "body": "Been wondering about legal status of bitcoin ownership and it is very, very nebulous. As you'll notice in the disclaimer in my signature I admit to possessing keys but not to bitcoins themselves (this was for the purposes of 'disclosure' to jokingly avoid accusations of conflict of interest).The coins are held in the database that is distributed in the network, so I, myself, do not actually have possession of the bitcoins, the network does. I hold the keys to access certain coins but can only do so with the collaboration of the network. The closest thing in current law might be a custody arrangement but since the network is not a legal entity, like a bank, then it is not clear who actually has custody of the coins, or if they even exist as assets at all, under current legal definitions. Are the coins really there? The only way of verifying that is to move them into another asset class, up until that point they do not really exist legally speaking, particularly not until the bitcoin network is recognised as a legal entity existing in its own right, like a bank.So I'm not convinced that legally I actually own anything except the keys. Maybe the keys could be classed as virtual good, but not the bitcoins themselves since they do not really exist as an asset in any legal definition. If I use those keys to make a transfer that results in US, or other state monies or assets that the state recognises, then maybe I'm liable for tax on any profits of bitcoin activity. Until the keys are used for an exchange into 'real' assets (bits in US$ bank account) I'm struggling to see where the liability comes from, legally speaking.",
