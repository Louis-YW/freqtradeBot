But in case of unforeseen events like congestion of mempool it will take longer time. But since the past weeks we haven’t gotten a high congestion to say that your transaction will remain unconfirmed unti now so till you show the Transaction Id you can’t be helped. Nonetheless your transaction broadcasted will be dropped in space of 14 days if it remains unconfirmed",

At one point, Bitcoin.com would even lie to newbies that Bitcoin Cash BCH is the real Bitcoin which is malicious and not trueIt is possible they intentionally sent out a transaction with very low transaction fees so that you could get frustrated after several days of it not getting confirmed, and then you would switch to the shitcoin they have been shilling BCH.",

Next time, use bitcoinfees.earn.com, where you can set the necessary commission depending on the time for which you need confirmation of the transaction. I used to use this website, when I log in now I see \"Please wait while predictions are being updated\", that hangs endlessly (It's possible that the problem is on my end.). You can use an alternative, like bitcoinfees.net or others. At the very bottom of this site there is a bitcoin fee calculator that will help you set the commission (fee) depending on the confirmation time. The interval is from 10 minutes to 24 hours (as you can see, there are no 6 days, so you won’t get into such trouble as the author).",
