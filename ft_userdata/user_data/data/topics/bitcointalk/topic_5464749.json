There are some factors to consider as this will differ from country to country. Some countries tax cryptocurrencies. The exchanges and other centralized crypto businesses are located in some countries which government tax as well and the exchanges are employing people. There are many other reasons cryptocurrencies can add to a country's economy.",

When bitcoins become accepted generally, a lot of individuals and institutions will accept it as means of payment. Colleges and other educational institutions will not be left out, they will set up themselves to be able to accept bitcoins for tuition and other things in the college that requires payment(fee).",

It's a really good idea to have continuous accumulation and a side investment opportunity where they can save and invest at the same time.For the reason that Op you've mentioned on the Stable money I think the solution is hidden inside the query, BTC is the devisable currency, and using the satoshi unit we can fix the services prices, which can have no impact on the market price. It can have some consequences but I think on some levels we can do it.",

So for those schools, it's just going to be another payment method but then, they have to use a service as I've said.IIRC, there were schools already that have accepted payment methods into BTC or those were just online courses.",

BTC is money and it is gaining customers everyday. Those who get to learn about cryptocurrency by investing in altcoins, still refer BTC when they want to accumulate cryptocurrency for future use. The regulation that is facing most countries before they use crypto currency for payments is the only nod needed by institutional bodies before they start accepting BTC for tuition payments from college students. It would be a while before more institutions set up their payment portals to accept crypto currency for payments of tuitions. It's quite plausible in the nearest future, but it may be until the lawsuits and SEC regulators conclude on their percentage from transaction cost and network fees.",

But accepting Bitcoin is possible only if the teacher or student has good knowledge about Bitcoin. Moreover, currently the government has not yet taken any step that they will accept payment by Bitcoin in schools and colleges, so no such place has accepted Bitcoin. But you can buy goods with Bitcoin from many places that accept Bitcoin payments and in some countries most things can be bought with Bitcoin. Although many countries' governments have accepted bitcoins such that all other goods and food are purchased in bitcoin transactions. But it will have to wait until the government gives such permission to schools and colleges to accept bitcoin payments for tuition. But it will be possible in the future, I believe because many economic situations have changed with Bitcoin and such payments will soon be provided by the governments of various countries.",
