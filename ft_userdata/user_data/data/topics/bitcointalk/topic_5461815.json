One month has been passed, yet there is no official announcement about the downtime and the users stuck funds. Betnomi.com is showing this message since 25th July: 'This Edge Function has crashed'. Perhaps, the administrators have taken down the website intentionally. A small number of users have complained about stuck funds on Betnomi here in the forum.0.9 BTC of GekkeBelg$20k of Stayzor€5.3k of boroBTC300 USDT of marcloigUnknown amount of illmatic010101Let's have a look into some other and old facts regarding Betnomi.Fake team:The first complaint was raised in 2019 against Betnomi team. It was related to the fake team and fake ICO project. A flag was created against them, and Betnomi representative had received some negative feedbacks too. But the flag was withdrawn later and some negative feedback was turned into neutral. Betnomi team had solved it by sending PM to some forum members and by running a review campaign.• [SCAM] BETNOMI - Fake team, ID and Linkedin used without owner authorizations (New title: Old file - to erase) (Archived version)• PM from betnomi.Users data was moved to a dummy website Betnomi.bet and wiped from Betnomi.com:In the October month of 2021, Betnomi team had registered a new domain Betnomi.bet and moved the Betnomi.com database in it. They had wiped all the data from Betnomi.com after moving it into Betnomi.bet. As a result, Betnomi.com became like a new platform and old affiliate partners had lost all the affiliate benefits. (Read here)Things that happened since 2nd July:• On 3rd July: An admin of Betnomi said that they will relaunch the website with in-house games. The message has been deleted later from the telegram group.• On July 3rd and 4th: Some users said that they received their pending withdrawal.• On 8th July: icopress said that he got a response from Sorsis (Betnomi admin).• On 16th July: Some forum members have confirmed that they have started receiving suspicious and spam messages from unknown websites on the email address which they used on Betnomi.• On 19th July: icopress has said that Sorsis (Betnomi admin) will give an announcement in the forum soon. Unfortunately, we haven't heard anything from them yet.• On 1st August: A forum member has highlighted that Betnomi team has deleted their Linkedin public page.What is left now:• Betnomi telegram group• Betnomi twitter account• Betnomi instagram account• Linkedin profile of Sorsis Chatwin (Betnomi admin)• Some information about Sorsis Chatwin on the Betnomi's trademark application pageNote: It will be appreciated if any victims create a flag against Betnomi.

This issue has been on for long and many were hoping that they would come back to settle or pay pending withdrawals but the reverse was the case. It's so sad to see Ones hard earned resources get lost in such a situation and all efforts put in place to get it back seems abortive. What a devastating situation and manager has chosen to go mute without responding or a message to their campaign manager they owe for long now.At this point it would be very difficult to withhold anything petition against the betnomi casino and team as a whole. This is more clear a scam act perpetrated by them.",

What value are you actually bringing to this thread? You're talking about funding for a sig campaign and what managers should be doing(BTW they know what they should be doing) when the thread is about Betnomi exit scamming. Go get your post quota elsewhere!!",

Bro, to be frank, it's not only you who have problems ... there is a war in my country, and a lot of things are happening in my life that it's hard for me to talk about.
