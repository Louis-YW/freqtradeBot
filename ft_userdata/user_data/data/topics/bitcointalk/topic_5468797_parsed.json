And the thing wey dey pain me pass for all these scammers and yahoo boyz na be say, dem nor care to know weda na only that money wey u get for ur life, so long as say dem don get access to ur account dem go wipe every thing finish. And because of all these kind shocking news some people dey from there dey pass out because of high BP, and I don even hear of case when person commit suicide after dem collect all em life savings. Na two category of scam wey I get in mind to share, and the two of dem na local scam(call scam) and cyber scam(internet scam). Call scam 1. For this one dem try to scam me of resent but I sharp pass their trick, after my ATM card loss, person con call me say e get one interview wey e apply for, but e con mistakenly use my number take write for the paper (reason because my number and e own na only one digit difference so e con make mistake) say now the company don send message to my sim say make I send am the OTP. But I nor send am because if to say I send am my account for dey bleed2. My people if person call una say em dey call from una bank to solve small issue for ur account, no give am any more info about your account oo just cut the call, or call am scammer em go cut the call very fast. The truth be say dem go fit call your name, date of birth, state and your resident address so that dem go dey very persuasive but no believe dem oo, those na just information wey dem fit get from different place eg BVN internet scam1. Make we dey very careful for the kind of links dem wey we dey click, especially for WhatsApp, some people go post link say federal government wan give palliative, M-POWER don start to dey collect beneficiaries for their project, MTN dey give 1gb if u complete their survey, etc. My brother run from all these kind of links dem oo because some of dem nor dey secure and from there scammer fit hack ur devices.All this kind sites wey get that triangle sign  instead of padlock, make u no say e nor dey secure oo. Na only sites with padlock sign nai dey secure 2.  Also note say inside all these WhatsApp links dem we fit send our details dem give scammers with our own hand, some of these links dem dey ask for personal details/information for example And after u don put all ur details apply for the rubbish dem go com tell u to refer at least 10 persons so that dem fit get more victims, and from here naim some person go take know your name and all your info wey dem go use take call u. So abeg make we dey very careful for the kind of places wey we dey put our info dem because dem fit use am against us.3. Mining sites: if una see any mobile site wey say e dey mine BTC, ETH, XRP etc just know say na scam, at some point some go say before u withdrew your coins u go get to deposit first, while some go say u go buy miner first( some persons fit cashout for like one week) but after that time, dem go carry people money Japa. Abeg if u get any additional knowledge make u nor hesitate to drop am here, because e fit help person to avoid one when em see am.",

As e come be general tips why you no include others tips so the thread go carry weight, just three tips isn't enough. For this call scam, I dey always talk say na you dey make yourself fall for the scam because of your ignorance and greedy nature. Why person go call you in this 21st century come scam you in the most dumbest way possible. How dem go tell you say make you send them code and you go do am. Even with juju self you suppose no fall for those type of scams. Or when dem call you say your ATM get issue and make you send them your pin dem, with all the ads wey bank dey do say dey will never call you to ask for your sensitive information, you still dey fall mugu. Na you no value the money wey you get or maybe you no suffer get am because if you been surfer you go guide you money with all your life and become very security cautious to avoid becoming a victim of scam. Quote3. Mining sites: if una see any mobile site wey say e dey mine BTC, ETH, XRP etc just know say na scam, at some point some go say before u withdrew your coins u go get to deposit first, while some go say u go buy miner first( some persons fit cashout for like one week) but after that time, dem go carry people money Japa.All mining sites especially those cloud mining companies are all Ponzi scheme and should be avoided. They make their money mostly from referrals and the ads wey dem dey displays show you. Mining no be easy thing that start up because e dey very costly so nobi wetin anyhow companies fit do. This is why those companies no dey last because as people stop to dey register, their money go finish to pay their previous customers and them go disappear like every typical ponzi scheme. Instead of trusting those companies no mata how legit dey claim to be, just buy Bitcoin with your money and hold safely or probably go into cryptocurency trading if you get small knowledge of trading from the past like you been dun do forex trading before or other financial market trading.",

And don't disclose your discreet information to people more especially on social media. Be careful with the kind of conversation you have with people so that you won't reveal your personal security information.",

Omo the truth in this their intro sef go make you believe asap, next thing you don give them card number, expiry date, cvv and even pin without you knowing. Before e clear you for eye, excess debit alerts.    The second format na family, friend or relative format, dem go call you tell you say so so so person Dey this situation say make you help am so him go fit comot from the situation, first task, you go send airtime, then as the jonzing continue, you go start to Dey make red to account wey dem call for you. Everybody eye Dey red for funds sha but ways Dey make we no Dey fall victim abeg.Sometimes just try Dey reason some kain things well before acting even if the whole story sounds true and promising, for the ones wey get true caller app for phone, you go fit detect when some calls na scam call based on the reports from other pole, so true caller fit help show you say that particular number na fraud.

The funny thing about these guys that send all these links for hacking your account is that they are not organic with the words they use in convincing you to click the link and most times, they will just drop multiple messages to different DM and in different groups so those that can't control there sense of curiosity and the one that is looking for easy money platform will easily fall victim.But if you want to do it the easy way, there are sites online that you can use to check if a link is safe or not. Example of those site include;1. https://domain-reputation.whoisxmlapi.com/2. https://www.criminalip.io/3. https://www.urlvoid.com/And others you can easily search up on so when you are not convince on the link you are sent to, you can check it up for it authenticity.",

Most  http sites are tagged with this because most of http site are temporary and are use for getting victims over a short period of time . Mostly  days On this , not all have no intention of scamming ,informations required  determine  their  reputation.  And most times  browsers settings  can be used to fish out this site some might only review the Triangle sign based  on your browsers  settings . Search Engine   also play a major role, if you are using  search engines  used for deep or intermediary  level of searching then you might come across this this sight because most of this sites are  hidden by the watch dogs .
