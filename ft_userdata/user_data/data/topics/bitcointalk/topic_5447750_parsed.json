  "content": "What Happened: Today I noticed a Twitter page sharing Scam PawZone token Airdrop where they are asking to Connect Wallet through Wallet connect where there is no official airdrop ongoing from PawZone and it's purely a phishing Site. So it maybe risky if it gets viral, actually it's risky for a single user too. That's why I am sharing here so that you can be aware from it and always follow official announcements before joining any Airdrops and specially be safe when it asks you to connect your Wallet. Because many users have been hacked by connecting with these Scam Sites.Scam Airdrop Link: https://etherseums-airdrop.org/PAWScam Airdrop Archive Link: https://archive.ph/JukkUFake Twitter Account: https://twitter.com/PawShibarum Official Twitter Account: https://twitter.com/PawZoneTokenHere is the Screenshot of Scam PawZone token Airdrop Website with Connect Option.Â In this Photo you can see they are encouraging to Connect with this Phishing Site through WalletConnect and Coinbase. We all must be aware specially newcommers from any kinds of Crypto Scams.",

      "body": "I have never heard of PAW or the PawZone token, but it doesn't matter.I browsed around a little and noticed the project is holding an official giveaway right now as part of their listing on a new exchange. The information is available on their Twitter feed > https://twitter.com/PawZoneToken/status/1643565743676739584.Even before the latest listing, that token got listed on some other exchanges. The scammers are just trying to take advantage of the current situation to scam people out of their tokens. The fake site you mentioned in your OP is only 4 days old.",

      "body": "Because they are all brand new to us, these numerous new altcoin projects are also difficult to identify. Check out the fake Paw Zone twitter account, which has more followers than the real one. This is also common when airdrop hunters are not careful, I have seen telegram groups too with large numbers of members that can be mistaken as the real telegram. I do not like airdrops for this same reason. Additionally, there are assignments required and a considerable number of airdrops request that we connect to our wallets.",

      "body": "There is no limit of these Phishing sites because its very easy to create new one with just Sample domain and hosting service. Its better to do own research on each website before connecting wallet to any airdrop offering site. One biggest problem with these Phishing site is promotion if these sites through google search. many times i searched for Arbitrum and other big names and i found phishing sites in the top. I wonder why Google and other social project isn't taking any serious notice of this. Due to the lack of strict laws, their posts are free and they are scamming newbies everyday",
