Can you list the anonymous gambling sites so we could know them or you just used the word for the topic so as to get attention to your thread. In the absence of using time lock as stated by you, one can exercise self restraint and discipline from gambling if one must stop gambling because locking of your assets does not guarantee that one can stop gambling besides one have money which they can easily use to buy crypto if the urge to gamble without control comes up. So this option of locking up your assets I think can not really stop one from gambling but rather self discipline and restraint if one truly wants to stop gambling.",

Since you will stop seeing a lot of promotion so for sure it can lower down your interest to gamble. Also you can make yourself busy on other things like focusing on investment since for this for sure you will never think about gambling but rather you will just find new things that can possibly give you some profit like investing on new alts or trade with the crypto you want to follow.Doing what you mention could possibly exclude yourself to gamble but for sure you can still receive another funds and if you can't do anything with it for sure you would still think about to gamble since you might get bored for not doing anything.",

I say that the gambling platform would be fully decentralized if the platform itself does not have custody of our coins and tokens such as it only needs you to connect your Web3 wallet like the Trust Wallet. But there are KYC-less online casino platforms which doesn’t support connecting Web3 wallets but rather using traditional login types like email and has 2FA (Google Authenticator) feature, but I do not define them as fully decentralized as they have control of the minimum deposit and withdrawals of our funds there.",

Trustwallet has many validators and atomic wallet is part of them if they support the staked coin.Are you sure you want to trust a wallet that is not open source? I mean that is completely up to you but that goes against the transparency that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies stand for. At that point you might as well put your money on a CEX wallet and hope for the best. Ironically, I do not trust a wallet named \"Trustwallet\".But it is true that Trustwallet gives a decentralized option, unlike the Atomic wallet, which is not what I would call decentralized.Quote from: Plaguedeath on December 08, 2023, 08:24:17 AMI don't understand what's anonymous gambling sites have to do with your post.The another alternative is using time lock, you can lock your coins how long you want.Or the best solution is to learn about self control without need to use any tool that could give drawbacks of hack, urgent need, human mistake etc.I agree that you could simply lock your coins up so that you cannot get to them. That is a good method. But at some point, you are going to get them back. Will you be able to withhold yourself from gambling with them at that future point in time?",

Example on (Stake) you can set-up by one month self exclude after one month your account will be unlocked again. If people can't handle with short-term hold.Stake might offer it which is great, but many other sites don't.For example - Fairlay - has a very high limit for bets, especially on US sports, and you can easily bet there $5,000 - $20,000 on a game there, even more.Now let's talk hypothetically, take this all as some hypothetical case scenario, not necessarily a reality but still:Take someone who doesn't want to spend that much on US sports, so he is banned from Stake because they self-excluded him but he cannot ban himself from Fairlay.What does he do? Contact Fairlay? They won't help him. These guys have an instant link registration, 100% anonymous, 0 details about yourself, not even an email.And this is just 1 example. Might be tons of other sites out there.Okay, so if you save your money in your bank account you can't use it with a site like Fairlay, you might be able to use it with your own local website e.g. if you are UK based then Ladbrokes, William Hill etc. - these sites do offer proper protection and are proeprly regulated.However,Say you save your money in Crypto, you got $15,000 USDT and you don't want to be tempted to gamble it away - whether it's Fairlay, trading, Binance, day trading - there are lots of way to lose money these days, do you agree about that?So there you have it - that's a solution that works, because your money is locked away from you.It's not only for gamblers, but for traders, or anyone with small or big addiction - you arrest the addiction by taking what you're feeding it with away from it - that's how many gamblers made better lives for themselves - by arresting their addiction - this is just 1 example.Does it help to improve self control? Oh yeah, for sure, you would only make better decisions moving forward by not acting swiftly and carelessly and thinking about the money locked away much more than simply handing it over as if it was a piece of paper worth nothing.",
