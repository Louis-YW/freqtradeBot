I don't think anyone is saying that you can't earn good money outside of a physical job.What people tend to say is you need to put in a lot of work and effort to expect high earnings, which is good advice.Don't fall into the trap of chasing big returns with little to no work neglecting working on your skills. Even if you're successful and end up with a fortune, you'd be looking at your peers who mastered their professions, while you'd have nothing to show for yourself other than money. That's not the best place to be.",

Bye foren00 2024BTCReally glad to see your interest in Bitcoin but if you live with your parents then you will invest in Bitcoin with their permission. Try to convince your parents well, most likely if you convince them well they will listen to you and help you enough to invest in Bitcoin. If you are self-employed and you want to invest a certain portion of your salary in Bitcoin then you can because you probably already have all the knowledge to acquire in investing in Bitcoin. But if you inform your parents and then invest in bitcoins, your parents will have no chance to blame you later.",

It piqued my interest, so I delved deeper into the world of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. You discovered Bitcoin at such a young age which I am sure a lot of us here in this forum would have wished. I too wish that I discovered Bitcoin when I was younger so that by now I would have had a bigger investment already. But there's no point in crying over spilled milk so I just try my best to accumulate as much now. You're lucky to have found Bitcoin early in your adult days.QuoteMy parents never believed in this and didn't support me.

Your parents might have not supported you before but at least that did not stop you nor discourage you. Keep going and goodluck!",

Of course all jobs require a lot of effort but there is a difference between someone without skills working at a construction site and a skilled programmer sitting in an air conditioned office.Even investment in bitcoin (or anything else) to make profit is demanding. You need to work at it, endure stress, spend a lot of time analyzing the market and take big risks that could come with big losses as well.

I believe otherwise, which is why I’m writing this. Let time show.  Bye foren00 2024BTCit's not wrong to be passionate about something like Bitcoin right from a tender age, it's totally your decision to choose your area of interest and most of our parents that don't know what's the big deal with regards what's popular in today's century might not have it all figured out when it comes to the subject of Bitcoin but as a young person that's not yet balance financially you have to know how well prepared you're as you plan to start investing early enough. At 18 I didn't make it a big deal about taking my finances seriously up to the moment I almost finished my university studies. If I could take myself back in time and do change anything about my past decision, I would have loved to have taken my financial life seriously even while I was in school and so if you're 18 and you're not distracted by all the vices and interest that comes with such age range, I must applaud you for that.However, you have to also set priorities right as you go about investing in Bitcoin. Set the right financial plan in place before you start investing. Your skills are important and a strong source of finance is a necessity, set these in order and when you're done doing these you can be comfortable to invest as much money into Bitcoin as you want to.",

Although in crypto investments, there are a big chance that we can earn a lot by simple buying and then holding, just like a passive income.But I do go with the old and traditional way of earning money thru jobs, a 9-5 in the beginning.
