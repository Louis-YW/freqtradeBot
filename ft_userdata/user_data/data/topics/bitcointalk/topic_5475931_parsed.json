Decentralizing that process, if done correctly, will boost trust and attract miners to join their pool.",

This is going to be huge but I do not think that it is only Jack that's spear heading this. And it is too early to conclude on it. I think in my estimation that it is necessary and from what I have read, there are many potentials and upside to it. One of the reasons I like it is that it is disruptive. But is this going to in any ensure that we do not see high transaction fees again? In addition, what will happen to the already existing mining pool. Will it be abandoned by the miners? Further explanations would go a long way to help me understand better.",

I'm sure someone else could build this without needing a penny.The truth about Jack Dorsey is that he has come from the web2 world thinking that he will be web3 genius, but everything he has created resembles web2 in some way, and nothing innovative or special when you look at it from a web3 perspective. He clung on to Bitcoin as it was easiest to comprehend, but he is struggling to innovate. Now he has settled for this somewhat pointless objective to garner investments for something that a group of talented individuals here or elsewhere could probably build themselves if they put their minds to it.This might serve well for large mining operations in the US or elsewhere, but it does not need investment to be created nor does it need to be a commercialized product. I doubt Dorsey will make it open source, but it very well should be - or even built into the protocol itself.",

Bitcoin mining is decentralized as it is, I don't see any need for it to be \"more decentralized\" cause the current setup's already working so well for the miners. and I know the miners would agree with me on this one as well. I'm all for innovation and all that stuff but in this case there's nothing to be innovated, and it just feels like Jack's trying to reinvent the wheel when it's already turned for decades without any issues. The introduction of a new mining system into the mixture will just make stuff even more complicated not only for the miners, but for everyone, as the crypto industry's highly dependent on these people for their transactions to go through. So yeah, this is a common Jack Dorsey L for me.",

Thousands of miners helping solve a block for a pool getting direct dust payouts will, in the long term, make it excessively expensive to spend.

A single mining pool can not provide decentralization for Bitcoin mining industry.It can be a good trigger for more mining pools to do the same or to innovate something new and better than what Ocean mining pool is doing.
