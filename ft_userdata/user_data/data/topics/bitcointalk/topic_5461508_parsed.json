Does binance sell rubles right for non russian customers ? When people are looking to buy a good currency you are busy pursuing Russian Ruble. Well, good luck to you in your expected Russian bull run, but I bet you will get disappointed with such an investment. And if you must buy Russia Ruble, find out with your local bank or go to Russia to purchase it...lol.But Binance is not the right place for you to purchase your Ruble if you are not in Russia or have a bank account there, the P2P might not work for you in that regard.However, the other alternative is for you to purchase it through an FX broker, but ensure that the broker offers a swap-free account, or else you will run into debt.",

In contrast, Dubai is relatively an open and investor friendly country with significant oil reserves, and an emerging economy in the middle east. For long term investors , Chinese currency appears more suitable because it is second largest economy of the world, with strong export based industries and rapid technological advancement in all sectors of industries.",

This is purely for cryptos and I don't think you will find a lot of people active in forex market. Also, remember what Stompix has said!",

Does binance sell rubles right for non russian customers ? Are you serious about Russian Ruble? If you really think that Russian Ruble is going to bull run, you really have to spend a lot of time and learn about economics. First of all, national currencies don't do bull run because huge strengthen of national currency is very bad for country too, it makes their products very expensive for export, brings a shock to businesses and absolutely every institute and for bonus, I want to tell you that deflation is a sign of weakening economy too. Russia won't be able to produce such a big surplus of goods and services to make a bull run of Rouble, I don't really know how you've really got this idea. Have a look at this article: Investopedia.By the way, if you still decide to strongly bond with Ruble, I'll help you: Yes, you can exchange Bitcoin to Rubles, even if you are not a Russian customer but if you want to withdraw, you need to have Advcash account, all other options are suspended at the moment as far as I see.Or another option for you will be to do P2P trade on Binance and exchange your Bitcoin or USDT/BUSD, ETH and so on to other people for RUB. More likely you'll need to have a KIWI wallet or Tinkoff.",

Remember inflation is a monster. Inflation is a major concern for all of us as it erodes value of our assets, and Bitcoin is considered one of the best hedge against inflation due to its limited supply capped at 21 Million coins. Investment in Bitcoin is relatively a prudent decision, in its historical context, as it has demonstrated outstanding performance since it was launched in 2009. Moreover, halving event in mid 2024 makes it an attractive investment choice for medium term investment. When we evaluate all these advantages, Bitcoin appears to be a more favorable option compared to fiat currencies, such as Russian Ruble or Dubai Dirham",

This is a strategic miscalculation based on one’s own inflated self-esteem, self-hypnosis, and systemic lies within the ruling elite. Kleptomaniacs at the top. And now, being a coward and a scoundrel, Putin, trying to save his own skin, continues to send his citizens to slaughter, who, on his orders, kill citizens of Ukraine. At the same time, he is not worried about the impoverishment of the country, the collapse of the economy and the rapid fall of the ruble....Yes, and most importantly, no one will save the Russian economy. Cheap Russia, ready to work and sell resources “for food”, is CHINA’S DREAM. The only thing the world is afraid of is the proliferation of nuclear weapons through the “Kremlin hands”",

These two years of war with Ukraine cost Russia $211 billion (19.5 trillion rubles). We are talking about the costs of equipping, deploying and maintaining troops for offensive operations, a senior US Defense Department official said, Reuters reports.Generally speaking, the invasion of Ukraine cost $1.3 trillion, taking into account the lost economic growth of Russia, which was expected until 2026, the Pentagon noted. If Putin had not started the war, the Russian economy could have been 5% larger, the US Treasury previously emphasized.  The government has included record defense spending since Soviet times in the 2024 budget: it will amount to 10.775 trillion rubles, or 29.5% of all spending. At the same time, spending on social needs and other areas that could be aimed at improving the well-being of Russian citizens is sharply reduced. This winter, the suburbs of Moscow suffered from freezing temperatures and people were forced to warm themselves in the streets near fires as public utilities fell into disrepair due to long-term underfunding.A Pentagon official also assessed the damage caused to the army. According to him, Russia's losses in killed and wounded reached 315 thousand people. This is about 87% of the personnel that the Ministry of Defense had before February 24, 2022.All this certainly affects the purchasing power of the ruble, which is falling more and more rapidly. https://ukrrudprom.com/news/Pentagon_Putin_potratil_navoynu_bolshe_210mlrd_dollarov_ipoteryal_315_tis_chelove.html",
