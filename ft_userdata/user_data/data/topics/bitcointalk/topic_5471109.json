I saw this when I clicked on swap but I do not know if it will work or not:But what I know is that you can swap between tokens and their coin that have the blockchain. Example is that you can swap between ERC20 tokens or ether. I am not still sure if swapping with bitcoin would work because bitcoin is not having any token but which I think some developers are working on due to taproot that makes it possible.",

      "body": "Quote from: fokinlipat on October 21, 2023, 04:18:10 AMIs it possible to convert BTC to other alt coins inside trust wallet directly ?Simple googling would give you the answer; Quote from: https://trustwallet.com/blog/how-to-swap-tokens-using-trust-walletTrust Wallet supports two types of swaps: \"interchain swaps\" that allow you to exchange coins/tokens within the same blockchain, and \"cross-chain swaps\" that facilitate the exchange of coins/tokens across different blockchains. Regardless of the type of swap you opt for, Trust Wallet ensures a smooth and hassle-free process.For instance, if you have Bitcoin (BTC) and wish to acquire Ethereum (ETH), Trust Wallet allows you to make this conversion directly within the app, eliminating the need for complex protocols, bridges, or third-party applications. But it doesn’t end there, you can swap any ERC20 token Trust Wallet supports and swap across other blockchains like the BNB Smart Chain, BNB Beacon Chain, and more.Ps: Trust wallet isn't a recommended wallet to use as they're closed source and a product of Binance which translate to you not having any privacy as anything associate with Binance is centralized, yes Binance own trust wallet).You should be using a non custodial wallet to store your coins and if you're worried about exchanging your coins between the same blockchain (ETH to ERC-20 tokens) or  different blockchain (BTC to ETH) you can make use of instant exchanges.

      "body": "Things changed.  I think Trust wallet uses Thorchain dex to trade between BTC and other altcoins.  Thorchain dex feature changes fast.  The streaming feature of Thorchain said that trading fees is lower than CEX, but it is new feature.  Make sure that Trust wallet support cheap fee THorchain feature like streaming.  Otherwise, try to use other method to trade between BTC and altcoins to get low DEX trading fees.Metamask,  Thorwallet, Thorswap etc are all supporting BTC and altcoin dex trading.  Many support Thorchain dex stream feature for low fees, some do not. Check features before doing trading.",
