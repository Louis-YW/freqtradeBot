Bear market is like a punisher, it comes with full force and punish all shitcoins that are pretending to be good for investors.Bear market is not a punisher, it's just a natural thing that has to happen after the bull market, what goes up, must come down. You have to try to catch the highest high or the desired profit, but you should stand firm and don't break if you fail.Quote from: DevFile90 on May 10, 2022, 03:31:35 PM5. There will be more selling pressure than buying and most people wouldn't want to HOLD.The charts, the people, everyone always tells and suggests you to not sell bitcoin, I don't think there is or will be a pressure to sell from others but the pressure from inner self will probably be to sell as soon as possible when the bear continues for days, weeks and more.

If you research a bit about the history of Bitcoin every block halving Bitcoin block reward is split into half and that is the day that you should focus on when buying Bitcoin because after block halving you will notice of increase in value gradually which is a sign of Bull market and right now while bear market better waits for a good time to buy while in a bear market.",

But if you really want to gain the most advantage in the market, focus on bitcoin. It will never leave you in losses, but will give you the biggest profits if you intend to hold it for long term. Also, investing in established altcoins this time is also a great idea, as they will always recover after every fall of prices.",

Majority of the new projects in the market end up as scams, the reason why most investors should avoid them as they can only be a source for losses. If you want to invest, stick with old and established altcoins, and with bitcoin, because no matter how high the volatility in the market, bitcoin and those great altcoins with high potentials will always recover their value that made long term investors gain more profits than short term.",

I wonder how sometimes many people say about hidden gems, but when the market drop and is bearish, the coins or tokens are heading to dead. This means they are fake gems   Just still be careful when looking for certain altcoins, moreover they are hype enough and said as hidden gems or something that will be very promising in the future. Quote from: DevFile90 on May 10, 2022, 03:31:35 PM3. Even top altcoins will struggle to survive.Top coins may survive from the ebarish market. But, some may not be able to reach their ATH again when passing the bear market, like the rpevious condition. This really proves which are the best top coinsQuote from: DevFile90 on May 10, 2022, 03:31:35 PM8.

They are gems while the market is running smoothly. They may not appear absolute shitcoins because they have the community, the volume, the visibility, and so on. But once the entire market will plunge into the worst of times and these fair-weather gems will fall hard just like the rest, many of them won't be able to recover anymore. The worst of bear markets is a shitcoin killer. It would put to death so many altcoins. But their death is not due to lack of good volume or liquidity. Those are simply effects. The main cause of these shitcoins' death is the lack of the most basic reason to exist. Most of them don't have a working product, sustainable tokenomics, or even the smallest development.",

Also bear market always give us opportunity to accumulate more coins because thier prices are down then if you are having extral funds then you should be able to accumulate more at a cheaper price.",

While shitcoins and some altcoins might not recover, bitcoin will surely recover. Then, as we are buying the dip, let us still remember to invest what we can afford to lose.

If they will survive then congratulations for them because they are successful but if they can't then there is nothing we can do about it.

Even top altcoins will struggle to survive.I've seen this already during the 2018 \"year of hell\" and the 2020 \"Pandemic Crash\". After this, we might see new altcoins at the top and those below might go even higher. Just see Litecoin, XLM, IOTA, and EOS.
