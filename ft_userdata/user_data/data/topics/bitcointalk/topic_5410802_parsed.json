The fight will be on November 5 in the United Arab Emirates. At least the fight is happening on a neutral ground. Expect Bivol to become the betting odds favorite but most likely not that wide over the gutsy Ramirez. Both are undefeated and well experienced against top-caliber fighters but someone's 0 gotta go.

      "body": "It's just a match IMO. Both fighters are great in their own accord and this bout may even last up to 12 rounds. Bivol has the stamina and footwork advantage but both are power punchers too, so it's only a matter of who's going to connect that punch first to get the win. Ramirez has the reach advantage too, so it's quite easier for him to land some punches and get some points if they managed to drag this until decision. Bivol is the heavy favorite but I am not discounting Ramirez's creds though.",

He get what he wanted now, but we all know that Bivol has the hand speed and I think this will be a key to his victory against Ramirez as he has no match for a prime Bivol right now, riding high from a big momentum win against Canelo Alvarez.",

Although the score is very close, but we have seen how Bivol dominated Alvarez with his volume punching. What's holding Canelo is that he has a good chin, but he was no match. So if a boxer with that caliber can't beat Bivol, so what is the chance of Ramirez? I would say very slim, he really needs to be 100% healthy in this fight. Otherwise if will also be dominated by Bivol and maybe win by a knock out.",

Zurdo was a former champion in the super middleweight division so i think he also got some pop on his punches though not that hard but still enough for him to be recognized by the boxing community so with that said this would be an exciting fight because like Zurdo, Bivol was a nobody (at least for me) until he fought and won against Canelo.",

So we shouldn't underestimate this guy, perhaps we are not aware of his name. But as you have said, we are not that much familiar with Bivol until the Canelo fight.",

Both of them are very good fighters considering their boxing records. I am predicting that the winner would be determined by the efforts both fighters would put from now till November 5th when the fight would hold. Gradually, Saudi Arabia is now having a new identity that is different from religious pilgrimage. The country is now becoming a center for big boxing matches because of its neutrality and financial capabilities.",
