No, if the reasoning will be about DNA. Yes, if it's his own action and he never listens to one's advise on how to avoid or make it controlled by him.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 01, 2022, 10:46:12 PM-Can their gambling problem be put in check by regular methods?Yes, it can be checked at all times to see if the person who inherited it really has that inheritance through his veins. But for me, whether you have an inherited DNA from a gambler, it's still you that will be taking action and your personal decision.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 01, 2022, 10:46:12 PM-Will the addiction be worse than someone who picked up the habit?It depends to the individual and his gambling habit and level of addiction.",

It's a choice not came from everywhere cause if you have a mindset that gambling is good and bring you a lot of money then that kind of mindset is not good cause gambling is base on your luck you can not win every bet but you were lost big than winning. The main problem of the gambling addict is the gambler itself if they let gambling will take over them and fall into a trap.",

It is a choice not inherit in your bloodline, you are the one who is responsible for yourself not your family's DNA.  Gambling addiction starts in that stage to become a habit, which is frequently gambled and then turns into an addiction.

I mostly believed gambling to be an issue that stemmed from the community surrounding the person themselves, at least that's how I entered on gambling, being influenced by my high school friends back then.

It's just going to take time and a lot of effort on the players' side. Quote from: Rruchi man on July 01, 2022, 10:46:12 PM-Will the addiction be worse than someone who picked up the habit?That requires a completely separate study imo, and not something that users here can actually answer. That requires factual data after all. Though I guess completely separating DNA-induced vs habit-induced gambling can be close to impossible, if they are actually two different factors (or even exist, for that matter).",

I am not sure that this will really be because of DNA or genetics. Gambling is an activity, not a disease that may be because of genetics.But, if this is about the environment, I absolutely agree. People who are living in a gambling environment will be influenced more highly to involve in in gambling, too. Moreover if in family, the father becomes a gambler and lets his children also do gambling in their life, introduce it and also train the children in gambling, this will also influence the children to do gambling in the future (although there may be some exception). In fact, environment in our native family or even environment around us will really influence people to do gambling.",

No one around me gambles, nor they have ever thought of gambling. I just got curious one day and started doing it until now. Thankfully I have never been addicted, and I only see gambling as something that helps me kill time. The environment sure helps influence other people's decision making, though to conclude that gambling habits are passed on to the gene is to an offspring, IMO, a stretch. The parent needs to be extremely addicted to gambling, or gambles very regularly in order for this to happen. And even then it will only account for an extremely small amount of genes being altered, plus gene information are shared when an offspring is developed hence further reducing that extremely small amount into half.It's a stretch. No external substance involved, just pure dopamine in control, and you get your genes altered?",

I never believed in these DNA or genetic things why gamblers become gamblers. Social activity and culture play a big role while these people are growing up. These are by far the most influential reason we can look at.If these people will be addicted in the future, it does not make sense to point out that it's because of DNA.
