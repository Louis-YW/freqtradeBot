  "content": "We are just a few days away from the cricket's biggest tournament which is going to be hosted in India after 2011, that is also only the second time we won WC second time under MSD. Cricket is the biggest celebrated sport in India followed by over 1 billion fans, and it is getting bigger and bigger every year. And surely India is one of the favorites to win the title again because the team is in terrific form which they recently won Asia cup as well a week before. So let's just grab some discussion about the long tournament, especially about India matches, in this thread.Here is our 15 member world cup squad where all of them deserved their place with their stunning performances over the last 18 months of domestic and international matches but only one guy Axar misses out due to some injury replaced by R. Ashwin which seems actually a last time strategic change because a wrist spinner is very important especially in Indian playing condition and Aswin is one of the world class spinner also part of team India 2011 winning squad along with only other man Virat Kohli from the current team.Let's see the fixtures of Indian team belowJust use this thread for discussing every match of ICC world cup and you are free to add the sport betting sites of where we can use crypto to bet on ICC matches too but as of now I know we bet on Stake. I will edit the list later with more casino links.1. Stake : https://stake.com/sports/cricket/international/world-cup",

This time in the ODIWC he was again selected because of another injury. He is a perfect all-rounder at the moment that India needs in the lower batting order. India and England are the favorites but you cannot ignore the South African side, they are looking very good. Cannot ignore Australia and the Kiwis these two teams have the ability to outperform themselves in ICC tournaments.",

Axar performed well too in his batting even in Asia cup but for now it seems Off-spinner can't afford to miss out when playing in India so R.Ashwin is the best person for now. I would say India, Australia, and England are my top three, and I am not going to deny that Team England is far deadlier than any other team now if you look at their squad.",

Axar Patel isn't that good at bowling but to be very honest, he bats much better at the lower number and brings up the hopes when everyone thinks that the team is going to lose. TBH, there are various batsmen like him, like Rahul Tewatia and Yashasvi Jaiswal but they're kept out maybe because the team doesn't find the potential in them to play the World Cup '23.",

Regarding Tewatia, Ashwin aside from being an all-rounder, have plenty of experience, Ashwin over him.",

TBH, there are various batsmen like him, like Rahul Tewatia and Yashasvi Jaiswal but they're kept out maybe because the team doesn't find the potential in them to play the World Cup '23.I am not sure about Tewatia but Jiaswal will get an entry in the ODI team when either Rohit or Kohli are not playing. Jaiswal has got good potential and has proven that he is suitable for all formats of cricket. I am sure for now he is happy to be part of the T20 squad. Next year we might see him playing in the T20WC. BCCI has already given signs that Kohli and Rohit won't be part of the playing 11. Axar Patel is the future and he will replace Ashwin in coming years in all formats of cricket. I am not against Ashwin but I think that after the World Cup, it would be the right time for him to retire. He is already 37 and he got this opportunity to be part of the playing 11 due to Axar Patel's injury. At the moment the main concern is Jadeja's form, he has not scored anything big in the matches he has played. India does need him for the lower orders whenever the middle order collapses.",

The Indian team led by Rituraj Gaikwad has won another GOLD MEDAL for India. I too was expecting an Indian vs Pakistan match, which eventually did not happen. Considering the players of Pakistan who are playing in PSL and other premier leagues. India won the gold medal after the match was abandoned due to the rain and India had a good overall run rate plus points in this game. The silver medal went to Afghanistan and the bronze went to Bangladesh. Pakistan did not win due to DLS while playing against Bangladesh today.",
