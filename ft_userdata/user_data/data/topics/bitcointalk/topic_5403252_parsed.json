  "content": "They say west is about to go to war with russia....but here is tge reason why its not truth.In order to start war banks must lower rates no rate hikes scenario its impossible to go to in the war.If the rates going up and they continue to shrink liquity then no war anytime soon.So once we hear different story then we can expecting the war.But its not possible to go from qt to qe instant becouse the qt need to take some time to get the elite safe to sell their assets slowly so tgey can sell to retail with highest possible price so qt takes some time but war is qe situation it means no money orinting prbrrrrr...then no war",

If Russia and the US go to REAL war, crypto won't mean squat. A mere Executive Order declaring war, by Biden, could put the whole money system on hold until after the war. By then circumstances will have changed enough that there might not be any problems to bank about. Of course, common folks will never know how things were changed beyond QT and QE.",
