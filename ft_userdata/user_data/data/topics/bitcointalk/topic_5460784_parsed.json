  "content": "My fellow country people, it took me time to gather the courage to post this here and my motive is to encourage us to help in our own little ways in creating awareness and support... just maybe we can fight this without waiting for government alone. Anytime them mentioned out of school children, people mind dey easily go to Northern Nigeria but e go shock you to know say the reality for Southern Nigeria dey troubling as out of school children is a threat in Southern Nigeria as much as it is in Northern Nigeria.According to UNESCO report of 2022, over 20 million Nigerian children are out of school. But from my findings and recent happenings, the number is far more than this. UNESCO will use poverty, insecurity and other parameters to do their statistics. Unfortunately, their is a new trend that is taking children, especially those between the ages of 14 to 18,  out of school which no one is paying attention to.  This is call quest for money and easy life. We all are aware of the Word \" education is a scam\". Indeed, this word is eating deep into our youths and the reality of our country is substantiating their claim. I did a random sampling in Port Harcourt few weeks ago, I was shocked to see the number of young boys including girls who willingly stopped going to school and decided to focus on learning how to \"press\", socialize and blend. The thing be say, depending on your approach, they are not hiding it... they willingly give you the info with pride. This G-boys something and runs now make education look like a long distance quest. How did we get here? Who is to blame for this? What will be the future of our country where education is not a priority? How do we tackle this because where there is a disconnect in learning something good for humanity,  the knowledge for the wrong will surely increase and this will put all of us at risk. Make we reason on ways we can help as we cannot leave everything for government.NB: I don search this board for this kind of topic but I no see any. In case person been don post am, abeg make una pardon me and draw my attention to it.",

      "body": "There's more to what's happening now because of the current trends nowadays, people hardly devote time to look into school why because they want an easy life without waiting for their appointed time to come. Just like I said, laziness has eaten us up because we think and thought school is a waste of time well there's no way school is waste of time because education plays a vital and a viral role in our lives today but thoss who doesn't have that dream of making it through education can never believe something good could come out from education due to our educational sector today.Why because it's anathema to see our educational system today were a student would graduate without at least having to sorts their course this a lone has destroyed and discouraged most of them not to put effort in reading, whereby they felt after all every they would still end up having to sort those courses in other to make the required grade the wanted. This is not common with the white because I believe they had a solid foundation for education and it can never be compromised just as our system and aside from that our government never placed value on her citizens this is another major weak points that is gradually sinking us down, if they play their roles and places value to their students possible adopted the educational system of the foreigners I believe no one would called school to be scam because they will be working as well earning and I don't think any one of us would had this mentality to leave our country to another country in search of a greener pastures.While we had a better country, a better society and a better Nation where things are made possible for us but those who felt they are the owners of our nation held us captive and that is not even enough, they kept circulating power among themselves if at all this nation were set to be a nation governed and ruled by gerontocracy where no one breaths or even haven to speak their minds and they always believed what they said is the best. How do we grow and how would her youths have this energetic power to develop love and passion for education since their leaders has already compromised the entire system?",

In a case of someone dropping out of school due to no finance or no assess to a good school then I would be concern and would support this movement, but a case of a student who decided to drop out of school because they have other interests then I think their decision and what ever outcome they get from that it's entirely theirs.We all know that the government has failed up but this statement won't stand in anyone's favor when they are being arranged for any crime, I think the society and social media has glorified the wrong things infact the is becoming the high cause of drop out than finances, because there are now so much free or low fees schools but the search to attain that status that has been so glorified has caused many to chase the wrong things",

When you look at the lives and achievement of those who are graduate in Nigeria, you will be so discouraged because majority of the graduates succeeded from their personal effort not that the system made it possible that when you graduate, there is a place for you. On the other hand, many employed graduates are under employed and this practically make them live from hand to mouth. So, the younger once seeing this would rather opt for other options rather than aspire to be like their educated brothers wey nothin come out. But in all, education is not really that bad as it forms the foundation upon which every other thing is built. We should still encourage our brothers and systems to at least get the basic education before venturing into any other thing they consider interesting to them.",

I won't go with your line of thoughts because education transcends beyond the Western curriculum and pattern of learning and getting certificating because a child that is properly trained from home will know the differences between education and knowledge just like the difference between Bitcoin/cryptocurrency and Ponzi scheme, while they're both misunderstood but those that pay close attention have the benefits of experiencing the reality of the difference between the two,Education is a scam to only those who are not educated because going to school alone is not what makes you educated, but allowing the school to pass through you, also makes you what you become in life, there have been arising in social vices in society right now and the greed in young people have also increased significantly and that have had a bad impact in creative thinking in youths, there have succeeded in pushing illegality to cover the legality lately, I had a case of an 18 years old who was involved in cryptocurrencies scam, all this is what makes the society to have a negative mindset towards cryptocurrency because of the bad event created around cryptocurrency by some lazy elements in the society.",
