Or in other words, the best solution if you are in an area active in earthquakes and tsunamis.Redundancy and off site storage.A stainless steel metal plate of sufficient thickness will likely survive an earthquake or a building collapsing on it without significant damage. Jameson Lopp has tested many such devices under a 20 ton hydraulic press, and devices which are simply steel plates hold up very well under such conditions (any device with moving parts such as tiles, not so much). You can see the results of such stress tests here: https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/. However, having your metal plate survive is not much use to you if it is buried under several tons of rubble and you will never find it again. Similarly if you are in a tsunami region, your metal plate will survive just fine, but is no use to you if it is buried under rubble a kilometer away from where you stored it and you will never see it again.So you need redundancy. This means more than one back up, so if one back up is lost you have others you can rely on. And these other back ups need to be geographical separate, so if a natural disaster affects your city/town/village you have a back up in a different city/town/village which is unaffected.",

Does it bear the violent shocks?What are the solutions, in your opinion, if an earthquake occurs? Or in other words, the best solution if you are in an area active in earthquakes and tsunamis.- YamaneIf there is a seismic hazard in your area, then along with waterproof and fireproof, you should think about protecting seed phrases from earthquakes. In my opinion, the most dangerous elements here are building structures, such as various heavy objects, such as concrete walls and metal elements. When crushed and dropped by their own weight, these parts can damage the metal crypto storage and make the information unreadable.How can this be prevented? I think it will be necessary to use thicker metal plates, or even better, several at once, like a sandwich. That is, the main plate with text on both sides is covered by 2 other plates that take all the damage to protect the main plate from deformations and damaged text. The multi-plate construction will have greater rigidity and will not bend like a thin piece of metal.https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/reviews/cryo/ - something like this, but I would replace the threaded bolts with hard-fixing rivets (as a bonus, it will be immediately noticeable if someone opened your vault) so that the threads would not be torn off and the plates would not separate from the impact.It is better to have an extra margin of safety than later to have difficulties with the readability of the seed-phrase during restoration.Let's say you manage to make the storage strong and reliable, but another question arises. Will it be possible to find your seed-phrase under a bunch of rubble and will you be the one who found it?",

Having a backup of your seed phrase somewhere else is the only way to counter this event. I personally leave my backup private key on my grandma house in the province and the pther one stays with me. My grandma didn’t know what it used for same with their neighborhood. I feel safe when I have backup somewhere else instead of doing all in.",

The only way would be to remove your seed from a earth quake prone zone. On the first point, I disagree with you. A 1000 ton building doesn't purposefully fall with its entire mass onto your seed-phrase plate, so the force applied to the plate will be less. This is due to the fact that the building, when falling on its way, will encounter obstacles in the form of walls and floor slabs, which will extinguish and take on the load. I assume that even in such a building the plate with seed-phrases will not be badly damaged and keep the text readable. Again, the random factor plays a big role here.On the second and third points here I completely agree with you. In the ruins and rubble, it will be unrealistic to find a small piece of the plate (if you are allowed to do this), which will most likely end up in a landfill and be lost to you. In the worst case, someone else will find the seed-phrase and no one will like this outcome.Therefore, the best solution, as you said, is not to store the seed-phrase in earthquake-prone regions, because, as discussed above, there will be no sense, even using a reliable storage method.",

It doesn't have to be the only copy of your seed phrase - obviously you can keep one close by which is convenient to access should you need to - but any back up which is safe from catastrophes in your local area will by necessity be inconvenient for you to access.Quote from: Macadonian on February 19, 2023, 01:44:59 PMIf a 1000 tonne building falls on your seed no thick metal is going to prevent it from getting damaged it would be damaged beyond repair.Good quality stainless steel of a reasonable thickness would survive just fine, especially something 2\" thick as you suggest.If a 1000 ton building collapses, then that full 1000 tons will be spread out over the entire area that the building collapses on to, which will be the footprint of the building plus more, since the rubble will fall in all directions. An average steel plate is maybe around 10 square inches, a tiny fraction of the total footprint. And as I said above, Lopp's stress testing shows that such devices can easily withstand 20 tons of pressure. To have 20 tons of pressure on 10 square inches, you would need all 1000 tons of the building to collapse on to an area less than 2 foot by 2 foot, which is obviously crazy.",

I suppose you could engineer a device encased in stainless steel with just a very small antenna reaching the outside of the device, but you are now adding a lot of cost. You would need to access your back up semi regularly in order to recharge or replace the battery, which increases the risk of it being discovered. And then of course anything which can broadcast a signal can have that signal intercepted or detected by malicious attackers. The last thing I want on my back ups is any kind of wireless connectivity which could be used by an attacker to locate them.Better to simply have at least two back ups stored geographically separately.",
