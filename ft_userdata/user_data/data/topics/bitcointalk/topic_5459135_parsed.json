  "content": "Good day everyone, let's talk about the factors in our Trading decision in terms of psychology. There are many things that affect our decision-making, and that's why sometimes we don't know why we make that decision. Sometimes we are repeating the same mistake over and over. Let's find out the common triggers that happen in our brain that make our judgment poor in trading.* Emotions in tradingOur emotions are part of our human behavior and it has a profound impact on our trading decisions. In the context of trading, the two primary emotions that affect our decision-making are \"FEAR and GREED\" Fear is a powerful emotion that will push us to think twice about entering and exiting the trade. Sometimes because of our fear of the trade, we exit immediately even though we know that it is too early to do so. And when fear dominates we become overly cautious, which also causes us to miss the opportunity for profitable trade even though we have seen the high probability set-up we should enter a trade but we don't because of fear.It's the same when we enter a trade, we immediately exit because our immediate thought is that we might still lose. This is also due to fear, Now if we are Greedy it also has an effect on our decision-making. Because this will push us to take excessive risk because we want a higher return. So, because of greed, we will increase the leverage that the position size is too big, the type that can only gain a lot, we will trade 100% capital in just one trade. It will also cause impulsive action, and we will also be tempted into speculative trades without proper risk management.* Emotional IntelligenceThis is the way for us to recognize the emotional estate, and how it influences our decision-making. Our traders have different techniques to cultivate emotional intelligence and maintain emotional balance during trading. One of these is \"Mindfulness meditation\" a type of technique that can help people to observe thoughts and emotions without judgment so that rational decision-making can return. And another effective method is \"Journaling\" Here, traders can track the decisions they made in the past, and they can reflect on their emotions.This is where they can identify the triggers of why they decided to enter the trade so that the same mistakes will not happen again. Because a trader gains insight into his emotional response and can develop the right strategy to manage them effectively.* Social SupportThis is to manage emotions in trading, we need to have an engagement with the community of traders so we can also ask for guidance and other advice from a mentor who can provide emotional support. Because if we have interaction with like-minded individuals who understand the life aspect of the psychological aspect of trading it will help for valuable insight to manage emotions effectively.Cognitive BiasesThis is an inherent aspect of human behavior, a systematic pattern that affects our decision-making. This is how our brain processes information, it is not an intentional or deliberate action, and this is the result of our brain simplifying complex information.Because we are only human, we are prone to these cognitive biases, because our brain naturally searches efficiently for easy or mental shortcuts, and because of that, our decision-making does not become rational when we make mistakes. And one of the good examples here is theConfirmation Biasthis is the time we look for information to confirm our beliefs or opinion. And we ignore the contradicting evidence or in other words we prepare more that will support our belief. And the good sample here is if when a trader is bearish or perma bear his belief in the market will still fall in the price in a certain area.Let's assume Bitcoin(BTC) will fall to 3k$ or 12k$ so due to confirmation bias he will look for information such as articles, or expert opinions that will strengthen his belief that the value of BTC will fall further. He will ignore the contradicting information he sees. And the only thing he will pay attention to is aligning with his existing belief. So what will happen is that he can miss the alternatives that are view coins or the crucial data that could impact decision-making. And I see many traders like this who do not know that they are victims of their own personal bias or never understand the role of cognitive bias.Loss aversionI'll admit I'm guilty here, maybe almost all traders are. This is the time when the impact of negative losses is stronger than the positive impact associated with gains. It means that the pain we feel from losing is more intense than the joy of experiencing profit. So this bias has a negative impact on our decision, when a trader experiences losing trades, the fear and discomfort he will feel will cause him to be reluctant, and exit the trade.It can also happen that you don't put a stop to loss or are in a position to just let it go and risk something like that even though there is evidence that it will happen. And this loss aversion behavior that avoids losing leads to worse losses in the end. Because if you don't cut your losses, you'll just miss out on other opportunities.Overconfidence BiasThis means that if a trader experiences consecutive wins, they become like this. Because of this opportunity, we can increase our confidence that we are doing the right thing. But this is also the time when we take excessive risks because we believe too much in ourselves that we already know a lot. And we think that we have special skills in trading, and the result of this is that our position side is too high that every trade we will get a profit that can lead to excess and come over-trading. But the truth is that this bias is dangerous because we will neglect risk management. Because it will blind us to the real market reality. And potential warning signs can't be seen first to adjust if necessary.And in order for us to manage these biases, we need to prioritize self-awareness, and consciously challenge biases. Because if we know these biases we can make a method and rational in our decision making.Reference: https://capital.com/emotions-in-trading               https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-emotional-intelligence-2795423               https://www.verywellmind.com/cognitive-biases-distort-thinking-2794763",

Your emotion ruined your trade position even you already plan everything before you open a trade.Agree with this as it has happened to me many times Managing emotions in trading is not easy and requires sufficient experience and practice so that we don't falter when there is negative news so we can continue with our plans. We do not close the trade immediately because we think the price could go up a little more to reach our target. If we do the math, it is clear that we will get several times the profit from the purchase price.Greed often comes when we have succeeded in seeing the profit coming and delaying closing the trade. We often forget that market conditions can change immediately, especially after reaching their highest price, which makes us postpone it for a while.And I think the emotional factor that influences us the most in trading is because we want to make a profit, but after being profitable, we even want bigger profits. It is greed and it has become an influence for most traders.",

You need to analyse the risk, estimate the outcomes and predict the direction before investing in any coin.

I have some of my experiences which is very common among the Investor and they are also victim of it. I was used to buy Bitcoin when it gains velocity to upward but I was in FOMO almost every time. When market pumps suddenly I rushed to make my position. But the perfect time to invest is when the price is at the bottom. I made this faults again and again and lost a big amount from my assets. When it's about news related price drop, I will say it's a good habit to observe crypto news because we may remember what happened when Luna crashed. Some of us bought after the bad news arrival and they lost entire funds. But most of the time News manipulate prices a little. So we must have trust our trading strategy and should implement properly our decisions to get the best result in trading and not to lose our trades by being confused like a fool.",

Without knowledge, you will be very uncertain with any word you get from media and your emotion will like a roller coaster, up and down with very big margins.I recommend newbie traders to not trade but if they seriously want to trade, learn to increase their knowledge first.

What you plan may sometimes be forgotten and create a new plan that is not yet sure if it will work or not. That’s why traders are discouraged from being carried away by their emotions because trading itself is a battle of emotions. In the end, you’ll only compromise your trades over your emotions and end up in losing position.

If a trader trades against the market trend and buys shitcoin emotionally, he will end up with huge losses. So there are many things to keep in mind while trading so that you don't regret later. I have personally experienced many expected trades ended unexpectedly and I just sat and watched and had nothing to do.

They're not the only emotional variables in trading decisions. Regret and envy also matter. Your emotional intelligence explanation is interesting, however it tends to emphasize emotion control more than emotion recognition and understanding. Mindfulness and writing may be overly hopeful for emotional management. Cognitive restructuring or social sharing may help traders. Trading psychology should investigate social support and cognitive biases. Anchoring bias and hindsight bias may also affect trading decisions",
