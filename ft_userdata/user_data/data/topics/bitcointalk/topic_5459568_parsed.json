I know that even if this happens it may not affect bitcoin or its price but then having crypto ATMS goes a long way in contributing to both visibility and how accessible bitcoin is although I know that their absence do not affect bitcoins value.

But still they are shutting down BTC ATMs doesn't make sense. Or maybe these ATMs were used for money laundering or anything illegal that's why they are making some bold moves.AFAIK the number of ATMs are around 26.

People are not interested in the direction ethically or morally it is wrong or right they just need the results and until the results are in their favor they don't give a shit about how is it affecting the community.Well, I think governments can be our good buddies if they really want to because the system we believe can bring transparency if they really want transparency they can be our best buddies but seems like they just hate this terminology whether it's a developed country or under development country.

Those who are operating the illegal Bitcoin ATM are giving a bad name to their company and not to Bitcoin; in fact,  the entire Tech company, if they are found guilty of any illegal activities, will be remembered for that and their reputation will be ruined, but it won't change anything for Bitcoin. The only thing that I see as negative here is that those Bitcoin ATMs being removed might make it a little difficult for those who only know how to fund their wallets using those ATM machines. But my question here is: how will an ATM be mounted in a city without the knowledge of any single regulatory body? To some point, I believe they might be illegal, but they are not completely unlicensed, for there is no way such an operation, which is worth thousands of dollars, will take place with even the local or state regulatory authorities not giving permission to that company.",

I don't think they made bitcoin a bad name, it was the company that installed the bitcoin atm that made bitcoin a bad name. The actions taken by the government are correct, it must be firm against illegal practices so that legal businesses can develop properly.If the government allows illegal practices then this will give bitcoin a bad name, because people will think that bitcoin is always associated with illegal actions. It's time for bitcoin to follow the existing rules so that many people believe in bitcoin. Although maybe many people don't like it when the government interferes in bitcoin, when it's like that, bitcoin will always be considered negatively by people who don't know about bitcoin.But in legal companies, will transactions that occur at bitcoin ATMs be reported to government financial authorities?",

I also don't believe that none of these Bitcoin ATM operators managed to legally license them; there's no way in hell that they simply woke up one day and decided to install them in a specific location. The FCA is likely to have declined their registration and resorted to the extreme measure of operating them without a proper license. On the one hand, I understand why governments don't want Bitcoin ATMs because they open a loophole to avoid taxation, but on the other hand, this common misconception that cryptocurrencies are only to be used for money laundering and illegal activities needs to stop.",

But the law that mandates crypto businesses to register with the Financial Service Register (FCA) for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing started in January 2020. Meanwhile, the first Bitcoin ATM was installed in the UK in 2014. Most of these ATMs are legally registered before this law came into existence. I don't think it is right to call these ATMs unregistered meanwhile their blunder is that they have not complied with FCA registration. I am in no way supporting them for not registering with FCA but my point is that the UK government is overhyping the situation on the ground. It is looking as if some criminals installed ATMs to defraud people. I didn't read the process for registration with FCA but I assume that the process will not be an easy one.",
