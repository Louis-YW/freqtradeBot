Bitcoin created the road where other cryptocurrencies are passing and building all sorts of programs upon.Can't it be destroyed? I will not believe this, it can't be destroyed. I have some considerations.1) Government: No power of supremacy can be abused here. The government doesn't have power over it because it is not controlled by any central authority. The selflessness of Satoshi Nakamoto made sure of this by not giving room for manipulations.2) Hacking: Getting to know of many hacking stories of the past about bitcoin was confusing, but none is about the direct bitcoin network but websites and wallets housing it. Most of the websites hacked are custodial, I don't like them.Not that it is completely impossible to hack the bitcoin network but the needed condition to do so seems impossible to meet. For the proof of work blockchain (PoW) like it, it will take the hacker a very high computing power to take half of the blockchains network before manipulation will be possible. No person or group of person and government can get to the arrangement because this computing power is widely spread.3) Future: Bitcoin future keeps shining brighter, it came into the lead like a play, it will continue to grow in adoption. Considering the regulation, government will try more and will want to use alts against it but the truth and uncompromising decentralization of the cryptocurrency will speak for it and make it win.It will get to a time in the future when bitcoin will be the only cryptocurrency the world can trust.Reference: https://worldcoin.org/articles/can-cryptocurrency-be-hacked",

But it is not yet the main technology of IT-banking, and it has some vulnerabilities. First, the decentralised operations with so large amount of data inevitably leads to forking-type failures. Then there is a problem with psychological acceptance: even notable currencies (BTC, ETH) are still not considered as \"money\" by ALL people. In the vision of all people cryptocurrencies are either \"a project which is to be launched full scale in a couple of centuries, and I want to be rich now, so l'm just gonna earn some fiat by trading crypto, since I like lifestyle which large sums of fiat bring\", or \"some thing that IT staff develops, I'm not interested, my business is not connected with it\". Third, it can bring decentralisation of mining sites, or even it can have no mining at all, but it can't bring decentralisation of money distribution, and worldwide money distribution is the worst thing in economy now.",

However, it is designed to be decentralized and distributed, which means that it is not controlled by any central authority or institution. This makes it difficult for any individual or group to destroy Bitcoin. Additionally, the underlying technology of Bitcoin, known as blockchain, is highly secure and resistant to tampering or hacking attempts. However, there are still risks associated with investing in Bitcoin, such as market volatility, regulatory changes, and security breaches. It is important to do your research and understand the risks involved before investing in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency",

Seeing as how you reasoned it out, I reckon it's not something like \"delete\" destroy since only the internet shutting down would make that happen, but rather something along the lines of its adoption/usage I guess? In essence, the government can limit involvement with crypto, but it can't stop it permanently, temporarily maybe, but there'd always be people who can make a work around if they were actually able to. Hacking in some sense is just your wallet being stolen because you gave it out to someone else, in most cases if you were able to store crypto properly, the chances of it being stolen is rather minimal. As for it's future, well, I think this past decade has shown what it can bring and what it can still possibly bring.",

True, Bitcoin has proven to be a durable and resilient asset, claims that Bitcoin is indestructible are probably too strong. now Bitcoin faces challenges and vulnerabilities, but its strength makes it a popular investment choice for many.

But it's my view that most of the stories we hear about Bitcoin being hacked are not about the live Bitcoin network but the websites and wallets that host them. As the OP mentioned \"Most of the websites hacked are custodial, I don't like them''. why is that because entrusting one's Bitcoin to a third party, makes them vulnerable to attack. On the other hand I think the Bitcoin network itself is very secure, thanks to the blockchain Its Proof of Work It takes an enormous amount of computing power to manipulate a network, making it virtually impossible for any single person or group to carry out such an attack.",

The blockchain is connected by many computers, and they are keeping a copy of every transaction happening with Bitcoin. If the computers continue to run the computing, the blockchain will exist. That means if we can somehow create a scenario where half of the computing power is offline, then the blockchain will face a major disrupt. The government supply the electricity and has the power to seize any facility if they want. So if they choose not to provide enough energy and also put a ban on Bitcoin to seize personal properties in order to stop those running computers. Then most likely it is possible. But I don't know if this means \"destroy\".Also, natural disaster in where the whole world will be cut off from any electricity could do the same. It is unlikely. But the possibility is never zero.",

Even though the current regulatory landscape is relatively favorable for Bitcoin, there is always the possibility that governments may enact stricter regulations in the future which could negatively impact its adoption and value. Therefore I think it is important here to monitor regulatory developments and adjust one's investment strategy and while it is true that Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience thus far, it is important to remember that no investment is without risk it is necessary to carefully evaluate your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and overall portfolio diversification strategy when considering investing in Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. other cryptocurrencies.",
