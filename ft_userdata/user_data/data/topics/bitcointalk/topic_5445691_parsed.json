  "content": "Hi there, back in 2017 or 2018 I bought a ledger nano to put bitcoin. I did an installation with electrum and haven't touched anything since. Never updated electrum and never updated ledger (no ledger live etc). Never got back online with wallet and never put ledger in pc. In short a true and pure hodl.Recently though, the pc where I installed electrum is quite unusable, I wanted to figure out how to install on a new pc to transfer also something left in exchange.Clearly I have the seed/pin and access to the ledger, is it necessary to have the deviation path? does anyone know an easy guide to install?I tried a quick search but couldn't find it, although I guess it's a trivial and boring topic, sorry. thanksb.",

It's generally always better to use an up-to-date software than an outdated one. New versions include better stability, performance updates, bug & vulnerability fixes, new and improved features, etc.When it comes to Ledger HWs, there are 3 things that can be updated.The native Ledger Live appThe Bitcoin coin appThe firmware of the deviceIf you wait too long, you might reach a point where you wont be able to use your Nano to update it to the latest firmware. Question is, will the old ones still be useful? To avoid potential trouble, update it. Update the BTC on-Ledger coin app as well. I am not sure if you need the newest Ledger Live versions before being offered a firmware upgrade. I never tested it.Quote from: balladofjpeg on March 20, 2023, 11:40:43 PMis there anything that can go wrong with the procedure? Worst case scenario, you brick the device and it breaks, becoming useless. Happens rarely. A more common issue (happened only once to me) is that the device wipes its memory clean after the upgrade. No need to worry if that happens. Just recover your accounts from seed and you are good to go.

You should immediately use the above or the last version. It's worth mentioning that those older Electrum versions can no longer connect to Electrum servers so they can't get the phishing messages that point unsuspecting users to fake phishing sites anymore.",

I see no point in that to be honest. Your backup is the paper where your seed is written down. You can have 10 different recovery phrases and only one device, and it would work. It would be a pain in the ass to keep resetting them to input a different backup, but it works. Replacing the Nano S would only be necessary if you have those old firmware versions that Lucius mentioned in his post.Quote from: dkbit98 on March 22, 2023, 05:28:31 PMLedger nano S is not manufactured anymore and it is probably going to be unusable soon, since ledger is slowly increasing size of their apps all the time.

I have never used any of those Bitcoin-dependent apps on my Ledger, so I don't know what size they were in the past. I think they should be pretty small though, like a few kbs only because they take most of the code from the Bitcoin app. Looking at the app sizes for BCH or DOGE right now, I can see they are 36 kb. Seems pretty big. So I guess that information you got was correct. Still, I have never seen any logic complaining about the size of an app or a wallet and the data that comes with it. Do these people expect new features and improvements and at the same time decreasing the app sizes? Doesn't really work.

Yeah, that's possible. You can do that by accessing the manager, called My Ledger in Ledger Live. It shows you the apps you have installed, the versions, and app sizes. If there is an update, you can see the new version number and new size after installation.",

I can only speak about the devices I have or which I have used for a while, not about what I don't have or know. Trezors function in a different way. You don't install individual crypto apps on them like you do on a Ledger, so it isn't comparable. You enable and disable support for assets through the Trezor Suite.Quote from: dkbit98 on March 31, 2023, 02:05:30 PMThere is no improvements in shitcoin blockchains, I don't think Doge was ever seriously updated for years, and same thing for bch, so nothing changed.There is literally zero new features with this bigger size apps... Again, I can't comment on things I don't know about. What changed with the apps is something you can check personally if you know how to. Ledger's crypto apps are open-source, and many of them are created by the devs of the various crypto projects, not Ledger and their team. I don't have the knowledge to read and understand code and I don't think you have either. Such assessment are better left to those who know. Best case scenario: get someone to do it for you, and prove that they are maliciously inflating the app sizes if you can.  Quote from: dkbit98 on March 31, 2023, 02:05:30 PM...it's just one more way to force people to switch from model s to other newer models.
