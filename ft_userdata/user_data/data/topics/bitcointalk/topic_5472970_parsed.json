I have heard that the t-roll word comes from rick-rolling, whatever that means (Rick is rolling while stoned?)Just a quick tip from Master RickRoller here in BitcoinTalk. If you want to Rickroll more effectively here in BitcoinTalk use the YouTube shorts video of NGGYU instead of the official MV link of NGGYU. YouTube shorts video plays right away, while the MV link might show an ad‚Äîunless the person has YouTube Premium. I hope you get my point here.‚úåÔ∏è",

Nobody in the forum knows anything about you therefore why do you expect you will receive a loan?Just out of curiosity, what would have been the harm if you had used the word \"because\" of \"cuz\"? At least that would have displayed you were somewhat articulate.",
