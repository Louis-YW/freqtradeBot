There is no such government to help you fight against the use of AI on the forum. It is we users that can collectively pick out those who auto generate generic posts and spam around the forum.There is no specific rule against the use of AI, it has been so long since a new rule was included in the forum, but there is a rule against spamming and users who rely on bot posts are usually account farmers, spamming on multiple accounts.If you find any generic looking post, which does not offer any human thought but beats around generalities, you may likely have reached an AI post.",

What @lovesmayfamilis wrote is not that difficult to understand. It's simple and well punctuated. Let me help you to explain it further using lay man language. It means that users using AI to post in the forum are currently being tag by DT if found. The tags now serves as a warning to campaign managers that such users are using AI to generate their posts and should not be given chance in their campaigns. Not that the managers receive the tag on behalf of the users using AI. I hope you understand now.Presently, there's no official rule against the use of AI but the entire Forum frown at it which is a sign that it should not be tolerated. The reason why you are been given brain is to think and offer solution. The AI is another person's ability to think and he brought the idea. Why not use your brain (referring to people using AI) to think of something else too? AI post can be easily identify with the language structure and grammar usage.",
