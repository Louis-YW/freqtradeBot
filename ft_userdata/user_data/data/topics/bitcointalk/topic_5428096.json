  "content": "I've been trying for days to withdraw my dogecoins without success from Mercatox, detail, this problem comes from last year with the covid. I waited for them to resolve it until today, however, until today the problem has not been resolved. I suggested paying for them to solve it, since then, they have already sent me to the technical department and higher, but so far they have not solved the problem..  Sad I suggested that they send or exchange my dogecoins at market price, BTC 0.5 and pay for the losses I had sending money in the wallet, however they claim that the problem with doge will be solved soon, even though it's been more than a year since the problem.. Angry I also suggested that they give me BTC 0.5 worth of doge at market price, also paying for my losses, as I had the money, the guy said that I should sell the doge on the website, however the exchange option is blocked, there is no way exchange at market price.I noticed contradictory things on the site, you can enter dogecoins on it, but you cannot withdraw or send to other users of the site. What is wrong because you make users enter the doge and never leave because there is no way to leave. The right thing is to block the entrance, I even want pressure on that, as it is clearly an act of bad faith. HuhToday, they claimed they are almost fixing the problem, but I wouldn't say that, because the site said it would fix it soon and it's been a long time for that to be true, there are only 2 active doge users on their site, we share the same problem.I also noticed an increase in coins that are under maintenance, the week before it was 60, now it is 64 coins.Site: https://mercatox.com/Amount Scammed, Payment Method and Proof of Payment and messages: https://i.imgur.com/ogvUtGF.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/JYZksRr.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/spMOYyk.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/nGSYzcq.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/K7isvj8.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/vvKsCQq.png[solved]After reporting mercatox on reddit, github, twitter, facebook, google, police station, coinmarketcap, etc from the 6th to the 26th of December, my issue was resolved.Note that I had to report it in all media to get a response at the height. They haven't fixed the doge transfer yet, it might even be true that they are fixing it.I will not stop looking at people trapped in mercatox who were not the fight for what is theirs as I was, there are thousands of dollars stopped in mercatox with the deposit available.The solution to the problem was strange. Hanna made an appointment with me so that on the 27th at 4 pm I would be online for her to make the transfer. At no time was the doge available for withdrawal, and yes it was done by them.I also cannot help noticing that many messages I received from support were lies (as it seems to me), as there was no response from any department, not finance, authority or superior. Who appears there in the comment is a normal attendant. That is, does mercatox not have weak employees? I noticed this because Josh and Hanna were the ones who solved it, Murry seemed to try and the others didn't even care and sent automatic messages.Reading what people say about mercatox, those who criticize say that they are taking advantage of people, keeping their money there without the right to withdraw. Those who defend her say she is very lazy.Putting these two analyzes together, you deduce that you will only get what you want with this exchange if you react to its delay in some way, in chat, by email, or by reporting it. I also noticed that by email the solution was better than by chat.My recommendation is not to put doge in mercatox until everything is resolved (they don't want to take the deposit). I thank the members of the bitcointalk forum who tried to help me in their own way, in the end I don't believe that your action really reached mercatox, but I thank you for your good intentions. As well as those who shared and reported mercatox with me on twitter and reddit.",

However, waiting for a year is simply too much (even a month is!), it's safe to say that your case isn't being prioritized and it shows their reluctance to release your money.I guess you're probably already making rounds on crypto communities about this, no? I can only suggest subtly dropping that you're exploring your legal options with other users.",

This site is clearly a scam. But he scams in a way that if you report it, BAN supporters appear saying he's not a scam. That is, for some they do the normal transactions and for others they steal, until they are all robbed! For me they just wait until as many people come to steal them.",

Asking them to pay with another coin feels a bit inconvenient.I already did that, I demanded a position from the financial department. I said I would accept 0.5 btc on the 11th which was the market value of doge. The guy told me to sell on the website, however that is not possible, as selling at market value is blocked. I informed the impossibility and he informed me to wait for the maintenance..He said he would pay 10X the fee of 50 doge and they denied it, he said he would pay 100X the fee amount and they denied it ..
