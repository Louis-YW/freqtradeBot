But last year I try to play again on Livecasino.io Rise of Olympus and manage to win x500 multiplier multiple times on this game. This experience makes me interested more on playing slots and I become addicted on on playing more on different slot games with same provider.I visit Play’n Go website and I’m surprised that they are releasing multiple new slots per month and the thing that amazed me was the time I discover Rise of Olympus was it’s just new release(which I’m not aware that time). After that I keep playing new release slot game with this same provider hoping to experience again the luck I made before. So far I have a good result on doing this instead of sticking on same slot games especially the old one.What’s your favorite Play’n Go games and what’s the highest multiplier you get on playing their slot games?

      "body": "I can tell you that Play'n Go is a well-known provider of online casino games, including slot machines, with a reputation for creating high-quality and engaging games. The high multiplier you achieved on Rise of Olympus is not uncommon for slot games, which frequently offer the possibility of large payouts and exciting gameplay experiences.However, it should be noted that the outcome of slot games is determined by random chance and cannot be predicted. While you may have had a good time playing new Play'n Go slot games, it's important to remember to gamble responsibly and set limits for yourself.I played these games numerous times, but I never received a large multiplier.",

Canine Carnage: also a challenging slot where you can generate wild skull and number 10 with good results.But among all the slots you mentioned, the ones I like and enjoy betting the most are:3. Clash of Camelot.You can get your victory x5 to x100, dangerous electric shocks can bring you a lot of money, besides that the most extraordinary thing in Clash of Camelot slots, namely FREE SPINS, as I showed above, from my winning experience some time ago, you can choose the flag you want, to determine a big win for you.",

Luck-based indeed. There are lucky gamblers who can get it on a few spins while on the other hand, there are unfortunate and the worst, the bankroll will be depleted first and not get a chance to hit that feature.Quote from: swogerino on February 06, 2023, 07:53:25 PMMany people play Pragmatic and I also thought them to be better than Play n Go but I changed my mind and the reason is,if you play 40 dollars with a minimum amount bet like 0.10 it is a sure thing that you will get at least once the bonus round in Play n Go games,normally you will get it more than one time but as a bare minimum you will get it while by playing Pragmatic slot you can play much more than 40 dollars with minimum bet and still don't get the bonus game,meaning their volatility is much higher than Play n Go and as such Play n Go is better in this context.I understand why you end up on that observation but still, we can't really compare who's got the better chance rate to hit that bonus feature between Pragmatic Play and Play and Go. Anyways, since Pragmatic Play is not available in our region, I never experienced playing at their games so maybe I miss the fact that your observation might be true. My response is based generally on the chance of hitting the bonus feature on all game providers.(Apology to OP for not giving a direct response related to this topic. I was just about to open my Stake account and try to check my game history there involving playing in Play and Go. Not sure if I experienced winning a decent here since I'm playing at various game providers.)",

Maybe you need to play more Play'n Go games and playing more of it can also increase your chances of winning big prizes. That should be the time to get you addicted on them. But between Play'n Go and pragmatic, I also think that pragmatic is more popular.Maybe this provider is just good at making good games and the difficulty of the games that they are offering (in terms of winning) aren't also hard as the other gaming providers out there. You had a good feeling of the rise of merlin. That is because it has a good feedback and some users already said they win big on it.
