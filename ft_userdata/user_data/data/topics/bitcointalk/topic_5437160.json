They put these partnerships on their site to reassure investors that they are a legit exchange. It is good that they did not delete the reviews page on the CrownChange site. I have seen that 99% of the reviews written by their clients are negative. We must report to their domain registrar so that no beginner will fall victim to their hands.Most of the exchanges these days are like this, no team, no sufficient information, and no guarantees, it is a scam in a scam, so when trading or when depositing our funds, we must choose the exchange carefully so that our funds are not at any risk.",

Scammers are dumb too, who knew  They have been creating shill account and posting in their ANN thread too. I am going to tag all of themHere is another oneQuote from: yardus on February 02, 2023, 12:42:22 PMI really liked this exchanger, the speed and exchange rate are on top. Support adequate!

Now we have another confirmation that CrownChange is a scam.  Any service that uses sock puppet accounts to promote and vouch for its own product is most likely a scam. This is not just because it looks bad, but also because it makes the service appear untrustworthy. If you are looking for a way to make money online, I suggest that you find one that does not involve using scammy tactics like this.Nice find @JeromeTash! I supported the trust flag against @CrownChange.",
