Yes, deposit is for 'becoming the House'For example, if Person A deposited 1000 DAI and Person B deposited 9000 DAI.The entire House bank is 10,000 DAIIf someone bets 10 DAI and loses, hose wins.Now, Person A's deposit is 1001, Person B's deposit is 9009.If you are interested.. please check out! https://fantom.house",
