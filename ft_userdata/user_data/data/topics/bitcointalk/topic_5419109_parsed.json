Your funds are now at their mercy.I have a question, What are the advantages of purchasing Bitcoins from a BTC ATM over a p2p exchange?The only advantages of using a Btc ATM vs an exchange are exactly as Jollygood said, privacy. Other then that ATMs are a huge load of shit. Alomst a 25% markup on buying Btc from an ATM. Quite ridiculous on the fees. I recommend not using 1 unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket.",
