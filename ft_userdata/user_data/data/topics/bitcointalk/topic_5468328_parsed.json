  "content": "Hi guys,I am bringing this before you guys to please judge, your opinions or judgements will tell if I should remove the negative trust I gave Live Stars or keep it there, or change it to neutral..Back in 2018, there used to be this altcoin project called Live Stars, they promised to build a live streaming platform for adults only contents, the owners promoted the project on this forum and outside this forum, ran an ICO and raised alot of money (I was one of their investors).After raising millions of dollars, they managed to list the Live token on cryptopia(a crypto exchange that was hacked to death in January 2019), it was like the hack of cryptopia(the only exchange live token was trading on) gave the developers of the project(Live Stars) the opportunity to run away with all money they raised in the ICO, allowing the project to die a slow death..All this is cool with me, nothing to worry about since they are not the first, and neither will they be the last as long as people continue to give altcoins attention.. But here is the main reason why I am writing this... Recently, this account - Live Stars - which is the official account that managed Live Stars Ann Threads on this forum(in the global and local boards) woke up from a very long period of inactivity...And went straight to their Live Stars Ann Threads(global - both self moderated) and deleted everything, every single comment/posts was deleted from the threads this morning...So when I noticed the activity of this user, I suspected that this user (Live Stars) probably wants to return to the forum, but wants to first of clean up/hide his bad history, since by now, he or she believes that every one of us here must have forgotten and moved on - well, I moved on but I never forgot. So I suspect he or she doesn't want his past to come back haunting him or her, which is why he or she decided to delete every trace of this projects connection to his account, but how can't his past haunt him when they made away with investors hard earned money.. Who knows what next he or she is back to do, maybe launch a new project, or maybe he has squandered all the money and now wants to clean up his past so he can join a signature campaign.. Whatever it be, I decided to tag the account with a negative trust so that all be away.. Does he or she deserve the negative tag? Or do you think it's too harsh, that a natural tag would have been more appropriate? Please feel free to tell what you think, your opinion will determine if I leave the tag or delete it.",

It's shady of them to come delete their posts, but everything is saved ya know so they aren't really covering their steps like they think. Deleting posts alone is no reason to tag them, you strictly need to consider the previous question I asked when deciding to tag or not to tag.",

If you can prove that they indeed scammed people and its not just one of the many failed altcoins, then I think negative tag is deff warranted. From what I can see, in their last post (that is now deleted) in ANN thread they mentioned \"Parity multisignature wallet hack\" beside cryptopia. You think that that hack was actually an exit scam?QuoteDear community,Live Stars has been an ambitious project. Along the way, we encountered quite a few unfortunate events, including , dramatic cryptocurrency market value drop right after the token sale and several issues within the development team, which resulted in us finishing the project in cooperation with another team, as well as the Cryptopia hack and their eventual bankrupcy.Even though we succeeded in releasing a fully functional, stable product, we have no more funds for marketing campaign for the platform nor we have funds for new exchange listing which is required now that cryptopia announced their bankrupcy.Unfortunately, we are closing Live Stars project because there is no ways to continue developing in the current circumstances.We would like to thank each one of you for your support and cooperation.For any questions, you can reach us by e-mail: info@livestars.iohttps://ninjastic.space/topic/3256604",

This makes me believe they knew right from time that a day would or will come when they will have to delete everything to hide every trace, which is why they made the thread self moderated from the very beginning.Quote from: LoyceV on September 27, 2023, 04:53:50 PMIf you have to ask, you shouldn't hand out negative feedback. Yeah, you are right, and I sincerely apologize, I really should have asked before handing out that neg trust, it actually did not occur to me to me ask, I honestly do not like tagging other users if I am not 100 percent sure they deserve it, and here, I wasn't so sure even after having handed out the tag, which is why I decided that what will really put my mind at peace is; asking the community if what I did was right or wrong. Quote from: Rikafip on September 27, 2023, 04:54:06 PMIf they indeed ran away with investors money, how come no one created scam accusation thread, or even write anything in their thread all those years ago? Well, like I already said, they didnt like just ran away with investors money after ico, they hand around, listed the token on cryptopia, gave investors a reason to believe they were building, did sometime release a product which was absolutely unusable, long story short is that, I personally feel they purposely allowed the project to die slowly, so as to make investors believe it was or is one of those failed projects. Quote From what I can see, in their last post (that is now deleted) in ANN thread they mentioned \"Parity multisignature wallet hack\" beside cryptopia. You think that that hack was actually an exit scam?There is always a lot of cock and bull stories on every altcoin project that have decided to pull the rug on their investors, I will believe it was an exit scam as long as there is no proof.",

Respect your point of view, but it seems to me like you didn't completely read the op before putting up this comment, or maybe you didn't completely understand.. I said they ran an ICO, ico means initial coin offering, several projects do this to raise money in other well established coins like bitcoin, Ethereum, usdt, bnb etc.. To build the project. So by the above, you should understand that they already raised money by selling their tokens(live token) to investors who paid any of the establish coins for the token, now, if they already have BTC, Ethereum, USDT belonging to investors in their custody, then the cryptopia hack doesn't really affect them since they don't have to sell their token in the open market to raise money to fund the project.

What I read in this topic is not enough for feedback, at least not from my side. Before doing any business with this member, I would definitely consider your tag, as well as peloso's (although he is on my distrust list)",

Its another thing if they deleted posts in which they were accused of scam. Regarding deleting everything, my guess is that whoever is in control of the account might want to use it for signature campaign or even sell and they woulnd't be the first one trying to erase connections with shitcoin projects.

If anything, I think neutral would be the more appropriate feedback here. At least for now until you have more evidence.",
