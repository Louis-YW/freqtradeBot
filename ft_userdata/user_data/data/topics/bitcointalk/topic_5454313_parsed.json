Be able to display the clock and stash the dime. That's why I love the ones that have a dime over the pk/holo.",

I sure wish I could swing it. Glws I know it's a little OT, but anyone here involved in selling-goods also noticing a strong decline in sales? Seems to me this is not a crypto (collectible) specific occurrence. Spoke to a few vendors recently (from different countries, very different products), they were all complaining about a very noticeable/unusual drop in sales that started about 2 months ago.

I think in this case an open-dime or just pub-address version makes more sense.",
