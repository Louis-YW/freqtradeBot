And voters elected him knowing full-well that he is a convicted criminal, and they didn't care, which effectively makes Trump immune to prosecution.Years ago, I personally competed with companies in China as a US-based company. What you learn quickly there is that you cannot compete with the government because they control everything--and they will beat your company down and advantage their favored companies in subtle but unstoppable ways. This is going to be the new paradigm in the USA now as well, and competitors like CoinBase and Binance should beware, as well as basically any cryptocurrency that is not Trump's own currency.People in the crypto business should learn that the US is operating under a new paradigm now--which is exactly what Americans said they wanted, i.e. drastic changes to the US economy.In particular, companies--and cryptos--that will survive will be the ones best connected to Trump's regime. And companies and cryptos that anger the regime or get in their way as competitors will fall by the wayside, or even be eliminated altogether.It remains to be seen what companies and cryptos survive in this new paradigm, and which ones get punished, but understanding how your bet is connected to the Trump regime how you will make money in the coming years, just like understanding how your investment plays with the CPC is how you survive in China.What does this mean specifically? For me, the investments I am watching are: $DOGE, $DJT, $BKKT, $TSLA, $WLFI.There will be others, and obviously any of the items on that list will rise and fall based on their connect to Trump. For instance, Trump and Musk could have a falling out (Trump's has a history of turning on close associates), and then the Musk-related instruments will plunge.You need to adjust your thinking for this new paradigm: the actual business logic doesn't matter. Don't say, \"but Bakkt isn't as good as Coinbase\" or \"WLFI is a pure scam\" because it doesn't matter: anything with the full backing of the US government, no matter how crappy, is going to prevail, and even decimate it's competitors. Voters in the US have spoken, and they have voted for drastic changes to the US economy. Unlike last time, Trump and his people are well-prepared to deliver these changes, and unlike last time Trump has a strong political mandate now. Americans want change, and Trump is going to give it to them.",

I know as you said it is not as good and not a tier 1 exchange but what make this a more bullish news in compared to the regination of Gary Gensler. Telegram groups are full of the news that he tweeted that he will resign on 20th Jan. The day when Trump will be inaugurated Gary will leave and this news was too hyped that it will surely put a good effect on the BTC price. Now BTC can easily touch $100k because it's very bullish after this news now. War is getting more serious too so anything can happen till 20th January let's hope for the best.",

Trump's interest would be to replace everybody's investment in Bitcoin with $WFLI, and everybody's Coinbase/Binance/etc. account with Bakkt.And the polling is very clear: Trump could do all of this and still very popular. He doesn't need the votes of some people who failed to move from BTC to WFLI in order to gain majorities.Y'all aren't understanding the power of politics.

I can't find this exchange on Coinmarketcap and I have never heard about this from anyone on this forum, so I assume it's the least popular crypto exchange and it's strange why would someone want to buy it. Buying an unknown business doesn't seem a logical decision, I think it's better to build a new business instead of buying an unknown.Quote from: legiteum on November 21, 2024, 04:41:19 PMWhat you learn quickly there is that you cannot compete with the government because they control everything--and they will beat your company down and advantage their favored companies in subtle but unstoppable ways.Governments control everything but it's the main question who controls them. I believe that banks and companies like Vanguard and BlackRock have much power, control and influence than individuals who are in politics, i.e. I believe that governments are controlled by big organizations and companies. But I've got your point, you talk about China.By the way, I think that if Trump builds a crypto exchange, it will be one of the most successful one because of the trust that people will put into it. It's run by a President after all, it can't be scam, can it? I believe this is the approach that people have and that's why it will rapidly and significantly grow, especially when there is Elon Musk on his side, Elon's influence is huge on crypto, we saw how he pumped and dumped multiple coins.",

Yes the people has decided that the want change and they have voted in the man they think can give them that change. Also Trump open expression of friendliness towards crypto-currency has sparked the interest of some people towards Bitcoin. But still I don't see how his buying an exchange an important issue. Firstly if he is buying it then the exchange must be centralised and amongst the unique features of Bitcoin is it's decentralised nature.Let's stop getting too hyped by the Media. The media is a strong tool used to manipulate the market and it has its side effects. Trump is in power now let's see how he accomplishes some of his crypto related promises.",

He then defaults on the loans, gets sued resulting in the properties being awarded to the banks who find they are worth far less than advertised. With proceeds from his scheme he then buys more properties and repeats the whole thing over and over.I see him doing pretty much the same thing with Bakkt.",
