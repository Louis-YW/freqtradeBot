  "content": "Welcome to Zombehland, a post-apocolyptic world ravaged by a mysterious virus and overrun by these strangely grotesque creatures.OverviewZombehland is an idle game where every action you take is a gamble. It's a game about choices. It's about weighing the pros and cons of each action you take. It's about deciding whether you want to risk losing a little bit of everything, or a lot of one thing. There's no wrong answer, but there are consequences to everything you do. And managing those consequences is the key to success. In Zombehland, you start with a small base of operations, a small supply of food (brains, of course), and whatever crap your Zombeh managed to scavenge during the apocalypse. The goal is to survive as long as you can. The longer you manage to survive, the more resources you will earn, and the more resources you have, the better your chance of surviving. The last Zombeh standing wins.GameplayZombehland is an idle game. That means *technically* you don't have to do anything to play. You can just come back at the end of the season to see how you did (probably not very well). Or you can get your head in the game and play actively, making decisions and managing your resources like your (after)life depends on it. Because it does.Each season consists of 720 cycles. During each cycle, you will have the opportunity to make one decision that will affect your Zombeh's chances of survival. You can choose to do nothing, or you can choose to do one of four actions: hunt, scavenge, rest, or eat. Each action has a direct impact on your Zombeh's chances of survival.HuntHunting is the most dangerous of the four actions, and it involves directly attacking another player. It has the lowest chance of success, but it also has the highest positive impact if the odds are in your favor. If you choose to hunt, you will have a 25% chance of successfully hunting and earning 1-4 brains which can be eaten or traded. In the (highly likely) event you don't succeed, you will lose anywhere from 20-100% of your health.  ScavengeScavenging is the safest of the four actions. It has a 50/50 chance of success, a moderate positive impact if the odds are in your favor, and a small chance of finding something special that can help you down the road. But if you come up empty handed, you will have wasted a valuable opportunity to hunt, rest or eat.Rest Resting is the second safest of the four actions. It has a 50% chance of success, and it has a moderate positive impact if the odds are in your favor. If you choose to rest, you will have a 50% chance of successfully resting and earning 1-4 health which can be used to heal wounds or increase your chances of survival. But if you don't rest, you will have wasted a valuable opportunity to hunt, scavenge or eat.Eat Eating is the safest of the four actions. It has a 100% chance of success (assuming you have some food on hand), and it has a variable positive impact depending on what you eat. Different foods have different benefits. For example, brains restore health, and flesh increases stamina. Choosing not to eat is probably fine for a while, but eventually you will starve to death or get rekt by someone who chose to hunt.    Nothing As the name suggests, doing nothing is the laziest of the four actions. The longer you do nothing, the less likely you are to survive until the cycle. But there's a silver lining: if you do nothing long enough, you may get a surprise drop that gives you a little boost in the right direction. It's a gamble, but it might just pay off.Resources Zombehland is a resource management game. That means you have to manage your resources carefully if you want to survive. There are four resources you need to keep track of: brains, health, stamina, and luck. Be careful... if you run out of any resource, you'll be even more dead than you were before.Brains Brains are a sort of currency amongst Zombehs. You can use brains to buy things from other players, or you can eat them to restore health. Brains are the most valuable resource in the game, but they are also the most difficult to acquire. You can earn brains by hunting, scavenging, or trading. You can lose brains by eating, trading, or dying.Health Health is the most important resource in the game. If you run out of health, you're done. You can earn health by resting, eating, or trading. You can lose health by hunting, scavenging, or being attacked.Stamina Stamina is the second most important resource in the game. If you run out of stamina, you're done. You can earn stamina by resting, eating, or trading. You can lose stamina by hunting or scavenging.  Luck Luck can make all the difference in the world. If you run out of luck, you're done. On the other hand, having a lot of it increases the odds of success when hunting or scavenging. You can increase your luck by doing nothing, scavenging, hunting, or trading. Luck starts out at 500 automatically decreases by 1 every cycle, so it's important to keep an eye on it.Cooperation You may find yourself in a situation where you need to cooperate with another player to survive. For example, you may need to trade with another player to get the resources you need to survive. Or you may need to gang up with others to take down a stronger player. Cooperation is a key part of the game, and it's a key part of surviving. But be careful... if you trust the wrong player, you could end up dead.Trading Trading is a key part of the game. You can trade pretty much anything with other players. We're talking brains, health, stamina, luck, and even special items. Trading is a great way to get the resources you need to survive. And it's a great way to get rid of the resources you don't need while prioritizing the resources you do need. Trading can help you survive, but it can also be a dangerous game. Be careful who you trust.Special Items Special items are rare items that can be found while scavenging. They have special abilities that can help you survive. Special items are rare by definition, so you won't find them very often. But when you do, they can be a game changer.      Winning The goal of the game is to survive as long as you can. The longer you survive, the more resources you will earn, and the more resources you have, the better your chance of surviving. The last Zombeh standing wins the season's prize pool. Lots more text on the website: https://www.zombehs.com/",
