  "content": "Warning about ZK:NO KYC Instant withdraws up to $500K/24h.Today only: 0% edge and ZKAS airdropEvery element of the website (including the social media viewing) requires you to connect your wallet. Additionally, the topic is locked for discussion though the creator (newbie) is posting to bump the thread. This is extremely suspicious. This thread can be removed after a moderator reviews the report. This is a warning not to connect your wallet to this website until there is more information as to why the discussion is locked and why the website forces walletconnect for even things like viewing social media/joining discord.Since the situation has been handled, I will leave this thread open for another few days for anymore comment before I lock it.

If you simply notice the topic creator's presentation, it's fishy and easily understandable that he is lying. And the bet counts and registered users in a short period are horrible ,Those who like to play on the web 3.0 platform should always be aware before connecting their wallet to such a random/strange site which is just been launched. Due to the increasing popularity of web 3.0, people are trying to get the chance to steal people's money by cloning trusted web 3.0 websites. We should aware of it.",
