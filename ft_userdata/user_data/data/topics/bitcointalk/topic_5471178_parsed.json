      "body": "Well, in my case I have used in-person casinos to play poker and mainly tournaments.So, before a tournament starts, I \"warm up\" at the cash tables, therefore it will depend on how early I arrive to play it, but whatever happens, it does not depend on the money I win or lose, I establish a time of game, in the case of cash table.The tournament depends on the variance, or how bad or well you play on MTT.Traditional games or slots, any win is good to say \"I'm quitting.\"I think you are referring mainly to traditional casino games, in reality it is a priority to establish playing times more than profits, it is very rare that if you get some profits at first you withdraw, but as I said if it happens and it is your goal do it, but to That is preferable to play online, a face-to-face casino is above all entertainment, dispersion, so, leave the profits for when you play online Casino.  .",

I know that it's hard to do that, but if you get lucky, that 10x is going to be very quick. So it's a question once you hit it and you feel lucky, you might go and extend a make a run and think of winning more. So that is a dangerous mindset already. Why? Because we don't know what's going to happen, it could be that you run out of luck, or a stretch to get more big wins. Sooner or later though, the house is going to catch up with you and most likely you are going to lose in the long run. So it's good to put in your mind that if you hit a x5-x10 profits, you can go home or just log-off and withdraw and enjoy your winnings. And maybe later you will think if you will go and play the next day or just relax. Or there could be times that you are down already, and that the you didn't hit your target returns. Usually for me, I just think of just getting back my capital, it's already a win for me if I can indeed recover and recoup everything that I lost that time.",

      "body": "This is how disciplined gamblers roll. They set a goal and, once they reach it, they walk away from the table. Plus, they only bring money earmarked for gambling. That means they're in it whether they win or lose. The key here is to determine your own capital or bankroll, something you can comfortably afford to lose, which varies from one gambler to another based on their financial situation. With time, as you rack up wins in gambling, it becomes easier to grow your funds, especially if you've got some skills in the game.I'm personally diving into sports betting, and my sweet spots so far have been parlay bets. In single bets, it's all about the long-term game. If I hit a win, it doesn't necessarily make my day; it's part of the journey. I'll only consider the season a success if I end it with a profit.",

Let's just say it's a pretty substantial sum, something that would make me happy. But, as you mentioned the 'projection of a specific amount,' once I hit that target, I'm out, calling it a day. We can't be gambling around the clock because luck can run dry. Sometimes, it's about securing a win, and that comes through sticking to our strategy, with discipline helping keep our greed in check.Come on, guys, be honest. Haven't we all felt that itch of greed in gambling? Did you like how it turned out? I'm pretty sure the answer is no...",

      "body": "That is difficult to achieve in gambling because we must remember that winning gambling games is not easy and we must go through many losses. We can indeed win some money but we have to have luck, which only some gamblers can always have. It is better not to have a target to achieve in gambling because it will be difficult and make us even more eager to achieve it. It's not worth it, especially with a loser waiting to take our money.But some people may have a winning target that they want to achieve and won't stop if they can't. They really have to think again and understand that it is not easy because many people have tried it but they just lost by a lot. It's better for them to gamble for fun so they won't think about chasing victory.",

To me it sounds like you are expecting to make a certain profit each time when you enter the casino, this is not really realistic as our winnning chances are not high enough for that. Also, if you only enter to play one round at the casino to make a big profit and leave again it sounds a bit like you are only gambling to make money. I would be careful with such a mindset as this can lead to downward spiral when facing a losing streak. Having a fixed amount of profit in your mind is not going to help you to gamble responsible long term. The only real win for me to stop gambling wouldl be the jackpot. It has to be a huge amount so it's worth it to stop gambling and celebrate with friends, otherwise I would just keep gambling and try to increase my winnings even further.",

It would have to be something like me betting 10% of my bankroll and hitting x1000 or something along those line. I would cash out 90-95% and keep the 5-10% so i could play a few games. Im just playing for entertainment so leaving after the first roll would not make any sense",

Thinking about the amount of winnings before gambling, I think this is something that will make us unable to control ourselves in the games we play so that we easily lose quickly, you are right, if you gamble just to get a big win and get out of the game then people They are not gamblers but they just make money by gambling but I think it is very difficult for people to do that. Setting targets for gambling will prevent us from enjoying the gambling we do.",

We mostly discuss how we're going to be betting, strategies and games will be playing. However, when discussing how much we are expecting to win, we mostly say an insane amount before we will leave the casino but we mostly expect that we will lose and just have fun instead. In cases we really do win which are rare, we mostly stop when we  triple or even win more than ten times our bankroll depending on the bankroll we start with.",

It’s always a bad luck for me to continue playing while I already get an early hit. This target profit scale to the amount of bankroll I’m depositing. I decrease my percentage goal while I increase my bankroll to minimize risk of losing.",
