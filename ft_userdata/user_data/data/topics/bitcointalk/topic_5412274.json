If it reaches that area most likely many will sell.However what matters is what happens after. If it slices it like butter. Similar to the old $6K support in 2019, then it’s confirmation that we hit the low and will go up from here.",

I do not plan on selling any BTC until we get past 70K.Not set in stone but a goal of mine.I DO NOT NEED TO SELL btc at 30k so I would surely hold what I have.I feel the same way. I'm not necessarily going to sell at $70k but at that level I might consider selling a small portion to realize profits. Another milestone to sell would be to have clearly passed $100k, which I don't expect to happen until the next cycle (same as $70k). There will be a lot of people with sell orders around $100k and I expect a lot of resistance to beat that level, but once beaten, I might consider selling at, say $110k and above.",

So, I will act only based on what is currently seen on the news and in my technical chart studies. Anyone, group or situation might cause a spike or dip in the market, but the question we should be asking ourselves is, is it sustainable?The fact that the price of BTC has reached $30-$40K does not mean that it will not continue buying or reverse, what should be the guide of every trader is their technical analysis. Doing anything other than this will amount to gambling.",

This time around it was difficult to go down from playing on the top of 30k and 35k till it was beaten to current price. At this time speculating during this last quarter of the year, I think we may still approach this 30k price towards the end because of the festive season.",

It mean people do prefer more when more people buy and for selling, the same is applicable. But personally, I do DCA always. I do not mind where bitcoin market is heading but I always mind my budget and availability my preferred payment method for buying bitcoins.Bitcoin might have bottomed already out and the current market prices below $20k levels must be a very good opportunity for both regular buyers and for those who look for dips to enter. Always do not expect whales to lead you but when we believe into bitcoin and having regular investment into bitcoins then whales will lose their power over the time.",

No one will ever sell in that price.Yes there will be some desperate people who will want to sell anyhow. But nevertheless all the hardcore Bitcoiners knows the value for which they will hold the coins for more price.If you ask me then I will even buy more coins at that price segment, as Bitcoin’s price segment is enough to tell us what will be Bitcoin’s next target.Let’s all hope for the best and first wait for the bear market to get over.",

Or how many people will sell to cash quick thinking in 6 months times Bitcoin price will fall bellow $10k ? I think even if the Bitcoin price surprisingly starts to increase tomorrow onwards, the growth to ATH isn't going to be very linear, you will see many drops, corrections and reversals. I think the market would work sideways for a few months before we start another bull run. But on the other hand, I feel we are going to be in a great FOMO this time when the market comes back up so weak hands should be really careful while playing the bull market whenever it comes obviously. For me personally if once bitcoin reaches 40k area I will sell for once and wait for the next big correction to buy more. 40k is the psychological barrier now and is not going to be that easy to flip.",

I'm really gonna be super excited and begins to think we might have bottomed out because that price movement could be preparing us again for the next bull run.Then in terms of buying and selling Bitcoin at that time , what I do think is that some weak hands or people that got trapped in that zone, will think is time to exit the market and might be getting out of their pposition.While for me I have already gotten some/enough sats in my holding and not gonna sell any of my BTC , may add more BTC to my portfolio, Because that rise in the price of Bitcoin will even give me more confidence to continue HODLing.",

I believe that few people would want to sell if the price of bitcoin reached 30,000$ that's because for people who know about technical analysis already know that 30,000$ if broken could make the price go up a lot, what if it goes down? It doesn't make much sense to sell at a loss right now. in order not to lose out, the best thing a person can do would be to be buying at every big price dropwhat I did not understand:why do you think that in 6 months the price will drop to 10,000$?",

No one really knows on how many would be doing shorts if ever the price would be hitting up 30-40k price then it would be a personal choice whether you would sell and secure out 2x profits or would decide to held up for longer duration since you are into holding but its up to someone personal choice since we do have different decisions when it comes to this manner.On my case i had able to accumulate bitcoin on 19k price and im still holding and waiting up for some significant rise or even if it would raise up to 24-25k then i would definitely sell out.Make short buys and short sells would be entirely be relevant if you are really that impatient for holding long.",

I hold bitcoins that I bought for just a few hundred USD in 2014 and 2015 and I sold only a small part when we first went to 20k then kept holding in 2018 and 19 and again sold some when we broke 30k for the first time. I sold only enough to have some fun, play around with some free cash. I still hold 90% of my coins from 2013 and I won't ever sell below 20k that's for sure. 30k is nothing special. Maybe if we went to 60 I'd spend some coins to treat my family to nice holidays or something. 100k is my lifetime goal. That's the level that would satisfy me if I were to spend it all but I probably won't do it anyway. I'll spend half and keep half of it as a store of value.",

Let me educate you, op people who invest in cryptocurrency and especially a pronounce investor don't purchase cryptocurrency when the price in frequent motion of acceleration, it's when the price is immensely getting low that's when investors purchase cryptocurrency and precisely bitcoin.
