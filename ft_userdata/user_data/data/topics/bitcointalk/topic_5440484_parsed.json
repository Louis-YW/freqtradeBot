      "body": "When people talk about NFTs, they think of NFT art. NFT art is mostly useless and it has tarnished the reputation of digital art and everything related to NFTs (non-fungible tokens) by creating a hype-driven market focused more on financial speculation than artistic merit or cultural value. But NFTs are more than just pictures. NFT is about the ownership and distribution of digital assets, as well as non-digital assets. A token can be used for a multitude of applications.There are already useful cases of utility NFTs:- Loyalty programs- In-game items which you can re-sell and exchange for other items- There is direct creator support (like Stoner Cats NFT by Mila Kunis' studio that acts as a pass to stream their content)- NFT music, similar to the previous example, where NFT holders can stream music- NFT event passes",

      "body": "Nft covers a lot of areas, I think gaming nfts have a large use case (such as buying into a game like defi kingdoms does with its characters). Steam has a similar marketplace for badges from games too.I've received a few nfts from doing liquidity providing too so funds can easily be moved between accounts and that's another use for this (as you can just transfer the token instead of closing the pool, sending the funds and opening a new one).",
