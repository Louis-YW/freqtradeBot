  "content": "Hello everyone,I'm tinkering around a cgminer implementation on bitmain asic mining firmwares that is driving me crazy. I have two questions. I hope some of you may help me sort out what I'm getting wrong. If i query cgminer-api pools the system counts an overall of 6 pools, but in the following details in the 'cgminer-api pools' result I see only 4 pools, not 6. 1. Are the remaining 2 hidden or it is some kind of malfunction?Also I'm going nuts trying to find the correct syntax for 'cgminer-api removepool' or 'cgminer-api disablepool'. 'cgminer-api pools' Reports pools from no. 0 to no 3. If I try 'cgminer-api disablepool 1' for example I get invalid argument error for the disablepool command. From some research it seems I should be using some pool ID in the disablepool or remove pool commands, but i cant find this pool id information anywhere.2. What am i doing wrong in using these commands? Does anyone of you guys have any suggestions? Thank you so much, its been over a week now I'm stuck at this! Francesco",

In the group I'm using I'm allowed to use all pool related commands. as a matter of fact I receive invalid argument, not forbidden, as a reply.Braiinsos has a terrible mining engine running at over 10c more than cgminer at same performance levels. Also it is much less stable than cgminer. Hiveos is very poor in programming quality, i.e. it throttles fans according to pcb temps not chip temps (LOL).Any other ideas? Thanks friends",

      "body": "Thank you very much Kano and Bitmax for your kind replies. Have 2 new babies in the house and I don't have access to pc often these days. Here are my replies to each of your questions and feebacks.To Kano: I studied the api-readme, I have the commands enabled in my api group. As a matter of fact when I issue the command via SSH I do not get forbidden reply from the api, I receive the missing pool ID reply. I do not use W: group as I had some issues in understanding what IP where my commands being received from, so I changed the default api group adding the commands I needed and it seems to be working fine. I know you wrote the api and the readme, so I'm honored you are actually replying to me in person! To Bitmaxz: I am working on several machine types (bitmain Antminer L3+, t17, s17, if I can make the few changes I need I would really need also to extend the work to s19). I send the commands via ssh interface.Thank you so much for your help!Francesco",

      "body": "Thank you very much Kano.I did study that part of the readme word by word but the command didn't work as written, on my end. After many hours of trials, I found out what the issue was. I'm writing it extensively so anyone that comes across my same issue may benefit. Sending the command cgminer-api disablepool|1 (as I understood from the readme) could not work because the symbol \"|\" has its own meaning in Linux and gets interpreted as such, and not as an option of cgminer-api command.The correct syntax is therefore: cgminer-api \"disablepool|1\". This way it works with most pools.In my case I can only disable some of the pools in the list, I need to study better how is that possible. My guess is that the pools i'm trying to remove are somehow hard-coded in cgminer configuration by some file where my account that has no write authority.",
