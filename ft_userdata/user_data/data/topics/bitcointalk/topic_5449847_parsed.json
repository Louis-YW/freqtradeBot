They are part of activities to increase Bitcoin adoption locally and globally. I see those events are helpful for Bitcoin adoption but we should not think that it can make big changes in short term.If you see Bitcoin rises a lot after an event, conference, maybe it is only a hype that won't last long as it is unsustainable. However, if you see something good technically, it will probably help Bitcoin adoption and have big impacts in long term like next few years.If you see Bitcoin chart, it has higher yearly low price with time and such adoption events will help to increase the yearly low price to be higher with time. This one is sustainable.",

Unless a bomb goes off and kills a good number of important people in this space, then near-zero? Of course it'll very likely have a positive impact.",

Of course this will be very good for the Bitcoin journey in our country which is getting familiar with the world of blockchain.1. https://b.tc/conference/agenda2. https://twitter.com/TheBitcoinConf/status/1648045105012678657",

In terms of bitcoin awareness and promotion, the event will be a medium to spread the news of bitcoin to different parts of the world. Participants will attend from different parts of the world and the social media will be filled with the programs. People that are not aware of bitcoin might become aware of the currency. This conference can lead to the birth of one or more die-hard Bitcoin believersThe event will also serve as an avenue for businesses and entrepreneurs in the bitcoin sector to brainstorm, connect and collaborate. New ideas might spring up from the conference which can be beneficial to the community. New and beneficial products and services will also find a food avenue for promotion through the conference.The Thank God for Bitcoin section is an event I am interested in. This section will strive to connect bitcoin with the Bible. I don't know the content of the program but for me, bitcoin has so many qualities that are upheld or preached by the Christian Holy Book. The section might help to dispel the misconception some religious fanatics have against bitcoin.The entertainment section will be a time for fun and an opportunity for bitcoiners to relax after a year filled with suspense and pressure.But I doubt if the all organizers and sponsors of this conference have a genuine interest in Bitcoiners. I fear that some of these firms will use this platform to advertise their products and services which might end up becoming fraudulent. There will be a massive promotion of centralization and the spread of misinformation.",

Conferences are good, people get to meet each other and see some popular names in the industry, but i don't think it has too much impact to make, and should not even be discussed in that context. If you are around Miami and you're not worried about going, then go and have fun in the event, and leave it at that.",

As well as the Bitcoin Conference which is just a bit of a walk in and a good way for the future, the Bitcoin Conference 2020 will be an exciting time as it will allow all participants to meet regularly in order to promote Bitcoin at a very reasonable rate and reach an investment position.",

On this page, https://b.tc/conference/speakers, I still see a lot of speakers who have no connection to Bitcoin whatsoever. Perhaps 50% of all the speakers on that page do not have a clear understanding of Bitcoin and Blockchain.In the planned agenda, we can see that several events will take place in different locations at the same time. This makes it impossible for all visitors to enjoy all the speakers. It is a great pity for those who want to compare the knowledge of one speaker with another, as there may be visitors who want to see their idol at the event.",

Overall, it is worth watching this event and its potential impact on the future of Bitcoin.The idea of the first Bitcoin hardware wallet Trezor was birthed after the Prague Bitcoin conference in 2011. Two programmers Panavol Rusnák and Marek Palatinus few years after the conference launch Trezor 1. So this conference could be a birthplace for some creative and innovative ideas that could benefit the Bitcoin ecosystem The Bitcoin Conference Pitch Day give Bitcoin startups the opportunity to showcase their products and service and also compete for the winner of the competition. Last year there were over 500 participants that might be fortunate to meet financiers or investors that are interested in their products. So this year's events can be an avenue for new businesses or existing ones to get the right publicity and capital.",

If anyone wants to go I'm selling a ticket (general pass) at a lower price than the actual price on the conference website.The price on the website now is 949 USD and I am selling it for 700 USD.Message me if you are interested.",

I think this topic makes more sense in MeetupsI agree with you. The impact of a Crypto event is not necessarily in its ability to cause price spark on the day of event or after but in it overall contribution in strengthening the idea and practicable use of blockchain technology and Cryptocurrency in our real world. Just yesterday, Bitget held her Empower X Summit in Singapore with many industry leaders in attendance to make her 5 years of operation. The hallmark of it was panel discussion and pitch season. And Justin Sun of Tron foundation was one of the panelist among others who touched on Embracing AI and Blockchain - Prepare for the Next Generation of Internet. As you rightly mention, events like this provides experts and industry leaders the opportunity to connect, share insights and collaborate.",
