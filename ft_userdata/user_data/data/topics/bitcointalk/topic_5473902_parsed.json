In future, will his callings against Bitcoin be true? I am seriously doubtful about that.Bitcoin is not deadhttps://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-is-dead/https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/and it will not be dead because of Lindy effect (Lindy's law) as mentioned in The bullish case for Bitcoin.Gold is still a good investment and with recent actions from central banks globally, it seems gold will have a surge but I would like to choose Bitcoin as it has better ROI (use this casebitcoin.com website and look at the ROI chart.Why central banks are betting big on gold?",

Before bitcoin came out, gold has been seen as the most valuable asset. If bitcoin can last as long as gold, then you will see that most people will prefer bitcoin because it has high volatility and can be used to make good profit than gold when investing in a long term investment and can be bought by both the poor and the rich Bitcoin with the little time of existence has outperformed other assets in the market and it will still continue to outperform them in future. The limited supply of bitcoin has also given bitcoin more potential. I believe that when Bitcoin ETF is been approved a lot of people will understand the strength of bitcoin in the market",

Gold and Bitcoin are two different assets wherein Bitcoin was created to decentralise our financial transactions and to give us financial freedom but once people realised that it can give huge ROI they started using it as an investment medium wherein Gold on the other hand gold is more stable and used to store asset wherein we will see lesser appreciation in gold but one doesn't have to worry about volatility and Gold is physical asset. People may use bitcoin for trading or investment medium but cannot hold Bitcoin as an asset like Gold due to fear of fluctuations and volatility.I would would Bitcoin to trade, invest and gain profit and store it in form of gold as an asset.",

Gold looks like a save heaven because of its volatility which is less and because it is globally accepted while the bitcoin will generate you more ROI. I see both as a good  portfolio diversification, with Gold you don’t need to worry about looking for Alticoins as stablecoins when investing in bitcoin you will just diversify some funds to gold and when bitcoin experiences his bearish period and you are in need of funds you can just move there to sell. One other thing aside ROI that attracts investors to bitcoin is the fact that you can easily purchase bitcoin seeminglessly at the comfort of your home without middleman but Gold sometimes doesn’t have buyers ready and also needs middlemen which can affects ones privacy",

Cause like for example like what you've showed above is when those people have 100 or more Bitcoin in year 2011 then now they are millionaires while comparing those gold holder they earn but not big as Bitcoins. Cause when the price of Bitcoin will up then there's a chance that your capital will doubles or even trippled. Unlike the price of golds.",

If we talk about investment, recently many investors are looking for a comparison of comparable assets to use as a long-term investment moment.Even though these two assets are often used as masterminds of comparisons between Bitcoin and gold, for me these two assets are the most effective instruments in a real method of protection against the erosion of inflation that is occurring, However, the average person still thinks Bitcoin is a speculative and risky investment asset. Thus, whatever the reason, gold is still considered a hedging asset, which can be said to be quite perfect and safe, therefore whatever happens is based on faith.",

But if you are focusing on making a profit from a long time investment bitcoin will be the best option.In times of economic uncertainties like recession, investors prefer to invest in established safe-haven assets like gold.

Advances in technology, the addition of the Internet, social media and other digital tools have enriched and transformed their lives.

In my view, I believe  most people store their assets as Gold  because Gold is less volatile compared to BTCI think Gold is just to store and maintain the value of assets freed from inflation and not what you're thinking. Moreover, the value of BTC is based on its usefulness as a medium of exchange and its scarcity. The present generation actually preferred BTC over Gold despite its higher volatility because BTC is much more liquid than gold meaning that it's easier to buy and sell. Again, BTC is much easier to store and transport than gold since it's a digital asset. Majority of us believe that BTC is a better store of value than gold because it has a fixed supply and is less influenced by politics or central banks. Gold seems to be outdated.",
