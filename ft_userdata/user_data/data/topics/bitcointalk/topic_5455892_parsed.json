      "body": "Prices in Turkey and Argentina are both unbelievable.   Could you supply gifted steam games also possibly or is that barred trade, can I add you on steam for future maybe?  I often have people in a rush buying games together for multiplayer and theres always one person who doesnt have the full price available to spend which spoils the evening schedule etc.    The massive gap between countries for the same exact product has to be some kind of opportunity but also I doubt its too easy exactly because its so obvious.A sub is for 1 month, I think thats not too risky a purchase and alot of games are variable in price and next Steam sale is this month I think.",

If I want subscriptions for several streamers, what do you need to make me subscribe to their channel ? Do you need to get my Twitch password in order to buy them with my own account or will you buy them with your account and then give them to me? If you will give them, do I need to be connected to the channel when you will buy the sub and send it ?",

I will try to contact you on Discord but maybe other people would also be curious to understand something. 3 months subscribing is a little bit more expensive than 3 single months. $2.5 > 3 x $0.8Does it mean you only accept 3months subscription at least and the price in OP is just an illustration of the virtual cost of 1 month, rounded though?",
