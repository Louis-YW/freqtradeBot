  "content": "Argentina star player Lionel messi have been given the ballon d'Or for the eight time in his football career, the highest any player could achieve so far. Messi's performance over the years have been overwhelming and for the fact that he won the world cup even added in giving him huge credit in his football career. He has been resilience, committed and consistent over the years and I must say that this 8 ballon d'Or is deserving for Lionel Messi. What are your thoughts and views concerning messi winning this year's ballon d'Or is he worth it or not?",

Guy weti u tok e no make sense at all. So na dis place good to celebrate am, we no get Naija and Africa sports or gambling threads? why him no go there and make as comment. See weti you dey even tok. Apart from translation threads weti you contribute in dis local board? we are trying make dem to understand how to post and where to post and you dey here dey encourage. You dey post well from your main account but here u dey fuck up. most of you dont even know and understand di meaning of the forum. Someone was making a statement in one of the threads that local board was created to discuss local matters. I smiled. Those who can not freely express themselves on bitcoin can come to local board and learn. I believed the first thread I created your name was among, and the way I dey see your name go still follow. I no won to tok too much, let me stop... Di way you tok to Charles-Tim, you are an account to dat account. A newly full member account can never try dis.",
