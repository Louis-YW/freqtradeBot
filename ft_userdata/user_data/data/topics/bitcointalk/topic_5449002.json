One of the disadvantages which may make people not to be that using it is because it has only computer software, no software for Android or iOS, except the Android and iOS notification apps. So if comparing the trading volume to those centralized exchanges, centralized exchanges have far higher trading volume. But for anyone that wants privacy, Bisq is the best decentralized exchange to go for, but it has low trading volume.As for centralized exchanges, those that allows Nigeria P2P that are highly ranked on Coingecko, like Binance, OKX and Kucoin are all having high P2P trading volume. Among the ones that are not there like Luno, Remitano and Quidax. I have used Luno before some years ago, the exchange is very good. I have also used Quidax before, very fast but not advisable to use because of some high hidden deduction of users money. I have aso used Remitano before, I do not like the slow transaction completion time after CBN do not want bank to officially support bitcoin and other crypto transactions anymore.",

The first time I use Remitano, the transaction expired or so and it was cancelled. I tried it again, it took 1 to 2 hours before the money reflected on my bank account. Very frustrating. That was the first time I used Remitano. The second time I used Remitano, the transaction was cancelled and cancelled again and again. You see how that can make you leave an exchange forever without visiting it again.",

Back den I found 2 companies dat help which were xbit now known as luno and xapo. Â I left d crypto space 4 a while, now coming back many new improvements are around.

All you go need to do na to just input the amount wey you go wan swap into NGN, and this process dey always dey instantly. Step 4: So after you don swap your BTC into NGNR, the next step go be to click the withdraw button as you fit see below, and eh go take you go the next stepStep 5: So after you don click step 4, eh go carry you come this side all you need to do na to just select your bank, input your acct number & in few minutes you go see alert for your phone.
