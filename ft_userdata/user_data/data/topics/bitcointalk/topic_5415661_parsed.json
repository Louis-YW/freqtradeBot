  "content": "A dark tragedy in the history of Indonesian football, caused fear and became the world's attention. This chronology happened last night during the Arema FC vs. Persibaya match (Kanjuruhan Stadium, Malang). The death toll reached more than 130 people, not including serious injuries and minor injuries who are still being treated in hospital. A little review of the history of the two clubs where Arema FC has not lost for more than 30 years and today they lost so that the supporters did not accept the result. Supporters took to the field, causing unrest to get out of hand, police officers were forced to fire tear gas. In fact, according to FIFA rules, tear gas is prohibited. The impact of this incident will be very fatal, including FIFA sanctions. In addition, there will be other sanctions that punish Indonesian football to an unfathomable abyss.Cases of victims who fall continue to grow, hopefully this will be a slap so that football does not become a place of loss of life. Football is an arena of entertainment, you can be a supporter but don't let your life be at stake. Several factors died from the impact of tear gas, crammed into the hallway of the gate leading to the stadium exit (victims included the elderly, adults and even children).The President of the Republic of Indonesia finally issued an official statement to temporarily suspend the Indonesian League and confirmed the sanctions that Indonesia received, including hosting the U-20 World Cup and Indonesia being expelled from the 2023 Asian Cup as well as several other sanctions that overshadowed Indonesia.Under FIFA Rules the use of tear gas is prohibited in Chapter III on Stewards, article 19 on Stewards on the sidelines.With the current case, I feel sorry for the tragedy that befell the world of Indonesian football. May the victim find a place by his side and the bereaved family be given strength. I hope that in the future something like this will not happen again in any football world, both locally and internationally. Football is a world of entertainment that we should enjoy. Remember life is too precious to be sacrificed for anything.News source:https://www.fifa.com/https://twitter.com/jokowi/status/1576431163249262592?t=L8B6E3IWS1XfuDFxTzitFQ&s=08https://bandungbarat.suara.com/amp/read/2022/10/02/102009/indonesia-terancam-sanksi-berat-fifa-imbas-tragedi-stadion-kanjuruhanhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bola.com/amp/5085650/tragedi-kanjuruhan-ada-di-regulasi-fifa-larang-penggunaan-gas-air-mata-untuk-membubarkan-massahttps://twitter.com/marca/status/1576357001289793536?t=SAbPQ_Zh7omhWOgCVUtFww&s=19Video footage of seconds of chaos https://youtu.be/7QEjSKHefK8 Please note that this video contains elements of violence",

More leagues are happening around, and now only football popularity around Asian countries growing good. Once again this incident will affect the football history in Asian Countries.",

      "body": "Yes, that's right. Regarding tear gas (in this case it is written \"crowd control gas\"), FIFA clearly prohibits its use in stadiums.FIFA has also written rules / appeals related to how to anticipate the invasion of fans into the field area. I think a lot of the casualties in the tragedy were because the security forces fired tear gas.indeed In a derby match, the potential for friction is bound to happen.Riots and fans entering the field are definitely a possibilityBut not by means of tear gas.Firing tear gas, will make fans jostling for the exit, and eventually become hypoxic.whatever it is I extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims who lost their lives following this tragic incident.",

      "body": "My deepest Condolences to those who were lost. I tried looking up more info from this after reading this post, it seems like the majority of the victims were due to the unrest that the release of tear gas did, leading to a stampede happening, as well as a lot of people getting deprived of oxygen, getting trampled later on. The death toll count has also gone past 160 people from what I gathered, and it seems like it still might increase.  Quote from: KennyR on October 02, 2022, 10:19:55 AM~I wouldn't really consider it to be Indonesian violence though afaik they're well known to be rather violent when it comes to football. To what I know it looked more like fans were questioning the team as to why they lost, but since a LOT of people went out to the field I guess it looked like something \"was\" about to happen. And even if it was imo the police should have first prioritized the safety of the team instead of going, well, what they did.",

What a depressing day for this admirable game of football.I send my sincere sympathies to the relatives of the victims as well as the Indonesian people.This is outrageous; if the fans can't even enjoy a football game, they should be temporarily suspended.",

I think it happens in every sport. It is just that this was handled poorly by the officers.Hopefully, this will be a lesson for the officers, and they must train how to handle this kind of event. Handling crowds can be a big task especially if it escalates to riots or the like but with proper training and incidents like this can be avoided.",

I am dismayed to learn that the number of people who have lost their live is 170+ and can go higher. I learnt that the deaths were due to stampede and this is one of the worst football stadium tragedy. The Government of Indonesia should punish those responsible of controlling and taking decisions to control the crowd. There should be a proper enquiry be placed and steps should be taken to avoid such incidents in the future.",

I think this main problem why above 150 Arema Malang fans was pass away based on last few hours ago updated.Last night I watch this derby match and both player respect each other and seems not really derby match like usually, but few minutes games have ended and Arema Malang player try apologize, some fans down to the field and make police man have make some thing not allowed by FIFA rule used tear gas to disperse the crowd, now Indonesia League suspend awhile until one weeks later until all problem clearly what happen and exactly have conclusion about responsibility from each people.",

I still can't believe that over 120 people died not in a war field but in a football were fans to cheer on their favorite teams and be happy. How could a sport that unites followers and provides them delight suddenly become sour? I ask God to give the nation and the families the strength to endure the loss.",

I did not even think that the death toll reached 127 people and even this became a very dark incident. The more violent supporters and the overcrowded stadium capacity made the commotion even more heated. even the security guard by the police could not handle it, even police officers also became victims of this riot of supporters. I can only say, that this was a terrible incident. Indonesia must improve itself, must regulate football matches properly so that football matches remain a sport and entertainment event, not become hell and cause many casualties.https://news.detik.com/berita/d-6323804/127-orang-tewas-dalam-kerusuhan-di-stadion-kanjuruhan-malang",
