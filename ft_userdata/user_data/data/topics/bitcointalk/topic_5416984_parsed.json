  "content": "Hello! I am building a twitter marketing tool and would like to use Crypto as a way to make it possible for users to spend and earn \"credits\" in the platform, that can be later exchanged in other crypto currencyI would be ok by using Ethereum at first but would also like to have at least a stable coin. I won't be using fiat in the first months.Services like Paypal and Stripe are not an option as I don't want to use / give business informationAny recommendations besides running my own node would help me a lot!Thanks in advance",
