  "content": "Recently, derBowler from Germany has started to use Bitcoin to fund his donation campaign where he's helping Ukrainians. I like his project very much, so I've donated already multiple times and want to present his project here.  His project started already in the early days, when Russia invaded Ukraine. derBowler was providing help to refugees like transportation of refugees out of endangered zones, to the border near Poland and furthermore back to Germany. He used Bitcoin to fund his operations, especially because Bitcoin is fast and a reliable medium for donations. Recently, his focus has shifted to providing supply of humanitarian goods and food, where he's organizing transports, many oft them starting on the polish border. Some pictures from March / April: Quote from: derBowler on March 06, 2022, 06:58:49 PMMore from his efforts can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387906.0He’ll post updates and new pictures frequently. His donation campaign is still active and donations can be sent here: QuoteBitcoin : bc1qcatsxvw057khlcazrzpl33rje8lvjnyz6ryxxhEthereum : 0xD7638eb545678a58A9Fd77B12eb7dF5C30Cec0D5Monero : 4958PhVdtQGTpgdpC2VUhv94MvnCSrA4E77aVmViwfdzbTrU5VGfYRtPTNSjcwtJgNhGzyVw9AqTMG4 A5Upv623cEPesXaUIn case you want to help him, donations are very welcome.

He has agreed to lend 6 refrigerated trucks for our next mission for transports of our medical goods and other stuff which is in need of cooling. I addition, we have used 4 trucks to deliever donated goods into Ukraine. A few pictures: - EOne of our refrigerated trucks - - One of our trucks - - Some donations from our transport - As you can see, we are still at it and I would like to make a call to get some support!!We are still in need to cover some of our transportation costs.

      "body": "BUMP! derBowler is active again delievering help for Ukrainians, especially during winter now, when it's getting reall cold in Ukraine. It's already a problem right now because it's cold, because of food shortages because of electrictiy shortages from blackouts. Putin is deliberately bombing civilian targets and electricity shortages are very risky to endanger heating in winter. It won't get better in December, January and February because winter can be very strong in Ukraine. derBowler's whole translation: Quote from: derBowler on November 20, 2022, 05:53:29 PMHello everyone! I know it has become a bit quiet around this topic and we also had to step back a bit, because family, job and private life have taken some time. But now we receive many calls again for help from Ukrainians and unfortunately it has become very quiet in public, certainly also due to the fact that we have a lot to do here in the country (everything has just become more expensive), but we have decided to organize another aid transport.    Unfortunately, winter is here and the people there have no water, electricity or heating.    Yes, we also know we can not save the whole country but still want to make a new contribution in which we start for the people living there and especially their schools, hospitals, etc. again an aid transport.We have been collecting for some time now, this time we will deliever everything you need for the winter, starting with blankets, sleeping bags, tents, water filters and treatment, emergency generators, fan heaters, gas bottles, gas cookers, winter clothes, goulash cannons [/b] and so on.     I opened this topic again, hoping that some of you either know someone or want to support us again.     Of course, this time again the full transparency of the help is guaranteed, as already all the time here. For everyone who wants to donate some BTC: for Bitcoin : bc1qcatsxvw057khlcazrzpl33rje8lvjnyz6ryxxhI hope you'll join here once again and help us out. Even if it's only a small donation, it's much appreciated. For any questions, please ask and I'll provite 100% transparency. Greetings, stay healthy and have a nice ChristmasI'll send once again 1 mBTC later this week to his campaign, so if you want to be helpful, too, feel free to donate some BTC for derBowlers efforts.",

      "body": "Today, derBowler and his team are starting a new delievery of humanitarian aid into Ukraine.  I'll just translate his original announcement from our local section:  Quote from: derBowler on December 11, 2022, 12:58:21 PM - Update -Hello CommunityWe we able to organize some more delieveries and our next transport is ready to go to Ukraine. Here are some pictures of our rented vehicles and goods bought from donations: We will deliever: sleeping bags, beds for children's homes and hospitals, water, rice, chocolate, pet food, medicines, hygiene articles, toys and much more.We have managed to load 6 vehicles: 3 trucks and 3 vans, see more details in our pictures. Due to bad weather we have to stay overnight during our tour and unfortunately that will result in additional costs for hotel rooms but it's not possible to do otherwise, because safets is very important. So if you want to be a part of it, you can support us to help funding transport costs, fuel, tolls, food, hotel costs, food, coffee       - vehicles -        - humanitarian goods ( rice, water, chocolate, beds, sleeping bags, etc. )It's only a small part of our delievered supplies, even if it has become less because Ukraine war isn't covered much in media lately and people are therefore a bit less likely to donate, we still receive donations again and again. Last week a convoy from a German humanitarian aid group brought humanitarian goods to Ukraine, it has been covered in the news, so some help is still being provided. But we are not a large organization, so we rely on you here.We are very thankful for all donations, will continue to use funds wisely and post updates here, so merry Christmas to everyone! Quote from: derBowler on December 16, 2022, 10:07:02 AM - Edit -Tomorrow evening (Saturday, 17) our next but last aid convoy for this year will start.    I would like to make another request and maybe some of your can help us.    We got some generators from a company and the generators are very reliable and efficient. We would like to include them in our delievery and distribute them to children's homes as well as hospitals and other social institutions in Ukraine. Unfortunately, our budget is depleted and we do not want to leave the machines behind, maybe some of you have the possibility or you know someone who could / would like to support us.     Thanks again to all who have supported us so well, so far!    Merry Christmas to everyone! So, you see, all donations are appreciated, even small ones. In my opinion it's a great donation campaign, derBowler is always available for qoestions, makes updates and gives insights into their delieveries. I've sent him 2 mBTC, too, would be nice to get some more support for derBowler's continued efforts: Quote from: derBowler on November 20, 2022, 05:53:29 PMFor everyone who wants to donate some BTC: for Bitcoin : bc1qcatsxvw057khlcazrzpl33rje8lvjnyz6ryxxh",

      "body": "derBowler has provided a new update, where he helps Ukrainians via Bitcoin donations: After the situation has calmed down a little bit for him, it’s also no secret that he and his team are still trying their best to help Ukrainians. According to derBowler’s recent update, their main focus is currently on organizing drinking water treatment plants and medical facilities for hospitals and homeless shelters in Odessa and Kherson and planning their transports. Unfortunately, the purchase of such systems and also the transport is not quite as cheap as derBowler’s team has expected. Total funds are amounting to around 10k euros, so derBowler and his team are still dependent on support. He welcomes all sorts of support, no matter if real donations in BTC of just a nice comment to bump his topic and he also confirmed, that his main investor is still there and they can still exchange any Bitcoin without fees to use it directly for humanitarian help. So, derBowler would be happy for any donation to continue his mission.  Quote from: derBowler on November 20, 2022, 05:53:29 PMFor everyone who wants to donate some BTC: for Bitcoin : bc1qcatsxvw057khlcazrzpl33rje8lvjnyz6ryxxhI've sent him once again a small donation, too.

We know a psychological war are also being fought behind the scenes, with Russian hackers being used to gather information. Bitcoin can help to hide donators real identities and to keep them safe.Just imagine a scenario where a well-known CEO of a large global company are targeted, if it becomes clear that he or she donated to support the Ukrainians. The hackers will target the company and bring it to it's knees, so that is why pseudo anonymity are so important in cases like this.",

The transport is now planned for mid-June, but this time it is not quite so easy because some things have to be clarified in advance and the financing of the transport has not yet been fully covered. Here are some pictures of our deliveries, nicely stored in wooden boxes and no one will be able to spot them. As you can see, a lot of what we are making possible again for Ukrainians, a total of 12 boxes have been built and the systems were pre-assembled and packed here in Germany, we are almost ready to send our vehicles to Ukraine.If you want to donate yourself or you know someone else who wants to support us, let us know, we need every penny, thank you. Of course, derBowler will keep making updates, so you'll be able to see what your donations will be used for.",

Many villages are damaged by the flood and drinking water supply is not working for some villages. Luckily, derBowler is exactly contributing water treatment plant, so his help is very welcome. I've translated derBowler's latest update: Quote from: derBowler on June 07, 2023, 08:06:34 PMHello everyone.  Surely, you have all noticed what happened to the dam in Ukraine and the suffering of the local population has now become even bigger, now that the water supply has become even worse, all the more suitable equipment is needed. Our transport is already in the starting blocks to help the Ukrainians as soon as possible, will start next week. A famous German volutary help organization has also started a local transport with 5000 water filters and it's also in the process of organizing more water treatment plants (was also published in the media). Unfortunately we are not equipped like them and we are again dependent on support, so I start here again an appeal with the request for some support to help us. I'll thank you in advance and if you have any questions, just ask, we are absolutely transparent and just want to help.So, derBowler and his team are preparing once again a visit in Ukraine to help, especially to improve drinking water supply.

Quick summary: The project's last mission took place at Christmas, where several transports of relief supplies were included, this time the focus was on spreading a little Christmas joy for the benefit of the children and young people. It was agreed, to continue missions in 2024 as well. As a positive news, a large sports and camping manufacturer has joined and provides a lot of stuff, like sleeping bags, sleeping mats, thermos bottles and pocket warmers. It's really helpful stuff, especially because temperatures can go down to -35 degrees. Unfortunately, the infrastructure is very damaged and there is no electricity or water outside of many rural areas. That's why derBowler's team is currently in the process of installing mobile heaters as well as power generators and gas stoves. They visited a children's home, where the whole kitchen (neighboring building) was destroyed and they tried to make a warm meal for the children at least every two days with a small field kitchen.Original update text (translated): Quote from: derBowler on January 13, 2024, 12:52:14 PM- Update -Hello everyoneAs some of you may have noticed, we organize some aid transports for the Ukraine. Our last transport took place at Christmas with various vehicles and relief supplies, this time the focus was on spreading a little Christmas cheer for the children and young people.The transport actually went smoothly and the media were also present at the start, we were shown on the news - maybe some of you noticed it too. Unfortunately, it all took much longer than expected and we didn't get back until December 31st, so some of us spent New Year's Eve on the highway on the way home. Once again, a big thank you to all the volunteers.This was actually supposed to be the last transport, but after reviewing the mission we agreed that we would continue this year.A large sports and camping manufacturer got in touch with us and provided us with lots and lots of sleeping bags, sleeping mats, thermos flasks and pocket warmers from overproduction at our disposal.Because I can tell you it's really cold there, we're talking about 35 degrees below zero and so on.Unfortunately, the infrastructure is very damaged and there is no electricity or water in the hinterland or small towns. That's why we are once again trying to find mobile heaters, electricity generators and gas stoves.We have visited a children's home where the whole kitchen (neighboring building) has been destroyed and they are trying to make a warm meal for the children at least every two days with a small field kitchen.So we are still there and if you also want to help, then get in touch or use the addresses known here, thank youStay all healthy and I can tell you we can consider ourselves lucky that we are living in Germany or in Western Europe, in this sense, I'm saying thank you.So, you can see the money is spend really well here and the team is always happy to get some help.  I've won in the contest in memory of light_warrior and donated my prize money to derBowler's campaign: Quote from: 1miau on January 12, 2024, 10:22:49 PMAfter winning first place here, I would like to donate my win to an Ukrainian aid campaign, organized by forum member @derBowler. 13 mBTC were transferred today: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/a0629642710070bdac84b0f687afdb4edc40cc1c98bcc72255582a8fff163a00KUDOS to derBowler and his team.",

To get more information about his latest updates, you can check his topic here: Ambulance - Campaign - UkraineOr read a summary here in his recent update: Quote from: derBowler on April 16, 2024, 08:18:43 AMAmbulance - CampaignHello everyone.I'm contacting you again because we've been approached again to see if we could organise a few more ambulances.The last campaign with the emergency vehicles was so great that some Doctors in the Ukraine have joined forces and are now travelling across the Country to visit and provide medical care to people in the Ukraine who need medical help but are no longer able to drive to a Hospital due to destroyed infrastructure or are no longer able to do so themselves.As the ambulances are of a very high standard, almost like a mobile operating theatre, even very difficult cases can be treated, which also benefits the soldiers and the Military, who have also asked for a Vehicle.We, who have been organising aid transports and materials of all kinds for the local people for almost two years now, are of course doing everything we can to make this happen again.As we have been in very close contact with the Military and also with some aid Organisations on the ground from the very beginning and we now know each other personally, we know that everything we put together here will arrive there and go into the right hands.So everything, and we really mean everything, goes one-to-one into the Projects and help for the People in Ukraine.However, as this is beyond our financial means, we are now more dependent on external support, as this is something very different and not easy.Maybe you can imagine to support us in this local Project, it does not have to be a lot, everyone a little bit as you can but together we are strong.Feel free to advertise it and there will certainly be a report like with the other projects.Unfortunately, such help is still seen as very critical, which also leads to hostility etc. so be careful when you ask, we have already experienced a lot here.But I still believe that we should not stand idly by, especially as it is ultimately about Europe, our homeland, and the People in Ukraine who are like you and me, already have very little and now everything has been destroyed, so we should help those who are not so well off.I would like to say thank you and hope for a lot of support so that we can give some people some peace and above all hope.With this in mind, everyone stay healthy and if you have any questions, just write to me, pleaseGreetings Timfor Bitcoin : bc1qcatsxvw057khlcazrzpl33rje8lvjnyz6ryxxhfor Ethereum : 0xD7638eb545678a58A9Fd77B12eb7dF5C30Cec0D5PS: I very much hope that we can live together peacefully again at some point, but this does not look like it at the moment, see the new problem Israel and Iran all the more we have to stick together. Those who are doing well should perhaps help the poorer ones to restore a balance and give the poorer ones a little hope again. Thank you",
