  "content": "Hi, for those who follow crypto signals on Twitter, how do you set up your Twitter account to receive notifications of crypto signals without having to check your Twitter account every 5 minutes?It is probably very important to open the position immediately after the signal is sent as if I wait a few minutes that could make a big differenceAlso I would appreciate if you have any recommendations on what twitter accounts to follow",

      "body": "I will first advice you to be careful of crypto signal groups, they will ask of money, not for your progress or to make successful trades, but for their own means of earning. That does not mean the signal will not fail. I am not using signal groups, but there are people that are giving you the signals on Twitter as they tweet about it? Then follow the people on Twitter and turn the notification on for the people followed. Anytime such people post, you will have the notification about it on your device. Make sure that you enable Twitter notification on your device. Again, I will advice you to stay away from crypto signal groups.",
