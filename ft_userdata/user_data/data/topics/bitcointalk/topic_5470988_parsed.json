While the staffs who work to keep the forum being moderated are also known by their profiles showing those titles. The other set of people are the merit source who selected to distribute merit to forum members by having to go through the forum or board assign to them to merit quality posts. These members are choosen by theymos although it is through application by the reputation they have earned and how well they know the forum. All this are people are not paid except staffs that I have seen old threads about them getting paid, but I canâ€™t say for that. So i will this as their contribution to the forum. Other contributors also can be seen on their trust feedbacks left by other members, example are people that have had handle special donations in the forum, members that have contributed to local boards through guiding and translating meaningful information to his local language. All this and more can be found on users profile by just viewing their trust lists. Aside this the most important is people that have freely shared their knowledge with members and are given this tittle by the forum members themselves. Â I somehow like the idea of the forum being free as we have it, once there are things that gets attached to it then it wouldnâ€™t be this transparent again and many scams will be done here. So if your purpose of asking is to get the prominency rank, I would say start by just been a member who doesnâ€™t engage in scam and help to guide people with your knowledge and also help to catch scammers. Thatâ€™s all you need Â Quote from: Cyrus on June 18, 2013, 11:33:58 PMAll the main ranks that can be handed out to normal users are: Brand New, Newbie, Jr. Member, Member, Full Member, Sr. Member, Hero Member and Legendary.In addition to the main rankings, there are also sub-rankings that can be applied, and those are: Donator, and VIP.Finally, staff sub-rankings are as follows: Staff, Moderator, Global Moderator, Administrator, and Founder.RankDescriptionTagBrand New:0 posts, gets 1 gold coin under his name.Newbie:(none), gets 1 gold coin under his name.Jr. Member:Activity: 30, gets 1 gold coin under his name.Member:Activity: 60, gets 2 gold coins under his name.Full Member:Activity: 120, gets 3 gold coins under his name.Sr. Member:Activity: 240, gets 4 gold coins under his name.Hero Member:Activity: 480, gets 5 gold coins under his name.Legendary:Activity: the Legendary membergroup has no universal activity requirement.You are guaranteed to become Legendary somewhere between 775 and 1030 activity,but the exact point in this range at which you become Legendary is random per user.Gets 5 gold coins under his name of which the last is half dark blue.Sub-RankDescriptionTagDonator:Manually applied by administration after 10 BTC donation, and gets 5 gold coins under his nameof which the last is half green. 5 coins are shown regardless of post count when user is a Donator.VIP:Manually applied by administration after 50 BTC donation, and gets 5 gold coins under his nameof which the last is half purple. 5 coins are shown regardless of post count when user is a VIP.Staff RankDescriptionTagStaff:Shown when moderators (see next point) post outside of the sections that they moderate.The tags under their usernames are dependent on their post group.variableModerator:Shown when moderators of specific sections post within those sections.Gets 5 gold coins, of which the last is shown as half faded-out green.Global Moderator:Applied to Staff that have moderation privileges in all boards.Gets 5 gold coins, of which the last is half teal colored.Administrator:Has all available permissions and can appoint moderators and perform other administrative tasks.Gets 5 gold coins, of which the last is shown half red regardless of post count.Founder:Reserved for Satoshi, gets 5 platinum coins under his name.[\\quote]",

Their contributions, including writing code, fixing bugs, and various other invaluable efforts, have played a crucial role in keeping the forum alive. newer members like powerglove have demonstrated exceptional skills, continually impressing the foru.

It is used on members that have stayed here for long and have been popular which is still base on their contributions to help the community by sharing their knowledge freely. If you visit the technical board well, you will see some of this members eagerly helping out from their knowledge without any monetary value and they have been doing it for a very long time so yes they are worth the tittle. Others could be on how patches or sites they have created to help the navigation of the forum easier. But the prominent isnâ€™t a tittle that is ordained or generalize on anyone here, it depends on you giving such member the title based on what you have seen about him. Someone prominent to you might not be to me.",
