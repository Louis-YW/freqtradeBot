And I dont recall who it is, but that seller is someone on these forums. I probably would have forgotten about these except they gifted me one. Luckybit purchased maybe 10 Labyrinths from me, and they (Luckybit) produced these wooden boxes and used them as part of some raffle or giveaway... I think they were one of the first BTC casinos? I didn't have anything to do with it outside of selling them the Labyrinths. There were exactly 20 of the Ruby Labyrinths produced, and it's also true that there are less of the ceramic version in circulation than the silver version... I believe this was due to a combination of a parts issue and just getting burned out from producing them... like with the 2014 originals where I destroyed many of the parts. I'll try to do some digging at some point and see if I can get a better idea of how many ceramic versions were produced. (slightly less than 700 I know) It gets a little complicated because back then I would honor requests for serials like #1500, #2000, #2500, and birth years (1985) things like that... bc I had just assumed I would be producing them all - but I never did. Mintage on the Labyrinths is: Ruby: 20Ceramic: around 500Silver: 700",

Mintage on the Labyrinths is: Ruby: 20Ceramic: around 500Silver: 700 thank you for the clarification! I really wish I had known about collectibles back then - I would probably have been buying every version as they were released lol The website doesnt even mention the ruby ones that I can see. only states:Quote....and five tiny spheres tumble through the rings — silver spheres on the first 700 coins, and ceramic spheres on the remainder of the 2500-coin run.edit - this is to correct what i said previously when I stated 700 ruby ones - I meant silver.",

The website doesn't mention about the Ruby Edition because they were never sold along with Silver or Ceramic Editions. They were separately auctioned by Max after 3 years in the forum and on eBay even though they have been created in 2015. Here is some info about the edition :Quote from: Kialara on March 14, 2018, 11:05:59 PMWhen I originally designed the Labyrinth, I planned to use lab-created rubies. I ordered 100 of them (minimum order qty) and they were not as red in color as I would have liked, so I built 20 of them and shelved them - they’ve been sitting in my safe since 2015. I originally planned to release 250 Labyrinths with rubies, so these have serials 01/250 through 20/250 and are dated 2015. There are and will only be these 20 in existance though.Labyrinth numbers 01 - 07, 09, 11, 13, 15 were auctioned in forum and 12, 14 were auctioned in eBay. Either 08 or 10 were reserved by Max himself and one was given to AdvocateOne.The winning bids were :01 - 1.231BTC ~ $10k02 - 0.51BTC ~ $4.2k03 - 0.45BTC ~ $3.8k04 - 0.45BTC ~ $3.4k05 - 0.45BTC ~ $3.4k06 - 0.38BTC ~ $2.9k07 - 0.51BTC ~ $3.5k09 - 0.53BTC ~ $3.7k08/10 - 0.48BTC? ~ $3.3k11 - 0.48BTC? ~ $3.3k13 - 0.45BTC ~ $3k15 - 0.52BTC ~ $3.5k",
