  "content": "I have been in crypto almost 1 year now and has been an interesting year to say the least. When I bought my first crypto in January I didn’t know anything about cycles and just started investing after a friend had been telling me for months to do so. My portfolio is currently 40% down and I have just been buying weekly throughout the year and more when we have crashed and haven’t sold anything yet. Up until today I had the plan of just holding and selling when everything gets back to all time highs again but I have just realised as I have been buying at these lows for a while now my average buys have decreased a lot meaning I don’t need my investments to go back to all time highs to see good returns. I only started investing in Bitcoin after the June crash so feel I have a good average price currently as I have only been buying between £13k - £20k. Bitcoin I will hold until £100k at least but altcoins I own I realise I don’t need to wait for them to get back to all time highs to see good returns.I know we are likely to drop further in the first few months of 2023 but I am curious to know how high we all feel Bitcoin can reach later in the year before 2024?",

Nobody here is a prophet to know what will happen to the Bitcoin price in 2023. Just like most tradable assets, what you will get will just be speculation from different members. You will have to wait it out, so what will determine how far you will HODL will be your level of patience or greed if you have any.Take care of some altcoins. Some of them will keep sinking lowered and lower until they are no more and abandoned, and you will lose your investment even after waiting, just like that.",

Are we likely to have a run up to £40,000 or something or is it likely to stay at low these low levels for most of 2023.It is not a problem for anyone to study what happened with Bitcoin from 2009 until today, and cycles are not a secret and something that is difficult to understand. What is important in the whole story is that there is always a possibility that what happened in the past will not happen again in the future.In the context of the cycle, next year might be more positive, but how can you predict if something bad will happen? Any negative event like the ones we had this year would have a negative effect on the price, but also some big and positive news would have a positive effect. Never say never when it comes to Bitcoin, but somehow I'm not inclined to believe that next year there could be a price increase of even 100%, but miracles happen from time to time, don't they?",

Also, a market price as high as that won't be more likely achieved for a single year only. Considering market behavior at this moment as we get close to the next year, things are really sketchy. But regarding altcoins, indeed ut would be hard to determine which is which, but by quite doing a background check on the project, things might  be lessen especially with the risk. In terms of altcoins ,only few of them are having price increase not in line with general market trend. As an investor you should be able to find those kind of cryprocurrencies. But for now that the market is having a hard time to recover, be patient and wait for the right time to invest.",

But before you aid to predictions just remember that jinx usually happen. There are other major things that influence its price. The growth of investors or adopters will affect it. Things like crash of exchanges like the FTX of this year will affect it. Say a bigger exchange like Binance suffers same feat.Regardless of those stated worries i predict a bearish period between the starting of 2023 till the middle. After then we might experience bullish period till the end of next year.",

All I can say is that there could be a good chance that we might see another all time high. Or at least reach our previous highs of $69k. So just putting that numbers around, you might still be very happy buying today and then making huge profit if we hit that price. We will have a bitcoin halving in the 1st quarter of 2024, that will be a good gauge to see where the price will be in the future as we all know that it is the catalyst for a eventual bull run. And with that,, I would say you don't need to worry, just continue to accumulate and let the normal flow of the market come in 2024, maybe it could be $100k or higher or $50k. The point is that you could still make money if you look long term.",

I think we’ll see the price start creeping up as people begin to eyeball the halving, but the real fireworks take another year after the halving when the rubber hits the road as they say. If we do get institutional adoption, 2024-2025 will be some explosive years. The current recession expectations hint that the economy will be back growing by then and irrational exuberance will likely return.",

We can only guess based on the market charts by drawing lines from the movement of bitcoin so far and it's also not certain that it will really happen.2023 may bring very good changes for bitcoin but it could also be that we have to wait until early 2024.
