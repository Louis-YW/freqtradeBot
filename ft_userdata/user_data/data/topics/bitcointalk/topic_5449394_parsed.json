Exchanges give you a leverage of as much as 100x just to get you out of the game and people think they have the edge when it's 99% sure they are going to lose the bet. It's more of gambling at 1% odd rather than a calculated risk.Exchanges liquidated almost $83.34 million in the past 24 hours. Data from: https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationDataAlmost 25,216 traders got rekt. Most of them are now insolvent.Those who are dealing in spot trading and if they do not store their crypto in a reputed exchange, are surely going to lose it and become insolvent.Also, even if you are using a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor and you keep on approving random web3 websites for few bucks, you are tend to lose your money and get insolvent.So the answer is yes. I hope this all makes sense.",

The developers and contributors in Bitcoin never ask or demanding any money, they only focus to develop the project. So if they're want to get Bitcoin, they can mine with their own CPU.If the owner run with investors money, it's not insolvent, but it's scam.",

It happened a number of times. Try searching for the latest bankruptcies that happened in the crypto industry and you will realize that it is no different. Things would only be different if you and you alone own and control your private keys. Meaning, you do not deposit your cryptocurrencies in centralized exchanges and in any custodial wallets. Otherwise, insolvency could happen.",

Exchanges can go into bankruptcy when the funds they have stored in them actually gets stolen or hacked or faces liquidity problems like the FTX scandal. This in turn affects every bitcoin owner that stores their funds on this custodian wallets. For those using a non custodian wallets bankruptcy or insolvency can occur when you use a borrowed money to invest in a coin that either hits the rock or your Wallets get compromised. The only way one who stores in bitcoin can get bankrupted is when he or she faces and emergency and sells off at lower price during a bearish period or also lost his holdings on a hacked wallets.

As for crypto, some of them behave like fiat while others don't, as mentioned above. If both of them lose in value, then your wealth is definitely getting wiped out, regardless of where you store them. Neither of them is invincible to that, just like any other asset.",

If you have Bitcoin and you keep it in your own wallet, practicing self-custody in a proper manner. You cannot experiment insolvency (in terms of satoshis) because you are not trusting your satoshis to anyone. You can't suffer from insolvency if you hold the asset by yourself.On the other hand, if what you actually meant was possible losses due to price variation, that is actually a possible with most assets, including several FIATs (or all of them, depending whom you ask).I would recommend you to do your own research about terms like: liquidity, interest, Dollar cost Average, risk management, leverage, etc.",

If you use Bitcoin in the way it was intended, with one sender, one recipient and no middlemen involved, any wealth you transfer using Bitcoin is incredibly secure.  If you're doing things properly and taking all reasonable precautions, there should be no factors outside of your control that would result in you losing your money.",

      "body": "Insolvent according to the dictionary: \"Unable to meet debts or discharge liabilities; bankrupt.\" and \"Insufficient to meet all debts, as an estate or fund.\" and \"Of or relating to bankrupt persons or entities.\"Bitcoin is different because unlike banks, bitcoin is ownership while banks and traditional finance rely on debt. When you deposit money in a bank, they lend it out to someone else. If they don't take on too much risk and lend to too many people, they will be able to pay back all of your money when you need it. The problem with the traditional financial system is that it relies on someone else having control of your money. If the bank takes on too much risk and they lend your money out to someone who doesn't pay it back, they run the risk of not being able to pay you if you try to withdraw. They would be insolvent.Bitcoin is different because you can control your own money so you don't need to put it into a bank. If you don't put it into a bank, then there is no insolvency because bitcoin is not a third-party that can't make good on it's credits/debits. It's just a protocol. Can someone who uses bitcoin be insolvent? Yes, absolutely. If you borrow money to buy bitcoin and the price dumps, you might not be able to repay your debts. You would be insolvent. Can Bitcoin itself be insolvent? No, because it is not a business or institution or person that manages money on behalf of others and thus it cannot have debt and it cannot be bankrupt.",
