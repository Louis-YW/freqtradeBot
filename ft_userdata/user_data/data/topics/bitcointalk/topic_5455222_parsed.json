It can also be stressful for you to start a business and start an MBA course, the business can suffer from lack of attention and inexperience. I will choose to get my MBA first before starting a proper business with very good profit. Some people may choose to go ahead with the business but everybody's situation is different, for some people that the business is a like a family trade, something that they've known for a long time from a young age, an MBA may not be necessary.Quote from: Wiwo on June 05, 2023, 09:11:57 PMI tried as much as possible to connect this thread with the gambling board and I kind of realize that unless you make some further expeciasion on what you mean and how it relates to this board what will make your thread receive the right attention, if not you will have it deleted since it doesn't meet to the standard of thos board. MBA is a special degree for business administration. The discussion is about if you will like to get that degree before you start a business, or you start a business first.",

He had to relocate and started running his fathers company instead. And he also had friends in the same situation as him. There just isnâ€™t enough jobs out there to fill for mba careers.The only mba degrees that pay well are those from Ivy League schools. You get connections just by going to that school and will land a great career. However they are crazy expensive and you need connections just to get into the school in the first place.",

If you look at the majority of the business conglomerates of today's world, their founders didn't need a business administration degree to make them big. So don't think too much about it. If you want to learn product management, there are multiple certifications available in the market, which you can do at a fraction of the cost of an MBA. That's a good start as well.

The 360-degree view of the business biosphere it provides, the structured roadmap to navigate market tendencies, consumer idiosyncrasies, and the labyrinth of corporate strategy. Yet, let me don my contrarian hat for a moment.Is this alphabet soup necessarily the secret recipe to entrepreneurship success? Are these post-nominal letters a fail-safe to your startup's victory lap? Well, let's not rush to paint everyone with the same brush. The annals of business have their fair share of victorious entrepreneurs, both MBA crowned and not. Instead of that MBA route, why not dive headfirst into the stormy seas of a startup, learning to sail amidst squalls?Cutting the long story short, the crossroads decision of either securing an MBA or jumping onto the startup express hinges largely on personal elements - circumstances, risk appetite, and how you ride the learning curve. As the contemporary adage goes, \"What's sauce for the goose may not be sauce for the gander.\"",

Today, if you know the sector very well, you have a clear idea of what you want to do and you have a certain idea of doing business, you can start, but to scale the business you will probably have to hire people who have MBAs.

Some MBA courses expose students to some workable business strategies and leadership styles that can be beneficial to the business. But it is not a criterion for the success of a business because many business owners have built great businesses without MBA degrees. There are many books and materials both online and offline that can guide business owners in running their business successfully. MBA programs are very expensive and time-consuming but if I can afford the money and time, it will be an addition to my knowledge and experience.

The issue is that MBA is more useful if you have a mature firm, not a new startup or small business. For new companies, you have to earn a reputation by having good products, good customer service, etc., which require more technical knowledge/experience, meanwhile, management is a supporting activity, not the primary activity. Remember, there's no good governance when you are just started, for example, Apple started from a garage.Therefore I'd say just start your company without any degree, as long as you have the technical skill. The governance thing can be added later on.",
