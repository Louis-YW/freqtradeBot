There are only two things that can be seen from the person who spoke: first, either he doesn't know anything about Bitcoin or maybe it's just his way to beat or give fud to BTC so that if there is a panic in the majority of the Bitcoin community and a lot of people sell, they will take advantage. He bought it when the market value went down.That's the style of swindlers and liars in the name of money, meaning he's the type of person who has greed in his personal nature to get what he wants.",

I think is time to just let the words these guys are saying slide by without taking it to heart.The annoying part is that these guys knows how to make their words get into many that views their videos and when it fails you won't hear anything concerning why they gave a false predictions.",

No one is a perfect predictor of the market, which is why we need to be careful. Even at that, I see no reason why a good trader would call Bitcoin a bearish market recently, not even in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war because technically, it's bullish in the long-term, this is not hidden.It's possible Bitcoin holds a bullish stance for the rest of this year, I don't see anything changing that for now.",

Only few people like us on this forum and those that have the indepth knowledge about bitcoin have the knowledge to know that some people are making stupid comments about bitcoin price going up or down.If there is any analyst that is making prediction that bitcoin is going down without explaining how the price will later increase significantly, those are bad analysts.People do not also know that anyone can be analysts as long as they are predicting the market. That is why you will see some analysts predicating bullrun while some other analysts will be predicting bear market at the same time. I am myself analyst and I know the bear market is over for now, even if bitcoin will still go back to $25000 because we are moving closer to the next halving block.",

To be honest, that's simply a saying, which is why I didn't believe it. However, if something similar to that happens, the prices of Bitcoin would be affected, especially if the individual who stated it is well-known. If you recall what happened to Dogecoin's price as a result of Elon Musk's simple tweet, \"Dogecoin is the people's crypto.\", the price exploded. I understand that individuals nowadays are too educated to believe in a simple tweet, but others see it as an opportunity. Many people pass up that opportunity. However, the person who's mentioned in the Op is not Elon Musk or someone of similar fame, which is why no one or a small number of people will buy the tweet.",

It just so happens that the Bitcoin price was pumped down after a very smelly mouth uttered words that could cause panic for some investors who held Bitcoin. Greed could be the mastermind behind all this, he is deliberately spreading panic in the Bitcoin market and then they will take advantage when the market goes down.Such market manipulation will never make big investors panic easily, I will try to hold the assets that I have managed to collect even though Bitcoin is fluctuating downwards because I am very confident that Bitcoin will return to its highest price.",

Depends on what you would really be that ending up on doing because sentiments like this is never been something new whether do came from with those known personalities or popular person or with some average joes on which it is really just the same. The only difference on here is that there are really that those price calls and sentiments which turns out to be totally opposite on what they are doing. Specially on making some bearish sentiment but actually they've known something that there would really be some huge buys laterwards and making the price going up instead of dumping. This is why its never been that ideal that you should really be making yourself that get easily believe on whatever words that you would really be hearing out on this space. Always better that you should really be that sticking with your own methods and ways on how you do handle yourselfwith this market.Going down big?It could be yes or it could be no, but since we are really not still on halving season then i wont really be that shocked if the market would really be still making out somethat one time kind of dump or decrease into its price before we could really rocket into its price. There's no way on knowing on what would the future holds or what it would look like.The importance on here is that you do really know on what to do and assume out things that your analysis would really go out and would happen.",
