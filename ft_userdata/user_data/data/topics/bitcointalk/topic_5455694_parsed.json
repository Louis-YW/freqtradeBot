  "content": "Good afternoon, forum members. Now I'm working on my own token, presale, earlier in 2022 I've launched several projects, after the events of TerraLuna, FTX the launch of new tokens became irrelevant, now in the season of altcoins and memcoin boom the launch of new tokens is relevant again)).Test launched a week ago to test, everything still works. Looking for an investor partner to launch. The amount of investment needed is $7500. Implementation period of 1 week. Payback x3-x5 of the investment. All the technical part I undertake, for the project found ambassadors, bloggers to promote, marketing channels, site placement are all found. I know how everything is arranged) as a guarantee for the investor before the sale will give a pledge in tokens in advance. The project is not a scam, hanypot, etc. Â There will be a full audit, verification of the project, prepared documentation.If interested, send a message in L.S. or in Telegram.",

It seems interesting to know. To my knowledge, this is no longer the way to convince people no matter how good the project is. Market interest is unpredictable these days.Unless you can vouch that return, then send loan proposals to local banks around you instead.",

Therefore, I am looking for a partner on the forum.I have another branch on the forum, you can go and read there I answer more questions.Thanks for the question all the best to you.",

I didn't know that it violated the rules of the forum. I thought it was okay since the threads were not in 1 category. Thanks for letting me know about that. I want to apologize to the forum for that, sorry I really didn't know friends",
