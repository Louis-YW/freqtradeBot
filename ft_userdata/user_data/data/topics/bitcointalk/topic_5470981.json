They have a thought where Bitcoin is haram because having no physical appearance and interest is always related to immoralBitcointalk forum member CageMabok post to this thread: I have also made a study about the halal and haram of Bitcoin for a long time because I live in a Muslim-majority environment. However, after I studied it in depth and also asked the Islamic religious advisor here by giving quite logical and concrete examples, it turns out that Bitcoin is not haram even though it is not stated to be halal.",

According to what he had said collection of interest is wrong. For this reason even the Islamic banks don't pay interest to the consumers. Recently one such incident happened with Indian government not giving permission to Islamic banks to operate within India as they don't collect interest and the same might affect the other banks. With this bitcoin doesn't have any connect to be considered against Islamic law.",

There are Islamic interpretations of Bitcoin as haram, but there are also Islamic interpretations of Bitcoin as halal. I think the problem with this is that there isn't an objective basis for an official declaration. It's probably just about how these clerics perceive Bitcoin. And they perceive it differently.

Bitcoin spot trading is halal, because there is an agreement on the price of the buyer and seller, so it is legal/halal. What is haram about a transaction is if there is interest, such as interest-bearing staking usually called APY with large or small interest. Gambling is clearly forbidden in Islam. Interest-bearing loans are also Haram.When it comes to Bitcoin Futures, it still needs to be studied further, I don't dare say that Futures trading is halal or haram because it requires expert research. Future trading is capable of providing big profits and also big losses. From a personal opinion, Future trading tends to be Haram because it is related to loans/leverage and interest on leveraged loans.",

I don't think all of those are true. At the very least, their influence on the market is arguably low compared to the US or Chinese market. Not to mention I doubt most of those traders will follow the interpretation that directly affects their means to make money.There is really no need to force people to sell Bitcoin as low as possible if your target is just to make a profit. Just keep buying and DCA your way and stop being panicky every time there is bad news. If my experience tells me anything unless you have a ton of capital trying to change the trend instead of following the trend is futile.",

Those who support money and deem Bitcoin haram support a system with less value.Bitcoin's digital nature confuses many, especially traditional investors. The hasty labeling as Haram stems from ignorance and hostility to new technology. They overlook Bitcoin's resemblance to the gold standard.

What you do with the currency and how you acquire it, decides which one. For example if you steal it from someone, it is haram. But if you get paid in bitcoin for an honest work it is halal. That simple.There is also nothing wrong with trading or with interest. Some people are confusing interest with Riba (closest translation is Usury). It is basically \"unjust, exploitative gains made in trade or business\", although Wikipedia is not the most accurate article but you can read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riba",

The term haram in finance is majority connected to gambling and paying interest on loans. If crypto trading is a sin then every form of buying and selling is also haram. In crypto trading just as in any other trade, you buy a coin to sell to another trader and make a profit. It is not like gambling where you transfer your money to another person without receiving any asset. But in trading, you have to buy an asset and sell it to make a profit. It's also the same thing as going to buy some oranges and selling them later to make a profit. Some Islamic scholars have also claimed that crypto trading or investment is haram because it is speculative. But many Islamic nation holds large gold reserves which is also a speculative asset.",

First of all what do you understand by haram? If you understand what haram is, you'll not be thinking that Muslim will sell their bitcoin so you can buy at cheaper trade. Anything that is haram is considered prohibited and Muslim stay away from it. Trading is buying or selling of goods and services. So if trading is regarded as haram in your own understanding then the bitcoin those Muslim are holding will remain in their wallet forever since trading is haram. Meaning that they can not sell it. If you are waiting for Arab people to sell their bitcoin before you buy, then you'll wait forever  For your information, Arab is not Islam and Islam is not Arab.
