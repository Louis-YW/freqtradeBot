I think that governments try to beef with people, they claim false claims about how cryptocurrencies are evil and how they are used for money laundering, which pushes people to protect cryptos and tell them counter arguments, like, arguments against fiats, how they are used for money laundering and so on. I believe that in the end, it leads governments to have more arguments to support CBDCs. It will give them total control over everyone's money and the governments will say that they'll fix the issue of money laundering and terrorism but we all know that nothing will be fixed, there will only be more control over people and more power for them.",

That's good but corruption and evil practices is an act I don't expect to stop in this life unless the end of the world comes. As long as the world keeps [s getting tougher and tougher every single day, people involved in this act will keep increasing their game.  They see committing crimes as the only way to survive in a difficult time. If there is no other option, then we shouldn't expect them to stop. In fact, more people will be joining the game more and more. So, have it in mind from today that crimes cannot be eliminated from the world but the level at which it is being done can be harnessed if the government put the necessary effort.",

Somehow its expected that they would say those things especially that they want to manipulate peoples mind that banking system is more better rather than crypto.They don't like this industry because they are not earning anything if lots of people will used crypto. Those things mentioned is also happening on fiat that's why its really crazy that they always say bad about crypto while the fact is this is just an alternative currency by people using it online.Government could fight money laundering and they cannot just blame everything on crypto also its dumb reasoning for banker if they think that way.",

Unless you move the transaction through a mixing service, there's no way to hide the money trail. Coins like Monero or Zcash actually makes sense when it comes to money laundering. I am sure banks have their own reasons for blaming cryptocurrency for all such illicit transactions. But as OP mentioned, some things can never be eradicated from the system, no matter how much regulations you bring in to the plate. So banks will consider cryptos as their soft target to blame because no one is there to own the blame. But that doesn't change the reality!",

Another thing that has to be greatly considered is the amount of money that is being used. The truth is that it's also another major thing people into money laundering take note of because it's more difficult to kill traces the bigger the money is.This is the reason why they have to break it into smaller units of transactions that you find averagely on the Blockchain. They use monero most times as trace killers by swapping to it  Hodling for a while and swapping back to other coins like bitcoin.",
