      "body": "First: I have no experience mining. But I know a thing or two about energy, and that's where I'd start. Do the math: how often do you have excess electricity available? What do you do with it now: do you get paid to sell it to the grid, or do you have negative prices when that happens? How much water do you want to heat up, starting from which temperature and going how hot? How many hours per day does this happen?My gut feeling tells me it's not going to be worth it, but it's always fun to see the numbers. The next question would be how hot the water coming out of a miner could be, followed by how much hot water you use in a day.Some made up numbers to get an idea: if you have 1 kW excess electricity for 8 hours on a day in summer, that's 8 kWh. That produces 28.8 MJ of heat. Let's assume you manage to capture 80% of that heat in your water, that's 23 MJ, enough to increase the temperature of 100 liter water by 55oC.Assuming you'll only use this around summer, and can't use it when you're on vacation, you'll be able to use this maybe 110 days of the year. That's 880 hours mining, or 10% of the year. Taking mikeywith's numbers, that's $70 per year in mining revenue. A year later, when the difficulty is much higher, your revenue will be much lower unless you upgrade your miner.",

      "body": "I don't know why we bring up the aspect of money here, we're talking about 1kw at max generation hours so if we go by the most efficient things out there it will be 2$ a day as mikey said, but, that was assuming 24/7, and you're on extra PV, that would be 8 hours a day depending on where you live ? 60 cents? I think what we need to clear up first is how is your electricity system setup-up, do you have batteries or are you grid-tied or other, if you don't have storage capacity for the extra electricity then there is an avalanche of problems including the gear not working at all during one cloudy day because your already strained system can't generate enough extra power.The other thing as heaters were mentioned, those were heaters that run on the grid, you have here a boiler that runs when you have extra energy, so for the comfort it's a big no. I understand the hobby part but it's going to be a pain in the ass to make it actually usable,  and if at any moment you're bringing the $ in the discussion it's already a futile attempt, with 150-200 you can get a water boiler, it draws around 2-3 kwh a day to keep the water warm if you don't use so you don't need to power up a gear again to reheat it (if you can ) and you don't need to release water if you reach boiling point either.Quote from: LoyceV on September 02, 2023, 08:18:02 AMMy gut feeling tells me it's not going to be worth it, but it's always fun to see the numbers.
