  "content": "Guys I guest the university of wyoming (UW) has taken this bold step legitimizing BTC research.This was been mentioned at the Bitcoin Conference at Nashville institute by DR. Bradley's Reltler,\" An expert in philosophy and co-author of Resistance money\" Which says QuoteKey points -  The BRI, housed within the College of Arts and Sciences at UW, will emphasize research on the philosophical and economic aspects of Bitcoin.-The institute aims to cultivate the field of Bitcoin research by offering dedicated faculty roles, incentivizing impactful academic work, and integrating research into course curricula.-The BRI plans to host annual summer workshops, research paper prizes, public writing prizes, and outreach events. A particular focus will be on engaging with journalists and lawmakers to inform media discourse and public policy on Bitcoin.- As a nonprofit, the BRI is accepting Bitcoin donations to support its research. Donations in Bitcoin will be held as part of the institute’s strategy to allocate 4% of investments to Bitcoin.-Wyoming is emerging as a leading state in Bitcoin adoption and research, bolstered by pro-Bitcoin figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis and Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia  Bank.https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/07/40014390/university-of-wyoming-launches-first-ever-academic-bitcoin-research-instituteThe adoption of the cryptocurrencies in the institute's is trying to establish the growth interest of young youth academics to make more research on digital assets.So Guys what your take on this???",

But there are people from my country who have graduated with a Master's in Master of Science in Blockchain and Digital Currency at the University of Nicosia. He was the first person to have that title.  If you look at the web https://www.unic.ac.cy/iff/research/blockchain-crypto-assets/ I think they also have a concentration in Blockchain technology. So Blockchain education seems to be indeed a future. The world has already started a lot of education for this future technology. I think the more time passes, the more universities will open majors on Blockchain.",

Secondly, I will love to ask, Does the school accept Bitcoin as a means of payment for school fees? Because I think that will be the first step to letting the world know it's actually an institution that prioritize Bitcoin, when it's use as a means of payment in the entire institution.",

At least the theoretical aspect so that when they become capable of investing or going further in the knowledge they can do that knowing full well that they have elementary/basic knowledge of the technology. Actually it is also important for the tutors should not make it seem like a financial advise because it may trigger the student to start using their upkeeps, tuition fee, and library money to start investing In Bitcoin. Since they are still student it will be difficult for them to manage the investment to be successful and it will affect them academically.",

In my country there are also several universities that do the same thing with their academics who research blockchain bitcoin, cryptocurrency, there are many titles that we can find. That means now the world of education really needs to be involved in technological sophistication because blockchain is the gateway to a more sophisticated digital era in the future.In theory of course, this leads to something positive, but it is also inseparable from the negative side where those who understand blockchain technology often use their knowledge to build fraudulent projects and it is dominated by young academics who now understand how blockchain works.",

I also find it very interesting, as a philosophy major, that the head of the Institute is not from Economics, Business, or Tech, but an Associate Professor of Philosophy. I'm not sure whether it's news, though, as looking at the official website I can see that the Institute already as a lot of outputs, dating back at least to 2021. They have academic papers, a book, opeds, and educational videos. So it's great that it exists. Was it unofficial before, and now it became an official structural entity of the university? Or has there been a Research Institute for 3 years now?",

The false narrative that Bitcoin consumes much electricity and contributes greatly to global warming has been debunked, thanks to many scholarly works. There is also a need to support some of these institutions because many anti-bitcoin forces are sponsoring some dubious researchers that come up with manipulated findings. Establishment of of this institute is a positive development to the Bitcoin community because it will increase Bitcoin awareness and education. They can also engage in research or discoveries which can be beneficial to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Because I think that will be the first step to letting the world know it's actually an institution that prioritize Bitcoin, when it's use as a means of payment in the entire institution.I checked the school website and the donation option. They only accept fiat currency, and you even have to fill out a form that requires personal information. That's quite discouraging for a Bitcoin research institute.",

Don't get me wrong, I am not one of those people who ignore philosophy, I admire it and the part it plays in the world to move forward, but it is just dictating something that will not have a direct impact on the price, it's as simple as that. Moreover, economic research is not guaranteed, it feels like it is going to be done but we are not sure about it and I think that's the biggest issue. We should realize that we are going to end up with a lot of issues if we are not careful and this is one of them, if we keep making these grand claims and then fail to deliver, there will be a lot of people who will be disappointed and not happy about that situation.",

This will give a lot of people the opportunity and freedom to invest and carry out transactions with bitcoin in the country without fear of being rejected. It is just a matter of time and we will have more bitcoin research institutes all over the world duly approved by the governments of that country. Only then can I boldly say bitcoin has actually gone global. Quote from: Dailyscript on August 02, 2024, 11:28:10 AMIf Bitcoin is the future then it is important that the younger ones who are coming up need to know and understand the technology in all aspect. A lot of information have been flying around about bitcoin, some which are accurate and many others which are false too. The younger ones who are also the future of bitcoin might not be getting the right knowledge, especially if they are getting it from critics of Bitcoin and some unverified sources. A proper research institute will be doing us good because these young people would be privileged to learn from those knowledgeable in the field which will prompt them to research even further. If this is done well, I have no doubt bitcoin will be in safe hands in the future.",
