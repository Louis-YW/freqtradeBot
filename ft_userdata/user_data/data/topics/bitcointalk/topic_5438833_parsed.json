  "content": "https://i.imgur.com/pWf2GXG.pngThe project we know has made a reservation for listing on an exchange called okx.Then, sent them the $ they asked for and was promised a 100% refund if the listing was revoked at any time.And about 4 months passed, and okx did not approve the listing.So rightfully asked for a 100% refund under the contract, but they said they would deduct about 15%. That is, the 100% refund they promised was proven false.And, by tracking their accounts, it was confirmed that several people already divided the money like a multi-level company.However, the project team recognized that they had made the wrong choice, gave up 15%, and requested a refund of the remaining amount.However, okx initially paid a small amount, constantly delayed the date, and eventually started acting suspiciously of refusal to pay.They sent a small amount of money in several installments, and the refund has not been completed even after more than 50 days have passed.Their excuses were changed from time to time, and the refund team leader, \"Tom Jung\", continued to make excuses.At first, they lied that the system would automatically pay in installments,Second, it will be refunded soon, so sending $1k first is the refund signal.Thirdly, they said that it was a holiday period and they would return it all within that period,They didn't complete the refund after all, even after the holidays.It was all just a joke on their comedy.With these examples, we indirectly realized that the top exchanges in the industry are fraudulent organizations such as ftx. As this appears to be a sign of a huge financial scam that will affect many potential project owners,We decided to proceed with these warnings to prevent numerous damages.I sincerely hope that many people will sympathize with us, join us, and root out these social evils.We will soon share the okx listing reservation notarization promised by the project team, detailed information about the okx China refund team, and submit evidence of the trading account tracking, revealing that this is the truth.We will gather all the evidence soon and update it.We will also share this with the numerous social and scam reporting communities we know.* Evidence such as the okx listing contract will be shared soon.",

However, I see these as a mere write-up because I can not find any tangible evidence here to back up your claims. This is a serious accusations which will affect the reputation of the exchange for which I believe you know that and the exchange you are accusing is not a small unknown figure in the Crypto market. I call all these you have written literature because there are no tangible evidence even if you said at the ending of revealing some but at the initial complaint, it would have been nice you uploaded the evidence to back up your claims otherwise people would see it as a cheap blackmail against the exchange.",

Let me know by PM if you guys are up to it.But mate, you have no way out, unless court of law. But even there, on most contracts exchanges keep 25% if the listing procedures are not taken to the end. Be happy you took some money out.OKex is not the type of exchange that will back out on just 100k$, it's a really too small ammount for them to have demages on their image.",

You see the reaction of other members, right?With this topic where you accuse somebody of scamming but you have no proof you simply shot yourself in the foot and everyone will feel tempted to not believe your story and think it's something completely else as it happens a lot around here.And this is not helping you either:QuoteWith these examples, we indirectly realized that the top exchanges in the industry are fraudulent organizations such as ftx. As this appears to be a sign of a huge financial scam that will affect many potential project owners,OKX just decided not to list your token or coin or whatever, FTX played with people's money they've entrusted to it, it's a completely different story, and to be honest, I simply couldn't care less about \"projects\" that have to pay to get listed on exchanges. I don't know if your \"project\" has someone working in advertising or marketing but it would be better to let somebody else be in charge of this.",

I believe they become victim of a listing agent fraud that’s why Okx is having a hard time to refund the funds since it was already shared to the agent who referred them for exchange listing. The payment for listing agent is upfront once the client paid the fee. Probably they are just holding a piece of paper that contains the contract but didn’t signed by anyone from Okx or some random guy which they are still verifying. This kind of case is very hard to prove and it needs a trial court for them to refund the money. I see same scenario like this on different exchange like Binance but of course no one care to listen on this kind if issue it’s not their business to interfere on this matter. They can use social media instead the forum if they really serious to fight against Okx since Okx is active there.",
