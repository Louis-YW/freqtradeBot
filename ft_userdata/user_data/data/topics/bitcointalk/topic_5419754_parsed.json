In addition, another way one could look at it, could be what cap connotes when they say idiomatically, \"He who the cap fits, let them wear it.\" It's my way of rationalizing it any time I come across a cap avatar. By the way, you're right. WO is the part of the forum to find users who aren't into paid campaigns.",

Not really, as you can still be a part of signature campaign and use cap as avatar and it all depends on whether your signature requires you to wear a specific avatar. For example, in my campaign I can use whatever I want as avatar and in some campaigns like BestChange you can use hat as avatar but you have to put their log on it.",

And they are busy trying to improve the bitcoin forum. They have no intention of earning Because they use who else and they only aim to improve the forum.No this is not the case as @Rikafip already told you about this and if your campaign allows you to customise your avatar according to your own preferences then you can have it while some don't allow it.Speaking about hat gang then you can see those who are prominent members in WO thread have these hats as their Avatar but it doesn't imply they are not joining paid campaign.You can see @fillippone who also has hat on his profile as avatar but he is member of Chip Mixer campaign but they allow to wear any avatar so this is the case as you understand.But if you want to know the history then you have links above to check and be more familiar with it and know how it all started and they became WO hat gang.",

Would really appreciate that. ThanksQuote from: LoyceV on November 09, 2021, 09:03:47 AMSince you have to ask, you probably don't know those originated from the Wall Observer thread. User xhomerx10 makes them for regulars.The hat is sort of a badge for regular user in WO thread, who discuss things regularly there while active on the forum. I often go into that thread to read around even though I don't have any posts there. So the hat is a kind of award given to regular members of the WO thread like @JayJuanGee, @El duderino_, @fillippone, @vapourminer, @BobLawblaw, @nutildah and many others.Almost all of the top 10 posters in the WO thread use hat avatars, cool for sure.Code:1.

At first, when I saw someone change their avatar into cap with different designs, I thought it was some kind of promotion of their services or whatever they wanted people to know but later on it became a trend. You can say that it is like a gang in bitcointalk forum much like the other forum gang and you can say that it is a Avatar Cap gang which their emblem is a cap with any designs that the member wanted and you can also say that the founder is the one who created it.",
