  "content": "I need someone who already used Coinbase in the UK. A friend wants to buy some BTC/USDT using his bank account, but can't figure out how. He gave me his credentials, but from what I can see, he can only use his card (with a limit of 300 GBP per week) or PayPal account. There is no option to choose a bank account from the payment methods list. Any thoughts as to why is that?",

      "body": "So as an update (and bump) for this, I contacted the support team I was given this link: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/depositing-or-withdrawing-fiat-money/available-servicesWhich is pretty vague and doesn't really explain what could be wrong with the account. I asked the support for more specifics, and they said they couldn't give any.I'd appreciate it if someone could shed some light here. And maybe suggest a better alternative to Coinbase.",
