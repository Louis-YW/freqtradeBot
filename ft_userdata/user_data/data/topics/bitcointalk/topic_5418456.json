Certainly you did not expect bitcoins to keep going down, at some point we all expected that there will be a bounce back, but maybe this is too sudden and too quick for us to start calling it start of the bull season.It is good news but I will also say you shouldn't get your hopes too high so you don't get disappointed if it doesn't go your way. We are expecting a bull run, maybe it has already started happening yes, but our major concern should remain how to get more bitcoins and hodl safely.",

Don't be confident with everything that we see in the market despite being favorable to everyone. It's just a little movement that we've seen before and how much more if it's already over again?We're aware that it will fill another all-time high but it's just too early to say that it has ended already. This could be a trap or what but all I am saying is get yourselves prepared for the best and for the worst, if it hasn't come yet.",

But, I'm still not confident the bear season will end up shortly, not even this year. I was just happy to see the market stay high compared to the last bear season where we are almost at the very dip and many people become hopeless during that time. But for now, I'd see great hope form the majority and the willingness to take risks and hold for many years until the full market recovery comes.

After the period of decline we have experienced, we are currently in a pause period for a while. As far as I'm concerned, this period will continue in this way for a little longer. From time to time, there will be small-scale rises in the market. But I think that there are at least 1.5 years for the bull market to start exactly.",

But I believe it's really a coincidence on the monthly closing candle. If you take a look, few days left before the monthly candle and this is very important to traders or speculators. Some of their analysis could be a buy signal because of some of their analysis and that causes the price to go pump days before the end of this month. For me, this is a good sign that we can see some good price actions next month.",

I think it's too early to celebrate the return of the bullish runs until the major resistance at $22600 is broken else the price might pullback, but on once the resistance is broken and price retraced and turn the the resistance to support then it's will obvious that the bulls had returned to the market, though it's good that the price make some considerable pump atleast this will bring some relief to hodlers who had endured the bearish runs for so long, of course the bearish runs wouldn't last forever there must be a season of bullish run too and historically the price of bitcoin always experience a massive pump at a certain periods.",

Congratulations in advance to those who bought low and those hodling for a long time.There are some reasons to believe that Bitcoin is moving in a bottom range but pay attention in the word 'range'. A range has upper and lower bands and you should know there are outliers beyond a range.The market basically should have a massive shake out and I believe we will have it when Bitcoin surprisingly crashes towards $13,000. All weak hands should be out, all gamblers should be killed by forced liquidations, before a new bull run kicks off officially.Is Bitcoin bottom there yet? Fear & Greed, Pi Cycle Top / BottomBitcoin is moving under its Realized price for a while and the period is almost the same as it was in Nov 2018 to April 2019. If history repeats, it should ends soon.Pi cycle top indicator gives me a thought that Bitcoin should have a good bounce back to about $40,000 and it should be corrected back. A next time will be an official jump into a new bull run.People are still very fearful according to Bitcoin Fear and Greed IndexQuoteThere is likely going to be a new all time high to be achieved before this year comes to an end. If you can, fill up your bag but do your own research.It won't. New all time highs are reached in bull market, not in bear market, not within a few months after a bear market ended. When a bear market ended, it needs a few months to wipe out fear, hesitation, disbelief so that a new all time high can be seen.QuoteWhat do you all think about the sudden bounce back and price increase on Bitcoin of lately?Normal movement, nothing special.",

This can be an encouragement for crypto users, because basically we will never know when the bulls will arrive, because it is very difficult for us to predict, we can give predictions but we should not expect too much because if we expect too much we will definitely be disappointed , we should respond normally when there is news about the increase in crypto prices.",

We might not recover faster if the war between Russia and Ukraine does not stop. You also argue that the 4 year cycle has been broken. However, it has not yet been broken because we are still in early in the cycle. Next year will be telling, I reckon.In any case, yes next year we might begin to agree on one of your arguments. Slow economic recovery implies the 4 year cycle being broken and a faster recovery than expected would imply the 4 year cycle continues.@mk4. I very much agree!",

Now that the price of Bitcoin hit $21,000 few hours ago in the market, showed that before next month ending the price will reach $50,000 for those that bought when the price was $18,000 or $17,500 to start releasing their bitcoins to make a good profits.
