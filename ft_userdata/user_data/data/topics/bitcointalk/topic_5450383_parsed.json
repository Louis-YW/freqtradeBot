  "content": "Hey guys...  If you missed the ARB airdrop, there's prolly more projects out there that will have their own airdrop.  There's another L2 roll up out there called zkSync which could airdrop later this year.  Here's a guide that could give us a chance in getting some free tokens.Edit:  First before first...  Read and learn more about the project and always read the docs.https://zksync.io/https://era.zksync.io/docs/First, bridge some ETH via Orbiter Finance.https://www.orbiter.finance/Then once you get some ETH to the network, you could go on ahead and play around their live projects.I suggest playing around with SpaceFi, Mute.io and SyncSwap.https://www.spacefi.io/https://mute.io/https://syncswap.xyz/Use these protocols to swap and do some LP'ing to get your total volume and usage in the network up.  When I was playing around Arbitrum, I had my total volume to a tad more than 10k USD in a couple of months or so without realizing it.  I didn't even think Arbitrum would really have an airdrop.  I felt I just got lucky.  So if you wanna get lucky with zkSync and be eligible for their airdrop, you have to use the project and the protocols developed in it.Here's a tip, put most of your volume in SyncSwap and use it the most as they haven't released their own token yet and could also have their own airdrop soon.  There are other protocols that could help you get lucky in getting your address eligible for the airdrop.  I haven't used them tho.Mint Square and zkAnimals.  Mint Square is zkSync's NFT marketplace, zkAnimals is a NFT project which could have its own airdrop soon.  Keep on the look out.https://mintsquare.io/https://zkanimal.xyz/That's it for me.  If you guys like more content like this, just drop a line and let's find more projects.A little caveat:  This guide doesn't assure you that you'll be eligible if they do have an airdrop.",

      "body": "Thank you for this guide. The zkSync Era project is really powerful and is much stronger than the Arbitrum, and has so far managed to raise millions of dollars, which is the layer 2 solution on ETH. I participated in it and did everything you mentioned in the topic a month ago, and I have great certainty that there is a massive airdrop that will come in the end because the CEO of the project mentioned that 2/3 of the token supply will go to the community and I hope that these are not just false promises and follow the example of what the SUI team did.Quote from: tokeweed on April 27, 2023, 02:26:23 PMA little caveat:  This guide doesn't assure you that you'll be eligible if they do have an airdrop. I think that participating once in the main network is not correct, but each person must keep a good amount of his money to spend it also on fees and distribute it over 6-8 months.",

Actually even on arbitrum there are a lots of sybil. Even though they say that they are against it. They cant really push them off since the project knew that they are contirbuting to the network TVL in terms of liquidty and volume to some dapps. This will help them in some way and negating those would definitely bad on their side too. Personally I hate sybil, since they are milking projects but its up to the network how they will remedy that.",

And since there are no official guarantees that early participants will be rewarded, participants will be careful to create additional accounts.",
