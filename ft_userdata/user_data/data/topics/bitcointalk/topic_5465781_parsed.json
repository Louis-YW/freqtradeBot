A gambler have to minimize the timing for gambling, minimize the money for gambling and then he should overcome it by involving just one time in a week. I think if a person is so busy in gambling that he initiate selling of whole things to utilize the amount in gambling then getting rid of such habit will takes too long time and gambler himself has no idea that what is bad or good for him because he is in continues trying of getting more money so in such greed he loss his each and everything even his own value in a society.",

And how long do you need time to break away from the addiction that has been experienced?I have never been addicted to gambling, but I did come close to becoming one. The first thing I did when I almost lost control in gambling was to stop the gambling activities that I was doing for quite a long time, up to several days. I need to do this to calm myself and control my emotions. and I will return to gambling once my emotions are controlled.There is another thing that I do, namely by asking someone to accompany me to play. so that when I lose control, then someone will try to revive me.And I'm a bit pessimistic if someone who is already heavily addicted to gambling, can wake up in a short period of time. They will realize their bad behavior when they have lost everything, including money and the people closest to them.",

Those people that had suffered from gambling addiction are always far away from gambling activities because that is the only way the spirit of gambling can locate it way back to them. People that escape addiction are mostly seen having lost of interest in any gambling activities because that is the best way to keep themselves safe from it.",

I therefore think that some people are addicted to spending much on Gambling more than they are supposed to all because they have the money to fund the habit. Take that source from them and they will hit the hard rock and come to a realization of setting budget for their gambling lifestyle. Glad to extract this idea from your story.",

This is the main thing that you should really be avoiding on the time that you do gamble is on which you shouldn't really be that letting yourself that addicted. Play on the amount which you can afford to lose and never ever consider on chasing up your losses or making gambling as your source of income because having these kind of motives or intents would really be a catalyst for you to play even more until you do run down flat on which it is really that very a common scenario.I myself, cant be considered going into a point on being an addicted gambler but cant really deny that there are really moments which i do chase out my losses and bust up everything in the end.On that time then i do make out myself some self realizations and telling to myself that i shouldn't really do that in next time because it would really be bringing out that devastation on your bankroll.",

It may take some time, but in the end you'll feel better and gradually break free from it.Attempting to quit your hard addiction on your own can be extremely difficult, but seeking help from others or consulting a doctor can in my opinion make the process much smoother and more effective, as one of my friend was really addicted to gambling but after the help he got from others he left gambling for good and now his life is a way much better.",

Stop Blaming Yourself: Continual self-blame can exacerbate feelings of guilt after a relapse. Remember, everyone makes mistakes. If you fall back into old habits, simply refocus on your original goal without added drama.2. Rationalize and Monitor Your Activity: Keep a detailed record of all your gambling actions. Understand that there's no such thing as \"lucky streaks.\" We can't predict random outcomes, regardless of any fake mathematical models full of data we might believe in (reality is much complex and those models are garbage). The house always win.3. Limit Your Exposure to Risk: For example, bring limited cash, don't bring a credit card when you gamble. Also, consider unsubscribing from online gambling platforms (autobanned if possible).4. Be Cautious in Emotionally Fragile States: Especially when you're seeking a dopamine boost. This is particularly important after significant losses, as it's been proven that our perception of risk diminishes, potentially leading to even greater losses in a short period.",

      "body": "First of all, it is important to remember that every gambling addict has a different case in how they deal with their addiction problems. One more thing, if someone has recovered from his addiction, he will automatically stop and will not play it again. let's take an example in the case of smoking, someone who is addicted to smoking will stop when he has completely recovered from his addiction. Likewise with gambling, although in the case of gambling it is a little more complicated and complex than cigarette addiction.So okay, I'll tell you a little story from my personal experience. In short, I have known gambling from a young age, starting with traditional gambling, then moving to land casinos and now I am involved in online gambling. In the past, I gambled uncontrollably even though I experienced many losses and sacrificed to fulfill my gambling passion. I experienced a phase where the lowest point in life, I think there are many who experienced something similar to my experience. Then, did I stop gambling, for some time yes, but in fact I got involved in gambling again. whether I have recovered from my addiction, I can confirm not 100%.I don't know how long it will take me to be at peace with myself, but throughout my experience, I have learned many lessons that I can learn. believe me there is no better theory than that we are in control of ourselves, that is, we are the ones who control what we do. I mean, you have complete control over yourself. it's just that the problem is, in the phase when we gamble, even with the idea of ​​having fun. where we lose, even with money that is ready to be lost. in fact, our emotions are already involved in it. dopamine, endorphins, adrenaline, satisfaction, anger, are triggers for us to be compelled to make deposits again. At this point there are two consequences, winning or losing. the problem is, we will not stop in the future until the money we bet runs out. usually, after that we will regret it. not because winning will stop us from gambling, but because of losing. I mean, after the money in our account runs out.Then what is the solution, for me, now gambling is a means of entertainment, nothing more. If you lose today, there is another day to have fun again without having to chase losses. Remember, it is very important to involve understanding, experience and responsibility. If you can do that, you will only gamble with the idea of ​​having fun regardless of winning or losing. end it when it's no longer fun. I think it's too long what I said, hope it helps you.",

What I did might be helpful to me but it might not work for you. Privacy is important so people might not tell you about their experiences but I think some basic steps will help addicts break free. Some of these points are from personal experience.1. You should accept that you are an addict and confirm that it is affecting you negatively. 2. Decide to quit and be willing to pay the price.3. Have a gambling plan and don't ever exceed your budget. 4. Stay away from people or situations that trigger the urge to game uncontrollably.5.

If you're already having doubts over your gambling (you think you're slowly succumbing to gambling addiction), most likely you are already, in which case you should actually quit outright. No slow down from gambling and all that stuff, just straight up quitting. Quit for a significant amount of time, until such a time where you are positive you're cured of the impulse to gamble. After which, you should instill discipline strictly. Create a plan and stick to it. Do not make any form of excuses upon yourself or whatever, just follow through with it.
