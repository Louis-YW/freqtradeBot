It argues that, while a flawless scaling solution does not exist yet, Layer 2s including Optimistic and Validity Rollups hold the most potential for increased scalability with a good tradeoff for the blockchain trilemma.– More precisely, optimistic and Validity Rollups, using ZKP technology, will be key in shaping the future of Ethereum by enabling trustless, complex, and permissionless transactions at scale. \"",

As an investor, I will only play the game phase by phase That's so true, i believe arbitrum and optimism will have better future then all zk rollups and the recent collaboration between optimism and Coinbase is the perfect proof, the competition will be between optimism and arbitrum for who will lead the layer 2 solution and in my opinion the only zk rollup that could enter the competition with them is zksync",

      "body": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently shared his opinion that ZK-Rollups are likely to be the primary Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. He compared the two solutions, Optimistic Rollups and ZK-Rollups, and highlighted that ZK-Rollups are faster in terms of moving funds.Optimistic Rollups and ZK-Rollups are both Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum. Optimistic Rollups use a more optimistic approach to scaling, which means that they process transactions off-chain and assume that they are valid unless proven otherwise. On the other hand, ZK-Rollups use zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions, which allows them to be more secure and private.While both solutions have their advantages and disadvantages, it appears that ZK-Rollups are gaining more attention and adoption in the crypto community. According to L2beat, a website that tracks the TVL (total value locked) in Layer 2 solutions, ZK-Rollups have a higher TVL than Optimistic Rollups. Additionally, there are more ZK-Rollup projects in development, as listed on zkrollups.io.It is important to note that many of these ZK-Rollup projects do not yet have their own tokens. This means that their success and adoption may not be reflected in the current market trends. However, it is clear that ZK-Rollups are a promising solution for scaling Ethereum and addressing its current scalability issues.",
