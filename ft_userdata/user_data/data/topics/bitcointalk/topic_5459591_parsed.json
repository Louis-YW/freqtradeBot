  "content": "It's built around one of Bitcoin's core ideas: that independent, unbiased, community-led Bitcoin education will change the world.This isn't about Bitcoin, but rather what Bitcoin will teach us: critical thought, personal responsibility and ultimately self-sovereignty. It teaches us to lower our time preference and look further into the future—and that changes everything. When we have control over our lives and future, it encourages us to build and plan. Bitcoin allows us to define our destiny. Our highest-level strategy has three prongs:First; create an example in El Salvador that demonstrates and documents Bitcoin education as a tool for empowerment at mass scale El Salvador]As the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador will be an example for the world—we get to decide what sort of example that will be. When used correctly Bitcoin is a tool that empowers individuals to make their own decisions and as educators introducing new people to the space it is extremely important that we never dictate to students but rather allow them to come to their own conclusions. In many ways this is the path of most-resistance, but it is also a cornerstone value.Cooption  is our enemy, and we will have to constantly confront it.Fiercely resisting outside influence—from sponsors, governments or anyone else—will be difficult. It will mean that we will decline some opportunities, which is why the communities we serve will deeply value those that do understand and support the mission. Even while we grow, we must always strive for quality. In fact, quality is MORE important than quantity. This means we need to always iterate and improve upon our offerings as well as always strive to improve ourselves. We need to be self-critical. We also need to forge new ground, which is difficult but necessary. This first prong is the most important; it is what the next two are built upon. El Salvador is the example.Source Second; create a toolkit to make that example easy to copy by open-sourcing everything & creating easy, international communication channels  [node network]El Salvador is the focus, but the mission is the world.This has never been done before.Bitcoin can be humanity’s first revolution. In every previous ‘revolution’ we have fought over who has power, we now have a chance to change our very relationship with power. As we grow, we will make a lot of mistakes and learn a lot of lessons. We operate on a Bitcoin standard in a fiat world. We must build new systems and trailblaze new paths. When we open-source  everything—not just educational materials but things like accounting, media, communication and even how we make decisions internally—then it will be much easier for anyone, anywhere to copy or iterate upon our template. While we seek to create new systems and open-source everything, we are also building out a global decentralized communication layer—a network of nodes. Each node agrees to a basic core consensus about Bitcoin education—that it must be: independent; impartial; community-led, high-quality; Bitcoin-only; and teach empowerment.The communication needs to be multi-directional. El Salvador is the genesis block  but all of the nodes in the global decentralized network must be able to easily and independently communicate with each other to share their own best practices and lessons learned. This will dramatically speed up the timeline and increase the quality. The network will have nodes in 21 nations by the end of this year.This is a serious attempt to replace the existing order and making the status quo irrelevant. There will be resistance. Diffusing the core ideas in a way that is efficient, decentralized and international will make it extremely resilient. Once something becomes unstoppable, it becomes inevitable. We are building an unstoppable machine. Third; create a common banner under which diverse interests can align--we don’t have to agree on other things, but independent, impartial, community-led bitcoin education is something for all to rally behind. A rising tide raises all boats. [advisory board]By focusing solely on independent, impartial, community-led education, and doing so with complete transparency, we can create a common ground that everyone can support. People come at Bitcoin from diverse perspectives, but, like Bitcoin itself, we want to encourage collaboration over competition. There are lots of other great projects doing wonderful things but because our geographic vision is so broad (the world) we need to maintain a narrow focus on what we do. If it’s not Bitcoin education, then we will leave the task to others. This common ground, that is difficult to oppose and easy to unite behind, manifests itself by creating an advisory board of all the diverse industry leaders and creating a common table. This will also lend legitimacy, which will allow the network to grow even faster. This will incentivize industry leaders to be involved and create a positive feedback loop. This common ground will manifest itself in the physical world at an annual charity Gala in El Salvador, which won’t just serve as a fundraiser but also to entrench that vision and give it physical space.",

      "body": "In my own view, Bitcoin is all about empowerment and that of course entails a huge area of concern that covers many things. Now, in this process, we are kicking many old habits and entanglements and that is why there will always be resistance coming from different sources - on the top of that is the government as it will slowly lose some control if Bitcoin is allowed to spread like a wildfire. Bitcoin can be representing many ideal dreams and visions and I am hoping that some of them can really be coming true and not be distracted by the force of weak human nature along the way. Good luck, everyone!",

In the same manner that you can't expect Bitcoin to eradicate poverty, hunger, inequality, and other socio-economic ills. And if you imagine that there's something everybody can absolutely rally behind, you're probably up for a disappointment. Even among Bitcoin supporters, people are in disagreement about so many things. Even among much smaller groups like Bitcoin developers, there are disagreements.",

What i think is, El-Salvador just made a test on someone else guide to test out the pros and cons of making the BTC a legal tender. And i think that country is US.

      "body": "Bitcoin education for self-determination is intriguing. El Salvador has already adopted Bitcoin, making this plan risky but potentially revolutionary. This courageous move amazes me. As an intellectual and skeptic, this initiative seems unlikely. The idea is good, but the execution is terrible. Bitcoin's volatility and complexity may make it unpopular. It seems like a gamble to make it the foundation of such an ambitious undertaking.Maintaining quality and rejecting cooption is wise. Its difficult to mix independence with support. This balance may influence project success. An transnational decentralized network to spread essential concepts is futuristic but serious and intimidating. I wonder what this disturbance might mean. Uniting disparate interests is positive. However, Bitcoin's exclusivity raises concerns. Would a more comprehensive approach to digital literacy and decentralized technology work better?",

The example of El Salvador is interesting and inspiring, but hardly scalable. Various educational programs, seminars and other forms of knowledge dissemination are already in operation. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, and it is normal that everyone promotes it in their own way among those they know. And, for example, this forum does a great job as one of the centers of knowledge that spreads from here.As a result, your whole message is a lot of words, pathos, but not a lot of content.

Once i merited a post without checking the source link but once i gave that post a merit and posted a reply, then other members helped me to find out that he had copied it from the source just like here this OP had did. And i was targeted by other members that he is my friends and i gave him merit on purpose. While i was not his friend and i did not know him. The point is we should not come to final decision so soon. Again just to clarify i mean no disrespect i just want to share that if we come to final results so soon that would effect us too.",

El Salvador is setting the pace for other nations but the impact of Bitcoin is not yet visible because they have a long-term for Bitcoin. Bitcoin education and awareness are important for Bitcoin adoption but it is not a desperate move. Any country that wants to know more about Bitcoin should set up a committee to carry out an in-depth analysis or they can learn from other Bitcoin-friendly nations.
