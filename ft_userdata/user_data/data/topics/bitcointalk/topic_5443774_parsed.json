  "content": "Hello everybody! I want to tell you about the bad experience of playing on Duckdice.ioMy nickname in DuckDice is Ipunapi772I registered on the 1 of March, made a deposit of 666 usdt on the TRC20 wallet - f1ea5fa452b450822925852d835c6c5a0eb3021b1d96f46410dfe77b3535daed, which was provided to me by the Duckdice website - TNU3o53Ccv5ADrsPPM8NUJS3tXQBhJCfWEI made one bet on tennis in the amount of 15-18 dollars (I don’t remember exactly, I didn’t record) and the second bet on football in the amount of about 70-80 dollars, after which I received a notification that my account was blocked.I immediately emailed support@duckdice.io and received an auto-generated response - \"your complaint registered\".I was sure that they would answer me quickly enough and ask for a standard KYC check, for example (although I don’t understand why, I only made two bets for small amounts and did not withdraw money)(But for 6 days now I have not received a response. I wrote again, but also received no answer. I wrote to live chat Duckdice, but they told me to write to emailAt the time of blocking, there were about $580 on my account, taking into account the fact that the deposit amounted to $666.I think that the office is obliged to give me my money, I'm ready to go through KYC, but I don't even get a response to my letters...P.S access to my account on Duckdice.io is blocked for me, I can't enter my personal accountI'm attaching links to screenshots for proof...1. https://ibb.co/mFD0SSp2. https://ibb.co/0CbsSzj - I managed to take this photo after I received a notification about the blocking, the next time I refreshed the page, I could no longer log into my account3. https://ibb.co/VC4HBbj - Screenshot of registration, welcome letter dated March 1st. I also use the same mail for the Bitcointalk forum",

You do it in such way that if you get the favorable outcome you win money, despite your partner losing his bet, and if you get the unfavorable outcome, the win from your partner nullifies your loss. The more people in a group the more you can manipulate the odds and even make multi bets to increase profit. Even if you're caught doing it, the remaining money should be returned to you and probably will, so stay calm and wait for more info from DD.",

OP has a case to which he wants it to be settled  hence he brought it here providing everything necessary details to speed up the process so he could get his money back which I believe would be released upon proper investigations. Duck dice I know has a good reputation here and has been here for quite some time. I have not come across any complaint but this is the first time I am seeing such a complaint against duckdice. I guess there was a default from OP  end hence his account ban but nevertheless, but the duck dice representative here has assured op of looking into OP complaint for expedite actions.",
