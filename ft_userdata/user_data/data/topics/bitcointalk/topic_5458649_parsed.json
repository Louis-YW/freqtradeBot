  "content": "Quit gamble! Easy or Hard? Let's talk.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458430.0Success or Fail? - Talking about Gambling as a major incomehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5456632.0Boys and girls, greetings to you. It is time to make a big step to next stage. After talking, discussing, arguing with posts on both of the topics, two facts are shown and proved. Gambling as a major income is kind of like to the moon, only few guys can achieve. Quit gambling also seems like impossible. In past 10 years, I almost spent 5-7 hrs per day to gamble. If no money, I would like to watch and refuse to leave. This is sick. Most of you cannot imagine the depth I walked towards. Gambling is part of my life or in my blood forever.Now, I decided to create the last topic about gambling here. Targets are loud and clear. One, stop losing. Can't afford any loss in future. Stream will shows what and how. It is pure automatic stuff. If I stop streaming someday, means I fail again. If the stream is still continual, everything is fine. After losing everything, I learned but I do not regret it. Nothing is easy and nothing is free. I pay what I believe. Two, two days ago I sent an sponsored streamer application email to marketing of wolfbet.com, but still no response yet. So, I am also open for other sponsors or marketing stuff.Three rules for streaming.- 100 dollars stop-loss for the day.- Stream for 24/7 except disrupting by Intenet or others. - No selling, no teaching, no charges services supplied on my side. So, I won't create things like discord, telegram group and etc...Only one stream channel. My weekly records will be updated here and hope all of you can enjoy.http://kick.com/fuckdiceGamble for entertainment only. Updating......1, Thanks for the dude who found out my first post in this forum...WoW...can't imagine just passed half year...I did find out the strategy how to 5x your balance in long term which is 6-12 months...but after my tests from Jan to June and losing another 50k dollars...I gave up. The result just proved how naive was that...But the dream is still not broken...If some rich dude can invest...Stream is a good business...People love it so much...By the way, I have two another topics which show my target and ambition strongly...I am trying hard to avoid homeless...Maybe I can live in Four Seasons every fucking day with blonde someday...who knows...and who fucking cares you think...I chase what I want...I pay what I believe...that's it...2, Please focus on this topic. 24/7 stream is something. Nobody can do that anywhere.3,I have a platinum 5 account (63.61% to platinum 6) on stake.com. This fucking account cost me at least 350k USDT. If some of you want blessings, you can ask it here. I will send when I have some coins left in my account. Thank you.",
