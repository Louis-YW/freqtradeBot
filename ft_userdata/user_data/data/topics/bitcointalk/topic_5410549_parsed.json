That's why the redeem instructions ask you to log in to your Binance account and they made a big yellow claim button to make it easier for the victims. Ideally, even if you fall for this phishing attempt, there should still be a 2nd factor that protects you in the form of a code that is sent to Authy, Google Authenticator, or a similar app. And if you aren't using the same password across multiple sites/services, all the hackers would get is a password they can't do anything with.The fake site could also have malware that infects your device and that's another concern. But I believe we are just talking about a simple phishing site here.",

Maybe it's better if we can ask Binance if they own this redirection linkI also check about emails to whitelist and the email is not mentioned in their address to whitelist https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360000444531I'm not saying our brother Shasan is wrong he is a trusted member here with a great contribution to busting scams and I have huge respect for him.",

I’m not aware that there is scam scheme like this that copies Binance promotion email. I sometimes encounter re-login once I click Binance promotion but so far my account is still safe.I think I should start resetting now my account credentials and check my emails just to make sure I’m receiving official email.

But it's good to be careful though especially when you are a crypto user and you wallet is in the same device which you are using all the time.I usually keep a file for all the service sites I use and always visit their website from the links. I avoid any form of emails and links from any other channels. If I need to check the service offer then I login using my saved link and try to check the appropriate section of the site.
