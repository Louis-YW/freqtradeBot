BlueWallet will cease custodial lightning operations, meaning that BlueWallet users of the Bitcoin (BTC) Lightning Network must connect to nodes to continue using BlueWallet lighting services.Quote“The account is shutting down, not LndHub or Bluewallet itself.

Currently I did not see big changes for both total open channels and sum of channels value. They actually decreased since early 2023 but we have yet seen impacts of Blue wallet event.Let's wait how people will react with this and how it will impact Lightning Network in next one or two months.https://txstats.com/dashboard/db/lightning-network?orgId=1&from=now-5y&to=now",

He is always an advocate against offchain bitcoin related transactions. According to him those are not bitcoins if it doesn't exist on the bitcoin blockchain. Lately I'm beginning to buy into the ideology of Franky about bitcoin and its usage.",

But considering the number of users that they have it's probably not that much per.Add in a few people with a lot in there and it drops even more.Lets see how it winds down over the next few weeks.And how they handle the people who screwed up and left funds there after the official shutdown.-Dave",

Not your node not your coins is the same as not your keys not your coins. I think Bluewallet are making the correct decision and suspending future nodes which hold their clients funds. It was a disaster waiting to happen and it shows how trustworthy bluewallet are because they have made this decision because they probably feared the eventual attack where they would lose peoples btc. I think this is more reason to trust bluewallet and not lose faith in them because they made a decision that does make using them less convenient.",
