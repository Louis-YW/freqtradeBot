I think we can aim for a little bigger now. Instead of only companies making use of bitcoin and realizing its potential, let us hope that countries start incorporating bitcoin into their economic plans and give their citizens as well as us investors a favor. I have no doubt bitcoin will be soon realized as a cryptocurrency more instead of just as an investment opportunity but a step forward is still a step forward so I will be happy with whatever progress bitcoin makes in this year in the context of countries accepting bitcoin whether that is just looser restrictions or recognizing it as a legal tender.",

One thing I think we need to understand about bitcoin been a currency is that it can only be an alternative as such can be use where fiat currency seems like an hassle. For example cross border transactions where you have to go through Changing of fiat currency to different currencies before arriving at the desired currency but with bitcoin the transfer and even fees are hassle free.",

      "body": "When people talk about “mainstream,” it often comes down to everyday usefulness. If Bitcoin transactions feel as seamless as sending an email, that’s when we win. The tech is nearly there, but wider acceptance still depends on the comfort level of institutions (banks, governments, large corporations). They have to see fewer regulatory gray areas and a more stable environment. That’s why each new piece of legislation, each new stablecoin partnership, and each new improvement in user interfaces matters.The part that excites me the most is tokenization. Picture digitized assets that can be traded against Bitcoin or a stablecoin in a single wallet. Whether we’re talking about fractional ownership of real estate or licensing deals for music, this stuff may quietly reshape entire markets. By 2025, if we play our cards right, there’ll be a generation of folks whose first instinct is to settle everything on a blockchain ( faster, cheaper, more transparent). That feels like a turning point to me.",
