When you place a big bet after winning small bets they would make you lose. This why you always need to be inconsistent while placing bets. Sometimes it works and most of the time it won't. Always remember in the end the casino will always win.",

You cant judge a casino is fooling you by comparing the result of your small bet vs big bet. Anyway, this is not the first time I read a gambler who think that a casino is cheating just because he/she win with small bets but lose with bigger bets. If you want to make sure yourself of the fairness in your bet, go find casino with provably fair system so you can always verify your bet result.",

What do you think about casino site algorithms?  Are they cheating with us?The feeling you have is quite common but it is nothing more than a feeling. Almost all the casinos that advertise on the forum are trusted and don't rip you off because they make enough money doing things legitimately. What you say is probably just a coincidence of short term results. When you talk about 'always' that I have put in bold, what sample results are we talking about? Millions? Surely not. Another thing that tends to happen is that when we bet large amounts it is scary money for us and we change the way we bet as well as being more sensitive to the results.",

Casinos already have HE and without cheating they already get big profits with the setting of the HE, and do bad things in their games to get even bigger profits. I think that casinos that already have big names will not do this, maybe it could happen to a new casino or a casino that was made for the sole purpose of deceiving, but with the amount of money you use to play you should play at a trusted casino so you don't experience what you think is really happening. Casinos that are built to actually survive in this tight industry won't go under by cheating, it will only cost them players, and ultimately destroy their business.",

Or maybe luck in not on your side when you bet huge money. Unless you can check everything and set that they are changing the seed, hence they make you lose.And so you might have that kind of feeling that you are being cheated, but if there's no proved at all then there's nothing we can do.Too bad to here that you have lost $1k, that is a huge amount.",

Also, some online gambling platforms will try to wake the greediness in their players, making them win with small amounts so that they can get greedy and retry again with Big amount of money, this is common sense, think about it, why win only when you play with a small amount? You are not alone. A smart gambler would have known how the platform is operating, and have some laughs about it, but keep playing with small amount, since that's the only assured way to win on such a platform.",

But if you try some other casino and the returns come out the same then note that your lucks are on small bets.There's nothing wrong in betting small and winning, keep doing that and you might accumulate enough money for yourself. Don't be greedy and increase your staking amount, already you have seen that it doesn't work out for you so continue betting small and win.",

What do you think about casino site algorithms?  Are they cheating with us?I'm not sure I can give you a good answer, but I myself have no doubts about the algorithms of some online gambling sites at the moment (I'm not sure they are cheating us), claims probably fair may be a little doubtful for players, but when you play, you must be fully aware that you can lose all your money, so it's all your responsibility. My advice is if you really doubt the algorithm of a gambling site, then play with small capital, don't try to put big capital in your game, especially if it's a slot or dice game.",
