  "content": "For those who don't know me, I work as a warehouse operative (working class person). I don't aspire to succeed much as an employee, but rather strive to be creative as an individual person. The Bitcoin history book is what I devote significant amounts of time to, aiming to create something special for the community (completed book will be on Amazon in SEPTEMBER 2024!!!).  It is the main avenue through which I am exercising my intelligence and diligence. I know most people in the community would rather hodl their crypto wealth, but isn't it wise to support community effort. All I seek is donations to aid my effort to create a detailed BTC history book. Please show generosity I once knew the community was renowned for in the early years. I look forward to your messages and feedback. I won't give up the task. As promised, here is the PDF document showing chapters 2008/09 to 2016 (still have the summary pages to complete):BOOK INTERIOR>>>>>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M8z4M4oV4WC_aIGWkn-tO_T7Nkllj47C/view?usp=sharing<<<<<BOOK INTERIORPlease leave comments, feedback and suggestions for improvement in this thread.  The current thread for the book is:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5475400.0UPDATE 30/06/2024I have almost completed pages 50 to 273 (covering 2008 to 2022 BTC history) amounting to 224 pages.

Feel free to include photos. I have opened the book up for these 10 pages to gain community insights and experience.If interested, please contact me. The price has been set relatively high to deter too many entries.  UPDATE 26/12/2023:As a way to help me complete 'The Bitcoin History Book 2008-2024' by September 2024, I seek community support.  If you you would like your full name (or alias) in the book (will be listed on page 6 onwards), please private message me your name and donate at least $5 (crypto equivalent) towards my efforts.  Donation addresses are in the OP.

With sufficient support, I am the type of person who knuckles down and is totally determined.  Please trust me!UPDATE 04/12/2023:First of all, thank you to all those who have commented on this thread including useful feedback.  It is motivating and helps me to assess progress.  I have nearly completed the first draft of 8 chapters covering 2008-2016 (see draft preview, some pages removed) immediately below.  The Bitcoin yearly history chapters begin on page 44 after introductory and other BTC related To be honest, I am slightly baffled about the lack of generosity from the community.  Countless time and energy has been put into it so far, and I am determined to write draft pages for 2017-end June 2024 next year.  I'm far from a greedy person (live in a small terrace house with terrible heating and an abomination of a garden) who continuously loves to learn and work hard.  Moreover, I turn down overtime at work in favour of writing this book.  If you can, please donate:$BTC bc1qktyzg2atx5paka2x64pxdwg54u7m2yn3cu2qxy$LTC ltc1qz8jqkhy264q3mdjkjzsve7er25qdnmmvxt96lr$ETH 0x125288bAf499e26259f8E2aC6FC5fE1491aBa9c2$DOGE DRj7PWEz5zxHc5ptkTBapKjCrxQU75CB6q$XRP r9LbXGJ9HCdwvAhKWJJLihSd8612xHybv7With sufficient help, I know the book will be completed by September 2024.  Thank you in advance for your support and feedback.

Historical books always have some important moral lesson that will help shape the lives of every reader. I want to congratulate you for investing your precious time in putting up this important historical book about the development of one of the greatest discoveries of all time. I know this is not an easy task, but I want to encourage you to continue and finish this project.
