I can do 8 characters in about 3 minutes on my home computer. Some quick testing shows it would take me about 3 days to have a 50% chance of finding 10 characters, but about 3 months to have a 50% chance of finding 11 characters. So 9 or 10 characters seems to be the limit of what is reasonable (depending on how long you are willing to run the software for).",

I suppose you could also create bc1qst0rage... or bc1qsalary... or whatever if you wanted instead of labeling your addresses locally, although that would be terrible for privacy.",

Public keys are this random number multiplied by what is known as the generator point (G), which is a point on a curve with an X and Y coordinate. If I have the private key 5, my public key will be 5G. If you have the private key 10, your public key will be 10G. Adding our public keys together will give us 15G. Adding our private keys together will give us 15, which would then generate the public key 15G. In essence it is this simple.The core feature of this curve that we are using (known as secp256k1), is that it is impossible to work out the private key from only knowledge of the public key. So when you give me your public key, all I need to do is find another public key which when added together produces an address with the prefix we are looking for. I then give you the private key I ended up with, and you add it to your private key. You end up with a new private key which generates the address in question.The original private key you generate should be completely random and generated in a cryptographically secure way, as would be done by any good wallet software. You definitely shouldn't go about picking it yourself. It simply serves as a starting point for me to begin my brute force search. At the end of this process, your key + my key = final key. Given that I only know my key, and I have no idea what your key or the final key is, then I am no closer to being able to guess the final key than I would be with no information at all. All I know is that some number plus my key equals some other number. If all I know is that x + 10 = y, there are infinite solutions to that equation.*In terms of software to actually add the keys together for you (it's a bit more complex than a simple addition because we have to perform the calculation modulo n, with n being the order of the curve (essentially the number of valid points on the curve)) then you can use the links nc50lc has provided, or there is also this site: https://gobittest.appspot.com/*For private keys, there would be n possible solutions, i.e. the same number as the number of all possible private keys.",
