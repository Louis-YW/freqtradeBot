  "content": "This topic might sound hilarious to everyone active on this board! My objective was to find a platform that can give me an option to convert Bitcoin to either INR or a gift coupon for purchasi any iPhone. As expected I did not find any platform that gives me that option. I thought Betrifill might provide with a big Amazon gift card, which is not possible. I know it is hard to make a direct purchase in 2023 with Bitcoin. Incase of you guys have know anything then do reply. Thank.P.S - Please ignore my typo or sentence mistake.",

      "body": "You won't find any direct way of doing that because of obvious reasons. You still have an option which involves some risk though.You can find someone to buy it for you. Find a person who accepts BTC payment and ask him to buy the iphone for you.You can very well use an escrow for it. But the catch is that there will be some commission involved for that person.",

      "body": "I don't think you can make such a big purchase using Amazon gift card otherwise I would have given you the option of buying them from Bitrefill. 5k is the max and buying multiple cards won't help you. Bitpay debit card can be used to make a purchase on Apple store but that service is not available in India. What @pawanjain said is correct but that entails some risk. Take due diligence before making such a purchase.",

      "body": "In a the future you might but for now you need to wait and use fiat to buy iPhone. I haven't seen any big company except Tesla accepting Bitcoin as an alternative payment. Till today Amazon has not allowed crypto based purchase. You can buy gift cards from Bitrefill but the max is for INR 10,000. Recently they have added Flipkart to their list with 10k limit. Thier one risk free hack which I am aware of. It might help you. I am sure that most of your friends do by groceries online. Most of them would use any of those e-commerce website listed on Bitrefill. What you need to do is to find a few friends, who are ready to buy gifts cards from you. Do your math and then buy an iPhone with that amount.",
