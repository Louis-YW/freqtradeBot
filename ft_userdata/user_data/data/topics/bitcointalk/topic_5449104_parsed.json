Is it competitive?I am totally pitch black in this. No one knows exactly but it will be not very fast as with all the other staking services if you by fast mean a considerable amount.The ETH network only with the latest upgrade if I understood it correctly lets you withdraw any staked ETH or any rewards you got from this.I think this will be more clear in the near future but many sites that I have checked are pointing toward an average of 4.52% interest but none of them shows us the time,most probably because there is still not clear even in the ETH developers,so we have to wait to know it for sure at how fast,I am assuming that 4.52% to be yearly but that is just my assumption.",

For that money you can buy bunch of chias that hdd will never mine next 10years.so why bother to mine it. Buy it for the money you wanted to buy hdd üòÅ",

Is it competitive?I am totally pitch black in this. If you're still in the dark about ETH staking, I highly recommend reading the basics here: https://ethereum.org/en/staking/. Currently, the staking reward stands at 4.9% APR. Although the reward rate fluctuates depending on the number of validators (i.e., the amount of ETH currently staked), it's reasonable to expect that the current figures will remain relatively stable. In my opinion, staking ETH only makes sense if you are bullish on Ethereum; otherwise, the 4.9% APR may not seem appealing.",

That means if you have 1 ETH sitting on Coinbase for a year, you‚Äôll earn something like $6 worth of ETH per month. Not exactly retirement money but there‚Äôs also hope that the value of the ETH will increase giving you a gain and raising the amount of monthly interest you receive from staking. So far I have earned around 4.2 ETH via staking on Coinbase. I started staking in 2021. I plan on starting multiple solo staking with ETH. I am not interested in trading crypto because of the tax nightmare. I'd rather accumulate more ETH slowly via staking and pay taxes on the interest payouts. I personally am bullish about Ethereum and think it will go well above $10,000 eventually. It might even go to $180,000 - per Cathie Wood. Of course, Bitcoin would be at around $1 million or more. The way I see it the Ethereum supply is 6x the Bitcoin supply so it makes sense for Ethereum to eventually settle at 1/6 of the BTC price.¬† A fair value ETH price with BTC at $29,000 is around $4,800. Ethereum is currently undervalued compared to Bitcoin. And we can thank Gary Gensler of course for that.https://ultrasound.money/Judging by that admission and looking at my interest rate proclamation I would assume that you have around 50 ETH staked then. Certainly a great deal of money and more than most here. That likely earns you around $300 a month in more ETH at current prices, which isn‚Äôt bad for doing nothing. I for one am glad to see earning expectations is crypto coming back down to reality. I staked 40 ETH (Max at the time) in May 2021. Then in February 2022 I added another 28 ETH. So for the past year, I staked 68 ETH on Coinbase. Coinbase takes a 25% admin fee. I have ETH on Binance also but not staking it currently.I can make more with solo staking but am then responsible for configuration, maintenance, updates, etc. As well as the electrical costs associated with the validator. I already have the hardware and I think the electrical costs should not be too bad. We occasionally lose internet and storm-related power outages once or twice yearly. Not sure if these outages would impact the validators much.So you have over $100k on an centralized exchange, which can be hacked every time and this for an interest of $7k in 2 years? Not worth the risk¬† There are much better and safer opportunities.Actually at current prices that's $7.5k. If ETH goes to ATH then that's $20k. It all depends on when you sell. I don't because I don't like complicated tax work.",
