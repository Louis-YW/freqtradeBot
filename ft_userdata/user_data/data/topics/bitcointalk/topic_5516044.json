However with respect to you point, lost coins simply means that the owner of that particular wallet lost his keys and his seed phrase. Which literally means there's no possible way of spending the coins in that wallet. Although it actually isn't a donation to the network, but it's literally similar to burning your coins.To burn  some coins you send them to an address which you lost the keys and seed meaning there is actually no way to access or the coins.Lost coins are actually beneficial to the bitcoin network because it preserves price since it's like an anonymous HODLer is hodling indefinitely causing circulating supply to reduce increasing price.",

I mean how can the system detect lost or misplaced bitcoins when the actually owners never voiced out?But to my view, I think those misplaced bitcoins are gone forever but though I read that there is an ongoing development system that is being initiated to the capability of recovering those lost bitcoins but that would be determined in a far future .",

There have been many scammers who have tried many times to pose as having the capability to recover lost Bitcoin; some people have been victims of them, but to give you a warning, @OP, avoid such, because it is a scam!",

The higher the number of lost Bitcoin the more valuable the worth of Bitcoin.     I don’t even consider bitcoin been lost if they are actually still on a spendable address, many people consider bitcoin sent to a wrong adress as a lost coin, although it is not common but I believe if bitcoin is sent to an address that is with a correct checksum that particular bitcoin isn’t lost because there is tendency of it been spent. The only validly lost bitcoin is that sent to a burn address, like using the the usual OP-return method which means the output can never be spent, this is the only way the coin is lost in my opinion. Right most of all this assumed lost bitcoins could be long term holders who left it dormant",

It's true that OP-return outputs are lost and can never be spent, but they are not the only coins that have provably been lost. There were coins that were lost because miners didn't claim them when mining blocks and there were also coins that were lost due to the coinbase transactions having the same hashes.",

Coins sent to a provably unspendable outputThis includes the OP_RETURN outputs, broken outputs (eg. OP_HASH160 <push 10 bytes> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG) and burn addresses. These are lost forever and it is impossible to spend them.2.
