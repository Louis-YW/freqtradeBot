  "content": "Taking a look at prices at coinmarketcap isn't giving me hope we are at the end of the bear market yet.But the charts and the overpriced assets (Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, etc.) are not the only indicators.There's an event we are waiting for that should finally end and that's no other than the MtGox coins release. Certainly, Bitcoin's price is decisive for the whole market. Maybe the release of 100,000 BTC will not be that damaging. Sure if everyone sells, we will find new levels, but right now, I think it is the only event investors wait to begin buying both Bitcoin and altcoins.Nobody wants to buy fearing MtGox holders will dump their 9 year forced-hodled coins. Maybe they won't but it is fear of a dump that blocks many investors at this point.The soonest the MtGox BTC are released, the better for everyone in this market. The FUD will end, and if prices drop then we get a discount.",

The bottom may have been reached, but that is in relation to the current situation in the world. If that changes and there is a major war, or blackout because of energy, then people will continue to get scared. Investments could out of bitcoin and acceptance could fall. For the price to rise, you need many more people and companies that want bitcoin. A bottom in 2023 could be lower with a worse situation than now.But there are also times when bitcoin does what it wants and I would bet on that",

I think someone is intentionally spreading FUD in the market to cause more panic. In this September, we will mainly focus on the news that the Fed will raise interest rates and finally, the rate hike has caused the market to fall deeper. Today is the last day of september i think we will have a better october as there are not any major events affecting the market, suddenly the MT.Gox event was mentioned again by someone, apparently it's all just pre-arranged FUD.",

Gox, that news started some panic in the market some time back but the thing with FUD is the first contact effect where the impact on the market is the maximum on first appearance of the news, further down the line, people become resistant to that news.Still the FUD will continue in different forms, it never ends and neither will the cycle of bull and bear. So better to put that thought out of your head. Instead to keep profiting, just treat the numbers as numbers, not as an effect of a news on a number. Buy bitcoin at the lower prices being reached and sell when it will goes back up.Today it might be one set of FUD, tomorrow it will be another. Hence we have to learn to ignore them.",

In this condition, you should pay attention to the trading budget you have, make periodic purchases, not instant buys. Follow the trend when it goes down, do the accumulation starting from small amount but continously till reach 100% from your budget. If you are afraid to see your portfolio, you should withdraw and hold it to your own wallet then reopen when there is a pump. never hold it on exchange, its not good.",

But then it is better to hold more Bitcoin this moment and focus less on altcoin. It's a good choice in my opinion as well to put the focus on bitcoin. Because almost everyone is now focused on the price movement of bitcoin, and I believe that sooner or later bitcoin will stabilize again. Moreover, it is more profitable that the price movement in the market depends on bitcoin. I'm also a little into altcoins that have great potential and of course already have high enough trust, not much but I think it's quite profitable.",

Exactly Mt.Gox will issue 137kBTC not 100kBTC, but I don't see it will cause any damage to the market. They put on the market such a large amount of bitcoin but it doesn't increase or change the bitcoin supply how can it cause damage? Like the case you describe about Tesla, I don't see it having too much of an impact on the market, just investors' reaction to the market, some panic sell for fear of loss but there are always some other investors waiting to buy at lower price. Depending on people's reaction to that news, for me that is good because there will be more buying opportunities for bitcoin and once the bad news is over it will be time for the bulls to come.",
