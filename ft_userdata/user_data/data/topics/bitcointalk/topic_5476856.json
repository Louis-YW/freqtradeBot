Thanks in advance.Are you looking for this website: https://kycnot.me/ which has a list of all DEX that do not need KYC and services that are focused on privacy? I do see Bisq being rated as the top DEX on their list. I hope this is the website that you were searching for but could not find it. Their points system is based on a large list of criteria, you can check the list when you click on this link: https://kycnot.me/points",

I'll go ahead and do that. Even though I agree with Helena on the rating for some sites that seems off in comparison to others.Quote from: Helena Yu on December 07, 2023, 07:10:17 AMQuote from: pakhitheboss on December 07, 2023, 05:59:27 AMAre you looking for this website: https://kycnot.me/ I don't understand why right now Agoradesk, LocalMonero, and PeachBitcoin can get 10 points when they're not completely decentralized.

Should be 8/10 or maybe 9 but 10 doesn't make sense at all.Quote from: Helena Yu on December 07, 2023, 07:10:17 AMJust for addition recently there's a new project about list of mixers mixhub.to - a maintained list of mixers for backup and lookup purposesDamn, mixers don't seem to age well it seems.",

Those services need to create an account and closed source, I think they should get 9 instead of 10. The centralized/decentralized and open-source/closed-source elements aren't considered when a rating is given by KYCNOT. As they explain on their About page, the rating depends on how much no-KYC friendly the service is. The other features they consider are TOR and which cryptocurrencies they support.
