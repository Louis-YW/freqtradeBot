The more we fall for this scams and the more fraudsters will be encouraged to try new ones.",

      "body": "Dealing transactions to a newbie is too risky. Look, even people here give negative feedback that newbie account for this case, it is easy to dump that account then create a new one. Plus, those kind of accounts he is selling or you are buying are really prone to scams, because those accounts can be recovered by the original owner by just making support ticket. So obviously you are wasting your money and time dealing such kind of transactions. May this serve you a lesson in the future to avoid dealing newbies without escrow, or dealing to those kind of accounts.",

      "body": "Sad for what you lost, I hope in the future that you will do your transactions through an Escrow service or deal with members who have high ranks and positive trusts. You cannot trust the ranks of Newbies because any scammer can create his account on the forum with the rank of Newbie in less than a minute and even if he gets a Negative trusts, he can create multiple accounts and then promote his services, even if his services are fake. There is no guarantee, after you send your money to him, that you will get the product or service that you bought. Therefore, you have to be careful, and it is good that you lost only 32 dollars and did not lose thousands or hundreds of dollars.",
