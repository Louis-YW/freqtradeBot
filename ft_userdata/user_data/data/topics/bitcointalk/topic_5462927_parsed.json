  "content": "$WGHOST Contract Address: 0xb5e0CFe1B4dB501aC003B740665bf43192cC7853Wrapped Ghost on Polygon is now live!This historic event brings a new chapter in our ecosystem’s history. New opportunities have now been opened, in addition to the uncountable amount of liquidity available and endless DeFi possibilities.For Polygon, this is also huge news as there is not a whole lot of privacy focused projects on their platform. This is where Ghost has a sort of “First-Mover-Advantage.” With Polygon’s recent launch of their zk-EVM and the privacy protocols found in Ghost, transacting privately and across chains has never been better.With the launch of Wrapped Ghost, ticker symbol $WGHOST, this marks the completion of Phase 1 of 2 and brings us ever so close to launching our decentralized two-way bridge. For now though, users wanting to bridge their Main Net $GHOST assets over to Polygon for $WGHOST, can head over to nonkyc.io for the transfer. Every $WGHOST token has an exact 1:1 collateralized Main Net $GHOST counterpart. Below are some quick details about $WGHOST:Initial liquidity launch: 100,000 $WGHOSTInitial Liquidity Pool: Uniswap $MATIC/$WGHOSTContract Address: 0xb5e0CFe1B4dB501aC003B740665bf43192cC7853How to bridge: Head over to nonkyc.io and deposit your MainNet $GHOST into your wallet. Make sure you also have some $MATIC in your wallet for the withdrawal fee, there are no bridge fees. When you withdraw, it will prompt you to select which network. Select Wrapped Ghost as your option to withdraw and fill in the boxes with your Polygon address and amount to be withdrawn. Once finished, you can click “Make Withdraw.” Now you have successfully bridged $GHOST over to the Polygon Network!Phase 2 of 2 will include the launch of our decentralized two-way bridge as mentioned earlier. When this bridge goes live we will upgrade the current wrapped ghost smart contract which will include some new features making it a better overall token. While we are closing in on Phase 2, final testing is being done on various aspects of the bridge such as the oracle and among other parameters. We will keep the community informed about our progress as this develops.In the meantime, please enjoy using $WGhost on Polygon and explore all of the fun DeFi possibilities now available to you. This infinitely expands the Ghost ecosystem and is a great addition to the space as a whole.Stay connected and follow us on our other platforms:Discord - https://discord.com/invite/Pjbme6vGhost Veterans - https://ghostveterans.net/GitHub - https://github.com/ghost-coin Opensea - https://opensea.io/OFFICIAL-GHOST/createdReddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostPrivacyCoin/Telegram - https://t.me/ghostcoinbymcafee Twitter - https://twitter.com/ghostbymcafee?lang=enWebsite - https://ghostbyjohnmcafee.com/",
