  "content": "Three weeks ago, I liquidated 10k from my stock portfolio into my bank account. My plan was to dump it into Bitcoin as soon as it dipped under 17k. But now, for the first time since I got into crypto investing in 2017, I'm having major doubts. I'm beginning to wonder whether Bitcoin has a long-term future, now that much of the world's nations are caught up in this 'climate' hysteria, and want to ban proof-of-work protocols, like Bitcoin, which they claim is harmful to the environment. For example, the EU recently held a vote to ban proof-of-work mining across member nations*. Thankfully, the vote failed, but this wasn't the first time they attempted it, and I don't think it'll be the last. Eventually, as younger and more 'progressive' individuals enter positions of political power in Europe, my guess is that they'll succeed. And, once they do, the other chimpanzees in countries around the world will follow them, potentially causing the demise of our beloved cryptocurrency.Thoughts? * https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/proposal-limiting-proof-of-work-is-rejected-in-eu-parliament-committee-vote-sources/",

Bitcoin Policy Institute put up some data during the last COP that provides some solid arguments against that energy argument and, if they hold true, will prove that energy use will plateau in about a decade and then decline.All the while securing a financial system that has no peers.If price is all that matters to you, and that money is dear to you, you probably did the right thing.But if Bitcoin is a little more to you than that (not saying price doesn't matter, of course it does) and you're willing to wait it out, as all cycles have come and gone, look to the progress made, the fundamentals that keep getting stronger, and the weakening of the alternatives.",

      "body": "Whenever you have your doubts, take a look at the positives that Bitcoin bring, and see if they're important to you, more than profit alone. For example, removing the issue of relying on a third party I think is vital. I don't like to have some bank handle all my money, and feel unsafe doing so. Even though, in the UK our money is guaranteed up to a certain point. There's also the issue of them blocking transactions whenever they feel like. This is ultimately a decision we all have to make, and weight the benefits or the negatives. What conclusion we'll come to will wildly differ. However, until Bitcoin ceases to exist, there will be people that use it. Sure, curb your investment if you think there's a possibility of Bitcoin being banned, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend not using it at all if it's still important to you.",

The energy debate has been going on for years and major news outlets alongside huge names in the financial sector only rehashes what has already been said about the topic. While there are some interesting statements pointed out there that supports the argument 'bitcoin wastes a lot of energy', those things can also be said against other industries that does not really help the betterment of the masses at all. I know that if bitcoin climbs back up again in a few years time, you'll be regretting your decision right now but hey, at least you took off the burden that's taxing for you.",

You can't stop Bitcoin by stopping some people from mining. Even if mining is prohibited in the EU, it can be mined somewhere. Even the ban on mining in China has not stopped Bitcoin.",

I do realize that risk and reward go hand in hand, and the possibility of a global Bitcoin mining ban is one of those risks that an investor must assume in order to potentially reap any future rewards.I've invested tens of thousands of dollars in BTC and other crypto assets over the years, and will HODL for life, even if it means going down with the ship.

I did consider the fact that not all countries will be on board with banning Bitcoin mining, but once a critical mass of countries ban it, it could be enough to minimize Bitcoin's potential.  Quote from: Anonylz on July 15, 2022, 08:48:43 PMYour money your choice, you can decide to either hold back and leave it with your bank (inflation will do its part) or buy btc now that price is 3x cheaper than few months back.

You sold your coins 3 weeks ago, so in other words you held for a while, but as it continued to fall you've decided to make money shorting bitcoin, like a trader, but it bounced back above 20k. Your plan failed and you got even more desperate because math can be painful in such times. You sold at the lows, didn't buy back as it went up, had to pay trading fees. Now you're down more than you'd be if you held, so you want to justify that move by telling yourself that it can fail, it can be banned, it was a good decision to sell. Fine, if that's what makes you sleep at night",

Investing now shouldn't be seen as guaranteed returns, and definitely shouldn't be seen as something to make a quick buck on. Bitcoin is going to be effected by the recession, nearly as much as fiat is. Okay, it being deflationary is going to help it in the long term, but for the short term (next two years at least) I'd say we'll be at a similar price point to what we're at now. The halving should help, and also as people cope better with the recession, buying power should go back up, and therefore Bitcoin should be crossing hands a little more also.",
