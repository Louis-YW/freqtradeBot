  "content": "I purchased 2 GekkoScience USB Hubs from 419Mining back in April 2022the first one I opened and used - nothing was wrong with it, the 2nd one I opened back in October, and one by one the powered USB ports started to not get any powerI've attached a USB reader to each port for testing and this was using a FutureBit ApolloBTC 200W Power Supplyhttps://imgur.com/a/Z0X2okLAnd just today, all of the 6A ports are getting no power the only 2 that works is the 2 fan portsMy next step is to try to get the barrel-type power supply and continue to test, hopefully, it'll fix the problem.Not sure if anyone else has experienced this with the GekkoScience USB Hub, really hope I can fix this hubthx in advance",
