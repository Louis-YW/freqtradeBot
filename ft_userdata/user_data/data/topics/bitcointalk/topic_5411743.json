Then, make another backup, just to be sure.Install the latest version of Bitcoin Core (see News link above this topic), make it read the wallet.dat, and let it sync.

Assuming the transactions happened many years ago, you'll see them long before it's done. You can lookup the current balance of the addresses in a block explorer if you're in a rush.",

      "body": "There are ways of exporting the private keys but it's probably just better to let everything download.You may see some of the transactions as soon as the wallet loads, long before the sync finishes BUT they will be greyed out and not spendable until the sync finishes. And as others have said make a copy or 2 of the wallet.dat file on an external drive before doing anything else.For a bit more info take a look at LoyceV post here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4959742.0-Dave",

      "body": "If you care about privacy: Let it sync. It might take a day or two, if you're using a strong CPU and have a decent internet speed.If you don't care about privacy: You can export the private keys and load them on an SPV wallet, such as Electrum. To export a private key, open up Bitcoin Core and type:Code:dumpprivkey <BITCOIN_ADDRESS_HERE>If you're in a rush AND you care about privacy, you can download the wallet software I've linked you above, and open it up with these parameters:Code:electrum --one-server --server=nw724n2hcotb2zaavdwhaudgggvpukb5ybpkz4duz7fvnp5fgkycsnad.onion:50002:sThe \"--one-server\" implies you'll only connect to one Electrum server. The \"--server\" defines what that server will be; in this case, it's mine. I don't keep neither share logs. To establish a connection you need to have Tor running in the background. Security tip #1: Whichever option you decide to pick, do it on a, preferably, clean machine. If I were you, I'd format some drive I've had to keep the private keys safe there air-gapped, and let Bitcoin Core sync my watch-only wallet (that would have the addresses only). Security tip #2: Don't trust strangers in PMs.",
