OP isn't trying to hide anything that way  Anyway, I've unstaked the energy I delegated to OP. It doesn't seem like they tried to move their USDT at all, so I guess their goal was to steal $5 worth of TRX. I didn't do my research properly when offering to stake them energy either - their account is owned by TQFymRj6AD57iFzpCrtHijBXXn5QdQsxAU, which is owned by TGsy6W3T4fs3nAMk4E6ohfXXsosbHXRLvK and has a balance of ~$30 worth of TRX. I'm surprised they even bothered putting 1000 USDT in their address in the first place.",
