Yes bro I already had plans for this so I won't hesitate to inculcate her with the best knowledge I could because there are many more benefits for me to outline which I know bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large have set me high whereby thinking of any governmental or company work can't place me in such speed. So it would be a great Joy of me introducing my daughter things about cryptocurrency and most especially bitcoin.Thank you all for being with us and for the showers of loves.",
