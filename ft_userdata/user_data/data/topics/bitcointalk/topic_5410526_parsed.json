  "content": "~ BTC Bitcoin Layer 1 Privacy - concepts, ideas, research, discussion BTC ~Preamble / Motivation:Motivated by discussions on various threads, I started looking more thoroughly into L1 blockchain privacy - covering what is available in terms of academic research, implementation in various altcoins and upsides & drawbacks of different methods.This thread is dedicated for sharing ideas and research, as well as discussing and educating, about privacy solutions that could be implemented in Bitcoin in the future. Hopefully, it could even become the starting ground for development of concrete BIPs.What I am specifically looking for in existing implementations is that they do have to work with UTXO-based cryptocurrency, they do need to work with PoW, they do need to work without a centralized, trusted setup ceremony and generally have to work on Bitcoin.This is not an altcoin discussion; its sole goal is trying to find one or more L1 privacy solution candidates for Bitcoin.As I'm still learning a lot on this subject, I appreciate suggestions for changes and additions to whatever I write next.. I will also add more sections / lists in place of reserved posts over time.The set of lists and the lists themselves are by no means definitive or authoritative; merely a starting point, and will be maintained. Yes, I even leave question marks wherever I'm sure more information has to be added since I'm not educated enough on these topics. We're all going to learn something together here... Selected privacy-focused altcoin projects, techniques employed and limitations: Monero Ring signatures: obfuscate UTXOs Ring confidential transactions: hide amounts (range proof) Bulletproofs: much more efficient NIZK range proofs Stealth addresses: sender generates unlinkable one-time address from given public key Drawbacks: larger transaction size, ... ? Zcash Zerocoin: basically in-protocol mixing for existing coin e.g. Bitcoin, precursor of Zerocash Zerocash: successor of Zerocoin: smaller, faster verifiable transactions, variable amounts, spendable directly to receiver Drawbacks: centralized 'key creation ceremony' required, larger transaction size, ... ? Grin MimbleWimble: complete new protocol for confidential transactions and smaller transactions (but interactive!) Drawbacks: interactive - both parties need to be online at the same time, ... ? Litecoin MimbleWimble Extension Blocks: optional MW, but non-interactive and with stealth addresses Extension Blocks: kind of like little side chains with extra features (in this case MW) Drawbacks: it's only optional, ... ?Layer 1 privacy concepts that could / do work in Bitcoin: CoinJoin (Greg Maxwell): combine transactions to hide who pays whom - usable today CoinSwap (Greg Maxwell): swap coins with someone else to get new transaction history - usable today Confidential Transactions (Greg Maxwell): hide transaction value - sidechain / softfork needed MimbleWimble: complete new protocol for confidential transactions and smaller transactions - big fork needed (? To-do: look into how it was done on LTC)",

      "body": "The biggest downsides of privacy tech like ZCash and Monero is that they hugely hurt scalability, not just by having much larger transactions, but also by making it impossible to identify the UTXO set. Because you never know when outputs are spent, you have to maintain the entire TXO set (i.e. not only store but be able to efficiently index it) all the time. (When Monero fans claim that it improves scalability over Bitcoin, they conveniently ignore these properties and instead refer to Monero's ability to increase the maximum block size under conditions of congestion.)Mimblewimble is the opposite, allowing you to completely forget about spent outputs, even in the Initial Block Download, greatly improving scalability and privacy at the same time.Quote from: jackg on August 19, 2022, 09:43:46 PMI was looking at a chart comparing grin and monero on the stackexchange yesterday. Link provided: https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/11107/what-is-the-difference-between-monero-xmr-and-grin-grinA much more objective comparison can be found athttps://phyro.github.io/grinvestigation/why_grin.htmlThe one downside to Mimblewimble compared to bitcoin, is that it no longer allows full auditability.But at least in Grin, auditability reduces to one simple equation. Quoting from https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/kyhgcv/are_there_any_public_cryptocurrencyblockchainΣ utxo = Σ kernel + offset * G + height * 60e9 * HAnother feature, that can be considered both an advantage in some cases, and a disadvantage in others, is that MW transactions are multisig by sender AND receiver, and thus require them to interact to build the tx, just as is already the case for Lightning. The advantage being that you cannot receive unwanted coins (like tainted ones), and don't need to scan the blockchain for new outputs unless you just transacted. The disadvantage is that you need to be in communication with the recipient.Note that Litecoin's MWEB implementation is not pure MW, but a more complicated hybrid that no longer requires receiver interaction.QuoteThe main difference I noticed was grin being considered fairly weak for privacy as it hides historic information and transaction amounts but those can be gathered before a transaction is confirmedThis is quite wrong.

      "body": "One of the major drawbacks I see in a lot of the privacy coins is actually the privacy. I have no idea how / if it could be done but we would need a way for Alice to pay Bob that is 100% private BUT at the same time provide them with a way that if needed Alice could prove to the world that she did in fact pay Bob to this address and this amount and here it is to be seen on a public block explorer. BUT and this is a big but, they both have to agree to release that info. Alice says she paid and here is her 1/2 of the info. Bob now has to put up his 1/2 to show there was no transaction if he said he was not paid. This way in event that either Alice or Bob are compromised you still can't get the information because you need the other 1/2.If you can't do that then there will be a lot of people who are going to start popping up saying that they didn't get their money.Which brings up the next question, which probably needs it's own thread. Do we need L1 privacy or would an integrated into the protocol but on an L2 privacy be better?-Dave",

For a payment from Alice to Bob, this is a statement signed by Bob's public key (associated with his wallet) that appearance of certain data on-chain (sufficiently confirmed), proves that he was paid by Alice. The statement can include amount, time, and purpose of payment.BUT Bob's agreement is not needed to release this info.

Do we need L1 privacy or would an integrated into the protocol but on an L2 privacy be better?I think amount and address privacy is best built into the base consensus layer, as these improve scalability as well in case of MW.But hiding input-output links (obfuscating the tx graph) on the base layer comes at a large cost in either scalability or (in case of recursive snarks/starks) in trustworthiness, so perhaps that is better added on as separate service  (such as the Mimblewimble CoinSwap protocol).",

If we really don't trust each other 1 or 2. One is fully public 2 is private but can be released without my consent or knowledge so there is proof for the sender. 3 is private and secure.-Dave",
