I am looking for a crypto payment system for my Shopify store and have come across Coinbase, Binance, and Bitpay, but they work a lot with databases and tend to impose their apps. I found a Crypto Pay System called Blueberry Pay which looks very promising.Does anyone know of another payment system where the degree of decentralization is high?",

So, that's just the downside of a decentralized project because once you have created trust towards the community, they can rug pull you and get a lot of money from the community. Maybe you can make your payment gateway so that you wouldn't need to rely on other apps. You need to develop it, though.",

Even though we wanted to make crypto payment as decentralized as possible, there are factors to such need in terms of convenience. Something like OP wanted but having a hard time to deal with a single deed without having centralized process. Scams are probably prone to this and make us use their system and putting up our trust and in the end pull off a lousy modus to their customers.Cant get help but rely on convenient way of some centralized service system which dont have any hassle to a simple wants like buying a product that easily accept and transact orders.",

But it seems that it is not 100% decentralized either, moreover it uses an escrow system you have to make sure that their credibility and security is good because this is related to your payment gateway.",

      "body": "I'd recommend trying to make your own or hiring people to develop/manage the payment gateway to be used on your shop if you want it to be decentralized. Payment gateways are Centralized to help the process of conversion from fiat to crypto be a lot smoother since you may be paying in crypto, but that doesn't mean that the shop will store it as crypto. On the Shopify note though, based on the link @Bttzed03 gave shouldn't the only gateways accepted be the ones listed there? Cause if so then I think looking for alternatives or developing your own wouldn't really do anything. I'm not familiar with how Shopify works so I might be wrong, feel free to correct me then.",

I think if you are feeling good with it and just use it. I can't give you a suggestion caused by almost all of things were centralized. Even defi was actually centralized",

If you want to get cashed in on FIAT, then surely a centralized option is the way to get since they offer a FIAT automatic conversion.For accepting Bitcoin or LN, BTCPay server is the recommended way since it gives you full control of all the things, you can see their tutorial to integrate it with Shopify here: How to accept Bitcoin in Shopify. By using it, you can also extend it to accept other cryptocurrencies, but further development is needed(https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Development/Altcoins/).",

Obviously there will be some small and shadier businesses that won't do this but if we want adoption, some sort of centralization needed.",

Most payment projects are mostly centralize since they have to comply with the financial regulatory bodies and in other to stay in business and attract a high number of users it is important they operate in a centralized manner.
