By the way, why don't you use some other coin with lower fee to transfer funds between exchanges? You can use https://withdrawalfees.com/exchanges/coinbase to find out which coin has the lowest fees and that is also available on Bitget.",

If you really don't want to take the risk and stick with big fees stablecoins are still an option. Or just use Bitcoin because the Fee is only $ 0.73, what does that mean is only $ 1 for the fee, while the assets withdrawn are up to thousands of dollars.

It is unprofitable to trade with smaller amounts there, because it is a lot to pay 30 dollars of commission from $1,000. If someone asks about the minimum commission, then this is a small amount. If I were transferring $10,000, I would pay $15 commission and not waste time looking to save $5-10.",

Choosing too many exchanges or DeFi Ecosystems which is cheaper will be a waste of time, especially if it has been converted to altcoins, price fluctuations will be more risky because they will lose value quickly.In the DeFi Ecosystem, the gas fee will be affected by how dense the ethereum network is due to an increase in requests for more transactions, such as the increase in transactions caused by the $BLUR airdrop a few days ago, the increase in gas fees is very high. So, don't think too hard about getting a fee under $ 1 when transactions are made for thousands of dollars, $ 15-$ 30 is still very reasonable.",

For now, you can actually use any network including the ERC 20 the fee is relatively low since Ethereum turns into PoS if the Coinbase has TRC withdraw and Bitget had TRC deposit you can use it since TRC20 is dirt cheap fee.Â  But Im rarely withdraw from one exchange to another I think the best way is withdraw it to your local wallet fist",

Trading to other coins and then withdrawing it directly would be better IMO. Sure it depends on liquidity and how fast your tx will be confirmed on the blockchain, but it is arguably faster and cheaper if other factors don't change that much. If you use an exchange that has very expensive withdrawal fees regardless of which network you use, maybe it is time to consider other platforms or use DEX.Quote from: dansus021 on February 19, 2023, 09:54:04 AMfirst is What the option that coinbase has.

Is it Terracoin? I've tried to see if Coinbase supports them but it seems they don't. If you're referring to Tron, it seems like they don't support it either. They do list it on their browse crypto website but they don't list it on their exchange. Ethereum fee is still a bit expensive compared to other networks, they are still in a transition phase at the end of the day so don't expect much. CMIIW.",

The fee currently for withdrawing Bitcoin is 0.00002414 BTC, which does not exceed $0.60, and for Ethereum it is 0.000567 ETH, which is equivalent to less than $1 at the current Ethereum price.A final tip, I advise you not to withdraw directly from Coinbase to any other platform, but rather withdraw to your own wallet and then deposit to the platform you want to transfer to.",

In order to transfer USDT from Coinbase to Bitget, you would need to find the correct address to send it to. Checking with Bitget to find out which network they use for USDT transfers and whether they charge any fees for receiving USDT. For Coinbase, if you're not able to select the network when sending USDT, it's possible that they automatically select the most appropriate network for the transfer based on the destination address. However, it's always a good idea to double check the details before making any transfers to ensure that you're not charged any unexpected fees.",
