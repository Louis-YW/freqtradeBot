  "content": "QuoteBinance Data Shows 40% of Major Holdings Are BUSD, BNBBinance Holdings’ major crypto token holdings include $74.7 billion worth of coins, of which around 40% are in its branded stablecoin and native coin, according to data compiled by Nansen based on information from the world’s largest digital-asset exchange.Of the $74.6 billion termed as net worth, about $23 billion was in the BUSD stablecoin, issued by Paxos, and $6.4 billion in its Binance Coin, according to Nansen. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-11/binance-data-shows-40-of-major-holdings-are-busd-bnb?leadSource=uverify%20wallSo it looks like binance is in a similar situation compared to FTX.so  let me ask. Do you have bnb, busd, or any cryptocurrencies in your binance account?Think about it. Binance might fall overnight just like ftx.  If for some reason bnb price drop (which is absurdly high now btw, as a top5 coin) we will see a massive Holdings withdrawal in binance. Just like ftx.",

Do you have bnb, busd, or any cryptocurrencies in your binance account?Even if they are not on Binance exchange, and you have this shitcoins (including fake bitcoin on bsc chain) in your non-custodial wallet, you are in danger of losing your money.If BNB token or BSC chain collapses for any reason, all on-chain transactions will stop, fake dex exchanges will stop working, and value of this coins will go down fast, probably to zero.I would never keep larger amount of coins on Binance or any other exchange, but I also recommend converting all shitcoins to Bitcoin and withdrawing them to hardware wallet or cold wallet.Binance is seriously connected with FTX, heck they wanted to buy them few days ago, and who knows what other dirty connections we don't know yet.I don't think Binance will collapse soon or in few days, but there is good chance this could happen in near future, so better be safe than sorry.",

Just like ftx.With the way I detest BNB, BUSD and all those other shit chains of theirs,i don't even trade any pair involving them when using their exchange...Something bad is most likely to happen in the near future and when it does we better be ready.Quote from: dkbit98 on November 12, 2022, 07:09:35 PMBinance is seriously connected with FTX, heck they wanted to buy them few days ago, and who knows what other dirty connections we don't know yet.Most importantly why the hell would an exchange have $500M worth of a \"rival\" exchange's tokens?There is definitely something we don't know yet.",

However, who was expecting FTX to collapse? Probably no one, and it collapse in just a few days.Although binance looks much more solid, and probably is, it may fall as well someday in some unexpected event.  Many of those cryptocurrency companies may be much more connected than they look like.",
