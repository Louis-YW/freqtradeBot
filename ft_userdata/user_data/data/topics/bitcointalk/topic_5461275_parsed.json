  "content": "The Netball World Cup is a quadrennial international netball world championship organized by World Netball. So it is starting today and the host country are South Africa. 16 teams will be battling it out across the 10 days, in the hope they will be crowned champions in netball’s most prestigious event.Anyone know where we can bet on these matches? It is a World Cup after all... and I think Women's Sport does not get the same attention as Male Sport are getting. So, please... drop some names of Sport betting sites on this thread, if you spot them hosting bets on this. Also discuss this event, if you are a Netball spectator.",

Also discuss this event, if you are a Netball spectator.  The Sponsors also look into Netball as like the football and cricket World Cup games.If the people and sponsors concentrate on the netball,then the gambling sites also include the netball in their site.The world biggest sporting betting site like stake.com may include this in their list.But the gamblers should show their interest to the game.Not only netball,their are many games which host their World Cup games.But it doesn’t reach the people because of less sponsors to that game.Still the people not receiving the winners of some games like netball,volleyball and basketball on arrival to their home country.",

      "body": "Don't know much about Netball, but I assume that English speaking countries such as England, New Zealand and Australia are the dominating force in this sport. 6 countries (including the hosts) managed to enter the tournament directly, and remaining 10 teams came from the regional qualifiers (2 each from 5 continental qualifiers). I like this idea of regional qualification. Unlike some of the other sports bodies such as FIFA, they are ensuring that there is adequate representation from all the regions. For example, Tonga and Fiji have qualified from the Oceania qualifiers.",
