The only thing related bitcoin is how to get a good self custodian wallets and this also wouldn’t be much of a problem if many people become involved into bitcoin, at least if people could suggest banks or distinguish between mortgage and regular banks to each other in fiat systems, then the more bitcoin spreads the more the knowledge of better wallets will also spread. As for issues concerning bumping transactions or canceling them this also isn’t a big problem. Just like it was stated internet has become easy but it wasn’t so in the early stages, so once people get involved they will learn mostly through experience. If Grandma can today navigate between social media platforms then this also would not be hard. Lastly all these are still not known because of lack of its  awareness once the government becomes its user friendly then there will even be public awareness schemes that would just address this problems. So to me it is not a problem at all if only you’re holding bitcoin and not involved in Altcoins or even trading.",

I remember teaching my grandmother about 20 years ago how to use a mobile phone (old phone, without internet, just sms and calling options). It took me weeks of patiently trying and asking what she remember every time we saw each other. Unfortunately no success. Unfortunately, it happens that before the old generation learns a new technology, they leave this world faster if they are interested in learning at all, because they usually stop chasing the new technologies and focus on relationships.I agree that crypto needs to be simpler for average user, but its not like every todays grandma needs to know how to use it.",

Otherwise native segwit would have been the golden standard a long time ago.Personally I do not implement P2WPKH-P2SH (\"3\") address support at all, just native segwit, and legacy addresses for people stuck using outdated software. Taproot support is also questionable and it's only really useful if you are making scripts. Otherwise it is not much different from native segwit. Of course, support for sending to all of those addresses are important (and only involves implementing Base58 and Bech32 decoding - which would already be present if you are supporting legacy + native segwit), it's just the wallet generation part where you can safely stick with legacy and native segwit, like Electrum.QuoteYou could be a target of dusk attack and not many people know how to not spend the dust transactions.Fair enough. But if I were to receive dust, I would just burn it up in the (mining) atmosphere.Quote from: Solosanz on May 28, 2023, 06:32:05 AMNot many people aware of lightning network and how to open a channel.Also valid, though in my OP I was referring to Layer 1.Quote from: Solosanz on May 28, 2023, 06:32:05 AMNot many people know what is CPFP, RBF and sat/byte.Arguably they shouldn't have to, that is the job of the wallet software to handle. All users need to know, are fee priorities \"High\" \"Medium\" and \"Low\", which the software automatically chooses the appropriate sat/byte value depending on network conditions, and \"Refund\" which is just a double spend using RBF (which is on the brink of being enabled globally for the entire network anyway).QuoteAfter all either Bitcoin or altcoins are hard to understand if people don't want to spend few hours everyday to learn about it. All people should have to learn is: \"How does bitcoin (the network) work\" and \"how to use a bitcoin wallet\". They shouldn't have to read Mastering Bitcoin if they don't want to.Most altcoins though have brought their complexity onto themselves, with all this \"token\", \"bridge\", \"web3\" gibberish.Quote from: Poker Player on May 28, 2023, 08:19:09 AMQuote from: NotATether on May 28, 2023, 06:19:58 AMQuoteIs it so difficult for crypto developers to create a UI or anything that would make crypto easier/ more accessible to people.The internet was \"difficult\" once...but now even grandma can surf the net.

I disagree about shitcoins, I don't see anyone using something like $PEPE as cash material. Or even DOGE which has not received an update to its full node for an entire year.CDBCs are more concerning, but then again it will probably just be implemented as another way for your banks, Paypal and co. to store your money. In other words, people don't actually have to learn how to use the CDBC because their financial apps stay the same, it's just the banks being forced to adapt to that. That's how I believe people will eventually be made to use CDBCs.",

This is correct; I believed the same thing. Many people wanted to know how to purchase and sell Bitcoin so that they could do so whenever they wished. That is why some people prefer to use centralized exchanges because they make buying and selling easier than peer-to-peer transactions, which can be difficult to see depending on your location.Gaining information about everything you said is beneficial, but not everyone has the time to learn everything, and it is not vital for them to know everything before purchasing Bitcoin.Quote from: Z-tight on May 28, 2023, 07:08:23 AMMost of the content from this crosspost is about altcoins, and this section is for only BTC discussion, so we have to look at it on the side of BTC.

Grandpa could be a busy man who doesn't have the time to study what will disturb his old brain.Not so many people will struggle to make money and also struggle to learn how to save their money. That is why many resorted to fiat and the banking system. I know that as time goes on many things would be made user friendly. I remember when you need to run the whole blockchain in your computer in order to participate in bitcoin. But today the server can easily be reached by the wallet software developers and we can easily interact with blockchain through a simple application.

I mean, sure, giving cash to someone is easier and there are many people that find anything else difficult. But making a BTC transaction in Electrum is not more difficult for me than making a bank transfer. In both cases you deal with numbers and symbols, and with a bank transfer it can even be harder if it's an international payment or official transfer to a bank account (where you need to enter tons of data before you're done). There's an issue of responsibility that you have if you make a mistake, and there can be issues with transaction speed. But if someone wants a faster and more familiar way, they can use a centralized service. From what I've seen in videos, it seems there are services that are very user-friendly, as long as you're okay with custodial storage, and since these people seem to be okay with banks, they're probably fine with that as well. So the user-friendly way exists as well, I believe. And it's not like non-custodial wallets are hard to figure out.",

The simplest UI we can have is a send/receive button with extremely basic transaction history information and balance. Show fees in USD only. If the user needs to receive BTC, they’ll need to have a single Bitcoin address that never changes. They’ll need to have no change addresses. This is the most basic you can get. And I agree, this kind of UI would attract more than Electrum orBitcoin Core.But what do you do then? As soon as the user learns fees are actually fixed in sats, not in USD, they’ll be confused. As soon as they’ll learn their behavior of using a single address for all transactions is wrong, they’ll be confused and mad. You can’t lose functionality to win new users. Either they roll with us or they remain stuck in the fiat system where they are. The most fascinating part of Bitcoin is where you realize you have free will for your money, why lose this feeling because at that point the “simple UI” will be no different to a classic banking app..",

Go back to in the 90s when the Internet was catching on everybody thought it was this great new thing. But it really came into existence in early 1983. And before that for decades you had people dialing in through modems too other systems. This is about money camera this is about financial independence.So now take a look at it from that perspective, credit cards came along in the 1950s and it was still 30 plus years before they became ubiquitous for use in our society. I even remember back in the mid to late 80s where many places did not accept credit cards it was cash or check only. When online banking became a thing it still took a while for people to really accept Titus. And now there are a lot of banks that you could only deal with online. It does not have to become more user friendly, between all the web wallets and other wallets that make it incredibly simple to buy and sell crypto. It just has to hit that tipping point of use where it's everywhere. I am not a fan of square and their wallet and the entire cash app thing. Let me make that clear. But if they ever get off their ass and fulfill their promise of every one of their terminals taking cryptocurrency payments you're going to see usage and adoption goes through the roof. Because this might be in New York centric thing, I see their terminals everywhere in small businesses.-Dave",
