You can't have an idea on who owns those addresses and wallets not until you've known they own it personally.Well, for some light of hope. With those hacks and scams that has happened to other companies, I've seen news that a portion of it have been retrieved and taken back. Hopefully, it'll be the same for FTX victims.",

Actually the hacker are stole centralized coins that Sam Bankman can easily ask the developer of the coins to freeze the coins, but he's too late and the hacker already convert it to Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin is decentralized and there's nothing can stop Bitcoin transaction except it's still on centralized exchanges, the hacker can successfully rob all of FTX money.",

There would be indeed investigations would be made but it wont really be something an easy and fast solving out this case.Feel sorry for those who had been affected on this bankruptcy issue which the truth is those funds been used on other means.This is why its never been that suggestable on storing up yourfunds or assets on an online exchange platform which you dont really possess the keys.People never ever learn and would really be just doing things when they are already getting fucked up.Not your keys = not your coins... this should really be put up into someones mind.",

I dont know why this man still not imprisoned considering millions of dollars he stole from crypto investors. He is still doing interviews.   SBF is not a nobody. He was supported by the big people in the government including Gary Gensler. I suspect the investigation will even be flipped and focused more on the users/investors as to how they got thier money and whether are they paying taxes. The thousands of IRS agents will come into thier residence.",

But that does not mean that the real culprit will not be imprisoned.This only happens in the crypto business as there is currently no crypto regulation, but if FTX were a traditional business then things would be different. FTX does not register business licenses in all countries, so once bankrupt, they are not obligated to compensate investors but in the US and Bahamas, FTX is obligated to compensate investors if they don't want to be sued and go to jail. FTX has business registration in these 2 countries.Quote from: gunhell16 on November 23, 2022, 05:42:57 AMOf course, there will be a thorough investigation into that, and I think the FBI is going to have a hard time with this.

But I believe that regardless of the outcome of the investigation, the possibility of him going to jail is unlikely as crypto investment is always warned by the government as risky and the investor is responsible for their decisions.",

Maybe the authorities don't want to open up to the public about the investigation being carried out to prevent the criminal from going away making it even more difficult to trace but It's only a matter of time until we finally read the news that he's been arrested, what's weird to me is how the organizers of the event still allowed him to speak at the event and if I were one of the participants at the event would opt out because everything he said was bullshit, and people who have made a bad image of crypto should be prohibited from returning to activities in crypto although he could assume a new identity.",

It seems that you watch a lot of movies, there are other censorship authorities that handle financial investigations, and it is now up to the regulators.Unfortunately, when you deposit your money in central platforms, you trust that the platform will return that money to you. Otherwise, recovering it through the regulatory and legal authorities may take many years.",

He can't deny he didn't have a hand in the collapse of his exchange. Dude isn't clean. There was a lot that went on in the background which will soon be revealed in time to come. His books and records aren't clean and that was why CZ Binance backed out from the deal of taking over FTX. Though I ain't a victim, I can imagine the pains of those who lost cash by patronizing that exchange. Sam deserves to get a jail term.",

He involves too much in politics in the US. It is strange to see on social media, on newspapers, recent days, there are many articles that wrote good words about Sam and shown sympathy about him. They try to distort the truth and make their readers think Sam is like a victim but not a reason of that collapse. Maybe the Democrats party and related entities try to do something for Sam.More weird, rather than investigating about Sam and FTX, they are trying to investigate about CZ and Binance and consider the collapse of FTX is because of Binance and CZ.QuoteBut I believe, these coming weeks, there will be updates about FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried.
