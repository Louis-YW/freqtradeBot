  "content": "It's not a matter of being appreciative; rather, it has to do with my personal growth and my pursuit of my life's goals. I started out as an employee who produced sober outcomes. As a result, while I can cover my expenses, it is challenging to satisfy my \"wants\". I then proceeded to sell services, and everything went well. The result is that I constantly have an issue to deal with and must find a solution for it. Then I moved to the realm of MLM. The outcomes are mediocre, because thus far the distribution of \"profits\" in the MLM sector has not been fair. The effect is that I have to retain my reputation, no matter what the conditions are, prestige is number 1, to the point where I don't even notice that I can't even afford to purchase milk for my child. The results of my switch to actual business were not awful, but this is where my debts mounted, and I thought the debt statistics were amazing. If you don't pay the interest on your loan, your current assets will be seized as a result. Not to mention being exposed to member fraud and corruption, as a result I went bankrupt owing to a lack of expertise in operating a genuine business. Then I shifted to the HYIP and BO world. The outcomes were fantastic, but that's also where I experienced the extraordinary and never-ending ups and downs, being defrauded despite temporarily being wealthy. Just flourished briefly before having to restart. The result is that when friends, coworkers, or family members visit us and initially worship us as gods due to our steady profits, when a scam happens, everyone curses it out. I feel like giving up right now. Since I can now make bitcoin funds and undoubtedly get a great deal of information and insight from this group with the correct trade knowledge, I am now really glad to have found it. My life has entirely transformed from how it was before thanks to bitcoin, which has taught me to dream big. I truly like being a part of this community since it allows me to accumulate bitcoins.",

I have no idea how this helped you. But even so, Bitcoin has really helped a lot by coming to this field.",

Something that you can \"sell\" to people, without feeling guilty that it is a scam. Unfortunately MLM's and Ponzi schemes have followed the technology and they too are using Bitcoin as a payment option for their scams... this is giving Bitcoin a bad reputation.... because the people invested in that... seem to think that they are invested in Bitcoin.",

It's a pleasure that you got to know about Bitcoin, the decentralized digital currency that put us in control of our fund, but one thing I will love to add is that while you learn about the benefits of Bitcoin, please don't forget to also read about it's disadvantages also for being a volatile currency, and as such we should always afford to invest an amount you can always afford to lose.QuoteI truly like being a part of this community since it allows me to accumulate bitcoins.However, that should be your secondary reason and not primarily reason on being on this forum, as this forum is indeed an encyclopedia of all you need to know about Bitcoin.",
