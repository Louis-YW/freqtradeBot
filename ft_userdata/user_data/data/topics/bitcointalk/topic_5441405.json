      "body": "This question has been asked several times and answered as well. When the entire bitcoins have been mined, rewards from miners would be gotten entirely from transaction fees. This would not happen instantly, but slowly over the course of the years with each halving, this means that the system would have enough time to adjust to working entirely on tx fees.A solution could be through growth in 2nd layer transactions like Lightening network, reducing the bulk of transactions performed on chain and when it is done, it would require a higher fee to compensate the miners.P.S, all these are speculations, it remains to be seen how the network would operate at that time.",

No confirmation will be made by any miner as consequence of a dead network.Do you really think there will be no single Bitcoin miner on Earth?Because if there is only one miner left, network difficulty will be adjusted after each 2,016 blocks that takes about 14 days (2 weeks), after many times, difficulty will be re-targeted to be lower and lower. Chance to see all miners shut down their rigs at the same time is very impossible.Bitcoin mining difficulty. Everything you need to knowWith a dead network, you can not talk about its security. Dead is the end of everything but fortunately if miners operate their ASICs again, network will become lively again.",

      "body": "Bitcoin ming reward was 50 BTC before. I can ask a question at the time that bitcoin mining may not be profitable in 10 years when the block reward has reduced to 6.25 BTC. That might be what some people may think but not what that happened. More people join the mining and the hashrate increased. What I think is that transaction fee will gradually replace mining reward and we are still continue to see increase in hashrate in a way that the bitcoin blockchain is still very much secure.Quote from: Upgrade00 on February 27, 2023, 12:11:52 PMA solution could be through growth in 2nd layer transactions like Lightening network, reducing the bulk of transactions performed on chain and when it is done, it would require a higher fee to compensate the miners.I think what the OP means is that it is possible for bitcoin hashrate to continue to decrease if all bitcoin have been mined because miners may not see it profitable again and leave mining it, and maybe for other altcoins. Layer 2 solution like lightning network can help in scalability issue but can not help in strengthening the bitcoin blockchain.",

Layer 2 solution like lightning network can help in scalability issue but can not help in strengthening the bitcoin blockchain.I understood OP's question and aptly responded to it.I refered to layer 2 solutions like LN cause they could help reduce the load on chain.Consider a situation where Mr. Bob opens a channel on LN and performs hundred of transactions through it before closing the channel, the on chan connection would be at the point where he opened the channel and when he closed it, so miners would only confirm two large transactions rather than hundreds of smaller ones, and the two large ones will come with a larger fee, increasing the fee paid for per block for the miner that confirms it, possibly making mining more profitable with just tx fees.",

However, transaction fees will still be paid to miners to incentivize them to continue verifying transactions and maintaining the security of the network because the security of the bitcoin network will continue to rely on transaction fees incentivizing miners.But why there are such people thinking too much ahead of time and scratching their heads about the impossible things that happen?",

Block 5,168,390 -> Last Reward Block)Max Coin Generated is 20,999,999.97690000 (rounding)I don't know how the network remains secure after the end of the mining process. But, I believe mining is not going to end. They will get the transaction fees that we spend. A couple of satoshis will be worth a lot (I hope). I am not an expert on it.
