I could see these being popular among members and casinos looking to reward their users with something special. Nice find. I can’t say I’ll be participating but it’s always nice to learn of a new use case.",

      "body": "If so, there is a possibility that it will become a new trend in the gambling business to attract more gambling users. However, if the casino does not yet have a place to trade the NFT, I think the interest of gamblers to own the NFT will not be too great because they can only keep the NFT without being able to sell it for other profits. But I'm sure the casino can accommodate that and help gamblers who already have the NFT so that they can also get other benefits apart from gambling.",

This sounds a lot like a faucet but for NFTs. I don't find this very exciting. There was a bubble of NFTs that started to burst a few months ago, and realistically, 99% are going to have a value of 0 or very close to 0 in the next few years. Of course you can like win the lottery with NFTs, also by playing for free with slot machines, but it is practically impossible.",

The benefits coming from their own NFT collection really made it more interesting, One thing I don't like is the airdrop of NFTs as that might easily kill the value of the other NFT due to the increasing monthly supply but the rest sounds great and promising though.",

What holders? Is the project owner seeking for investors? Those investors better be careful.Anyway, the NFT industry is slowly dying and all the hype surrounding NFTs is going away. Most NFTs, which costed several hundreds or even several thousand dollars are going to cost 10-20 dollars in the near future. The market liquidity on the NFT markets is decreasing and selling your NFTs will get harder as time goes by. Good luck winning some nice NFTs and trying to sell them for actual cryptocurrencies.I don't mind wasting my time playing on this NFT slots game(if there was a free option), but wouldn't bet any money on it. It's not worth it.",

I also admitted my mistake in saying that NFTs are Tulip Mania 2.0. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5377417.msg59219783#msg59219783Although, there will be some people in the forum who wouldn't like it because their belief remains, \"NFTs have no value\". I have debated against it, and asked who are we, as plebs, to say what has, or has no value? It's the market that decides \"value\", including shitcoins.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5377417.msg59247492#msg59247492Plus the concept of \"NFTs\" was already mentioned by Hal Finney. I believe Bitcoin as a protocol has missed the ride in this development.",

What if a \"common NFT\", but a dynamic one, would increase its probability of \"generating\" a rare trait if it stored in a special wallet, giving the holder an opportunity to increase his NFTs value?",

I would definitely play in a casino where you a have a chance of winning an NFT from Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks or, now trending, goblintown.wtf, but having my RTP lowering for a chance of winning something of zero value, or even with the same RTP but in a shady casino ...
