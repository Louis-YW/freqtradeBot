  "content": "I want to share some basic statistics and definitions to make this thread more accessible to anyone, even people who haven't taken Econ101.What is stagflation? QuoteIn economics, the term stagflation is used when there is almost no growth in production, yet there is high inflation, and unemployment is high.Source: Simle English Wikipedia. Stagflation is surely a situation no economy would want to be in. Having inflation to keep increasing while the economy is contracting is a sign of collapse and definitely a bad look for investment. This time around we might be getting some early warning signs that the U.S. economy could be at a pivotal point that could make or break its entry into a dire macroeconomic situation. The DataSource: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATEFED's data shows that in the U.S. unemployment isn't high, but has picked up slightly from the lows it had reached. Meanwhile, industrial production has remained in levels lower than those of 2022's summerIn spite of the above however, the average billable hours that employees put to work has been increasing constantlyAnd USD inflation has been persistent above 3% after it peaked at a rate above 9% in 2021. Do you think that the fears of a potential stagflation creeping through the economy hold any substance? For sure having inflation remain high during a phase of contraction and reduced growth is worrying, especially after it peaked that high. But the FED keeps saying \"just a tiny bit more\", meaning that the economy needs to contract just a little bit more before we can be done with our money being worth increasingly less due to high inflation. Â Perhaps they've lost control already, but is it too early to tell? Or perhaps is inflation the new norm?On the other hand, there's an increasing amount of people that see the hypocrisy in trying to battle inflation by increasing unemployment, all while people keep working more hours with FIAT money's purchasing power decreasing. An increasing amount of people keep considering bitcoin as a means to defend against inflation. But will it pay off if the economy officially enters into stagflation?",

This can be done because the government has control over finances with the help of the central bank. If the government feels that people's purchasing power is insufficient, the government will lower interest rates so that people can borrow money from banks and have production capacity and increase purchasing power, or the government will provide subsidies so that the price of goods does not rise. and people can still buy it.The circulation of money in society must always be balanced, because too much money will cause demand for more goods and prices will rise, too little money will reduce purchasing power. I think a country's economy is very complicatedWhen a country uses bitcoin, it is likely that the government will not be able to regulate finances in society. I don't know whether it will be good or bad, because there is no more financial control.",

Even though many economic observers say that the USD will collapse, in reality all countries still hold USD as foreign exchange, this makes America too tough and difficult to fight in the near future.Moreover, if a country dares to mess with America, they can threaten and intimidate with the sophisticated weaponry and aircraft carriers they have.

However, subsidies can be used to stimulate the economy, if carried out continuously it will have a bad impact because people will depend on subsidies and the state will not be able to bear the full burden of subsidies provided continuously.We know that having control over fiat can make things worse, especially if the government is not pro-people, do you have any views on bitcoin? if a country uses bitcoin which cannot be controlled then it will be good or bad because there is no government interference in the country's financial system",

This in turn can decrease inflationary pressures.Tightening monetary policy: The central bank can decrease the money supply by selling government bonds or raising reserve requirements for banks. This can also decrease spending and slow down economic growth, which can decrease inflationary pressures.Intervening in the currency market: The central bank might try to achieve a currency appreciation which would then reduce the prices of imported goods and services and perhaps reduce cost-push inflation.What do you think are the most effective and more realistic measure among the three?",

But will it pay off if the economy officially enters into stagflation?Frankly, I'm still baffled by this write-up as you seem not to really understand economics not to talk of the US economy itself. There is nothing to worry about when it comes to the US economy right now, people are only creating panic where there is none, the economy is in capable hands, except that criticisms are too many and most of these critics do not understand what they are saying. Is it for the Inflation, GDP, and PMIs, all are fine with the US. But if it were to be in 2021/2022 that you made this article, I would have said there is a reason for this, not now. There is no economy without a challenge, the response of the government to it is what matters most and if there is a country in the world that is so good and are fit for the task in this regard, the US is the number, damn critics.Let me start with the US inflation, the inflation is being beaten down by the government's measures and policies. The CPI has dropped to an average of 3.2% in a year, which is against the alarming figure of 6.5% a year earlier. Again, the GDP continues to grow, and as of the last, a whopping 4.9% annualized quarterly rate was declared, which is far better than the previous two years. And the Unemployment rate which just moved from 3.8% is currently at 3.9% and is still not alarming like other countries. This fluctuates month-monthly and who knows before the end of January if it would be below 3.7% again? Nonetheless, it's far better than many top world countries' rates as Canada's Unemployment rate is 5.70% and the average of the EU's Unemployment rate is about 6.5% even as Spain's Unemployment rate is 12.00%. So why the fear for the US with a 3.9% Unemployment rate?In light of these and more like the consumer sentiment and CB Consumer confidence that stands at 63.8 and 102.6 respectively etc. and were recently released positively in the last releases, the USD economy is not such that should be worried about stagflation as the economy grows and citizens are never in fear.You might want to continue the reading below:[1] The US GDP[2] The US Inflation[3] The US Unemployment Rate[4] The EU Unemployment Rate",

Not like what you said about Gen Z being picky when it comes to work and being influenced by social media ain't true, but to sum up that that's the cause of unemployment is a different level. Besides, being picky is not a bad thing, you can't accept every job that comes your way. You can't compare someone who did a job for $8 per hour 10 years ago to someone doing the same job for the same pay rate with the level of inflation we are right now. So yea, it's okay to demand more. You make it sound like rejecting a job that pays peanut means you're expecting a job that pays a million a week. I agree that social media has affected a lot of young people negativity. They want so much more, but the has also made them resourceful don't you think? If you can't accept a job that pays $5k a month, then you've got to work extremely hard and smart to earn $15k a month. It only becomes stupid and a problem when you refuse a job that pays $5k a month then you just sit down expecting a better one without working hard for it.BTW, I don't think there are many Gen Zs that will reject a $5k per month job or feel it's too small.",

No, they won't do that. They'll take loans and finance the project then pay back the loan from the proceeds of the investment over time.",

They don't really know or they don't really care if what is going on now on theirs and to the global economy.",
