      "body": "Many altcoins will face the same demise as time goes on, I am not surprised as many crypto projects are built only on hypes, after the hype is no more the team will become weaker, they will fail to bring new updates into their development and big investors will start losing interest. To cut the story short, it's always lack of new development and ideas that makes a project perform weaker in time. Many altcoins all time high will be a history in future.",

Your logic was right but circulating supply was the main reason. It's like when the supply was pretty small and then people were rushing to buy that and then the supply suddenly increase as more tokens being unlocked. This was also giving a very big pressure to the price. That is happening so many times. The price can be pushed so high when the circulating supply was around a few millions but it will be going to the very low price once hundreds millions of supply will come to the circulating supply. That picture has been reflecting that situation.",

Time will help us to understand what’s really happening on this projects. Long time span like a year or more means the project is not progressing at all and doesn't have any product that will catch the investors interest to invest more on this project. In simple term, this project is already dead and just slowly fading away. Even the increased of token supply will not gonna give that kind of downtrend since the progress will give a positive atmosphere to investors to buy more.On the other hand assuming the time span is short. Probably investors is just keep selling there tokens coming from presale. Typically new tokens doesn't pump until all the presale tokens together with the private investors is already sold in the market.",

Definitely this project seems to be hyped a lot in the initial days of it's launch and suddenly it turned into bear market with uncontrolled volume. Checkout the sharp drop in the trading view. It's clear indication that this coin was dumped all in and whoever had highest holdings sold it to the bear market. Seems to be terrific project and owners themselves might have done the furious job of selling everything at once. It will never go up, not even in the green candle. May be you will see few pumps and dumps but that would be fake trading by signaling groups to earn some bucks out of it. Forget about ATH!",

But the possibility that new altcoins like Sol, Near, Dot... will repeat, they will not be able to reach the old ATH and be replaced by new altcoins with potential and superior technology. In my opinion, the main reason is that altcoins are born to be hyped and nothing more, investors understand that. Currently, potential new projects being heavily invested by VCs such as aptos, Sui, Sei, Op, Arbitrum are developing very strongly and they are the perfect choice for the next bull season to make a profit. Do not invest in top alts but wait patiently for new projects to research investment.",

Most especially if the coin has no real utility and it relies upon the hype, they eventually turn to shitcoin and that is why after listing on the exchange, the price graph keeps growing down and down. Picking a good project is very tricky, you need to join first their activity before you will conclude that they are a good project, be careful with shillers too as it seems good to be true.",

If such a graph for a coin is no more than 1 year old, it could be an indication that public investors who got their tokens after a public token sale quickly sold them, thereby collapsing the price. The price of such projects, after unlocking among large investors, may start to rise again, and may even update ATH. If such a graph is observed for a coin that is 3-4 years old, it is most likely a dead project that will never be able to update its ATH again. Developers very often freeze their old projects in order to direct all their time to projects that are relevant in the market. For example, on web3 projects.",

Based on the graph, it is very highly likely a shitcoin that you are talking about. All those coins get pumped and then dumped. Eventually no one trades them and they die in the long run. All most all well known, or at least coins with potential reaches new all time high during a bull market. There might be coins that were over priced before and then later correction takes place. Coins that are usually sold through ICO or something similar has high value initially and then investors starts to dump them causing the price to drop.Quote from: udayantha11 on November 04, 2022, 01:25:58 PMMy logics are- Circulating supply increased( Supply increased)- Project abandoned  by the team-  More high tech alternatives replace4.
