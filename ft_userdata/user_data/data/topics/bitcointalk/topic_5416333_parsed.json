Some lesser known projects like Yield Yak have barely $4,000 in Trading Volume, yet the TVL is something like $50 million, whereas a better known project like Raydium has a Trading volume of more than $6 Million, with a TVL of only a little more than triple the TVL of Yield Yak  ( $160 Million TVL )I'm also surprised that some lesser known gaming projects like Vulcan Forged have a high trading volume , whereas others ( like Axie Infinity ) have a relatively low trading volume. The way I interpret it right now ( correct me if I'm wrong ) is that trading volume is high when an ecosystem is very active and adoption is growing relative to other projects, so it's a good indicator to buy into that project.",

      "body": "Volume matters but it should be real. Don't be over-excited if you see Volume has been increasing suddenly. It's because it's pretty easy to manipulate trading volume whether it's cex or dex. Have to see also chart reflection on how it's looking. Have to realize if it's real volume or fake volume. If the price increase with the volume means real volume coming although they might exit at any time. But if you see just volume increases and not much reflection in price that means the project team doing MM to increase trading volume. Hence the token price hasn't been increasing.",

A coin can have almost 0 volume but market cap in the millions if its very illiquid.Yes, trading volume and marketcap are two different things, but you can know from marketcap of what coin trading volume can be (either high or low). The higher the marketcap, the likely higher the trading volume can be. I am not talking about marketcap in general, but of a particular exchange, comparing it with the trading volume of the exchange.Quote from: adaseb on October 07, 2022, 05:50:36 PMVolume is typically used when day trading because it gives you hints when reversals can happen.

Even I have not seen an exchange with wn indicator for marketcap, not necessary and have no useful information , but trading volume is used as an indicator in trading.",

It's one of the basis for selecting which coins to trade.That's why there's an attempt of doing a fake trading volume to lure traders.

Mostly, if the project has a low volume then it's going to be easy to ignore it and move on to the next project that tries to catch your attention. Although there really are websites that manipulate and cheat on what they show for their volume you'll eventually know if that's really the actual data it shows proportionately to the volume that it's got. Because if there are not that much people in the community, discussing about that project and the volume is quite high then you'll find it suspicious.",
