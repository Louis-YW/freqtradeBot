Not always that money is to print only when necessary to avoid inflation as you say but scarcity of money in the country is going to lead to conflict and instability, fear of collapse of government. If an exchange is having the backing from government, the collapse or scam issue like FTX can attract government support but this is not with FTX",

What a stupid idea! What you are suggesting effectively means, using resources from a very stable regime to an unstable regime just to bail them out! This way, even the stable regime will become unstable! 401K pension fund is one of the major contributors to the world economy because that's what comes into circulation after a fixed period of time which keeps millions of household running and maintains their purchasing power. Siphoning that money into an unstable field like crypto, is suicide! Recent FTX issue has shown it is extremely risky to invest into bitcoin through 401K retirement fund. https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/collapse-of-cryptocurrency-exchange-ftx-is-warning-for-fiduciaries.aspxStupid idea!",

You did not think this through, there is problem with the strategy. Once you kee pumping the market it will definitely go up but once all the traders and investors will know that this money was injected into the market as means of pumping the price, they will sell right after the first clue. They will dump like crazy to gain quick profits. Thatâ€™s the problem with volatile market like this along with the fact that you are trying to control public based ledger by all yourself. It will fail.",

This creates a vicious cycle where inflation forces banks to raise interest rates on loans higher. While economic analysts and experts might support greater credit and liquidity on the basis of small businesses generally being responsible for upwards of 50% of new job creation. Eras of high inflation make it difficult to extend credit and liquidity to the areas where its needed most.If the goal of credit and liquidity is achieved. It may need to be done outside of inflation and interest rates. Perhaps there are crypto options for this which could be developed. Or perhaps there are other formats that would work as well.",

There are people who paid in 40 years for their retirement and are not interested in any risky investment, they only want a modest return and a guaranteed payout. Once you use all that money to buy up bankrupt companies there is no guarantee anymore that the money will be available when it needs to be paid out. FTX is bankrupt because they made bad trades and inflated their own coin with fake trades. Why should such company be rewarded with a bailout for ripping people off? And why should the greedy investors of FTX who didn't look more closely on how their money was spend be saved? I don't think this is a political viable option.",

There are much greater things happening, like inflation, war and supply chain issues - these are the things having a real impact on the economy. Nobody is going to bail out these exchanges, because it doesn't affect the wider public and only affects people who gambled with their money by storing it there. There's no need to talk about 401k's or anything else, because those have trillions stored - the 8 billion that FTX lost is irrelevant to that scale. You really need to get a better grasp of economics and investing before sharing such ideas, as it looks a bit silly.",
