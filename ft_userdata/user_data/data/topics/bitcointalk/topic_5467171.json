Robert Kiyosaki doesn't have a sterling reputation especially in terms of business or finance. He may portray himself as a remarkable financial pundit, however, his failures in the same field will likely put doubts to his statements. Although what he's saying may be true, it seems it would hold less water considering how a lot of people also label him as a hypocrite. Kiyosaki doesn't seem to be the perfect mouthpiece of Bitcoin, although his words may have some merit, of course.",

      "body": "His predictions of bitcoin reaching $120,000 is not a bad one. In the nearest future bitcoin would surpass that figure. Maybe 2 to 3 years from now that target would be actualized. One thing I believe is the reason why it is not yet gaining that much speed is the adoption. Currently, the world  population is yet to tap into the bitcoin evolution which makes it slow at this pace. You can imagine when %50 of the world population are aware of bitcoin and fully adopted bitcoin is a payment option do you not think the demand for bitcoin would be high which will in other words trigger a rise in bitcoin price.The bitcoin halving is another area of focus to trigger the price increase. It is known that every four years halving occurs which reduces the total supply if I am not mistaken and  possibly causes a spike in bitcoin price to a new all time high. So therefore bitcoin halving would be a major propagating force to increase the price of bitcoin come 2024.",

Because he is always so sure that this will happen and you have to avoid it, the point is, I don't think that his interest in BTC or cryptocurrency is new. Because I watched him talk about BTC and crypto way back in time, like 5 to 6 months ago. So, I thought I should mention it here.He may have shown optimism about the price of BTC, as everyone is making predictions and many people are sharing all the possibilities (predictions that they can at least make). And most people are saying only one thing and taking ETFs as the main factor that will take BTC to new, unexpected heights. He might be optimistic about BTC and predict that it could touch $120,000, but many other people have shown their interest and optimism and also predicted the price of BTC, and the maximum I have seen is that it can touch $170,000.To be honest, I personally think that BTC can really reach $110,000, and $120,000 is not impossible, but now the year is 2023, and it might not reach that target in 2024 (which means next year). It can, but the chances are the next ATH might take place in 2025.",

In my view, he wants to portray bitcoin as the kind of investment people should buy, but you rarely see him talk about the disadvantages of such investment. In his book, he promoted real estate business, not crypto. Why is he flaunting cryptocurrency all over his social media? The floor is open for him to write a well detailed book about cryptocurrency, before we take his predictions and information seriously. I've seen people like him, who take back their advise immediately cryptocurrency price crashes, they'll not say a word and when they do, it'll be condemning the mistakes of investors who invested into crypto. Nobody, can tell or explain how soon it'll take for bitcoin to hit 120k even after the halving. On the other hand, he claims that the rich dad bought some hotels in the US that's still operating till date, have seen his interviews where he said such. The stories in his book doesn't sound like fiction.

I suspect that Robert Kiyosaki has acquired some amount of bitcoin and is engaging in promotion to make profit. Just like other fake believers, he is also targeting to make gains during the bitcoin having. I don't trust these guys due to their inconsistency.

The ideas he presented about Bitcoin are completely correct and I agree with him. The Bitcoin could reach $120k or above in value during the coming bull market and it will surely be a strong competitor for fiat currencies. His views about Bitcoin's recovery are 100% correct and we all know that no matter what happens the Bitcoin will continue to gain value in its price. I won't say anything about other crypto-currencies but surely Bitcoin will flourish and it's next price will be over $100k to 120k during 2024-2025.

That point of view is changed by this person a brilliant author and motivator. You should listen to his podcasts sometimes, he made a good prediction about BTC and he is very much optimism about BTC as he knew that the poor are becoming more poor and the rich are becoming more rich. This system can provide a way for the poor ones to get out of the matrix of rich and poor. And that's what he was emphasizing. So the best thing for all of us is to adopt BTC and try not to get late. Those who will adopt it slowly and slowly all far better than those who are adopting it but not learning it and not getting the experience they should get from it. And I don't know that Kiyosaki looks like Fiat as a criminal because in my opinion, that's wrong. But what we can say, is every person has their own point of view and he has his own. But he makes a good prediction and I hope that BTC will cross that price tag.",

Let's just say that after following the trajectory of Bitcoin for a while, I'm not totally in line with Kiyosaki's expectations. I will grant him this, though: the old finance system, with its never-ending money production, is growing a little... stale. The impending halving of Bitcoin is going to affect everything, so if you're not aware, you better find out soon. When it comes to crypto, you should always be one step ahead of everyone else.",
