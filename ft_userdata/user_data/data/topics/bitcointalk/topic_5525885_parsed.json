  "content": "After sometimes in my analogue bitcoin classes in some schools around my area. On the second quarter of last year, I received some calls from friends and relatives and others to teach them bitcoin online and I agree to teach them also asked them to invest. But many of them didn't invest after the classes, so what I am doing right now is to asked them invest some amount of money before I start the teaching. And in the process of the practical aspect of it, I will use the money to invest for them so they can be serious on the investment. And since some of them are Civil Servants and Unemployed combined I advised them to purchase weekly and monthly as DCA method of it. Like before yesterday someone send me N100k which is equivalent to $60 as of then exchange rate and I invested for her at the rate of $100k for 1 BTC. I always explained both the risks and the benefits in the class so everyone is aware. In most time we use google meet for the virtual meeting (classes) for easy presentation and Whatsapp for chatting classes because meet consume Internet data.and not all the participants can buy enough Internet data to browse. My friend sister at UK also chatted me up to teach her and we did that class last year too. And base on the technology, online classes are more interesting than offline School Classes.OmegaStarScream, bitmover, apogio, JayJuanGee, tranthidung, NeuroticFish, Pmalek, hugeblack, Lucius, RickDeckard, philipma1957, fillippone, NotATether, Charles-Tim, BlackHatCoiner, ABCbits, hosseinimr93 and Sceptical Chymist, I will pm you for more technical knowledge. Some of the classes I have updated here.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405990.msg60555094#msg60555094https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5403925.0",

Also explain the risks of investing in Bitcoin because there’s no guarantee that holding long-term will always be profitable. That’s what we believe here, but not everyone has the same patience, especially when they experience a bear market. They might panic and make rash decisions.If that scenario happens, like the price dumps and they start blaming you. what will you say? Since they paid for your advice, they might expect everything you said to come true or think they’re guaranteed to benefit from your guidance. It’s something to think about.",

I really commend you for that and this would really go along way on helping the adoption of Bitcoin.But I don't think investing for someone into Bitcoin without their consent is actually the right way to go. The financial sector is one place you ought to be very careful. I would rather suggest you be patient with them keep in giving them the much needed information they need and with time they can be able to give their consent to Investing.",

It is not everybody in your class that will be willing to invest. I am more comfortable with online learning than teaching them physically. I am interested in my security because most people think that all Bitcoin investors are rich. There has been news of how some crypto investors were attacked and robbed of their coins.",

It would have been better if you teach them about Bitcoin and allow them to invest by themselves. Any of them who sees Bitcoin as a good investment will invest, they don't need to be compelled. You can simply guide them on how to download wallets, keep the seed phrase safe, fund their wallet and protect it. Instead of going through the complicated process of asking them to invest through you. Calculating expenses such as transaction fees and profit can be complex. They should have personal  Bitcoin wallets and be their bank. Keep up the good work.",

Again I am not taking anything from them please don't misunderstood me.I misunderstood earlier, sorry about that, but it's pretty clear you're asking for money from them to invest. It still seems risky because you might end up violating the law, like soliciting money for investment. Although your intentions might be good, just be careful because the law is very clear on this.That being said, I still think that in the long run, you might get blamed if the Bitcoin market turns bearish. These people who give you money might not know much about it, so they delegate their decisions to others. If things go south, they might panic and blame you, which could cause you stress. This is just a possible scenario, though - it’s up to you to take it as advice or not.",

Gotta teach a man to fish, not buy the fish from the market for him, no?Yes I do agree with your point buwaytress. We are currently in a digital era and as a result crypto isn't pretty much a new and odd topic to anyone especially bitcoin with it's hype every now and then. And that is to say that virtually everyone is aware of bitcoin and crypto currencies in general and as a result have access to information concerning them.What I actually fancy is fixing wrong ideas and information that people often pick up from social media and the internet as a whole especially about how easy and rosy it is to invest in crypto. Convincing people to invest is not the best option because you often end up as a \"blame holder\" especially if it eventually goes sideways. What's best is informing them especially about security and privacy.",

Quote from: Agbe on January 09, 2025, 02:46:00 PMLike before yesterday someone send me N100k which is equivalent to $60k as of then exchange rate and I invested for her at the rate of $100k for 1 BTC. Am not a financial expert but why do I feel that the idea of taking the money to invest for them is wrong? If you teach them as you claim, then a week or two is enough for them to learn how to buy and invest themselves. If the reason for investing is to make them serious in the class, then you can take a small fee of 15k which you will return to them after a week they have learned and invested then you can continue the teaching from there. There are several disadvantages to taking the money to invest in them. Paraventure things don't go to their expectation you might be blamed for it. Also, imagine a scenario where a student chooses, they don't want to learn anymore or invest anymore, and they want their 60k back will you give them the exact amount if the price of Bitcoin has gone down from the original price you bought it?Anything you are doing let the ball be in their court so they won't blame you for anything. Humans can be very unpredictable when it comes to things that has to do with money.",

You know majority of people in the society are left behind in times of information about Bitcoin or Blockchain technology, so many are ready to learn but has no people to educate them, and because of this reason of lack of proper orientation has made most people to have wrong mentality about Bitcoin. Some thinks that Bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme and others sees it as a scam, ut having a right information will make them change their mentality and it will boost Bitcoin adoption in the country. I must confess it's a nice initiative. You should also do well to let them know the penalty of \"not your key not your coin\" so that they will handle their seed phrase carefully.",
