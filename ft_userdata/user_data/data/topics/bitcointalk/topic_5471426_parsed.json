They keep going up and the average joe has no idea what they mean except that it's such a large number that it's hard for him to read it.It is difficult for these numbers not to increase with the growing demand for cash (resulting from the growing number of goods) and new money in circulation is issued only through debtIt's not just central banks that print. Every retail bank granting regular loans prints this to a much much greater extent. Thats how current monetary system works. Even a commercial banks can lend money it does not have (\"Lend into existance\")This article explains how the majority of money in the modern economy is created by commercial banks making loansThe ratio of debt to GDP is much more important than the value of debt",

If you look closely, there's one thing that is so common in the statistics of the national debt, and that is the fact that it's the rich countries of the world that take the first seats in there.Nevertheless, do not forget that the money didn't fall from heaven, they are collecting it from somewhere, and they are also the chief contributors there (where the loans originate from).This means a win-win for them than how it looks on the surface.",

I used to remember that the Japanese people were pretty motivated at saving more money, but on the other hand, the Japanese government has enormous debt. China also has big hidden debts.We might be heading towards mass government default in the near future. I don't see it as a tragedy. A mass default and a global Great Depression will be necessary for the global economy to get rid of all this debt. The world will sooner or later find an alternative to the fiat/banking/debt oriented/money printing financial system.",

After I read your post, think a while, I think that Debt to GDP ratio is for deep analysis. First with the National Debt, we can focus on countries with biggest economic sizes and their debts. After that if we want to check deeper, we can look at their Debt/GDP ratios.",

I used to remember that the Japanese people were pretty motivated at saving more money, but on the other hand, the Japanese government has enormous debt. ~snip~I'm not an economist, but I've read several times that Japan tested some very strange economic models in the past that led to exactly these results. In addition, I think that Japan (as well as some other countries) actually owe most of these debts to themselves, because it is about borrowing money that happened between various domestic institutions. Of course, it is very strange that we see such numbers in a country where people are very hardworking, mostly very honest and have a sense of business - but since the time of capitulation in the Second World War, they have been greatly influenced by those who defeated them, and this is the case even today. I read that part of the Japanese population is even protesting and demanding the departure of US military forces from Japan, but Japanese politics is anything but sovereign and free to make such a move.",

      "body": "National debts have become dangerous for international trade and the economic trajectory of countries. The fact that the USA, with the largest debt, is constantly raising the borrowing limit and being forced to do so raises the question of how long this will continue. USA debt is the foundation of global trade, built on decades of trust, but this is about to lead to a dead end for capitalism. A USA default would be tantamount to the end of capitalism.If this is not to happen, national debt must be reduced. With the pandemic, the system was severely damaged and the increase in the debt limit was a good thing for global trade but with the exit from the pandemic, it became clear that this was not a good situation at all. The dominance of the dollar in global trade is among these reasons. For example, countries started to work on common currencies in global trade as the system started to get bogged down.",

I've seen those debt clocks online and they can be pretty eye-opening even here. The USA's national debt is staggering and China's huge gold demand reflects its economic strength. I mean I think the comkon thing about these two is that they both constantly adapt policies to maintain economic stability and the specifics involve complex strategies and decisions made by their governments and central banks. It's crucial for any country to find a balance and address these financial challenges for a stable global economy. I hope our country does an improvement too even at a minimum.",

Citizens and taxpayers often pay the price either by increasing taxes or by decreasing exchange rates (the value of the currency), so it increases. Labor strikes and the feeling that salaries are no longer what they were in the past, and this tension often leads to revolutions or wars. Therefore, all countries do not pay attention to the debt crisis, which is often passed on to future generations or borne by the middle and poor classes.",

I read a while ago about how the Japanese react to the price change in Japan and how it has slowed down their economy. Presently, Japan has an inflation rate of just over 2% and they've maintained that rate for over a decade, but studies have shown that only a very small percentage of people in Japan will buy a product or service if there is a slight price increase, meanwhile the cost of production increases.So an increased cost of production with no change in the price of the commodity will only reduce the profit of businesses and this affects the economy because it can either force the business to employ fewer people, pay lesser salaries, produce inferior products, discourage foreign investors, etc.As a buyer, it's good for the individuals, but it weakens the economy.",

You can check about that on https://www.usdebtclock.org/world-debt-clock.html on the right hand side where it says: 'external debt to GDP ratio' where you can see that of the 300% debt to GDP it has, 'only' 110% (lol) is owed to foreign creditors.

Debt trap is a global phenomenon, and we have seen this first time when China acquired a port in Sri Lanka a few years ago.

With all this growing debt burden, we are looking at more and more inflation and unemployment. I am particularly thinking about the underdeveloped African and Asian countries; their debt-to-GDP ratio is on the higher side, and they are taking more and more loans to pay back their debt. They are trapped in this cycle forever.  For an in-depth analysis of the debt trap and capitalist mindset, I suggest you read the book \"Confessions of an Economic Hitman\" by John Perkins.",
