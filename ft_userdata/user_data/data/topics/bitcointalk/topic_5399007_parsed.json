Maybe it's still in the works ?Just remembered, Injective Protocol is another good one, like FTX, but smaller and newer. Unfortunately last time I checked nothing was working, it was not ready, looked promising, but nowhere near ready like FTX is.",

I don't understand. If you want to buy gold, why don't you go to your local gold seller and buy some? I don't know a country which banned gold ownership. Does it really have to be in the form of crypto? There are a few projects that buy and hold gold for you and tokenize their shares but the main issue is trust here. I don't like the government entities but I sure don't trust people I don't even know.If you are going to invest in commodities, stocks are still the second best option imo. (the best option is owning commodities physically)",

      "body": "Not very practical or safe to hold large amounts of physical Gold if you ask me. And you don't have the liquidity or ease of access you do have with something like PAX Gold. I could easily convert my PAX Gold into cash if I needed the money, or purchase some goods and services with it without even converting it ( with a VISA crypto card for example ) So to me it's like a less volatile version of Bitcoin. Great for the bear market which is where we are. I just wish there was a similar crypto version of Silver. By the way, I exited the market a few days ago, went all in with PAX Gold, but now I'm thinking of putting a bit into commodities if I can.",

      "body": "One approach is to invest in the stocks of the major producers or processors of the commodity. For example, if you want to invest in oil, then you can use the drillers or the refiners as possible alternatives. For grains, the large agricultural producers. For metals, the mining companies. .You can trade / invest in these long or short.Not my thing though, as I exclusively trade in the futures and futures options markets for these and other commodities",

      "body": "Yes ! I heard Gold mining companies are an excellent investment as well. I imagine I could get exposure to something like that for Silver and Copper as well. The thing is I want to keep these investments in the crypto space. For example, I bought PAX Gold, 100% legit crypto project backed by real gold bars. Nearly 6 figures worth so not a small amount. So the idea for me is to at least have some exposure to Silver, Copper and commodities in general through a Crypto friendly exchange like FTX ( preferably an alternative to FTX without KYC ) Originally I wanted to invest in the big tech giants like Google, Amazon, Tesla, Apple, but experts seem to think this is not the time for high tech, as they are seen as \"high risk\" for the most part.",

Almost all platform that offer trading in commodities or futures need KYC.Try checking out the likes of Etoro or Uphold but trust me, you can't dodge KYC because such platforms are highly regulated.",
