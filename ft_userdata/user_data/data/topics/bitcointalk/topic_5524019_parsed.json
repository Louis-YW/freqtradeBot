Its just those people who's skeptical or hate Bitcoin doesn't want it that's why they are not celebrating together with this coin.Since El Salvador is doing a nice thing so its not surprising that they celebrate Christmas by promoting Bitcoin since somehow their country is gaining a lot of profit from this that's why its expected that more celebration to come especially if they are still bullish and benefiting from thus coin.",

Countries that like cryptocurrency and work with it want to do something like this, but they can not because their country has many restrictions. Even if we want to do something like this in our country, we can not because we have many restrictions. But if something is ever done about our legality, then we can also freely discuss or celebrate something about BTC in an open way. But you share on photo its very extraordinary.",

For me it's too much to display a Christmas tree containing a Bitcoin hologram. There are another means to promote Bitcoin adoption and usage while still keeping the traditions and aesthetics of Christmas event.Of course they are aiming a commercial effect through it. People tend to spend more money on Christmas to gift people around, so the responsible for the local organization is putting Bitcoin in evidence to encourage people to deal with Bitcoin.",

I know that the country has made huge profit from their bitcoin holdings, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't do the right thing at the right time. They should have taken a special day to celebrate bitcoin this way to gain more attention and not on festive period. El Salvador motto should be 'BITCOIN TILL I DIE'.",

Anyone else who's still thinking that Bitcoin is not the way to go will be running away from the reality but I know that sooner or later, bitcoin will become the new currency acceptable by the world or rather the world's most preferred currency. El Salvador has a good vision towards the emancipation of the bitcoin-driven economy hence their position is driven towards leading other nations to such new developments. The financial freedom that comes with the decentralized technology is humungos and cannot be overemphasized, I see nations with socialist ideas quickly and quietly monitoring and adopting the new technology while others are still scared of the impact it can make in the grassroots economy.",

Even when explanation where made that it was payment from an organization outside the country for services they rendered, they still had to spend about 14 days in prison. And would only be released after they made payment for bail. They weren't taken to the court for them to have the chance to defend themselves.

If you will consider the lost an investor may have you could think it's too risky to proceed. That's why there are only few countries that do the risk.",
