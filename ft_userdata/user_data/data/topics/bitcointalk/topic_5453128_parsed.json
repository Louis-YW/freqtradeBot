  "content": "Online/hot wallets should only be for little amount of bitcoin. For high amount of bitcoin, use offline wallet.I have noticed using Trustwallet is common among we Nigerians on this forum. Some of us are also probably using wallets that experienced bitcoin users can not advice anyone to use. I think you need to know what an excellent bitcoin wallet is. Note that there are many excellent bitcoin wallets that are open source. Features that excellent bitcoin wallet should haveopen sourcemultiple address generationfee customizationReplace-by-fee (RBF) supportChild-pay-for-patent (CPFP) supportCoin controlThe most important features are: (1) a wallet should be open source so that the public can be able to check the source code, this can help the public to know that there is no spyware or other vulnerabilities included in the code of the wallet,  (2) multiple address generation for privacy reasons, (3) RBF which would be helpful to increase transaction fee, to have higher chance for your coin that you transfer to get confirmed earlier and (4) fee customization.Among the wallets that I am using, Desktop Electrum and Bluewallet are the once that have all these features. Mobile Electrum is not bad either. For wallets that support opt-in RBF, read this: Bitcoin open source wallets that support replace-by-fee (RBF)There are many wallets, but just the only two wallets that I am using are those mentioned. If you have used a wallet that has all those features, like being open source, generating many addresses, having fee customization and RBF, you can mention it too. Trustwallet is not an open source wallet, not supporting RBF and not generating multiple addresses. It has only one bitcoin address. Not supporting CPFP and not supporting coin control. Even just address freeze, it is not supporting it.",

While I use Mycelium for bitcoin. Not only you but me also,  I have been a fan of Trust wallet ever since I got into cryptocurrency in fact I held my first Bitcoin on trust wallet for months before I transferred it off recently,  I have never hard any issues with the wallet or deem it fit to acknowledge the the risk associated with using such wallet until my friend Charles-Tim took the time to educate me on the risk embedded in using such wallet for large coin holding or long term holding then I opted in for blue wallet for now and the feature I like most about blue wallet is the ability to generate new addresses with ease this have indeed made things easy for me. Trust wallet,  blockchain and the rest of the OG cryptocurrency wallets are popular among early Bitcoin users and that is why they always advise us to use them until now that knowledge of security and flexibility of Bitcoin safety and security becomes of utmost importance then we decide to research for a better and more secured wallet for holding our coin.",

This is about bitcoin, and bitcoin has wallets that you can advice people to use because they are better. There are so many options of different wallets that you can go for if it is bitcoin, while some altcoins may not have excellent alternatives.

I guess this is the sign I need to check it out. For now, I would not experiment with the mobile Electrum wallet; let's just say I am not comfortable with it on a mobile device.Two of the most important features that you have mentioned, which I do like about the Electrum Bitcoin wallet (I know that it is not limited to it but to other Bitcoin wallets as well), are the multiple address generation for privacy's sake and the RBF. I know how the former feature helped \"fast-track my transactions\" during the network congestion period.Speaking about Trustwallet, I never liked it. Although, one time I was forced to use it for non-Bitcoin related transactions, but since then, I haven't opened the app unless the Play Store notifies me that I need to update it.",

      "body": "Very nice content, you try wella to put all this together, trust wallet true true no be the best wallet to use but provided they're constantly been promoted by Binance exchange and na the most popular exchange for African and Nigeria in particular, we go always get people wey dey use am. I dun use trust wallet and I no find any problem with am. It isn't the best wallets when you have congestion issues and other privacy concerns but if you're not bothered by them then you no go get problem to use trust wallet. If you just dey receive and send Bitcoin it's one of the most understandable wallets (una know as binance dey do their things to dey very easy to use). My own suggestion na electrum weda na mobile own or laptop (na the best Bitcoin wallet I dun use be dat). I got to know about electrum when I been dey very active in campaign management. My best feature about the wallet na as I fit send multiple transaction to different addresses and many wallets no get that feature. I think after metamask wallets, trust wallet go be the nectmist downloaded wallet and Binance the promote am steady. If you need total control and Ethereum easier to operate na electrum for me. Once again very nice content and more of this are appreciated and welcomed here instead of all this other discussion wey we dey get.",

Install wallets like Electrum to generate a HD paper wallet.Paper wallet may not be convenient, you can go for watch-only and cold storage, but you need a device to spare for that. https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.htmlBut for convenience, a reputed hardware wallet would be better.Quote from: Davidvictorson on May 21, 2023, 10:43:29 AMThank you for this expository and informative piece, Charles.
