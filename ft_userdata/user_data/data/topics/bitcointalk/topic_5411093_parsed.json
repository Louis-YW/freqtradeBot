IMO, a simple example can go a long way in aiding readers to easily grasp the point of a discussion, and  not misinterpret it.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on August 24, 2022, 09:46:45 PM...customers and sellers can get together and try to discuss prices, to either lower it or push it up from an original price. I think the discussion mostly between customers and sellers of product usually involves intense negotiation on price reduction and not increment.",

If sellers are coordinated and organized enough to set prices. Its no longer a market arrangement. It more closely resembles a monopoly. Which will typically lead to price gouging and reduced product quality and reliability.Something resembling a monopoly on the consumer side, will usually resemble a boycott. Or the so called \"retail movement\" in stocks. Its much easier for sellers to organize than buyers. They have the networking, communication channels and infrastructure. Buyers tend to be more unreliable with less throughput on promises. Each has their pros and cons. Which the majority of people do not understand. Considering most seem to not comprehend how the price of healthcare has become overinflated around the world.",

      "body": "Any buyer will always lower the price, and this price is unlikely to suit the seller. Therefore, there are different markets for goods. In my country, the central markets are always more expensive, and the prices for goods there suit buyers since the stratum of the population itself is better off.But exactly the same goods can be purchased at a different price if you go away from the center of the country. Those who are not satisfied with one price can always afford lower prices with just some effort.But all the same, buyers' demands will aim at lowering prices simply for the sake of profit.",

Meanwhile, if the goods are sold at a low price expected by the customer, it will cause a loss to one party (the seller). Therefore, it is necessary to balance the market to create the same supply and demand conditions.To create an increase in purchasing power, it is necessary to agree on a price that is willing to be bought and sold by both parties, this price agreement creates the principle of market equilibrium because sellers and customers are both happy after the transaction.",

The movement of the economic recession is still in the alert category and alert if I'm not mistaken. One business can close its door, and another can open next to it. Flexibility is an important component of any pricing strategy, and that's why you need to be able to adjust prices on the products and services we develop because market forces can change quickly. and this I think is important for businesses to be flexible with their pricing tactics in order to be successful.",

One strategy is giving discounts, overpricing the product and announce to the whole world that they are having a 50% discount.  Pricing tactics is like a game of chess, of course seller always put a huge margin so that when it comes to pricing discount negotiation, they can still give the requested discount of the customer while not affected by the said discount.Another thing is package selling in a \"discounted price\".  This way they can sell non-saleable items together with the hot item.  This strategy is known to clean up the locker of unsaleable or unpopular items.So a good selling strategy is to make it look like that they are giving in to the demand of the buyer but they actually are not affected by the decrease in price of the item.",

This seems like a bit of a bizarre question, are you asking from the point of view of a consumer or are you asking from the point of view of a business? If you are a consumer, then you are likely to find much greater bargains in the middle of a recession when it comes to high cost items like furniture or cars, so if you have savings in a secure place and can delay those sorts of purchases, now might be a good time to hold on to cash considering all the recession indicators flashing. As a business, you might just be struggling to stay afloat during a recession and only the super big companies or those in recession proof industries will be able to try to claw back some market share - for many the main strategy will be just to cut costs as much as possible and just survive.",

      "body": "The problem I have always noticed when it comes to flexible pricing is that it is normally offered by small entrepreneurs only. These small-time businessmen provide the opportunity for their clients to haggle with the price. They could end up profiting very little or even simply break-even. This practice is generally good. It's just that it seems unfair because huge grocery stores and shopping centers and malls, those large companies that earn millions or even billions, do not do this at all. They provide fix prices to their goods and services. They simply don't compromise their profit.In times when the economy is not in its best form, these small entrepreneurs are indeed a big help. And I think providing flexible prices will make them attractive to end consumers.",

In the event of a recession, there are not many options for the seller because the markets are full of goods and the demand is low, so he will have to reduce his prices in order to dispose of his goods. The competition in this case is to reduce prices, not raise them. Because everyone wants to sell his goods, the best solution is to search for new markets to sell products or store them well until the time of increased demand.",

This will also create a lot of confusion and complexity with the accounting side of large corporations like this, because they work with fixed markups and discount systems. A small informal business are totally different and you can haggle for a better price, because the sales person are usually the owner or someone in the family that are running the operation. (This is more suitable for a Market environment, where you have loads of small stalls and a lot of competition)I have to say, there are large \"Malls\" ....in places like Singapore, where you have tons of small businesses that compete for business and it is a lot of fun to haggle with these sales persons.",

However, if you did it 9.99 and 69.99 and 99.99 then it wouldn't look like a steal for medium and maybe small would go, and yet if you do 49.99, 59.99 and 69.99 so close to each other then it would mean nothing at all.",
