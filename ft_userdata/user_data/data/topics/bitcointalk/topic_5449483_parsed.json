      "body": "No body knows the true identity of Satoshi Nakomoto and for some reasons, this person or group of persons has decided to stay anonymous. To me, I feel like they actually understood the risk of creating some thing that could influence political and government power and work on its own.  If the real creators had been identified the maybe they would have been facing the governments now. And we could maybe have lost Bitcoin to the government.

Or what really happen?The story is complete if you ask me, I think we sometimes overrate the relevance of who is Satoshi over the possibilities of bitcoin. It’s no longer surprising to see people so interested in uncovering the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, whether Satoshi is one person or a group of individuals remains a mystery. I believe Satoshi’s identity should be protected by the bitcoin community because it will be bad for bitcoin if the government can put a face to the name Satoshi Nakamoto.",

      "body": "Should we really be concerned about Satoshi's way about? Bitcoin technology was built for the purpose of taking away financial control from the hands of financial elites and putting it in the hands of ordinary people like you and i in a decentralized manner. Bitcoin is decentralized and works so efficiently that even if Satoshi is alive and living somewhere in the world, he doesn't need to show his face for the technology to keep existing. If the federal government can even find out who Satoshi is, I think that's going to be bad news, because they would want to be in control and thereby want to make it centralized. Just know that Satoshi built Bitcoin, but forget about if he is alive or not; his anonymity may even be the reason why Bitcoin is still the way it is today. No regulations, no terms, no policies...",

And it is really a valid concern, because we know US has been able to track and spy many influent people and authorities from foreigner countries, besides people from their own country. Would it be so hard to track Satoshi, that even the mightiest nation in the world couldn't achieve doing this? Would Satoshi be more efficient in protecting his ID and localization than the specialists of intelligence services from countries which have been spied by US?",

While some have claimed to be Satoshi, none have been able to provide concrete evidence to support their claims. It is also possible that Satoshi is a group of people, rather than a single individual. Regardless of who Satoshi is or was, the impact of their creation has been significant, as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have transformed the way we think about and use money.",

What makes you think the FBI would inform anybody, if they had Satoshi in their blue zone? Although, no clue of him anywhere, because if he's been held hostage by any Governmental platform, we would have been seeing some changes in the network, because Satoshi is the creator he'll also know a way to jeopardize the network in some ways, not completely, if apprehended to do so. I think of Satoshi as a man who settled down as a teacher in a nursery school living his best life and engaging with nature. He is not interested in the wealth he's made and also his vision is yet to be completed; mining all the bitcoins. I don't think he makes use of the computer and on the second flip he could be very old and resting. No need to bother about him, what matters is that the blockchain network is moving without him being present. Just like the founder of cars, he doesn't need to be here to guide mechanics on how to fix cars.",
