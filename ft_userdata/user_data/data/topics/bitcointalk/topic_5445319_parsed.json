  "content": "Am embarrassed  of the fact that I once saw Kyc as something not that bad but now am so scared because of the dangers around Kyc.Please everyone should read this especially Newbies Why KYC is extremely dangerous – and useless. I plead with everyone to take this seriously because Kyc has done more harm than good and also in Nigeria majority of us are ignorant of identity theft and we have suffered from it especially using loan app(this is one of the major damage we have faced from Kyc verification ), there are others and more are still coming especially in those that we regard as  legit update  that usually requests for Kyc just to earn some money or coin that doesn't worth our identity being stolen and some ponzi schemes also request it.Some of you may think that it doesn't matter afterall you are not a popular figure but I want to let you know anyone can be a victim of identity theft and you can read  about a Romanian citizen who suffered from identity theft in this post What happens when your identity is stolen -- real story || Avoid CEXs!, you can see how He got arrested from criminal activities which He knew nothing about because His identity was stolen and you know if He was a Nigerian with no popularity or helpers the police would likely lock him without proper investigation. I plead with everyone to take this seriously please because Kyc will continue to cause more harm than good.I would be much happier if this post Why KYC is extremely dangerous – and useless would be pinned or place somewhere anyone can easily assess it here because this is the most detailed post about the dangers of strict Kyc verification",

KYC get him advantage oo because at least once person get problem let’s say P2P on CEX get problem with KYC dem fit trace am. But u don imagine why many people Dey against from this companies na mostly because some of these companies sell off your data easily without your consent and that danger surpasses anything. KYC is also a tool for Hackers to get peoples data after breaching into a companies serve and most at times this data are used by hackers to commit crime and when they get caught it comes straight back to the owner of the data with the person knowing any of the thing they committed",

      "body": "One of the essential tool that could help against identity theft is phone number verification,  and must identity development are coming up with tokenization of identity just like what the new NIMC have on their new app, if you don't hand out your identity token at every point of using your national identity NIN number will not work as it only verified when you input the right token generated for the holder on his profile. -So with such development,  we can be afraid of identity theft anymore since their not able to use our documents even if they stole them from the KYC database, I itis s  imputed that we are sent a code via registered phone numbers. -KYC can be bad in some ways but then we can't do without KYC mostly when using centralized platforms such as exchanges and casinos with other payment platforms and wallets.",

      "body": "From an individual perspective, it might be a risky/bad thing to do but for the business, it's only essential that they get to know who they're offering services.  toWhen I newly got into crypto I completed KYC for two exchanges (Binance and kucoin) because I need to use their peer-to-peer service. And if I was allowed to start all over there's a high chance that I'm still going to complete KYC for those exchanges. I know that we have decentralized exchanges like bisq that offer such services but I still prefer binance. As long as you're just going around providing your details to some shitty platform without any good reputation then you should have a lesser chance of getting your info falling into the wrong hands.",

Let say you go gamble for one of the famous gambling site and you win huge amount of money along the line they requested for your kyc detail, this could be NIN, BVN or even Voter's card and with driving license, It doesn't mean we should be afraid of it. Wetin dey there be say, you go only mind the kid of websites you go put your kyc details. For long now i have been here e no means say i don do bad or my kyc details was used for evil  no, is simply because i was very careful not to compromised my detail. I don't even enrolled myself with airdrop before any of them would request for my identity details.",

      "body": "As the name implies KYC - known your customer, is a way of verifying the authenticity of a customer inorder to checkmate fraud. But there are dangers associated in performing KYC as you risk giving out your privacy or sensitive information. If the platform is hacked or your information is sold out by a third party agent, and if it falls into the wrong hand, it might cause you more harm. This is the reason I don't do full KYC. I only do tier 1 KYC on centralized exchanges like Binance because I'm scared of using my passport or drivers license.",

But at least we ought to be cautious and most of us don't even read terms and conditions.This is also a warning that we should only do kyc verification when we don't have any options left because we need to reduce the number of platform that has our personal information because any platform can be hacked (Even Binance was hacked last year) and our identity information can be stolen or be sold just like what coinbase did  the case of Coinbase",

      "body": "People can be ignorant because they lack knowledge or are not educated about the risk they are taking when fulfilling KYC. There is more risk when people do KYC on non-reputable platforms and are just fine with it. Some people go as far as using their BVN to do KYC, which is very dangerous when the platform gets compromised scammers could get the person's bank details and defraud the person. I think I created my Binance account in 2021 (I can't remember exactly), and then it was just a facial verification I did and my account got verified. I have been using it since then. I just want to add that people who intend to do KYC should at least verify that it's a reputable platform, not as if that eliminates the risk but to reduce it compared to when one is interacting with a non-secure platform.",

Well,  I don't think this other people mistakes will stop people not to use kyc in their businesses because, it make some people to earn well in some projects in the community.",
