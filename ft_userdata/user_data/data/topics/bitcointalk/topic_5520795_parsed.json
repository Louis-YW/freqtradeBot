  "content": "Bitcoin seems to be taking a drop just before it reached its projected $100k high. This might be due to profit taking by some of the buyers. I was speculating this may just be a break and its value may continue soaring especially after Trump's swearing-in since he is crypto-friendly. He is also expected to introduce some crypto-friendly policies. Some have compared this drop to the 2021 one after Bitcoin gained value from $17k to an upwards of $64k urging buyers to avoid panicking.Do you think this is just a break or will the coin drop to lower lows as people may panic sell hoping to withdraw profits?",

It’s just a correction which a lot pf us had expected. But now lots of people would see the price going lower than they expected and start selling their coins then later on regret once they see bitcoin rallying back up again.This is not the way to be a good investor. If you aren’t a trader who wants to make profit by the volatility in each day or hour, I would suggest to stop analyzing each market movement and calm down. Don’t be impulsive and have some confidence.",

It is already back in the move to the upside.. we wouldn't have expected price to keep moving in that direction without a retracement move back down. Though we had expected it to meet a psychological level, which is the $100k mark before coming to a significant level in down. Though some people already started selling around the 99k which we touch last week already.. just a 1k difference in price. The only thing I know right now is that it's not the right time to buy as price can dip anytime soon depending on any fundamental factors which may affect it..",

The current dip is for it to enable the price of bitcoin to advance farther into six digits and above.This is also another opportunity for those who was complaining that bitcoin price is high to buy bitcoin because it's clear that 100k price is sure. You shouldn't expect the price of bitcoin to be on uptrend alone so that you don't panic and sell when it's moving downtrend because the price will bounce back.",

You don't have to worry with the fluctuation of the price but use that for your own benefit so you will have a chance to accumulate more Bitcoin by buying at the low price. This down is just temporary and usually happen after the price hit the highest price so the price will increase again. Bitcoin will have a chance to increase so you don't have to panic with the situation. You need to calm down yourself and analyze the market for buying Bitcoin. If you can see when you can buy, you should buy it and hold it because we may not see the low price in the future.",

Even though it is bull season, but we cannot expect bitcoin to rise vertically without any corrections. Bitcoin has been rising rapidly and reached $99k in a short time, so a correction is understandable. So every time bitcoin price corrects, we should see it as an opportunity to accumulate more bitcoins, not as a time to panic sell and have to buy back at a higher price later.I believe that if bitcoin doesn't pull back and break $100k, we will have a stronger correction after that because people will sell massively when bitcoin hits $100k. Because $100k is the sell target for most people, but with bitcoin pullback before hitting $100k, the selling pressure in the market will decrease significantly. Many people got scared and sold their bitcoins in the past few days but I am happy with the current situation and believe that bitcoin will soon surpass $100k without any correction after that, and those who sold will definitely have to FOMO and buy back at a higher price.",
