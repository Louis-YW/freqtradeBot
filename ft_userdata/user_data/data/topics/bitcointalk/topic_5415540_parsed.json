Turning off the Internet for a while, in order to enter a seed phrase or password, is just complacency for the user. If the keylogger is already on the victim's computer, then it can collect all the information, regardless of the Internet, and then, when the network appears, simply send it to the desired address.It would be more important to minimize the use of the computer on which such operations are carried out and be sure that the system is completely clean, that is, it has a license and does not have any extraneous programs.",

But you need to consider that by the time you keep your seed phrase somewhere hidden and safe, it is most likely forgotten for years or even decades. After all, you don't need them for deposits and withdrawals. So there's a tendency that by the time you check on it, some words are already illegible or some characters unidentifiable. High humidity, for example, could completely destroy the characters. Or the ink might have already faded, deforming the words. So it's probably wise to consider steel seed phrase storage like Billfodl or Cryptosteel's.",

I have seen a metal like aluminum where we can carve letters writing down our private keys on it making it waterproof and less vulnerable to fire. There are many news tools being produced this recent time to ensure that our file and crypto document are safe from hackers through the internet. For me I prefer the manual crypto wallet where we can store our coins or tokens without having to go online. At least this will reduce our risk of falling prey to attacks from internet.",

You can not say paper backup is a safest one. Because it is related to many things.Quality of paper, pen to make sure what you write won't be blurred too much or even disappear after a while sometime because of low quality of pen pink. Later steps are like where you store that paper. Is your storage location is safely enough, is it secretly, is it good to safe your seed from water, fire and more types of physical damage risk factors.If you recover it successfully from your backup, it means you don't make any typo when writing and that backup is good to use.QuoteI am starting to feel like there is some kind of a tool or software that hackers use to find out recently typed in words or something, the moment you type your recovery seed while connect online makes your wallet weak, I am sticking with writing down with a pen and I think you should too.

Please note that there are many impersonators and phishing websites that offer the functionality of \"checking\" your wallet, while in reality, they merely collect and steal everything you feed them, especially data that looks like a set of words to recover funds. Even legit websites such as iancoleman tools shouldn't be used as is in an online environment: instead, you can use an offline copy of an HTML page on a computer that never interacts with the Internet. Or you can install a reputable software such as Electrum and generate your private keys there, but, assuming we aren't talking about small amounts for everyday spending, do it on an air-gapped computer, or at least on a hardware wallet that supports sending information via QR-codes. Any online solution you can think of will be much less secure than a solution that doesn't require you to be connected to the Internet.",
