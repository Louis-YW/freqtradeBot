Also, you can try to ask this user JustaVirus he recently bought s19pro and setup immersion cooling for this unit.",

That said, the vastly improved cooling certainly does allow for running them faster but at the cost of efficiency.Thank you for your input, NotFuzzyWarm. You're absolutely right that overclocking doesn't increase the THs/J efficiency. However, in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency mining, the lifespan of a miner is typically 2-3 years before newer, more efficient models hit the market.In this context, the goal of many miners isn't necessarily to maximize THs/J efficiency, but rather to maximize the total output (THs) of their miners within their effective lifespan. This is where our CoolTank technology comes into play. By allowing a 40% overclock, we enable miners to significantly boost their total output, thereby increasing their mining profitability before their miners become outdated.Of course, this approach may not be suitable for everyone, and it's always important for each miner to consider their own specific circumstances and objectives. But for those looking to maximize their short-term returns, our CoolTank technology offers a compelling solution.",

Thank you for your insights. Natural air cooling and well-ventilated locations can indeed be cost-effective solutions for small-scale or home-based mining operations. However, when it comes to larger-scale operations, especially in hot climates, air cooling can become less efficient and more challenging.I have extensive experience running a mining farm in Dubai, where temperatures can reach up to 50 degrees Celsius in the summer. In such conditions, air cooling is not sufficient to prevent overheating, and the cost of air conditioning can be prohibitively high.That's why I developed the CoolTank, a 2-phase immersion cooling system specifically designed for these challenging environments. It allows for a 40% overclock, significantly boosting mining profitability, and it's adaptable to a wide range of environments.While the initial setup cost for an immersion cooling system can be higher than for an air-cooled system, the increased mining output and the savings on cooling costs can make it a worthwhile investment in the long run.You can learn more about my journey and the development of the CoolTank on our website: [CoolTank About Us](https://www.thecooltank.com/about).",

Unfortunately I can't add pictures to u message here. I created a blog post on my website to answer your message. https://www.thecooltank.com/post/ntroducing-advanced-cooling-technologies-for-cryptocurrency-mining-in-the-uaeThe main idea is immersion cooling is for long term mining. You'll squeeze maximum from every new model of miner and be ahead of competitors. Economy of scale is also is very useful. I am working on small CoolTank for home use.",
