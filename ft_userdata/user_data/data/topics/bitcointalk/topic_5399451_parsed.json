      "body": "One of the easiest ways to get funding is through grants and contests. Grants, as a rule, are aimed at accelerating the development of individual industries or technological areas. They do not require payment, but they require winning the competition and clearly following the use program after receiving funding. From the point of view of flexibility, this is a minus, since you will not be able to dramatically change the direction of startup development. But from the point of view of the value of money, it is the undisputed leader, because there is no need to give either shares, grants themselves, or interest for their use.",
