Do you think it should ever be increased ? I don't think Bitcoin supply will ever increase because everything planned by Satoshi at the start and we found nothing about increments of supply. In above article , we can read that many people are against this idea which did not allow others to do this. I think if we do voting from all over the world, I believe that only 10%-20% will be in the favor of supply increments. Quote from: Lida93 on September 07, 2023, 12:39:01 AMWhat would an increment mean to you? And can an alteration of the supply limit spell a disaster as some opined?Let's have a discussion here!No need of increments in future. The idea of increasing supply is because in the future demand will be high when more people adopt it but solution already available that price of btc will also rised with the time and no one will be able to buy full btc. Instead of increasing supply, buying only Satoshi will work.If it happens with outside layer like Ordinals then I Don't think any big changes will occur because the main supply will remain the same but still there is some headache for long term holders if any official news comes out and we may see panics selling at the start but everything will be normal with time.",

People will believe that Bitcoin communities can vote to increase Bitcoin total supply forever, whenever they see it is not enough for them to buy cheap bitcoin.Cheap bitcoin, I meant, that is not what we want if we are Bitcoin investors, we want Bitcoin to increase more in its value and price on market. To achieve it, its total supply must be capped at 21 millions, no more, can not be increased.How is the 21 million Bitcoin cap defined and enforced?",

People can still use sats just fine, there are other issues that are likely more urgent in the near future such as the decrease of block reward and so on. I'd rather focus the discussion over there if people really need to argue over something. That being said, the limited supply is definitely one of the key reasons people invest in BTC. Still, you can still use BTC as a currency if your goal is not investment at all.",

And for me, the alteration is a disaster.,You are 100 right, increasing the number of BTC in supply will not  provide us some good results. As it will provide an opportunity to BTC haters to spread bad words about it. Besides haters, it will hurt the feelings of miners, validators, btc users and those companies which had trusted the scarcity factor of BTC and invested millions of dollars to build a fortune. This will looks like a scam or a phishing scam in which people will began to think crypto really is a scam as the king of all cryptocurrencies has scammed us. Overall, you are right about  it will damage BTC reputation and in my thoughts it will damage the reputation of all those who invested in it and trusted the mechanism. But you know what, the supply of BTC has been already wrote means it is no more changeable. According to many studies it has made sure that BTC is totally scarced (mean have limited supply).And there is one more thing, which is we might not have to worry about it but maybe our next generation have to because they are the ones who will face this disaster, if any happens. But I believe BTC developers must have some surprises to amaze us in the context of this question.",

And can an alteration of the supply limit spell a disaster as some opined?Let's have a discussion here!It's an entirely unnecessary thing to do. I am not sure if it's possible to increase the supply limit of Bitcoin because I always thought it was fixed and wouldn't be increased in the future. If supplies do not increase, the scarcity will increase over time, and my Bitcoin will be worth more daily. Let's say I bought Bitcoin hoping there wouldn't be any supply changes, and I was holding for a couple of years. You guys then increased the supply just like \"Terra Luna\" developers did before they collapsed. My bitcoin will be worth less again, and there is no point in being an early adopter.  The early adopters will feel they were betrayed, and I don't think anyone else will believe the protocol anymore. I mean, if these things can be changed and others will decide the value of my Bitcoin, like centralized currencies, I don't need Bitcoin anymore.",

Many people are investing in Bitcoin because they know the price will increase in the future when it becomes very scarce. Increasing the supply is not impossible but it will be very difficult. Miners might support the increase because it will sustain their mining fee but it will be difficult to sell the idea to other key players in the Bitcoin ecosystem. And I don't think this modification will happen because it will cause more harm than good to Bitcoin. 2140 is still a long time and most of us will not be there when the last block will be mined.",

Many people, and I am including myself on that statement, will jump ship if that ever happened, in fact the sole discussion of this topic among the developers and miners could generate a huge drop on the price and that is not good for this market.",

Although, it may be technically possible to increase its market cap if most of the miners, developers, nodes, and other important community members agree to alter the total market cap of Bitcoin blockchain, but I still think that anything like that would completely destroy the trust of the investors. Bitcoin isn't like any other cheap alternative coin where developers can change anything without anyone's consent and we must know that even the developer of Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto can't change the market cap by his own. I'm quite sure that any such changes if ever done in future will break the trust of investors about Bitcoin. The 21 million market cap is the feature that increases the value of Bitcoin and it's because of that market cap that we can see higher price mark of Bitcoin as of today, and if that thing is altered then the value of Bitcoin will drop significantly and no one wants anything like that to ever take place.",
