      "body": "Iirc there are a few lightning network clients that function on top of bitcoin core (I don't know if they share wallets or not but I'd assume they don't).I think they're intended to be separate though as the lighting network doesn't seem widely used yet and a lot of bitcoin's additional protocols are provided separately. Bitcoin \"core\" might just be that, the core version of everything you need to do with bitcoin mainnet transactions.",

Yes with a complete re-write of it's functionality and a lot of bloat. So, no it's not going to happen. Not should it, there is a lot more to LN then just a wallet. You need to setup channels and some other things. Core is just for holding / moving BTC.-Dave",

In other words, there's no direct access, but we must necessarily use a bridge whenever we want to switch from one to the other. So, there's waters between the layers. Is it correct?",

Any developer who's working on Core and is interested in lightning can work on it, and in fact lots do. I think your question if the Bitcoin Core QT (wallet software) will ever support lightning payments. Isn't it?I don't think it will, because lightning isn't the core of bitcoin.",
