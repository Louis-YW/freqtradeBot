  "content": "Coinslotty.com, an online casino for crypto enthusiasts, would like to introduce themselves to the BitcoinTalk community by offering you a chance to test out their product. You can find more about them in their main thread here.With that in mind, Cro2 is proud to present the Coinslotty review campaign.Please note that some of the rules will be a bit more specific than what you’ve been used to from the regular review campaigns. Read them carefully before applying. We have the following review tasks to offer with roughly 2150$ in BTC on our escrow address.Deposit Testers Group A: $60 RewardLimited to 10 Participants, each player will get $90 deposited to their BTC address and will need to test the 100% up to $100 welcome offer with a $30 deposit and follow the standard Q&A provided at the end of this thread.Deposit Testers Group B: $60 RewardLimited to 10 Participants, each player will get $75 deposited to their BTC address, and they will need to deposit $15 and test the Live Casino section, together with the Q&A provided at the end of this thread.Deposit Testers Group C: $70 RewardLimited to 5 Participants, each player will get $75 deposited to their BTC address, and they will need to deposit $5, go through the phone verification process for the free spins, and then test both in the Slot Machine section, together with the Q&A provided at the end of this thread.Bonus For the Best TestersAfter all the reviews are up, we will pick out the 5 best reviews and distribute another $25 to each of the reviewers as a “thank you” fee.The Q&A Section for All Reviews:- Your experience in depositing and withdrawing (Any winnings can be kept by participants, with x50 wagering requirement applied on welcome bonus/free spins)- Your experience with the platform in general, device compatibility, speed etc.- Your experience with the customer support (additional languages are a plus)- A few points about what you liked most, and a couple of improvement suggestions, with a direct example of how you would improve the site.Payment:We will select 5 members for each week over 5 weeks. That means we are paying for 25 reviews. You will use part of that money to deposit on site and perform required tests.Application:Minimum rank accepted is Full Member, higher rank, higher trust and affinity to gambling will have advantage in selection process.Please note that at least 5 participants will be chosen from the Croatian local board – a part of the Coinslotty team is native to the board and wishes to introduce the site to more local participants as well.When applying please let us know following:Your Bitcointalk nick:Your Bitcoin address:Your preferred group:Review flow:After being accepted, you will register via the tracking link we will provide (please do not register before). Then you will need to check your tasks and review dates in the spreadsheet. Please don’t write the review in advance, that review won’t be paid. Example - if you are participating in week 3, some games will already be locked for testing, so pay attention to that as well – it will all be written in the spreadsheet.Review example:Code:Deposit/withdrawal:General Experience:Customer support:What I liked:What I did not like:I tested the following: (slots/live casino/table games/CS originals)Game 1 reviewGame 2 reviewGame 3 reviewWe will choose all 25 participants at the start and spread them out over 5 weeks. Beginning of each week we will transfer payment to the 5 participants that are scheduled for that week. No reserving of positions, it doesn’t matter when you apply as long as it is before the deadline. Your preferred task is very important part of your application so read through them carefully and choose wisely. You need to choose onetask group A,B or C, if you don’t have preferences you can say so or you can tell us what tasks are not acceptable for you. Saying you are ok with everything will probably raise your chance to be accepted but then we expect you to verify phone number in case that ends up being your task.We are accepting the applications for 3 days, so until Thursday 20th. Let us know if there is something unclear.",

Deposit bonuses are unavailable for the players from Finland.If you are from any of these countries and have applied for testing, use VPN and register&play from India or Canada.PLEASE READ THIS COMMENT BEFORE REVIEWINGQuote from: SirJohnVonSlotty on February 06, 2023, 04:32:11 PMA note to all of the future reviewers. Try to use common sense when registering, we're a licensed online casino, and as such we need to have a set of rules imposed by the regulator. One of the rules is the list of restricted countries, if your country is on that list, then obviously you'll have problems with the registration process. Use a VPN. Another is the personal details for withdrawals, if you're planning to withdraw your winnings from the review, then obviously don't place a name like Mickey Mouse under there, that's just asking for trouble in the eyes of the regulator, our customer support and the bonus abuser matrix. If you'll want to withdraw your winnings, then the personal details fields will need to be filled out.Third one are the terms of use, of course I can bend some of the rules for you guys here and there, but if Serbia is a restricted country, and you use a VPN to bypass that restriction, and then win a jackpot or any other significant amount - you will be KYC'ed, and your funds will not get paid out if you can't prove that you didn't use a VPN to bypass a restriction. Loyce did quite a good review on the terms of use (that I'm still updating), so I recommend to every reviewer who plans to withdraw their winnings to go over it beforehand. I did make exceptions here, and I plan to do more of them, but try to help me out by playing within the rules. We already had several issues from the start of the review campaign, and I sorted out each and every one of them in a timely manner - so I'm here for you. Just try to use common sense in the process, and if you get stuck along the way, share with me your nickname or e-mail address so that I can sort it out for you asap.  Coinslotty is a licenced casino. If you'll want to withdraw your winnings, then the personal details fields will need to be filled out. How you're going to fill it out is up to you, but an empty account can't withdraw funds due to license requirements + money laundering acts.Enjoy and have fun testing out the site!",
