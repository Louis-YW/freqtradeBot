Isn't the increase in tourist arrivals from various countries having an impact on the demand for euros so that the strengthening of value is emphasized more than weakening, as a result there is a rotation of the local and non-local economy in it including transportation. Not only that, other factors to attract tourists are supported by various aspects of comfort, security, responsiveness of local residents and in Europe strategic places still have quite expensive prices, especially if newcomers who try the travel experience are minimal, need funds to pay guides .",

Maybe next time you pay attention to how you title your articles. Quote from: naira on August 05, 2023, 10:51:18 AMNot only that, other factors to attract tourists are supported by various aspects of comfort, security, responsiveness of local residents and in Europe strategic places still have quite expensive prices, especially if newcomers who try the travel experience are minimal, need funds to pay guides .You are correct. Anyone planning vacation must have set out a nice fund that is able to sponsor their vacation. So, weakness of a country's currency shouldn't be a major determinant of their vacation destination. Moreover, as Europe's currency is getting weak, so also the currencies of other countries are getting weak. Weakness of fiat is a universal problem which the highly centralized government cannot solve.",

For a prediction to be scientific in nature, there should be a way to falsify it (to disprove it). For that, we need more details. When will the EUR get weaker, by which point in time? How do we measure it? Is it inflation rate, value against something like the USD, or something else entirely? How much of a difference from 2022 would count as 'weaker'?Without any of that, it's just a vague phrase that some can agree of disagree with, but which there's no way to confirm or refute.",

First, what is your argument to say euro will depreciate or is deprecating? You can not make a statement of a weaker currency without measuring it with either dollar, pounds or any other currency. Like last year, you could say euro exchanged weaker against dollar so which currency is it weaker on? And moreover, you thinking of vacation not because of the speculation of a weaker euro but for the need not advantage.",

Once again europe Will be good vacation destination becouse of weaker euro specially by usa and british tourists.Thanks and enjoy the Reading  It is too early to come to a conclusion like this, we know that fiat conditions, especially both Euros and Dollars, are currencies that are always used as a benchmark. Not only from an economic perspective in the tourism industry, because the tourism context only relies on one source of income. For example, a tourist or local or foreign tourist besides focusing on the budget to get to a destination in Europe or anywhere else will use many facilities ranging from renting houses, public transportation, food and drinks. Watching fiat cycles means the government is ready to print more money but foreign demand usually increases its value.",

Maybe you want to elaborate why that specific scandal is meaningful today, when in camparison EU has actual war next to them.And if european construction and real estate markets would be be booming, wouldn't it mean that euro might be doing well too? I mean those fields are making a lot of jobs, and people with jobs consume keeping the economy happy.

I don't think Europe is going to become a popular destination again, especially for vacations. A lot of people have been choosing the east for vacations for years. That is, countries with a weaker currency than their own. How can such a situation change?It takes a long time for things to change in the world. One of them is the Euro and I don't think there will be any depreciation as has been said recently. The European economy doesn't allow that. Or rather, even if it does, there is no economic structure to affect it.",

All right...i tought people want just predictions and bold forecast...like some people find it boring to read full story...u know.But If you want i give you the analysis.Few points i'd like point out here ...1.One of the primary drivers of currency movements is the economic performance of a country or region. 2.high levels of public debt, and political uncertainties. 3.decoupling from the dollar can be influenced by various factors, currency wars, swaps, debt issues, lack of commodity trade, and other economic indicators. 4.Never undestimate the power of commodities currency tied with commodities can give strengh to currencies.5.Concerns about sovereign debt default or bailout packages can further weaken the euro.Join my financial and Investment official Telegram Channel and get daily news and you know first what's going on in the money world.Link: https://t.me/wealthclub777Joining your telegram group wouldn't make any difference from what you have said here and I don't see any smartness in your,from your thread it shows that you don't even understand anything on economy. How will you say Euro is depreciating and it is an opportunity to go for tour in Europe.
