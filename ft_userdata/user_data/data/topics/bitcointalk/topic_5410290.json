It is a full client wallet that you can use to run your own node after downloading the full blcockchain or you run a pruned node.Bitcoin is stored on the blockchain, an open ledger which is available to anyone. You will need to download the blockchain (which is where bitcoin are stored) to run full node. Blockchain.com, formerly Blockchain.info. It is a light client web wallet, not a full client. If talking about full client, you do not have to talk about Blockchain.com wallet, it has nothing to do with that at all, it is a light client.",

Can any one explain me please ? Technically, your Bitcoins are not stored but they are locked on the public key, when they are successfully locked, each of these transaction data/hash is included in a block by a miner and permanently distributed to every node that is connected to the bitcoin network, these blocks are in sequence and it continues in that manner when a new block is successfully mine and hence the name blockchain.Bitcoin core and Blockchain.com are two different wallets and none of them stores your bitcoin but store your private keys and helps you spend your bitcoin.",

They do not store your bitcoin, but rather you have your wallet(keypair) to prove the ownership of the addresses with bitcoin in it so you can send and receive funds.On the other hand, bitcoin are recorded on a public ledger and that ledger is basically all the computers that the miners are running with full copy of database(transactions) in it. If you want to have a representation of bitcoin, that is your private key.",

The example is Electrum.Which means web wallets are not SPV wallets (light clients). I thought all online wallets are light clients before. Which means only mobile and desktop wallets are light clients? Not the ones you have to connect through the web, like blockchain.com.Quote from: DigitalMonk on August 18, 2022, 08:21:48 AMIs it true that Bitcoin and Blockchain do not have a central server ?  If it is true then it is good. But if Satoshi Nakamoto secretly running the Central Server where all the Bitcoin data's are stored then how Bitcoin is decentralised ? You can download the blockchain and run your own node, or if you use Electrum, you can connect to your own Electrum server, but if you are using SPV wallets, you are depending on central central server to connect your wallet with the blockchain. Everything about bitcoin is open source and decentralized to a very create extent, Satoshi Nakamoto is not having any central server the way you meant it in your question, bitcoin is decentralized.",

Are you saying that Satoshi may have lied to us and bitcoin is centralized? If so, that's not possible. Bitcoin is an open-source project and we all know how it is working. Anyone can download the blockchain and keep a copy of it. Anyone is able to validate transactions. Anyone is able to make transaction without relying on any third party.",

There is no central server or centralized control by one individual, institution, or company. The beauty of open-source software is that you have the chance to verify all claims and you don't need to trust what I am saying or what the people before me wrote in this thread. You can go through the code and learn everything yourself. It's a completely different thing whether or not someone can do that, but that doesn't change the fact that such an option is available. Since most of us aren't developers and can't read code, you are stuck trusting those that can and have verified everything thoroughly. Since Bitcoin is very popular, you can be sure there has been plenty of scrutiny with more to come in the future.",
