Just buy some today and you will be surprized later next month. I am just playing a game. A game that will bring more investors in the Bitcoin business place. Beleive it or not the Bitcoin Bull is going to run very soon and it will go to the moon by 25 December when I will bring Bitcoin Jesus back to earth. Do not think Bitcoin value will go to Zero and sell all your Bitcoin. Then the  Bitcoin  Whales will buy your Bitcoin cheaper because you are scared. There after they will become more rich and you will cry loudly saying, ' why didn't I hodl my BTC ? BitcoinMoses  Grand Father of  Bitcoin  Jesus.If you don't beleive in me then go and beleive in Faketoshi. Remember those who say, \"we are all Satoshis\" are also Faketoshis. Okay ! Dokay ! You are all Satoshis. Only I am myself Bitcoin Moses. PS: The one who control gold makes the rules.",

As Buffett says (although he has no idea about Bitcoin): “Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful” What doesn't convince me is your religious view and that something has to happen on December 25.",

Just because it is true that the dip is the best time to get into Bitcoin does not mean that we should not analyze when is the right time to get in because for all you know after you buy more Bitcoin then the price can go down further. That's why I am really wishing that soon the bottom can already be cler in the Bitcoin market so that there can the the possibility of sudden reversal of fortune for good.",

Drop for the week 31 percent. The same applies to all other cryptocurrencies. Some show weekly drops of 50 percent or more. This is getting interesting. At the same time, we do not see any objective reasons for such a fall in the market, except for its general nature of volatility. And this means that after some time the cryptocurrency will go up again. It is interesting only to what minimum it can fall in the near future. This is a good opportunity to buy potential coins.",

Now is not a good time to sell, it is a good time to buy.

If you think I am impersonator then speak logically, you do not know me as BitcoinMoses neither you know me as satoshi. Nor you know who is satoshi. Therefore, it will be better for you not to accuse me as I am the a thief or impersonator. Any body can claim to be satoshi nakamoto. If you don't believe me now then I win because you don't believe me. If any one do not use their big head to insult me  it remain sceptic with civil manner they are wise people but if someone understand my language and respond to me accordingly then I might invite them to attend a celebration later. You are soliciting to ban me from this forum, well the self appointed moderators or the person  controlling my other account Theymos together have banned many of my accounts. They knows who I am and I know them, I also know who you are and what you are doing in my Forum. I will not get provoked by you. But when the time will come I will ask Angel Gabriel descend from heaven with my Private Keys and I will ask him to sign the message, \"I am Satoshi Nakamoto, I am not alone. I have a twin brother his name is SHA 256 and a Grand Father, his name is Nagasaki ........... . Bitcoin Invention, Bitcoin Market place, bitcointalk forum etc all are called Bitcoin Drama. Each person is playing their role in rela life in real time in real world in the Bitcoin Drama stage. If you do not like my thread just simply leave and go and read something else, which is better for you. Bitcoin forum is not for insulting any one. You come here to learn about Bitcoin and get involved and become a faithful Bitcoin adopter and Bitcoin business partner. Who is Satoshi Nakamoto ? And who is Faketoshi or Who is is a troll is not your business. Indeed you yourself is a troll. I will not ask the moderators or staff to removed you or ban you because, you are playing your role for a purpose. One day you will regret and become fully aware that you should have not made this insulting comments. I forgive your sin. But my twin brother won't forgive. BitcoinMoses akaSatoshi Nakamoto",
