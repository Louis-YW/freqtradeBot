Because we know that the presence of Web3 will advance the internet field and create an innovation which will make Japan a sophisticated country in this industry. Hopefully Japan's plan to be able to develop their Web3 industry will be welcomed by internet users there and it will trigger even more massive Web3 development globally.",

Like Airline of Japan have made a marketplace for NFTs, and Japan's President also showed great interest toward adoption of WEB 3.0 and NFTs. This is a good gesture. That now we can see more adoption of BTC too. Because these projects need BTC to back them up. Or at least some amount of BTC is required for them. Other wise they might not gain so much trust. But still, i really like the way they are growing. And the CZ is an old player in the field he will definitely find a way to lift the cases and allegation made on him and his exchange in US. and if that's happen we will see another surge in the price. Currently, this news is not of that much good for the market because market is currently correcting itself. And IMHO market might take a swing toward $40k now. And such news will only increase its potential to do that.",

Hopefully, however, it will not cause much negative effects in the crypto industry. Well, it all comes down to how well Japan will be able to attend to the policies they are making/planning to make.

Binance's involvement can further boost Japan's position as a leader in Web3 regulation. Exciting times are ahead!The government's commitment to transforming the internet and fostering social change through Web3 is a positive move. It's a strategic step for Japan to compete with China economically and explore new opportunities in the blockchain space.

It's good because then other hardworking countries will the earn their rightful spot into the world economy. I seriously didn't expect this from Japan as their workforce is known for their hard work, honesty and long working hours. But with web 3 and a meaningless virtual world, the next generation will grow dumb and immobile. Mark Zuckerberg understands that web 3 will not become popular. He slowly moved Meta out of their web3 ambition for right reasons.",

There is not even an exact consensus on what \"web 2.0\" exactly consists of right now, so mentions of web 3.0 seem like a complete gimmick. Politicians love to act like they are at the cutting edge of tech, because it makes them more relatable with younger audiences, however they often change such plans after getting elected. The fact that binance is supposedly involved could also lead to a dead end because they are being pursued by US regulators among others. Essentially it's a vote gaining exercise.",

From the article:QuoteThe opening speech given by Koichi Hagiuda, Japan’s Liberal Democratic party’s Policy Research Council chairman, noted Japan’s efforts to establish a strict regulatory framework aimed at protecting investors that form the basis of further promotional Web3 policies.This sounds cool and all, but after you think about it, it kinda summarizes the fact that there's no infra ready or any kind of rules for it, and they are planning to build the regulations for tech that doesn't even exist yet. Before that they probably regulate existing cryptos way harder then they used to. Which in many ways contradicts the idea behind many cryptos out there.From the tweet:QuoteJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida addresses at #webx“Web3 is part of the New Form of Capitalism”This is like a selling pitch for a most generic nothing burger ever.",

These type of things matter in the end because it allows you to be a lot better and could result with you not having any issues at all.I understand that people may end up making mistakes and that's why governments may end up making mistakes as well, so this road may have a lot of troubles and issues along the way, but when it's done it is going to be something to be proud of by the Japanese people.",

Talking about Japan's finances, they are quite careful, but in my opinion, this can still be handled by the government, but with caution, it certainly takes a long time for the government to reach an agreement to make web3 an infrastructure for accessing the world of the internet and a more powerful money-making machine for the people of their country.Web3 is also inseparable from the blockchain, for sure the crypto market will resonate.",
