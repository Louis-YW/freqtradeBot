But seriously everyone should believe him? Eth as security? Well leave that to your own understanding cause we know this could be a huge and long debatable topic.",

Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-bull-michael-saylor-ethereum-is-obviously-a-security“I think Ethereum is a security, I think it’s pretty obvious, [...] it was issued by an ICO, theres a management team, there was a pre-mine, there’s a hard fork, there’s continual hard forks, there’s a difficulty bomb that keeps getting pushed back.”“For it to be a commodity there can’t be an issuer, and the truth is you can’t really make decisions. I mean one of the fundamental insights in the crypto industry is that the fact that you can change it, is what makes it a security,” he said. Surely his main point besides a few things mentioned above is the fact that there are an issuer, ICO, and premine which make it could be categorized as a security. One thing worth noting is he talking in the context of a bill that considers ETH as a commodity.",

Most likely after the merger ETH will face a number of problems related just to centralization and vulnerabilities, there are already quite a few analytical parses on this issue. I wonder, if you suggest to Saylor to transfer his favorite bitcoin to PoS, will he also say that it will be safe?",

Its just business too for Saylor, an investment that is been waiting to pop up. Of course he is after the gains, so if this to happen he will defend it like how he did on btc. Shill on his twitter and make a myday post about it. But I doubt he is gonna do that but stick to btc as its more safer net for him.",

Doesn't mean that I will follow whatever he says, of course I still hold my ETH and I hope to god one day I would have 32 ETH so I could stake it eventually when that happens. But that doesn't mean that I will go out against Saylor and say anything mean about him neither. This is the dude that helped the crypto world break into the wall street world.If he could help us get that much bigger, with billions, then I would support him no matter what. That is of course resulting with me not believing or agreeing on stuff he says, and still do not say he is wrong, just moving on without disagreeing.",

Saylor's opinion which you can see on the Youtube link I posted on my first post of this thread, argues that Ethereum is more suitable to be deemed as security, whereas according to the bill it will be regulated by SEC.",

ETH still has utility and people are still using ETH on the Ethereum smart contract, thus make it commodity. It's not just a piece of paper that says you own something. Basically Saylor has invested a ton into bitcoin, hence why he would like to see bitcoin being the best ever and nothing else getting closer. Looking at the previous bull run, we could say that there was a good case to be made about ETH getting way too close during the bull run.This means if we have ETH 2.0 and proof of stake there, and if we have a bull run at the same time, there could be a ton of money going into ETH, not saying it will be at the top and take bitcoins place, but it would go up a lot. This means that some money that could have gone to bitcoin and make Saylor richer, would end up in ETH and he doesn't want that to happen right now.",
