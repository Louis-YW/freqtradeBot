The @halfin account has more than 69,400 Twitter followers on Dec. 12, 2022.Will Elon listen to those voice or will his hate transfer to Hal Finney's account to make bitcoin unpopular more. I feel emotional about it when reading it when he say it that account not login that inactive will be deleted.QuoteFinney, who passed away in Aug. 2014, was the first to mention bitcoin in a tweet on the public forum.Hal Finney first mention bitcoin in a tweet on the public forum",

Nothing of any value if that he will delete them so he should listen to voice of users.",

It's like he just created a vote on former president Donald Trump's account and followed the majority's request and wish. The intention to get rid of bots and inactive accounts is something he had wanted to do before he bought Twitter. For reputation accounts, and if the bitcoiners asks him not to delete accounts like Hal Finney's, I think he will not refuse.",

Elon main purpose on purging is to delete farm account/bot accounts that flooding the twitter right now. Twitter is a centralized application which means Elon can spare those account that has contribution on there respective field as respect for there work when they are alive/active.Elon is not the average joe and he is always reading the comment section especially on crypto.

Deleting accounts that have been inactive for many years and don't publish anything makes sense. I don't think that Musk will delete the accounts of people who have died long ago, like Hal Finney, because these accounts, despite the fact that the authors have not published anything for a long time, still continue to attract other users. These accounts are already in fact historical or museum exhibits, and their removal for the society will be an irretrievable loss. These are some kind of monuments. At the very least, I consider Hal Finney's Twitter account to be a monument to the bitcoin's history and it would be blasphemy to deprive future generations of this.",
