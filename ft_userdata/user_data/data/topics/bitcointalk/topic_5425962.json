Any ban in that direction is quite absurd, although I have no doubt that some countries will go in that direction as well.",

The electricity comes from various sources, fossil fuel and renewable. Its not like this says anything about fossil fuels vs renewables.Oil is not safer to use in a crisis. They're just concerned about a crisis with electrical power, not with oil. If they were concerned about a crisis with oil and not electrical power, they'd be trying to limit people from driving gas cars during a crisis and encouraging EV during a crisis.And obviously energy use has to do with economics. It also has to do with the environment since we're destroying it by using fossil fuels. But during an energy crisis you use whatever sources of energy you can get and limit the use of those that could be in short supply, and the worry here is that electricity will be low so they want people to use less electricity wherever they are able.Don't try to turn this into some lame false political point. Trying to use less electricity during a possible energy crisis does nothing to reverse how bad fossil fuels are.",

In case of energy crisis like these days in EU there will be shortage of all kinds of energy sources from fossil fuel to electricity specially if a country itself does not have these resources already (have to import) and most of European countries are like this.",

Just one, close to the border with France on one of the pipelines that bring oil in and next to one of the gas pipe that comes from Germany to Italy but most diesel and gasoline has always been imported from Germany.Quote from: franky1 on December 06, 2022, 11:11:31 AMthey say average per person use of electric pre ecar is 0.75kw per dayfamily of 2 children is about 2kwh a dayHousehold electricity consumption in Switzerland is 4500kwh a year, that's 13 kWh a day, so you're off by almost an order of magnitude.The average personal car distance driven is 40km a day, so for the most efficient Tesla, it will be 4.5 kwh.So, as usual, you're completely wrong about everything.",

      "body": "Electric vehicles, electric stoves and ovens are the way for the future because at least it is possible to have renewable sources of energy for electricity, whereas using oil or gas is not something that can be in principle done in eco-friendly way. However, using them properly requires having energy security, which isn't normally a problem but is an issue now. Ukraine, for example, used to enjoy a surplus of energy, producing more than the country needed, so we never had blackouts or energy deficit and exported energy to other countries. With the war and Russia targeting energy infrastructure, electricity is scarce, so electric cars and stoves are very unhelpful. So unfortunately, in current times, we can see a certain backlash due to a specific country doing its best to create global issues.",

Switzerland main source of power is hydropower but the country has to rely on imported gas for heating during summer. And report shows that 43% of this imported gas comes from Russia. As European nations try to boycott Russian supplies there is need to make sacrifices to achieve this aim. The swiss government is even considering regulating sports, the theatre and even crypto mining . Currently European nations' main priority is survival and not the environment. When this crisis is over, the voices of the protectors of the environment would become louder, but for now, they need to live to fight for mother earth.",
