  "content": "Metamask introduced a beta version of Portfolio dApp more than a month ago. It's a pretty interesting service that provides information on all the wallets you have in Metamaske at once. Not only that, but it also displays all the tokens you have from all the connected networks in Metamask at the same time.The Portfolio Dapp app currently supports coins issued on seven blockchains.Other blockchains are promised to be added in the future.They also recently added a beta version of a bridge for exchanging tokens between different blockchains. Only four blockchains are present here. I think others will be added over time.In general, who is interested, try, test and share your opinion. https://portfolio.metamask.ioYou can get more information and watch videos at this link.",
