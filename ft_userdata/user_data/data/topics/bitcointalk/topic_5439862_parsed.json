  "content": "Avoid ending up like a friend, who used all the money he has to invest in bitcoin and also took a loan, promising the lender that he will pay back when he gets paid in a month, after a month he never received the salary, I warned him doing this, because he has no doubt mixed investment with 'whatever it takes', is it safe to call this greed? I don't know. Now he wants me to lend him some money to at least pay the loaner back and later settle me, there is more, now I have to send him some money to buy some food. You don't have to use all your money to invest, even if you are not married yet or have other responsibilities, the best approach when planning to invest in Bitcoin is to buy with some percentage of the money you earning, maybe through business or a job. If you do this weekly or monthly you won't feel any pressure, always remember that health is wealth.",

Because it sounded like he is now your responsibility.Whoever gave him the idea that he can make huge amount of money after a month of investing really made him totally believed on it. I hope its not you because he really put it all down the line. Helping a friend in times of trouble is being a good friend and he seem to be in need and you are the one he calls for.  Hope you know him well and not trying to scam you. I'm not saying he is a scam but find out. Just a warning.",

If you do this weekly or monthly you won't feel any pressure, always remember that health is wealth.People fail to understand this phrase \" invest what you can afford to loose\"  this is absolutely the best form of Crypto investment where by  you do not need to panic when ever the market situation is going otherwise. You can not be under any pressure so as to quickly collect your capital because already you got a backup plan which is your source of income or profit from other business you so so far as you only invest a little to buy fractions of bitcoin at various intervals. Well seems OP friend was under pressure so as to meet up because no man can make such mistake up to the point of getting a loan for just a risky deal which you are not certainly sure of. OP you did good by supporting your friend with feeding. I commend your efforts but you should caution your friend not to make such mistake next time.",

Once you do past up some due date and wont be able to repay some loan the credit score would really be a mess and this is something that we should really avoid as much as we could.In a problem like this then there's no other way but to sell out his bitcoin holdings and repay on where he did get that loan because it would really make things even more worst.Its true that never go all in for whatever investment you are dealing with whether on typical investment or with crypto.You cant really be so sure on when they would be giving outreturns or making out huge movements for you to make money and also we know that loans does have durations which means you do need to pay them of.",

Beforehand, you warned your friend not to invest in bitcoin with all his money and loan money. He still went ahead and do his wish. Now he wants you to lend money to him to repay the loaners. Is it not funny? Allow him to learn his lesson a hard way that bitcoin is not a get-rich scheme so that he won't ever dare to invest in bitcoin with the amount he can't afford to lose. Let him to find means to sort himself out of the mess he has committed for himself than lending money to him. If you lend money to him, forget it cause he won't pay it back.  If you want to help as a friend give him the amount you know you can readily give out without second-guessing",

This situation of taking out a loan has put the lives of many people in danger, so me here, taking a loan to invest in bitcoin, is taking a risk and is not advisable to those who are feeding or relying on salary to pay back, because no one knows the issue that will come to he or her at any period of time.",

Also, no investment would give you a hundred percent chance of profit which should be an enough reason to avoid being greedy of profit. Know and set limits on any investment. Cliché as it may sound but only invest an amount you can afford losing. The idea is there, and no one wants to lose right?
