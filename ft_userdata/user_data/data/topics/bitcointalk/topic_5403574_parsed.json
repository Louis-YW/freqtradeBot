  "content": "With the desire to go green and minimize electricity expenses, mining companies are now utilizing solar energy to power their rigs. This, of course, is tied to the geographic location of the facilities since it requires areas with ample sunlight. http://f2hash.comF2Hash provides low-cost cloud mining option through their facilities which are solar powered. The facilities are located in Namibia and a new facility is currently being constructed in Brazil. The extreme sunshine hours combined with over 60000 watts of solar energy reduces mining costs to a bare minimum and hence maximum profitability.There are various mining contracts ranging from 50$ to 30,000$ with a contract period of one year. The return on investment is relatively short owing to the high profitability of the platform. Users just need to register, select a mining contract and monitor their investments through the dashboard. Pay-outs are done every 24 hours and one can re-invest or withdraw to their wallets.",

      "body": "Are you trying to give a profit of 1.5% per day or about 500% APY? It is a large amount and it is difficult to be covered by mining, especially in the current market situation.I don't want to accuse you as scammer, but if you want to gain initial trust, put money in the escrow that will be sent if the user does not get the profits (although I doubt if this will earn you credibility)Unfortunately, cloud mining is closely associated with fraud here so you are the party that needs to prove that everything is real, legal and that you can pay these profits with an explanation of how you will get them.Trying to give fake reviews from a new account will only make things worse.",

I just finished checking your mining contracts and it doesn't seem you're charging anything to cover certain pieces of equipment that are responsible for harnessing that type of energy!- When I compared the stats with \"whattomine\", some of them are inaccurate (e.g. hashrates for non-stacked contracts)!It'd be nice to see some pictures of your facilities + mining rigs...",
