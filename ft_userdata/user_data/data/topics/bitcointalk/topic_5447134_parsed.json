Just reading about these two topics will not help you much, but if you continue to be present on the forum, you will surely conclude how it works and the feasibility of it on your own.Those coins that you want to collect are merit points that the rest of the members will give you if they find that one of your publications deserves it. Try to focus on creating good posts and you will definitely get some. Merit & new rank requirementsQuote from: Why2why on April 01, 2023, 08:56:58 AMThe forum said I am a suspected spammer but how can I be a spammer here when I am not even a member someone please help clarify this to me, because I cant see that in the bitcointalk rules I read.Don't bother with the topic.Today is the first of April, and we have become accustomed every year on this date to have fun with the administration of the forum with what is called the April Fool's Day.Don't freak out. Tomorrow you will not find any of those warnings that you see today.",

But no need to worry mate the puzzle was thymos(forum main administrator) April fool stunt. Just like what Kavelj22 said it will be gone soon although I don’t know maybe the administrator would consider keeping permanent as this is also my first April on the forum. Here is a guide by NotATether on how to solve the puzzle. It is a lot harder while using mobile phones but easier on using a PC.",

But like others said we are caught with this April fools day set up by the admins. So calm down and relax. If I ever read theymos message like that not in April Fools day then I will be nervous since a lot of people here might be spammer regardless of rank due to this hard bypass captcha.",

I am glad you were able to go through the forum rules and regulations as you stated, and I am sure this will make the forum easier for you because you will be able to interact freely with other forum users without fear of violating any of the forum rules now that you have them.This CAPTCHA was introduced to the form earlier this morning by Thymos, and I believe it is for April Fool's Day fun. I'm not sure if it will remain as one of the forum rules to prevent spam posts, but the puzzle is difficult to get two points.",

You should do the same, and spend more time reading than posting, this is an ideal way for a newbie not to violate rules and regulations or go with the flow of April Fools Day. But appreciate that as a newbie you're concerned about the forum rules, just enjoy the game resolving the captcha and enjoy the last remaining time of April Fools Day.",

Just play the game below through collecting the required coins being ask on your screen. This game is visible when you are making post.You will be tagged as spammer if you post without completing the captcha task which is getting the coin on flappy bird game. This is just a temporary feature dedicated for April fools celebration but it’s not bad following it if you want to become non-spammer while the rest of us is spammer on this single day. Honestly, I’d rather tagged as spammer rather than completing this insanely hard flappy bird. It’s harder when you complete more.",

There's no reason to worry so much about the thing you're so worried about. Seeing the red writing above, you are very worried. Those who cannot complete the captcha have posts with red text above their posts. To remove this post you need to fill captcha by mobile then post. I have done it a few times but need to fill the captcha again and again to post again and again. I'm not worried about it because the admin made it an april fool.",
