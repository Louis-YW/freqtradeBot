FOMO is one hell of a market-related emotion.you're exactly right as i've viewed his survey but didn't answer as i haven't bought any squid token. basically, it is investigating the impact of buying squid coin (token) in your perception to the crypto market. the before and after its collapse, if you invested on this hyped-up token. i believe mostly that got screwed up here are newcomers in this market hoping that they will get another SHIB-type or doge-type investment. unfortunately, not!",

      "body": "I never bought into Squid Coin, I was t moved by the idea of having them for a Squid game chip based on the series at the time. I think I saw it for what it was as, movie series are more of a thing for the time and sooner than later, we lose enthusiasm in the series and so there were chances for me on the coin being one of those pump and dump coins so, I never invested. Checked it out but, didn't see it for an investment opportunity and besides, I'm always cool with bitcoin.Apparently, your survey doesn't concerns me but I've done a quick run through and the only questions that concerns most of us is, question 2 which was more about, what we thought of the coin and its nothing far from Pump and Dump as earlier stated. Its the cryptocurrency market, a new innovation and so, people take opportunities.",

There’s no need to survey honestly, just look at the total amount of scammed money and you can already tell how it affect the lives of the victims.",

      "body": "Why not write about Bitcoin instead of writing about squid coin?I know from the start that this coin will become a shitcoin soon because it takes advantage of the popularity of the movie which seems like happen covid-19 there is also a coin that pops up.  It's nonsense to have a survey on this coin that surely those FOMOed investors have been a victim of this. I didn't answer anything even though I dare to visit your link given because I didn't invest this coin from the start.  You must need to move on if you invested a lose your money on this project and learn from that mistake.",

Hype is over2. Dev gone scam3. Market condition or bearishI dont own Squid coin which is obviously been hyped due to that movie squid game.Once hype is over then expect that this certain coins value would be going to the floor.",
