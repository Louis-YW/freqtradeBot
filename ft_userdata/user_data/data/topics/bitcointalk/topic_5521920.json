Their apology is only coming because they've seen the testimony Bitcoin has recorded in recent years and they feel, they've lost out, imagine if Bitcoin price didn't appreciate over the years, trust me they would been admonishing Bitcoin and criticizing those who investment in it.",

      "body": "full quoteQuoteRegular readers of FT Alphaville may have formed the impression that its current and former writers are united in scepticism about crypto in general and bitcoin in particular. This is correct. FTAV posts between June 2011 and today may have communicated the idea that bitcoin is a negative-sum game being played on a protocol that’s very clever and hypothetically useful as a unit of account, but is chronically inefficient as a conventional means of exchange and is compromised as a store of value. Our posts may also have promoted the idea that the price of a bitcoin is an arbitrary hype gauge that’s disconnected from any utility the token may have, because it’s trivial to duplicate the utility provided by said token, so any intrinsic worth comes from the sunk costs of infrastructure alongside intangibles like regulatory acquiescence, interconnectedness with mainstream financial systems it was once sold as being the antidote to, and the souvenir attraction of “being the first”. We stand by every single one of those posts. Nevertheless, with bitcoin’s price recently crossing $100,000, a significant number of commenters seem to feel they deserve an apology in light of our longstanding cynicism, so here it is:We’re sorry if at any moment in the past 14 years you chose based on our coverage not to buy a thing whose number has gone up. It’s nice when your number goes up. And we’re sorry if you misunderstood our crypto cynicism to be a declaration of support for tradfi, because we hate that too.they are not changing their mindset, they still stand by their cynicism, criticism, scepticismthey are just apologising that any readers who read their articles chose not to invest back then..

I don't think they in any way directly told anyone or stopped anyone from investing; it was a matter of sharing opinion and allowing people to decide which one is best for them. Some investors judgement might have been biased based on the infection they provide, but at the end of the day, investors made their own decision, which means they are liable for their own actions, and they can't hold financial time liable to pay any damage unless there are some ways financial time has stopped them from investing, which they can legally use to go against them; if not, this apology might just be what they will offer, and it doesn't even sound direct as they are still not very polite and straightforward with their statement.",

Okay, even though it's said that those who invested then weren't holding anymore but at least out of 100 percent of people who could had invested then, at least 1 to 10 percent could had hold till date and who knows what they could have been by now. This is why I said this their apologies doesn't hold any meaning, and again those who also choose to listened to them do not only missed their live time opportunity rather has automatically drift away from knowing and adopting the technology on time to know what bitcoin and digital currency is all about.But on other hands, I wouldn't blame them because they also choose not to make proper and adequate research about bitcoin, and had in mean they find themselves making research they could had still gone back to hold at least some shares of it knowing too well it was very cheap as then.",

We all have our own views on bitcoin and it probably won't affect the whole thing. Any cynic will still find a justification for what they said but for those of us who know bitcoin it's not a big deal. Basically, the apology was uttered because Bitcoin has given implicit testimony regarding the consolidation of the price increase so it is natural for news publishers to want to clarify their mistakes.There is nothing more important to them than making the public believe in the news they publish and when they make a mistake, an apology is a must that they need to do and that is what happens most of the time.",
