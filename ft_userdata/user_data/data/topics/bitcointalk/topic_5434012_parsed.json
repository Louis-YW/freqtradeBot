In trying to change it to 130 characters, you are trying to convert your public key to an older, uncompressed format of 65 bytes.Is the prefix of the key you are dealing with 0x02... or 0x03...?Quote from: Nt013 on January 11, 2023, 01:44:56 AMit's an old adress, so is it possible to have only one key operating for public and private? No, for obvious reasons. Public keys are public and derived from private keys in a one way direction.Quote from: Nt013 on January 11, 2023, 01:44:56 AMAlso i still have hella problems to import it, idk what to do anymore. What sort of problems, inability to send out funds?Public keys can be used to create watch only wallets from which one can monitor their wallet balance, but cannot sign transactions.- Jay -",

Anyone that sees your private key or seed phrase can use it to compromise your wallet and still your coins.Quote from: Nt013 on January 11, 2023, 01:44:56 AMSo my private key is 66 characters long, but when i conver it to 130 characters it no longer validate my adress, but the 66 one do?

Do not confuse yourself, you need to differentiate between private key and public key. Public key is in 130 characters in hexadecimal format if not in compressed format. But if the public key is in compressed hexadecimal format, it will has 66 characters. So not your private key is in 66 and 130 characters, it is your public key.Private key in hexadecimal format has 64 charactersExample: 519AEF44454373646EB682F0B3281F99F53E6F48D019D08DDF676F9DB4BE6901Private key that has 51 characters (of base58) starts with 5 and it has 51 characters , (not compressed).Example: 5JSE5RpYy3P5WXkFHCGB2GrMM7PP5EBCHXRraiNyRwM2gyZbVfoPrivate key that has 52 characters (of base58) starts with either K or L has 52 characters, (compressed).Example: KyxLiYYt6MWSuLht2UhyEcxpomBnRf9zowJhqodz54sQTEdzaDgHPrivate key that is of base64 has characters 44 charactersExample= UZrvREVDc2RutoLwsygfmfU+b0jQGdCN32dvnbS+aQE=As for public key, it can either be in compressed format (66 characters) or not compressed (130 characters)130 characters, not compressed, hexadecimal format.

Its not like I'm in hurry, anyway the btc stays in, but i do feel better when cann acces it indeedIf your key starts with either 02 or 03 (+64 characters), then it's a compressed public key. In order to derive a bitcoin address from this key, the software first hashes it and encodes it in a special format, and then you can see your funds by pasting that address in a blockchain explorer search field. The key that starts with 04 (+128 characters) is called an uncompressed public key. When software hashes and encodes this lengthy key, it gives you a different address because the input data was different and the corresponding hash was also different. This is a completely different address that has no funds in it. If you have a private key (which, more often than not, starts with either L or K), you can derive both compressed (66 chars) and uncompressed (130 chars) and all corresponding addresses. If you don't have a private key, public key conversions from compressed to uncompressed won't help you to recover funds.Examples:Code:Raw public key:(12312385769684547396095365029355369071957339694349689622296638024179682296192, 29045073188889159330506972844502087256824914692696728592611344825524969277689)The uncompressed public key (HEX):041b38903a43f7f114ed4500b4eac7083fdefece1cf29c63528d563446f972c1804036edc931a60ae889353f77fd53de4a2708b26b6f5da72ad3394119daf408f9Length: 130Address from uncompressed key14FEwXgmVL37WvqVAucoijV1piKyzSCxzcCompressed public key:031b38903a43f7f114ed4500b4eac7083fdefece1cf29c63528d563446f972c180Length: 66Address from compressed key1DF7Yr4GKWoCXZZZXoEczo9oiokwQe8UrzHEX - private key0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffLength: 66WIF - private key5HpHagT65TZzG1PH3CSu63k8DbpvD8s5ip4nEB3kEsrefTAtA4sLength: 51WIF compressed - private keyKwDiBf89QgGbjEhKnhXJuH7LrciVrZi3qYjgd9M7rFU9EMfkHW6wLength: 52",

Public keys only let you view your addresses and not spend any coins. Where did you get these keys from? Are they from your own wallet or did someone give them to you?A raw bitcoin private key before you convert it to WIF will be 64 characters long, not 66 or 130.
