Merit is to be sent to the post that you find worthy of being merit. But I don't see any point in meriting an account and then banning it since it will be of no use to the account, so better still reserve the merit for more deserving posts, which you will always come across every single day when you walk around the forum.",

Yes, you can by using bpip extension on your desktop browser,  but if you only have an android phone then you can also use the extension by downloading kiwi browser.

No one will ban you for such actions and we do not have any rules governing such actions. The only thing is that you will waste your merits by giving them out to banned users. You can always check if this or that user is banned with the service BPIP.P.S. Your topic in this section is an off-topic. Move it to Meta.",

There's no need meriting a ban account because that account remains inactive and useless as much as the account doesn't contribute to the forum anymore. So I will advised you sent those merits to a valuable user who contribute more to the forum than just a ban account. However your free though but is useless giving such account a merits.",

As far as I know there are no rules in this forum that say that when you send or give merit to a banned account here you are violating the rules and policies of your platform.      That's all that will happen because it's like you gave a flower to a dead person in the cemetery, I'm sorry, this is the illustration that was given as an example. Or maybe that will just give merit to those who you know are active and still able to contribute to this platform.",

I thought the question was, can a banned account send merit points if they have it, and then it would be a reasonable question.Since there is no clear mechanism for identifying a banned account, there will be no penalty for sending merit points to that account.Technically, unlike merit sources, you are allowed to do whatever you want with your sMerits you have, but some practices may cause negative trust (selling sMerits or sending them to an alternate account)",

Its considered that for a person to merit a post then the person must have found such post worthy of being merited based on what receptive information that's seems to be beneficial to the person in question, so wether be it a banned or not banned account it's a thing of choice out of the worthiness of such post. But one thing I find wasteful is that such merit would be of nonuse to the receptor as such account has been banned and has no legitimacy within the forum activities to operate so it's better to not merit a banned post at all irrespective of how interesting such post is to the reader for the sake of avoidance of waste.",

Merit is not moderated so it means that there’s no punishment by the mods on whatever you do to your merit. You can only get a negative tag from DT if you use it on improper way but your account will not be ban by the mod.The status of the account doesn’t matter if the post quality is good. Besides, you can’t see if the account is banned or not if you are not using Bitcointalk plugins like Bpip.org to see the status of the account. Merit is based on the post and not to the user who post it. Eyes on the post.",
