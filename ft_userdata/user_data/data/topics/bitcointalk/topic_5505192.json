I even made a top about it.studying bitcoins price history will help you see that there is nothing that is happening to bitcoin today that hasn't happened before. It may not be exactly as it happened before, but it usually follows the same pattern. Price history will help you understand the events that led to a dip or a bull, it will also help you understand why certain news and rumours affect bitcoin. I remember when the phrase \"Bitcoin is dead\" was flying up and down after the FTX saga. A lot of people even believed Bitcoin would never rise this high again, certainly not in such a short time. As someone who was not into bitcoin at that time to witness such, what you need is the price history of bitcoin so you can have an understanding of what bitcoin has been through and it's still here today bigger and better. Finally, it will help you understand that Bitcoin will still go through similar paths. It may be worse, it may not be that bad, but brace up.",

Fear of losing everything and frustration, and all that surreal maddness isn't easy to capture in hindsight. Years worth of drama happened in just one week almost every week, trying to keep following everything was just too much. But at least it was easy for influencers to get content.These days this craziness is more public, and people are at least trying to keep up appearances.",

That's what they think and it's normal because everyone has been on that point that we want cheaper Bitcoins because we've missed buying before it went to the peak of it. And as for the miners, I'm sure that if the price goes down. It won't have something to do with its security. If there will be lesser miners that will continue to mine because of the lesser price of it and they'd be out for a while. It's possible that there will be new miners that are going to take over and will start to look at that point for which the difficulty will be taken by them and it's going to be noticeable. But I don't want to look into those moments that the possibility of going down or low is there for its price. Volatility will speak for itself as Bitcoin what usually does, now we're back to $62k and this isn't an unusual move for Bitcoin.Looking at it when it temporarily down to $49k, back to $55k and now a sudden skyrocket of $62k. It's always been amazing and this is why Bitcoin is giving always the chilling effect for most holders that have decided to long.",

By watching this live price video, we can feel how challenge it was for people who owned and held bitcoin previous years, especially in very earliest years.By watching this, it can help newbies to feel more confident on Bitcoin survival and its strength, to give them own strength to be less panic, and hold their bitcoin.Be strong and keep holding your bitcoin. If you sale off in panic, you will be like many people in the past.Yeah, this will make some newbies understand more about Bitcoin and also stop them from panicking about Bitcoin when they invest in it, bitcoin is not that easy to invest but as an investor, you have to trust whatever you are doing and believe in it most especially with things that you have seen many people have done it and they have enjoyed the outcome of it, before investing in bitcoin or engaging in crypto you have to understand that the nature of anything that concern cryptocurrency so that if you find yourself in any situation or the market price is going down you will know that is the nature of it and it will surely rise again, what I’m saying is that before you jump into investing in bitcoin you have to understand it and you don’t need to panic when things are not going well, although anything that concern money is not funny when it comes to the investment we should try to understand it.",
