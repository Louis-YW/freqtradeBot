  "content": "What happened: I was placing sportbets on tennis on stake.com, made a withdraw of around 11000 xrp than suddenly stake.com suspended my account with the remaining balance of 10500 xrp. This was over a month ago, they asked for various documents, all of them I provided. But they always rejected with different reasons. For example: on the selfie they always asked to send selfie with \"todays date\" and they checked it in 72 hours, than sent back to send the selfie with \"todays date\". On the utilty bill they wanted pdf, so I sent the online utility bill and a proof of payment from revolut and a different bank (both online).  After 72h they rejected it saying to send in non digital format. I asked the support on what do they mean exactly, they replied to print it out, so I did that. To that they replied to send 3 months of utility bill, so I did that, than they said they don't accept photos, etc. Also at one point they wanted me to send a revolut payment history with stamp and signutre on it, lol.For proof of payment I sent them my payslip for the last month and a bank statement, they replied they wanted 3 months.After a month or so I cant log in to my account saying that it is disabled.I contacted complaints@stake.com where they were no help at all. Also contacted the curaco gaming authority over a week ago but they havent replied at all.

It'll greatly reduce senior members's workload who try to help quoting you for image visibility. Also, for future reference, it'll be better and much preferred to edit a post to add new informations than to make consecutive posts.As for this case, I think this is the first time I am watching over for case against stake, so I am not sure who should I notify about this, but I think Stunna is the best bet.

Contacting their license provider should be taken as the last measure when other means of resolution had been exhausted, this was emphasized on their form, if I am not mistaken. It was stated --and you acknowledged by submitting it-- because once it escalated to the license provider, all hands are tied. I am not sure if any of stakes's representative will still reply here, given their duty is now shifted to answer the inquiries by their licensor. I'll try to PM stunna about this, see if he'll spare some time to put this on his plate though he's now not quite obligated to, so don't hold your breath.",

License problem action is so slow that takes a month or more just to get a serious discussion with them because of the volume of concern they are handling with different casino. I never heard a case that brought up to Curacao which user win a case against the casino here in the forum.I believe Curacao still didn't acknowledge the issue that's why Stake still entertaining the OP. The Selfie with current date is a joke reason since it doesn't matter if the picture is taken few days ago as long as it coincide on the timeline which they request KYC.",

You are simply being unpatient.  Ok first of all this is what stake writes about what they accept:\"Your proof of address document must meet the following requirements:Please upload an original photo or a PDF file of the documents, screenshots will not be acceptedAll documents must be issued within the last 6 months and need to be in Latin international formatShows your full name and addressShows the name of issuing entity and date of issueThe whole sheet of paper is visible in the photo\"Secondly I am verified on binance, and they accepted this documents without any bank statement in a split second. We dont receive the statements by post, they send it online. Also how stake handeled the situation is criminal. They always took 72 hour to check the document and rejected it in the last second, with various reasons.For example they wanted stamp and signiture on revolut statement. At one point they told me to send in electricity bill and the proof of payment with it. And I already sent them 3 month of electricity bill, meanwhile the chat support was no help at all, either they are chatbots or they are not knowledgeable at all, or they are there just to plain scam ppl.Thirdly stake disabled my account and i cant access it, funds are taken. They said that I sent them fraudelent documents, which I did not.",
