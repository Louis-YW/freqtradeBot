Manchester's city has really underperformed this season and if care is not taken the next season may be worst, because other clubs are ready to send money in getting their squad together by getting the best players on the board.  I agree with you when you said the more money you got determines the number of world class players a club could get, but saying Manchester City under performed this season is something I don't understand, because when it comes to the transfer window they spent on good players that in return helped them achieve the treble, which is not easy to achieve, they're only few clubs that's done that and this season is one of if not their best, winning the English Premier league, FA Cup and UEFA champions league trophy and their striker halland winning the golden Boot in both Premier league and UEFA, of which they won't have attained if they underperformed like you said, well everyone have their opinions, but I think they'll do just fine cause they're on the right track, with the best players, best manger and right backing from their very rich owners.",

You really have to come to Manchester with a big bag of money. But why should anyone buy it over? What are we missing in the current construction? I've pondered on your question and I think the Glazier have over stayed their welcome because lots of their fans are already eager for them to leave, they need owner with big bags that would be able to compete with the likes of Newcastle and their neighbour ManCity when it comes to spending on suitable and world class players.  moreover the glaziers, have taken more dividends than they've invested in the Club. the past years, Manchester United have suffered the loss of about £354m since their takeover as owners. And they're poor when it comes to investments in the club instance their Carrington training ground needs renovation, including the youth and females as well, the old Trafford stadium too needs renovation, no wonder some former players talked about  seeing same equipments they left 13years ago being used till now, even their famous legend Ronaldo complained about the swimming pool and training ground he left since about 2009/2010 still in same state and when it comes to transfer they're very reluctant in backing their managers early, imagine employing a banker in person of Woodward without football ideas and experience to be in charge as chairman. If the glaziers are handling the club well and having the interest of the fans in mind there won't be protests against them during every match day with posters saying glaziers out.",

Both NIEOS and Sir Jim are actually offering the the Glazers a bid that could still keep them in the club. According or reports they want the Glazers to still hold on to 25% of the club and they are offering around 5.5 billion and also the local fans are actually leaning towards them and with this juicy offer of 5 billion and a share the Glazers are also considering them but the major problem is the debt and rebuilding process hasn’t even been discussed on to clear it which is actually not a good sign. The Shiekh Jassim on the other hand doesn’t want a portion sale and wants to buy the entire club and also clear the debts and he has the plans of renovating the Old Trafford but his bid is still not accepted yet because he offered around 6 billion for the whole sale and this looks small to the Glazers. The local Fans and some club legend also don’t want him but most of the foreign fans support him. I believe it is just greediness of keeping the share or going on with a full sale that is keeping the deal still yet to be finalized. With the Sheikh declaring that last Friday was his last time to talk about the sale, news reported that the Glazes went to PSG owners to help convince the Jassim to increase his bid which I think is just ridiculous because he is Coming to inherit a debt affected club. Before the end of June I feel that Jassim would be considered buyer because after all the Glazers have no united at heart",

Quote from: Youngkhngdiddy on June 11, 2023, 04:29:26 PM My odds are that Sheikh would win the bid and take fully control of Manchester United.That's probably right but only if glazer will approve his last bid.

Their money is worth more than GBP because they have that black liquid coming out of their soil and the whole world needs that liquid. If this continues like this, soon the Arabs will own Europe completely. They already own many football teams but I don’t think football teams are the only thing they own there. Since they have more money than anyone else, they will own every other failing asset the Europeans couldn’t manage successfully.Similar stuff happened in Greece. Greece couldn’t pay their debt to Germany in the past and now they are living as a defacto German state.",

However, negotiations that have been going on for months reportedly have not reached a meeting point, because the offers from the two figures have not reached what the Glazer family wants. And maybe if it is in accordance with the agreement of both parties, especially the Glazer family, it will definitely be announced.and if a change of ownership is achieved I think Manchesrer United will be a tough contender for Manchester City and Erik ten Hag should be able to capitalize on this and improve what his team needs and also work out the best plan for next season.",
