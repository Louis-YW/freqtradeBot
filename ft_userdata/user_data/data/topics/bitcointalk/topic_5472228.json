  "content": "Bad news, folks! I just saw this article about how a bunch of LastPass users got hacked and lost millions in crypto.  So LastPass is that password manager where you can store all your passwords and stuff securely online.  But they got breached last year when someone stole an employee's credentials. and  Since then, hackers have been targeting LastPass users who might kept their crypto wallet info on there - private keys, seed phrases etc.  According to the article, at least 25 LastPass users were hit and the hackers made off with about $4.4 million in crypto across different blockchains - Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Arbitrum, Solana, Polygon.. and users wallets got completely cleaned out in just one day.  Can you imagine logging in one day and seeing your entire crypto portfolio gone?!This is a wake up call if you've ever stored sensitive info like crypto keys on LastPass or similar services.  You gotta move your assets to a more secure spot, like a hardware wallet or something.  Seriously go do it! This stuff keeps happening over and over again. Don't be the next victim!LastPass Hack Victims Lose $4.4M in a Single Dayhttps://x.com/zachxbt/status/1717901088521687330?s=20",

There is no reason to trusting intermediaries when you have cryptography. Install KeePassXC on both your main computer and your mobile. Use a strong password to encrypt both password databases. Back them up. Both the databas(es) (digitally) and the encryption pass (on paper).",

Other security lapses include 2017’s browser extension vulnerability, which allowed websites to steal passwords. In 2019, the same security researcher who discovered the 2017 issue also discovered another browser extension vulnerability that allowed the last used password to be leaked. The company has even made communication bumbles, like security alert emails sent to customers unaffected by a credential stuffing attack.And the list goes on!I am now using ProtonPass, which i believe is  a more serious company. But nobody should store seeds or private keys in a password manager.",

Fine, I know I can't be there for you 24/7, but the security of your private keys is equal to the security of lastpass, why? Because of human element involved.How can we educate people about this issue of trusting third parties with their funds?

I mean sure there are better options like that KeePassXC, but you still gotta trust whoever makes it.  I know its open source so anyone can check the code, but not everyone can do that.

I have learned it the hard way. There are some other method that I have came up with for storing private key online. Not the best and not the most secure one but it could provide great amount of security against hackers. It is hard to crack. Although I'm not going to reveal my whole secret but I will share another one that could give us the same kind of security. We have 12 or 24 words in a private key. We can divide them into four or eight parts. We have three words in a group like that. We can easily randomize this group like 4213. After that we just need to remember this sequence of 4213. Then we can add four five or six even ten words between each group. That way we'll have a long list of words. If you put that list on the internet and the sequence is only known to you then it will be hard for any hackers to crack it. So I don't think keeping your private key online is a risk if it's done right. That way we are immune to lose it and can access it anywhere we go. Because anything that is physical could be destroyed or lost. But multiple online backups could be accessed easily. Although this sounds so easy and theoretically it can't be cracked, I will never suggest anyone to back up their private key online. I have suffered it so I know how it feels. Recently I am using air gapped device for storing my key and storing my assets.",

This is yet another case that vindicate the need to saving your keys privately without involving a third party.  From the comments and reply i have read so far, seems the lastpass has been prone to hack and the has been a thing of back  to back hacking reoccurring without any much resistance. Does it mean that they  never bother or care abut the data and details of their users very much important to always be a target of hackers  on a regular basis. Possibly, there must be  rat in the house. Third parties should not be the right resolution to saving passwords and sensitive information as they can not guarantee their own safety not to talk of customers safety. Many third parties have suffered hack and as a result of that, lost huge amount of funds under their custody and some have not been able to recover form the incidence while some are gradually standing back on their feet. The series of hack should be a lesson to the crypto community to start practicing self savings and self custody of assets and funds.",
