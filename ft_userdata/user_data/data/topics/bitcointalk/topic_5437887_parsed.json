  "content": "A charitable casino means a casino limited to a building, or portion of a building, a) providing equipment, management and personnel for the purposes of conducting a non- profit casino, where a portion of the net income benefits various charities; and b) operated by a provincially licensed charitable management company. I am familiar with charitable events but this is my first time to hear about charitable casino. The funds realized are used for relief aid, counternarcotics assistance, helping to people fighting with a cancer, and many other good causes.  As a matter of fact, I will be participating in one this weekend to raise funds for people displaced by conflict in my country. My mindset is just to have fun. However, I will try to win but then if I lose, I will know it will be a cash assistance for those in need. My budget for this is just $300.Did you know that there are other casinos that donate a part of their revenue to do some good in this world?Betoncharity: It is just an amazing that from 4 up to 40 percent of the Betoncharity.com house win go towards charity. That said, we are that shocked by their generosity as we do imagine the declared 4 societies claims on resources: - Red Crescent & International Red Cross; The Institute of UCSF Aids Research; Foundation called Make-a-Wish America; the American Cancer Society.Paf: The Finish oriented organizations, with the best kind of promo – “Play among friends”-, have been calling poker, slots, and more of live and online casino players for help towards the Red Cross, including supported welfare associations for children, since 1966. RehabBingo: Not many people suspect it is the RehabBingo.com as a big help and an important sponsor of the Rehab group to fifty thousand disabled people with different physical and intellectual deformities across Ireland. And to be completely honest, their offering isn’t bad! CaptainCharity: Among the rest, we’ve discovered CaptainCharity by the address CaptainCharity.com, the organization shares 50% of the profit with 10 institutions, and later it is planned even more societies, which are chosen by players above ever. As far as we can see, it’s like the world of gambling is moving to the people advantage.Have you played in a charitable casino or will you consider doing it?",

I think this can attract people's interest in giving to charity, even though they play gambling first before giving it. Even if they lose, the money will be donated by the casino to needy people, so we shouldn't be sad. And that is a positive activity that casinos can do so that people who play there know that their money will be distributed to places that are needed. But maybe some don't want to play in such charity casinos because they think it is something different.",

Also, state lottery profits are  go in public education.Casinos and slot machines in Finland donate some profit to charities. Casino Helsinki donates all of its profits to charities and social activities.This Swedish charity lottery distributes roughly 30% of its total revenue to Swedish charities too [Source]There are charities done by casinos in Norway and in Canada too.Bitcoza offering \"world’s first charity Bitcoin Casino\".Somehow I can't access this website but seems it's the first bitcoin charity casino.Btw charitable casinos give meaning to lost money, you know that instead of rich people, at least some part of it was spent for improving the lives of people. But to be honest, that's not something that many gamer is interested in. Charitable casinos don't have that much players and profit to offer good promotions, better support and experience unlike traditional casinos, so, they still attract more people.",

When I know this forum, I have no reason to still continue to use other betting sites that do not have their own official thread on this forum.

As for me, I will prefer to just make a direct donation for charity, I like the qualities many gambling site here on this forum are having. The mission is to get money for charity purpose, we can also pay directly to the charity address or account number while making use of other casinos too. I will like people to tell us about their experience while they make use of charitable casino.",

It's all part of being a responsible business and giving back to the community. They call it corporate social responsibility and it's supposedly a way for companies to make a positive impact on society, although I personally think that it's more about just another way of promoting companies.But when it comes to the world of crypto gambling, I'm not sure if the same level of social responsibility is being upheld. As the crypto industry is still relatively new and unregulated, it may not yet have established norms for corporate social responsibility in the same way that traditional brick-and-mortar casinos have.",

It's definitely a good idea, but makes me wonder how big is the part of the profits that they donate. I know of a few charity organizations that raise money for children and they keep more than 60% of the money for themselves. Sometimes as much as 90%.",

It is what it is, heck charities themselves sometimes are pretty sketchy so I wouldn't put it past me that said charitable casinos are also doing their so-called \"charity\" work pretty sketchily.

I guess it's just additional money spent on helping others outside of the already taxes that they give out.",

During these events, people bet some amount of money with the intention of winning money or gifts. I also know that some of the ways some companies carry out their social-corporate responsibility are through donations and charity work. It is heartwarming to hear that some casino firms dedicate some percentage of their earnings or profit to charity. This will indeed support people that have become hopeless due to natural disasters and war. I have never seen or bet on any charity-based casinos. But It will be a great privilege to play in this charity casino because it gives the feeling that even if you lose, some amount of money will be utilized to take care of the needy.  Instead of sending all the money to the casino management, it is good to see that common men will benefit from my loss.",
