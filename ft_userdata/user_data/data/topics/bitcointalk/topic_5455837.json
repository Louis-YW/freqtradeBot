To create attention and maybe drag traffic to your channel.Well, you got the point. As you see even in the first video, I essentially say that without Satoshi, or at least a very credible eye witness, volunteering (or being forced) to step forward, the beautiful and beneficial mystery will go on. My facts-based investigation shows you more how Bitcoin unfolded, and what is does in the technical space, finance, and culture.",

Answering hundreds of PM on Facebook daily is a tough work, and that's not the only thing popular people have to do. So they employ SMM and PR agencies, which cost really much. Moreover, they have to spend much time for media events. Thats why it's easier for them not to have accounts at all.",

Well, if you were to check my videos and the book before you comment, you would understand that the formal identity is not the focus of this \"no stone left unturned\" strategy, but rather to dismiss false claims and nomiations, and to understand the origins of the Bitcoin project, and the mindset of its ingenious inventor. There is a bigger picture \"what Bitcoin is\", which is of particular relevance to the current SEC cases.",

Indeed we have not been in need for Satoshi Nakamoto on the technical front for a long time, after he departed, teh community became adolescen, independent of the parents. His undisclosed identity is even a huge benefit for Bitcoin. But it still fascinating, e.g., from a history of science & technology as well as a psychological point-of-view that would be great to clarify. If I had a wish to him, it would be that Satoshi Nakamoto answered a few questions, e.g., those I phrased in the book, without revealing his identity.What my investigation in the ebook (www.satoshinakamoto.be) is still useful for from a practical angle is to debunk false (self-)nominations.",
