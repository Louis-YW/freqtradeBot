Any wild guesses on price development for APT and Move projects? Many people think that APT will be the project to replace Solana in the upcoming bull season. I am still observing APT, maybe I will invest in it, but at the current price, I think it is still not suitable for investment, wait for it to drop to 1$ I will invest. If it can't hit $1 and the market is uptrend from now on, I will ignore it. According to me, if those who want to invest in altcoins should put APT and layer2 projects like zksync and starknet or potential new projects on the watch list and maybe invest in them for the upcoming bull season to select old project. Investing in altcoins is equally risky, but new projects like APT are likely to offer higher returns than older altcoins like Sol.",

The problem is there are many tokens have not released and the price can be dumped once these tokens will be released in the future. That's why investors must be careful before try to decide investing their money in aptos caused by they can get result in a big lose. I think that aptos is still a good choice right now. The price is also quite stable at this moment too.",

But with those factors, I haven't done my own research with those and that's why still, I won't invest in it. Anyway, the good thing that I've been hearing about that is there's its community that's too positive on it and its continuous development is considerably good.",

Both of its main developers were part of Diem.So you can expect it's a project which has the sympathy of the mainstream technological world of investors. They have wealthy investors and huge money potentially coming in.I think Aptos still haven't reach its full potential price and it could be profitable to invest on this currency aiming the next bull run. On the other hand, since it has come from a failed project (Diem), there is already a history of failure which doesn't bring good luck to the investment, besides being also attached to SBF from FTX, who led a raise of 150$ million for the project last year. I believe projects which are connected to negative people aren't good opportunities, because they don't bring stability and reliability to investors.",

It was being talked about here before but many people aren't really paying attention about it. Maybe they think this was just another ambitious coin but if it's true that Google is their partner then that's great as we know that Google is a giant company and I think it rarely made a collaboration or partnership with cryptos.Maybe they also think that Aptos is an extra ordinary crypto? If between this coin and Sol, I think there is no need to confuse yourself anymore. Sol is much older than this and we know that Sol is still making people impressed with their progress or updates. If you want to, you can just accumulate some Aptos on the side.",

Aptos was designed to be a new top dog, if that happens then the fully diluted market cap is still small. But yeah, it is kinda big for a very new project which did not proof itself yet. At this moment the best strategy could be to invest in high qualitysmall market cap ecosystem projects. The entry point to do that is having a high allocation on the Launchpads that run the IDOshttps://doc.aptoslaunch.io/products/aptoslaunch-tiers",
