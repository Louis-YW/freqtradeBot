If that's what you are trying to make. Because i checked the website and we have to manually fill all the details in it and it will definitely took some time too and then they will just put your information in some existing or pre-built invoice template. If you just need some template of invoices where you could put the information and could print that invoice for some purpose that could be anything. I think you are looking at the wrong website. Because invoice have no need in crypto, crypto have blockchain for that purpose. If you are looking for templates only then go for Canva or anyother online invoice template makers on search engine and you will find thousands.",

      "body": "Opps üò¨, @OP, what's the need for an invoice when the transaction is already on the Blockchain? Successful crypto transactions are registered on the blockchain and cannot be deleted or edited; they're just there and can be there for any time you need it. Any time you need them to prove a payment evidence, you will just go search for the particular transaction, copy the hash, and send it to whomever needs it. I remember when I first joined a signature campaign in this forum under Royse777 management, there was a user that was complaining of not receiving his payment, so the transaction hash was sent to him, and he really saw that the payment entered his wallet. For me, that's enough for an invoice. In my opinion, there is no need for a cryptoinvoice.",

I can issue you an invoice using their service in the same way that I can write on a piece of paper with a pen that you have paid me x amount with x thing or in a pdf document. But an invoice to be legal you have to be registered as self-employed or a company, if not, it is not an invoice is rather a private receipt. The receipt you can do as you wish, I do not see that your service provides anything to pay 1% more fees, and besides as you say the proof of payment is in the blockchain.",

I don't think that you'll need any kind of invoice especially when you are dealing with crypto-currencies because the invoices aren't necessary with crypto transactions as everything is already registered on blockchain and anyone can view the details of the transactions on block explorers like Blockchair.com as that one provides enough details about transactions. Just avoid that service and also try to forget about the invoice thing as that one isn't needed when we have the whole blockchain that we can view without any issues. I would most probably recommend you to use free service like that one Bockchair.com provides and that would be more than enough for you.",

But they also charge a 1% fee which might not be too much for those who really want to save a lot of time and trouble like your friend. Here is the topic I am talking about-->BconGlobal non-custodial direct to wallet crypto gatewayBut I am not asking anyone to trust on this platform because, it is new, might scam you, not old history or review so first DYOR then proceed with it.
