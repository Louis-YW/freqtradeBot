  "content": "Especially for the refugees of X (Twitter) - today I was looking for a Nostr client to use, but I was pleasantly surprised that I could complete the entire login and registration process using a web-based client called Snort (https://snort.social) With this setup, I was able to make a post and it shows the public key associated with my account, generated just now.Though a wallet and domain still need to be connected, but it will be done eventually.There's no need to use command-line software connected to Bitcoin Core anymore.It feels like we are in 2012 Bitcoin but for Nostr.",
