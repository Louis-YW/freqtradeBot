Well, there is still the case against Binance where over 60 other cryptocurrencies are classified as securities ( source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-labels-61-cryptocurrencies-securities-after-binance-suit); Sincerely, I am optimistic that the rulling on XRP will give a direction to those cases and in the end, crypto will win. Indeed, the future is looking promising for",

That's right @libert19 , I think the OP is very updated on the issues and market developments. Yes. Maybe what the OP said at least describes the current situation and conditions. The Ripple effect and the current case between Binance and the SEC. Very acoustic, if we read the topic title in this OP post.",

I understand this is good news in the crypto space as we have seen some impressive cryptocurrencies in a short space of time, but still need to be vigilant to avoid fomo when all is not a win. quite like the XRP field although this is still a strong inertia.I think maybe this will also be one of the reasons to draw investors' attention, because in the coming time we also have many different events, maybe an uptrend will gradually be formed.",

Is this enough fuel to sustain an upward trajectory? Yesterday when i randomly checked coinmarketcap i was really surprised to see basically every crypto project in the green zone and of course ripple with a pump of 80% at that time. Then when i read the news about that court ruling i also knew the reason for that. This was not only a great ruling for ripple but for the crypto market as a whole.I don't really think though that we are out of the woods yet to be honest. At the moment the market is already correcting a little again but of course this is also normal after such a heavy and almost instant pump.I still think that we still have to wait a little longer, until a real bull market starts.",

The obvious fact is that we are easily swayed by emotions when the market news comes out, as a long-term player I still think it's quite normal considering how dominant bitcoin is in the market right now. Now, and now that we are expecting more positive things to happen to bitcoin, I also see multiple media discussions about bitcoin with an imminent uptrend.Quote from: nimogsm on July 14, 2023, 02:18:12 PMI think that the wins of binance over sec will bring much more results. This situation showed that the state machine is not as scary as analysts predicted, and there is simply a way out of difficult situations, everything needs time, I think more good news awaits us in the near future.I also strongly believe the binance story will also follow the accusations from the SEC, but maybe we should look at things soberly here when the issues are not the same. But it is clear that if binance wins, they will continue to show their position and strength in this space, but they should not be too optimistic because in the past before being accused, a number of big projects in the market. The market has also received great trust from the community and then a long scandalous story.",

I think the excitement in the market since the verdict that exonerated XRP yesterday isn't for XRP alone but for Binance and other impending issues regarding whether those coins are securities or not. Precedence favouring cryptos has been set and that's the excitement we see in the market. For the first time in a long while an altcoin news also spiked Bitcoin. It's a good one.",

Those tokens have more utilities compared with XRP. They are definitely non securities coins. Well done XRP. You get the job done perfectly.
