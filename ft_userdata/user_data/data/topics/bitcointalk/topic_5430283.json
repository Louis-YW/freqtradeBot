Even running and connecting to my own node it still happens. Have you tried switching the node you are connecting to? I don't and just manually set fees and such, but should probably check one of these days.-Dave",

      "body": "Whatever your wallet software suggests you should use as fees, you should always check the state of the mempool manually before making a transaction, or just send with a low fee if you are not in a hurry. I have never relied on their \"suggestions\" when it's much easier to check mempool.space or Jochen Hoenicke's site.",
