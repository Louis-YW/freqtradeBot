  "content": "BOUNTY IS OVER✍️ Medic Doge Bounty Distribution Information♦️ Medic Doge's bounty allocation of 277,777,777 MEDOGE (~13,168) has been successfully distributed by Bounty Detective's team. Therefore, Medic Doge's bounty distribution is completed. You can check your bounty balance here.♦️ Since MEDOGE is a deflationary currency, whenever a user sends a transaction, some of the total amount gets burned and goes to the destruction address. Therefore, the receivers get a shorter amount of tokens instead of the total amount when transacting. You can check Medic Doge's Token Economics by visiting their website here.♦️ Follow up-to-date information about Medic Doge project by joining their Telegram Group.✔️ MEDOGE is listed on Pancakeswap.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖✔️ ALL DISTRIBUTED BOUNTIES                             📃 Page 1                              📃 Page 2📃 Page 3📃 Page 4♦️ You can participate in the ongoing bounties on Bounty Telegram channel.Kind Regards,  Bounty Detective Team★ WEBSITE ★ TELEGRAM ★ TWITTER ★1.

We are only responsible for the reward distribution of any campaign when we publish it, unless explicitly stated \"Bounty Detective has escrowed and guarantees the reward distribution of this bounty.\" The USD value of the bounty reward pool is estimated, and it might change regarding different factors. We usually announce the rewards by calculating their final token sale price if it is not listed on any exchange yet.Our team has carefully researched the project following several criteria as we did for all of the campaigns we have managed or published. However, we can't assure the project's success as our duty is to provide a bounty management service for them as freelancers. We are responsible only for managing the campaign. We are not responsible for the project's success and continuity.A crypto project has too many factors in reaching their targets. We are not in the team of any project and not their employees, and we can't guarantee the future progress of any project only because we manage their bounty as freelancers. We encourage everyone to do their research and due diligence before investing their time or money. Participating in this bounty campaign or investing in it will be at your own risk.Kind regards.______________________1.
