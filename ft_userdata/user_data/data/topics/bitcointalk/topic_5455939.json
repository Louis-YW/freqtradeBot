Anyway, not to take anything away from your country I think unemployment is generally a problem for most underdeveloped countries where their leaders steal the scare resources they've got without punishment.Back to the issue, it's true that Bitcoin is phenomenal in this age but we can't say it's specifically taking away unemployment. It's the services directly or indirectly associated with it that does. For instance, just buying and hodling Bitcoin won't do much for anyone except they sell off. In doing that, they're trading it. In trading it, exchanges are involved. Promotions and advertisements spring up because of this. Alternative coins are created, people get jobs from such and so forth. In this era, there are also financial opportunities from the social media such as the ones created by TikTok, YouTube and a few others where young people also make money from.",

Bitcoin introduced me to a lot of opportunities that couldn't be attain when being employed, since you can earn so much in cryptocurrency based on how good you are compare to working in a company in which you're not getting any benefits aside from working 8 hours a day, which is very tiring for me. I mean, freelancing is a lot more easier, we can't deny that and the salary or profits is really good if you're passionate on what you're doing.",

The only way an individual could earn money from this industry in general, and without investing is through airdrops (not all are paying), whitelisting, faucets, and campaigns in this forum (on signatures requirement is high knowing how hard it is to earn merit although there are contests they may join but there are skills required). Also with investment, the market price of Bitcoin is not consistently increasing which means profit won't be continuous, and that answers the question as well regarding unemployment and such which I think is impossible. Investments are good for additional profit or income but won't be guaranteed to generate consistent money.",

It can help them meet their financial needs and even support their families and probably leading them to financial stability in some cases. I personally know some friends who don't have irl jobs but are earning money online through freelancing and then investing in Bitcoin or receiving direct payments in Bitcoin.I believe that Bitcoin is assisting thousands, if not millions of young people worldwide who are seeking additional income opportunities. The only challenge lies with the government as many countries have yet to legalize Bitcoin. However, I think it will take some time for that to happen.",

Governments don't see Bitcoin as one to make money for their people but as a threat to their currency.And finally, the government made various kinds of regulations that could hinder the growth of Bitcoin in their country. But they also know that the government cannot control Bitcoin even though they can control Bitcoin owners by imposing taxes on Bitcoin or crypto owners. And this method has begun to be implemented in several countries so that the government can determine which citizens have Bitcoin or crypto.But when the government can support Bitcoin, make strict regulations for third parties, and protect the interests of crypto or Bitcoin owners, the younger generation will definitely have a way to generate income. And hopefully, this can happen soon, especially when Bitcoin can increase again and finally open the eyes and minds of the government that Bitcoin can provide benefits to everyone.",

We are actually getting all this wrong, although bitcoin is the first and the most widely used cryptocurrency coin but it is not bitcoin that actual provides work. Rather we could say it is the blockchain technology that has actually provided people with alternative to diverse into another technology and earn some money or bitcoin. This jobs comes only through development of new wallets or maintainers of exchanges. And as the the cryptocurrency community increases many platforms will come up and the need for developers will arise which will provide jobs for some but this doesn’t eliminate a large significant of unemployment rate we have. The freelancing and the faucets done by youths shouldn’t be classified as a job or any employment because it doesn’t always guarantee earnings. The only way youths earn in bitcoin which is common is through trading and this also doesn’t Eliminate poverty because you still need funds to invest or trade in bitcoin. And this funds isn’t just any funds but money that can be losable and I don’t think the poor who don’t have work can actually afford to spare this money into trading",
