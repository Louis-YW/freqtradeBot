What do you mean by the \"staking for airmiles\"? Also what are the utilities of  the nft? Can we use this pass in any airport of another country?",

Let's see where it goes and how much time it takes.I think you are over estimating number of NFT users that would use that airline. But that\\s what this definitely is a marketing tactic for a fringe group.And frankly i don't see why nft is needed for something that's basically paid membership and could be done with centralized service. It's not like you want to combat big bad corrupt airlines this way, as these are literally for a centralied cervice. I don't see nft being handy in any way on this. And who would buy overpriced membership later on?",

At least something can be done using this NFT rather than just buying some nonsense images for nothing. I like the way the entire thing has been thought out. It is essentially a loyalty program in the disguise of NFT to attract tech-savy and young croud. The usual NFT market is still dead.",
