I do, for those who keep worrying to deal with the risk and they will always be sitting in front of their monitor than do nothing and only seeing the price to go up even higher than before. This is just an old thing for sure but making money in the crypto will always make you deal with the risk. The volatility was the biggest problem here but it can't be avoided as it was making crypto can be very profitable once you have bought that at the bottom price and then you will able to see your assets at the highest price. Making money is not easy as you can't get trapped by buying at the peak price anytime and so, there would always be a reason why some people are only watching the market to go up without taking the advantage. They feel so damn bad to use their money to buy the tokens and take profit.",

People have got different perspective over the cryptomarket which too a reason why users weren't able to do it.You are right that experience is what makes us survive, because experience gives us a very valuable lesson which, in my opinion, experience will not be found in any book. Don't be afraid to try, because how can we learn from experience if we don't try and feel something that no one else can. The bear market and bull market are equally profitable if we understand what we should do with the market conditions in such circumstances. I think everyone can advance because of their experience, from there their knowledge will increase and they will be able to see which opportunities are good in order to make a profit.",

But when you are at the top already, people will only be able to make money if the late entry is on time. It's about time that people start to understand that it's hard to time the market, so much so that it will be challenging to recover what you have lost. That's why some people don't come back to crypto anymore because they were hurt.",

Yes there are some people who doesn't know how to create money on bull market situation because some of them think that they can grow more their money invested on some coins but sudden turn of events which cause them losing since the dump is coming then still they hope for great come back on it. People should realize in this situation that once you are in profit you should learn to exit because market is unpredictable so you need to think you already have enough and closing to get your profit in a day is right thing to do. There are so many chance for us to repeat this and only good timing is what we needed to wait.",

It's normal that people also don't know how to make money when the market is in a bear market. Those who are afraid to try to analyze market movements will not want to enter the market but only ask when the market will return to a bull market position. They also won't be able to make money because they don't understand when they can start buying. These people will regret it once they find out that the bear market is over and the price has started to increase. And only know that the market is in a bull market when they see the price is already at its peak.",

      "body": "There are exceptions. But those who are always looking for the perfect opportunity to make money are the mostly struggling ones to achieve their goals, because they wait too long to act, and once they decide acting, it's already too late and the opportunity is over. A classic example are the investors who think bitcoin's price is too expensive, and once a new bull run starts and bitcoin skyrockets they start complaining they should have bought earlier, when it was cheaper. Since the bull run is already happening, they can't afford buying anymore, so they have to wait for the next chance, what may take a new cycle of few years again, meaning they lost time and money.",

Because in the bull market every project keeps getting pumped. But people do not withdraw their money, instead they keep rotating their money from one project to another. Then they get stuck when the bear market comes. Bull markets are highly anticipated, and those who continue to be lucky to rotate their money until they continue to make profits, will be trapped when the market corrects again. there needs to be an awareness that profits must be taken and held in fiat assets or stablecoins to maintain their profits. constantly rotating will not be good if there is no complete control.",

I agree with you, but this is often due to the fact that they are beginners and have limited experience and it is due to their choice of memes or shit coins or because of their greed that they want more profits. Undoubtedly, the Bull Market is an opportunity through which we can compensate for the losses of our investment if we buy and hold promising coins until then Time, and patience is the key to success during a bear market and greed is what causes us to lose and miss out on good opportunities even if these opportunities are available to us.",

Although some of them have understood, in fact, not all of them are able to make money or make more money even during the bearish or bullish market. There may be several reasons:- They really don't know the ways because of the lack of knowledge, less learning- They are too late to sell their assets at a good price, expecting to sell them at a higher price again, but in fact, the rice keeps dropping- Lack of management of funds so that we may not really know what should do with our assets. - Doing trading which is this is actually very risky moreover without enough knowledge, in fact, they make some loss instead of profits.",

I believe that if you are a spot trader, You will chase bounces from massive dumps to gain a good amount of profit though people are now making money on futures trading which they short the crypto they want. The risk of futures trading is a bit high but on our current situation, I personally choose it as a way to earn money. I usually don't use futures on a normal market day but shorting massive dumps is very profitable, We just need to be careful since liquidation is very common on this type of scenario.",
