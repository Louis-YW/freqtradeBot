And saw that I have made many transections when the Bitcoin price was around 586$ only. Yes it's only Because this Bitcoin already hit above 60k $. I am enjoying today's moment because today I have imagined my past and it was the golden era of Bitcoin. I am talking about 2016.Today I have again learnt a good lesson that Hold is Gold. I have made many transections and I had a decent amount of Bitcoins but If I could hold them then I would become one of a successful Holder. But my luck wasn't so good I think. But I still have chances because Bitcoin is now also in a very cheap price. So Always Keep Trust On Bitcoin And Hold Tightly.  At the end of time you will win surely.",

And on the later month, the price of BTC crashed to $300+.It is really regretful that we don't pay much attention to buying BTC at that time thinking that it was too expensive to buy and now we realized that it was too cheap back then.",

I still had to do a lot of learning during the period and wade through a couple of altcoins before starting to stack up sats.The cheapest I've seen Bitcoin is a little over $3,000 as at late 2018. This just goes to put into perspective how changes in price affects the sentiment towards the market. At that time $3k was the bear period and now $30k is a bear period.",

I only focused to earn it for free while having no knowledge well that's another thing. But when i gets familiar with BTC its price was around  $4k to $4.5k. I was a student at that time and did not have any money so i talked with my cousin and asked him he was also out of money and we both thought to borrow money to buy some BTC but as we both were students and have no jobs to do which could bring money and thus we could pay the lender back so we dropped the plan. And still now we have the same feelings as before, but now we are making some money but not that much to invest in BTC. So we are still dropping the plan but i do want to collect at least 1 BTC but saying so will not make it happens so let's see what is in my luck.",

      "body": "Been looking at bitcoin since 2015, back when it was just 100 bucks. I studied it and found that it had this massive upward trend ever since it was conceptualized so I figured it would be great to invest in it or to work for bitcoin basically. So I registered on this site soon as I realized this forum exists, and from then on bitcoin has been my biggest financial weapon, that allowed me to reach financial freedom. I've known people over the internet that have been investing or observing bitcoin as early as 2010-2012, which I must say is the glory days considering how much cheaper you could buy bitcoin during those times and how massive the turnouts would be had I invested on it. Congratulations OP, most of us here actually have been in the same boat as you, it's all about timing, but since you're still in bitcoin you'd have all the chances in the world to invest and reap profits eventually.",

However, I at least tried to remain active in the cryptocurrency scene by browsing the forum and using faucets to accumulate a small fraction of Bitcoin, which was later worth a few hundred dollars. Those were great times that we'll never see again, but overall, it has been a great journey, acquiring stunning experiences throughout the years.Personally, I don't regret anything. Holding is great and all, but at some point we will all end up selling our coins; it's an inevitable process. I have several old transactions that would now be worth a fortune, but I'm not bothered by them; I couldn't have known better at the time.",

I am enjoying today's moment because today I have imagined my past and it was the golden era of Bitcoin. I am talking about 2016.When first heard about bitcoin was when bitcoin pumped to around $20k and dump to around $3k, actually I was being told and I haven't joined crypto space by then, but I started investing in bitcoin when the price was around $10k, and have been accumulating bitcoin with any extra amount am having, and I will continue to accumulate more bitcoin. Some people started investing in bitcoin when the price was still very low, but some people started investing recently, but the fact is that whenever you are opportuned to invest in bitcoin, then don't be discouraged that the price is already high. When bitcoin price got to $10k, most people tough that the price was too high and they didn't invest but we all saw bitcoin all time high, so don't think it's late to invest in bitcoin.",

I have known of bitcoin since 2020,when I some of my friends were into it but I wasn't that interested because I don't have much as extra cash which I can risk to invest in bitcoin. At that time the price was between $8,600 to $9k range. I joined this forum early this year to learn and grow on my bitcoin journey. So if you ask me about the price,I will say 19k when I bought my first bitcoin. Those early investors are the ones that bought bitcoin very cheap since they believed in it earlier. Those investors that hold on to their bitcoin from that time till now must be proud and happy for their patience and knowledge on holding for long. Holding and accumulating for a very long time is the best strategy for your bitcoin journey.",

Unfortunately, at that time, I didn't recognize the potential of Bitcoin and missed the opportunity to accumulate it. However, my perspective shifted when the price surpassed $3,000, prompting me to start accumulating Bitcoin and engaging in trading activities. As of now, I possess a substantial amount of Bitcoin. Since I enjoy capitalizing on its volatility, I don't hold Bitcoin permanently, preferring to actively trade and leverage its price fluctuations to make money.",
