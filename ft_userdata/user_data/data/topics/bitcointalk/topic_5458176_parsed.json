You are taking news from Indonesia and the people mentioned in those news were taking loan from Illegal finance service company. People preferred illegal loan because it lacks background check, but behind those easy loan the interest is brutal. In my opinion the correct to take a loan, is to deposit money regularly every months into back account, then applied for credit card, there are a lot of credit card that offer 0% interest, just small service fee and processing fee. If someone doesn't even have money to be deposited in the bank, then I don't think they should buy anything the can't afford.",

However, it should be noted that debt is something \"ordinary\", it is not good if the debtor has no income and is not responsible for his debt.For people who have loans to illegal loan sources, I have neighbors who are in debt of up to $ 20,000 from illegal online loans. This illegal online loan has very high interest, up to 30% in 1 week. This is illogical and is a fraudulent act committed by a lender so that the debtor cannot pay off his debt.I think the most important thing is to adjust income with the amount of debt you have, so there is a balance and maybe not bad.",

While I do agree that some of these online loan sharks attitude and approach towards their borrowers aren't right. But these borrowers won't get to experience that if they're not going to take any loan from them. Well, it's inevitable and every person is likely to have a source of their loan whether it's with these online apps or someone they know personally or with the banks. As much as possible, don't take a loan that you can't afford to pay. These services are where they're earning through high interest rates. Businessmen know how to maximize the usage of their loans and they're putting a good debt to themselves thus, the vice versa of those that can't.",

Anything that matters after that is simply because of your inability to pay it. Now I know it is pitiful in some scenarios, but that's just how it is. If there was a group that would support those in debt then great, if not then they can only try to accommodate for their debt by doing everything they can. In the first place, a debt is something you take if you know you can pay for it, if you can't then you 100% need to find an alternative, one where you can pay it off comfortably either by giving your service or something. While we can't exactly avoid loans sometimes, we can take measures to avoid burdening ourselves with it. It may be hard, but really, look at the bigger picture. You're mostly arguing with humans in the end, I reckon you can buy time to look at what you really need to look at most of the time.",

I would say that the best remedy is financial education in general and in general finance in particular, but someone who is already addicted to debt has to hit rock bottom before willingly starting a personal finance plan. Controlling expenses and income, budgeting, saving for an emergency fund, reducing debt and investing are steps that eventually take one from a stressful financial situation to financial peace.",

As was the case with myself before, I was forced to mortgage my property to have money to continue spending and orienting my next work, I also thought if I failed, becoming a homeless or beggars is what happens, so it gives me a lot of motivation to try and avoid making mistakes. The abuse of credits to spend for immediate personal purposes is like wearing a chain around your neck, it forces you to make efforts rather than accept the bumps in life, there are many cases like OP mentioned suicide to solve the problem, but before thinking about that think about the life of the people around you, they don't want you to end up like this, keep solving your own problems do not have to create more silence for those around.",

So what happened to me was that I was drowning in debt because I didn't have a job, it increased even more until I found something to earn, and I gradually paid it off with the help of my online friends, and I was able to avoid borrowing again. So for those who are planning to take out a loan, you will always think that it will be hard to work and then you will have to pay back the earnings. If what you are going to borrow is for an emergency, why not, but if it is only for personal luxury, it is better not to pursue it further. Many problems are caused by debt, that's what we remember. It hurts us forever if we can't avoid it.",

But in my opinion, we need to review our personal finances and make sure that you are able to pay off your debt without causing financial hardship. If you're having trouble paying your loan, contact your bank or service provider directly to discuss options for assistance or loan rescheduling. And adjust your daily budget and define reasonable spending goals. Find ways to cut unnecessary expenses and look for ways to save money. It's easy these days to get a loan, but it's also really difficult because limited work makes it difficult for us to get out of debt quickly, so it's not an exaggeration to say that we are slaves of the community money.",

Most of the time these loan companies don't expose or tell lenders how the loan will be repaid. The debtor will later find out that there are other hidden charges or interests. Some of these debtors are illiterates and don't have a full understanding of the terms and conditions of the loans. Some of them are exploited by these lending firms until they become frustrated. I will always advise that except if the loan is needed for business or emergency, there is no need to take them. Taking loans to satisfy avoidable expenses is not ideal. We should learn to live within our income and seek other means of income to cushion the effect of inflation and other economic problems.",

You can not prosper when you take loan to misuse and squander it unnecessarily but taking laon and channel it to a proper way will actually help you and change your financial life. It is advisable to stay away from loan if you can thou but if you can not absolutely stay away due to your means of income, then use it properly when you take one and do good to repay back at agreed time between you and your lender.",

When you have an easy way out you won't put effort into what you're doing since you have a backup plan which is indebting yourself. Loans should only be taken when you know you want to invest the loan money into your business that'll generate profits to pay back the loans.It doesn't matter where you're taking the loan, could be offline or online they still have the same effects. Also when talking loan if there's no other options available to you always take loans that are payable to avoid getting humiliated as you neighbor was humiliated.",

A lot of people, at least here in my country, are so financially irresponsible that much of their money goes to wants rather than needs. They don't have a proper sense of priority.Even among a lot of people I personally know, they are easily attracted to loans.

At the very least, the goal is likely to make the infrastructure more mature so they can regulate online lending properly and stop scammers to collect users data illegally.

However, if the loan process is from a company affiliated with the Financial Services Authority, they don't dare to run away and the personal data that has been deposited becomes a reference for the Bank when at any time the person makes a loan. , applying for work automatically the system will reject it because there is a negative track record. from not paying debts.",

And one more thing, maybe it's important to try if you really owe a loan to a legal company, because illegal ones usually have high interest.because for me debt is not a loss if we can really be productive with our debt. we can pay monthly installments and we can make ends meet for our daily needs. I myself have cash but I also have debt for shop capital. Because I believe everyone who does business must have debt. They are in debt for something that is productive or productive and profitable, but with careful calculations too, not haphazardly. so if you intend to go into debt for business or business, you have to really calculate the details.
