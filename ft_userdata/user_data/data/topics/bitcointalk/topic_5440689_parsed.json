Nobody is actually omini known in any field of life but I assured you we did our best and I guess many of them understood of purpose and points of the teaching. I can't said we must have address about cryptosystem cus not everything we know but the message of bitcoin primarily and elementarily passed and I believed 70% understood. Mind you, we first open floors for questioning in a short scene to affirmed the students knowledge of Cryptocurrency before we start teaching that's where those primary questions of Cryptocurrency as Ponzi or how long the system will last came about. So we trashed this questions as teaching progress. So bae, nothing conducted in our efforts to spread bitcoin, if we wants to find fault we can always find excuse for that and if we always desires to applaud people efforts we can always do it from our heart.

Because if it's only limited to trading through a Binance account, I think there are still a lot of things that need to be taught and understood by these students for now. Because the general concept of trading is always so simple for them to understand that they just go for the cheap and sell for the higher.But besides all that, you and your friends must also explain about the risks as well as about how to protect existing assets when they start buying and also when they start wanting to invest in currencies like Bitcoin. Because if it's only limited to trading, I think over time they will also feel bored when the profits are not that big. So try to teach them the basics first before they start trading on their Binance account.",

And what is the post-event plan. For me what is better than investing in Bitcoin is talking about it security. Getting the students to buy Bitcoin on binance is not just enough because as we know not your keys not your coins. For the post is there any plans did you include creating a WhatsApp group for students who bought bitcoin so you can move their awareness which I believe is continuous online and provide the proper guidance? Or did you add them to an emailing list so that you could send them email news letters weekly? If you didn't kindly consider doing it in your next event.",

Having investments and the possibility of making a fortune has been some way to pull up crowds in the hall. That's what our society has turned into as, we've got people going through a lot and all they are looking out for is for means of escape from poverty and the government. Apparently, cryptocurrency or bitcoin wasn't created to drag people out of poverty. It was for some easy lifestyle finance and staying off the government or centralised systems radar. Its ideally a currency and the bitter truth ought to be told else, we would have these guys looking out for opportunity in the wrong window and end up being discouraged for sometime.Obviously, security and privacy shouldn't be left out.
