Because if they have to include closed contests, it means they will trace back to when the forum started.",

Therefore, updating this list may be every 3 days to a week, which is a period Enough for everyone to share.Therefore, the benefit of such topics will be little if you are committed to keeping the list updated.It's up to you, and I hope someone can benefit from it.",

AFAIK, the last review campaign was several months ago, Whirlwind review campaign was just launch this month though.For OP since you added a review campaign as contest/giveaways, check the review campaign of Utopia[1].

They're usually say they will review it and may continue the contest in the future rather than say this contest is the last contest and we will not launch it anymore.

If not, this will just be forgotten like many other overview or compilation threads that came before this. Anyway, I agree with noorman0 that review campaigns are neither contests nor giveaways. Furthermore, contests that have ended don't have to stay on the list. After all, your heading is \"All Available Contests.\" The list would also grow too long if it always includes those that have already ended.Also, this list seems to specify only those offered in the services section. Most of the giveaways, however, are posted in the games and rounds. There are also those in the collectibles section.",
