Thanks for sharing it OPÂ  I really like the page dedicated to creating a paper wallet (https://getcryptoaddress.github.io/paper-wallet-editor/), it's cool that you can at least add your own text !However, before using it seriously and sending funds to such a wallet, I'm going to wait for someone knowledgeable on the forum to confirm that the code is ok. You can never be too careful",
