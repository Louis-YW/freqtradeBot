  "content": "Welcome to NoSSD Chia Pool official thread!▸▸▸ https://nossd.com ◂◂◂Features:1. No SSD needed  You only need HDDs to generate and store your plots.  More HDDs you have - less time is required to make a plot:  3 HDD: 30-80 minutes  2 HDD: 40-100 minutes  1 HDD: 1-4 hours  Fast plotting without SSD is a reality now!2. 20-30% more reward with new compressed plot format  Our plots are 16-23% smaller than standard plots, therefore generate 20-30% more reward for the same disk space.  Standard plot size: 101.3 GiB  Our plot size: 78.1 - 84.5 GiB  You can choose compression level before plotting.  Smaller plots require more CPU work during mining for decompression.Our pool supports delegated plotting. One person can make plots for another without being able to mine on them.All necessary software (plotter, miner, etc) is embedded in our client program and all required operations are done automatically.Basically, you will only need to specify directories for plots and Chia address for reward.Both Windows and Linux operating systems are supported.How to start mining:https://nossd.com/startMore information (including plotting time for different PC configurations):https://nossd.com/helpTelegram:https://t.me/nossdpoolEnjoy!Q: How much free space on HDDs is required to mine on your pool?A: At least 225GiB for temporary files plus few hundreds GiB for plots.Q: My plots are larger than you specified.A: Our plotter generates sparse plots first. They are suitable for mining too, but 13% larger than final ones.After filling all directories with sparse plots, it will start to finalize them. This process takes 10-30 minutes for each plot.Q: What about mining fee?A: Current mining fee is 0.5%. Later, standard mining fee will be 3.5%.Q: My Internet connection is ok, but your client still can't connect to the server.A: Check your system time. The client requires correct system time during mining.If time deviation is more than a minute, the client will be completely unable to communicate with the server.Feel free to ask more questions!",

You claimed on another site four people have been involved in this process for over a year, I would expect at least one to be known by someone, but it seems all four are complete mysterious unknowns without an ounce of provenance between them, in crypto, thats a big deal when many signs are pointing to scam. (and thats one of the big ones)2. Once again we circle back to lack of provenance for four people trying very hard to have no past history or current connections.3. I'm not going to point out several things misstated just yet, but I would expect four people who have been involved a year to not make such rookie blunders if they truly had an advanced understanding.4. (see 3.)5. We couldn't actually disable automatic updates because its closed source and you are using bittorrent within it, so lets be a little genuine here that most will never be able to secure their machines enough to stop your closed source software and it can tell them anything you want it to whether they disable autoupdate or not.Running something in a VM is not really a proof it works or works without unintended consequences tomorrow or the next day, thats the problem with an unknown group (who is trying very hard to remain anonymous) making claims with no connections to the community or seemingly the outside world in crypto or otherwise.",

You can download it here:https://nossd.com/startTrying to cite Satoshi Nakamoto as some defense for your software REALLY tells me a lot about you, their software was OPEN SOURCE, while yours remains closed source and had data stripped to conceal its contents, you also included auto-update software via torrent that would allow you to put anything onto someones computer now or in the future and they just have to \"trust you\" that its safe, guess who never did that, Satoshi Nakamoto.Now you CLAIM to have removed the auto-update software but you can't REALLY prove that, because once again your software is closed source and we just have to \"trust you\" there isn't simply a better masked version of it within, you know who never did that, the very person you're attempting to steal name recognition from to deflect away from your shortcomings and gigantic red flags waving about your past, present, and unknown future actions.You are the epitome of software that is dangerous and wrong for crypto, and your responses to people bringing that up on other forums simply casts more red flags upon you.",

      "body": "I posted this in your thread in the chia forums, but you didn't respond, possibly because you were in the process of moving the discussion here, so I'll respond again here:Okay @AnthonyYoung, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and try to help you get some traction here. Tell you what:Connect your farmer running your code to the public Testnet (i think it’s called Testnet10?) and run it. It’s a small chain so you should get blocks in minutes if not seconds. Show us on chain the blocks you won so we can see the public winrates ourselves.Answer the question of “Are you simply using the already known \"Hellman Attack” (as explained here on page 25: https://www.chia.net/assets/proof_of_space.pdf) there is no wrong answer to me, I just want to know.Do those two things, and no matter what the results are, either way I will send you $25,000 USD in the crypto currency of your choice, with zero extra conditions. You have literally nothing to lose from this and everything to gain and it should only take a matter of minutes to setup for a quick and easy $25k. I have a vested interest in getting to the bottom of this and am happy to pay to help you do so.",
