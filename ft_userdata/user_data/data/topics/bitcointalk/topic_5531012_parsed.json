  "content": "I wanted to throw this topic as a question but I feel confident to say that the days where anyone (poor) can easily acquire one Bitcoin is over. The reason why I feel such confidence is because, at the beginning, things was easy, and people where living good life because things was very cheap then, jobs where available, 1 month salary can serve a house hold budget and yet there will br enough money to save for that month but looking at how things have changed right now, salaries of so many people can not even complete their house hold budget for a months, it's only rich people that are able provide all house hold needs, settle all bills and still have more money to save and also buy 1 or more Bitcoin. Let's all be truthful to ourselves, since 2020 till today, how many times have you heard that a middle class or a poor person bought 1 or more Bitcoin? Does it means that they don't love to own 1 Bitcoin? Many poor people love to own even more than 1 Bitcoin, but yet, no matter how hard they try ( from year to year) they are not able to get 1 Bitcoin, the only people that are very opportuned to buy 1 or more Bitcoin are just the rich people. Since 2020 till today, how many person do you know to have been able to buy one or more Bitcoin?. That's the reason why I feel confident to say that, the days which anyone can get one Bitcoin is over.  A lot of people, their yearly income is not even up to $20k, some people are not even up to $8k a year. Does this thing bother anyone of you here or no body gives a fuck? I am not saying that everyone must have 1 Bitcoin, but the discussion is that things has changed and it's not as easy as before when 1 personal can just buy 1 to 100s of Bitcoin at a time with small money. So my advice is, if you can not buy 1 Bitcoin, just buy any fraction that your money can afford, don't fall into the pressure that you have to own 1 Bitcoin. Do what you can, based on your financial capabilities. It's possible to own 1 Bitcoin but not as easy as before when anyone  (poor) can easily buy 1 BTC at once.",

Your point is absurd because the rich can buy as much bitcoins as they want anytime any day your limitation should be to those that earn very little and as a result need to make use of the DCA method. If you have a $1M in form of cash especially, you could swap that to roughly over 10 bitcoins with just the snap of a finger in literal sense.",

      "body": "Not everyone can afford to buy a whole Bitcoin since the price is pretty expensive. There are some individuals who can, along with institutional investors who buy Bitcoin to hold long term. For the rest of us, the DCA method fits well because it doesn't put too much pressure on our wallets, we just stick to a budget and buy regularly.But don't assume that the current price is the dip and that it won't drop further. History shows that prices can dump again, causing some weak hands to panic. That's when you should seize the opportunity to buy more. Maybe one day, you'll look back and say, \"Hey, I can actually afford a whole Bitcoin!\"",

Those days are over. In the early days when bitcoin was still less than a $10, it easy to get. There was a bitcoin faucet and it give out bitcoins and not a fraction of it. There was a competition when the person who came third, the price was about if I remember correctly, 100 bitcoins. People gave out bitcoins in whole numbers like it was nothing. So it was easy then. Those days are gone. QuoteSo my advice is, if you can not buy 1 Bitcoin, just buy any fraction that your money can afford, don't fall into the pressure that you have to own 1 Bitcoin.

There are many Bitcoin units and you can invest in Bitcoin with very small capital. If you are rich, invest with big capital, but if you are poor, invest with small capital and DCA with time.MicroStrategy (now Strategy) are rich, but El Salvador don't need to be rich as same as Strategy to succeed with Bitcoin investment.https://saylortracker.com/https://nayibtracker.com/Now, do you see what I mean?",

Acquiring a whole Bitcoin is practically impossible for the majority of people nowadays, as it costs $100,000 on average, and I also don't expect it to go any lower than $80,000 anytime soon. Most people still claim that you can always buy fractions of Bitcoin and blah blah blah; I disagree. Let's face it and be honest with ourselves; 0.10 BTC is unlikely to take us far. That's currently about $10,000, which is a decent amount, but these $10,000 could have made a huge difference a few years ago. You can't do that now.Unfortunately, this is the ugly truth: most of us won't ever acquire a whole Bitcoin, nor will we have the opportunities that were presented throughout the years, but that's okay. We shouldn't look back, but only at what to do now to make our future better. Bitcoin was never a get-rich-quick scheme; some people were too confident, too lucky, or too patient with Bitcoin and got involved when it was still affordable; this evolution took years to take off.",

Invest, don't trade, and accumulate bitcoin with time will help you having more bitcoins in your portfolio.Don't set a too ambitious goal like owning 1 bitcoin or more, if you can accumulate bitcoin, it's enough and you are doing great things already. With time like after several years, through DCA, you will surprise with how many satoshis you accumulated. It will be bigger than what you think it could be, it's magic of DCA strategy.If you can stack, you can have more satoshis and maybe will have 1 bitcoin in future.",

It's more difficult for the poor to invest a ton hence the use of the DCA method but that doesn't apply too for the rich. The more you have the more you should be able to buy.",
