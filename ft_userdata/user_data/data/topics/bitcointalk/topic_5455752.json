You can file a complaint against them on askgamblers.com or their license provider Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission. If they can prove their claim, then you have nothing to do.

The other complainant you mentioned above kamen1 has already submitted complaint on CG. OP, if you want to, you can do the same.

A different scenario is that you are gambling from a restricted location or that you got banned and returned to the site and are now using VPN software to hide your identity.To confirm if you are telling the truth or not, a trusted mediator would have to look at the presented evidence. If you don't want to go down that route, this thread doesn't really have much value. It's a person saying they got scammed and nothing else. The story begins and ends there.",

I just want to warn new players that this casino is a scam.Your story looks like more scam than the casino. You admit to yourself that you are travelling that cause your account IP varies too much. The problem is your reason is too good to be true. You use an IP that is connected to other user that probably avail the same bonus.Your story of travelling seems like a fake reason just cover the fact that you are using VPN to change your IP so that you can claim bonuses using multiple account. Use askgambler to open a dispute against Mavericks if you are very eager to this case. You can send your passport with them to show your travel logs if it's coincide to the mavericks IP logs on your account.",

Based on OP's results, I don't think he want's to take this any further. Even if he does, there's nothing CG can do. Based on OP's statement I quoted below this post, OP reached to their licensor, Isle of Man, and the licensor agreed on the findings made by the casino and ruled the case in favor to the casino. CG can not intermediate this as they will not intervening disputes that's already ruled out by the \"highest possible\" authority.IIRC, every licensor stated that they're the last step of solving disputes due to this very reason, that their decision is final, and that gamblers should have been sure they've exhausted any possible means of resolution prior to escalating it to themThis is what also happened to the \"neighboring\" case of kamen1, where CG will not intermediating a case that's already ruled out by the licensor [the verdict of the said case is quoted below the line].Quote from: kezar1 on June 16, 2023, 11:27:42 AMI wrote to both the support service and the licensing authority.

I only recommend you collect your deposits back and let us know afterwards, so we can close this case accordingly.I am sorry I could not be of more help on this occasion.Best regards,Tomas",
