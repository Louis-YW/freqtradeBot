Sending those bitcoins to Genesis address is like burning those bitcoins.Who is rich enough to burn such bitcoin that has huge value with today price. Another fact is 26 bitcoins is just a small amount with early bitcoin miners because initially Bitcoin block subsidy is 50 bitcoins, before halved to 25 bitcoins in 2013.",

So, Satoshi has to dox himself, OR break the law1- IF he is a resident of the United States. US law applies to the US, not the whole world.2- what is the penalty for breaking this law? Probably some fine. Compare this to the risks of disclosing a fortune of $45 billion. No one in their right mind would come forward for this reason.3- If the goal was to flush Satoshi out, why wasn't $11k sent? This would be enough to create a tax obligationIn my opinion, a much more likely scenario is that, at some heavily alcoholic/drug-fueled party, on some millionaires' yacht, just as a joke, it was sent a moment after the words \"hold my beer\".According to estimates, in the middle of 2021, there were 56 million people worldwide whose assets exceeded one million US dollarsAround 2,132,856 households in America have $10 million or more in net worthWhat are the chances that from the group of 56 million people, there will be someone crazy enough to do it for fun? In my opinion, it's huge. Case closed.",

It is a bit unlikely, but if I were to guess, it was some dude who made a crap load of money on btc/crypto/trading that sent the $1.2m just so send a message (not necessarily to thank Satoshi because who knows if he's still alive).",

So, Satoshi has to dox himself, OR break the lawThat might make sense under certain conditions, though I'll be damned if I can think of any legitimate ones where someone would send that much bitcoin to Satoshi's address just on the off chance that he'll somehow come out of hiding to avoid breaking the law.  Somehow that just doesn't jibe with anything a reasonable person might do, even if that person had enough bitcoin to throw away.I did read some thread titles dealing with this, but I never looked into it until now.  This is the first time anything's been sent to Satoshi's stash, right, or am I wrong on that?  I know no coins have been sent from the genesis block, but my knowledge of the reverse scenario is fuzzy at best.  Aside from that, it's just another wacky story from the world of bitcoin--there have been hundreds of them by now, with more to come no doubt.",

They just \"burn\" 26 BTC to get the attention of people towards the address and make us discuss something like this.We do not know whether these people are making fun of the comments of people about their actions but one thing is for sure, these people are abundant with Bitcoins (probably an early adopter).",

If we consider this enough reason to either awaken the Satoshi wallet or fish out who Satoshi is, it might not be possible.",

It'd be like if the IRS fined the average person a dollar.So if the reason was actually to \"flush satoshi out\" lol, whoever did it is an idiot and just wasted a million dollars of bitcoin (of course worth much much more in the future).",
