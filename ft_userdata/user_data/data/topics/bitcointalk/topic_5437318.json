As we know that fiat has greater inflation than bitcoin itself, of course, when you invest in bitcoin, you will maintain a store of value from the assets you own. by the way, the halving of the bitcoin network will be happened by early next year (Q1 probably), so it would be a good opportunity for you if you invest in bitcoin asap.",

Planning for the future, requires an inflation resistant asset like Bitcoin.You need to plan for two things;• Proper security of your Bitcoins,• A contingency plan where your child or closest next of kin can still access the bitcoins should anything happen to you.With proper security, a hardware wallet is a safe option, with multiple backups in safe locations.You also need to learn how to generate your keys securely.On how to make the bitcoins accessible even if you're not there to release it, you could reveal the location of one of the backups to a trusted person, or utilize the locked transaction or locked address option, which makes the UTXO available to an address at a specified time in the future, this way, it cannot be accessed by anyone else now, but would be available to the person you any at a time in the future. You need to do your research and be sure you know what you're doing here",

      "body": "If you are asking whether investing in Bitcoin for the long term is good or not, I'd say that as long as you can take the risk it is worth it. While I believe Bitcoin will increase its value in the future, some people don't have the necessary capital or management to make sure they can avoid being destroyed by the bear market due to overinvesting or something similar. If that is what you're worried about, you can read more about dollar cost averaging or value cost averaging and make sure you follow your plan carefully. It is difficult to give you detailed suggestions since we don't know if you also invest in other things or just Bitcoin to prepare for your children's future IMO. The general rule is to make sure you can invest the amount you can afford to lose.For security or inheritance setup, there are many good threads about it here. I suggest you search and read about them. You can find discussion on time-locked transactions, multi-sig setup for inheritance purposes, or even find some service that provides custody for inheritance purposes. Although the latter is probably not the best option if you want complete control and don't want to rely on a third party who might or may not hold your money and use it without your consent. Are you familiar with hardware wallets, air-gapped devices, etc? Depending on how familiar or how eager you want to learn about them, your setup options can be flexible. CMIIW.",

And still keep on monitoring the price whenever you buy. Alongside of holding bitcoin also try to have atleast a small portion for  a emergency fund or educational fund for your child so if ever the price of bitcoin still isn’t that high at times you will need it, there is still a fund a alloted for his school or emergencies that needed a money readily.",

Nevertheless, you have made a good decision to invest in bitcoin, especially since the price is not high right now. I think it would be optimal for you to make BTC purchases 1 time per month.",

Bitcoin investment is not a big deal at the moment as it can happen after some years. Invest whenever you have less liability in your life in Bitcoin. Please understand you only need to invest what you can afford. At moment you cannot! Please focus on your child first and later think about Bitcoin.

If you are in an emergency situation then the buying price as in when you bought would not be the selling price you expected. This is a global market and you have to be patient if you intend to buy Bitcoin. Some of us have been holding our patience for a few years now.",

There are some things that you might wanna consider.Since you already said that you are aware of the risk of it, I guess you're good to go.As long as you will not lose your private keys that holds that Bitcoin or if you will not lose your hardware wallet in the span of probably 1-2 decades then I think there's nothing wrong about it. With this, you believe that Bitcoin will rise in value in the next 5-10 years. As for me, I already allocated a specific amount of Bitcoin that will be intended for my future child (I still don't have a child currently, but the earlier the better:)). Anyway, my opinion or suggestion for you is that, maybe you might wanna try to diversify into different assets like in dividend stocks if you are just doing it for your child. After all, the dividends that you can get into those stocks will help you in either your expenses or in your investment if you wanna re-invest it.",

I dont wish you bad but if you want the best for your kids you should teach them about crypto while you are still alive, what is the use of buying Bitcoin and when you are not here anymore they can't even sell. I think a better plan is to teach your woman first, just in case, you may not be around while your kids are still very small, teach a trusted adult like your wife, and when you live to see your kids grow you can teach them later. Whatever plans you have always think about when death comes knocking, no one lives forever and no one know when their time will be up.",

Yes of course Bitcoin will dump from time to time but that isn't something anyone who's into long term investment should be worried of. The risk for me for your kind of investment will be in the likelihood of you losing access to the wallet you will save the Bitcoin for your child through your own carelessness that will lead to either loss of password/PKey or wallet hack by a foreign body. Other than that, go ahead and invest in the future of your child. Bitcoin is a veritable investment.",
