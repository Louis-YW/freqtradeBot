  "content": "Well this happened to me multiple times, first I thought it's an issue with my BBCode, but I guess there is some issue with forum css.This happens when you add a table with an image in it. For example, I added the below table with an image in the first column.I did not specify height or width but still its shrinkingNow even if you try to put e.g. height=800 and width=800, still it will shrink.It's a small issue but still maybe theymos you need to check.I have noticed it's coming from below CSS of img.userimgCode:style.css:649img.userimg {    max-width: 100%; }or either thisCode:style.css:555div#bodyarea table.bordercolor td td td.td_headerandpost td:first-child {    width: 26px;}",
