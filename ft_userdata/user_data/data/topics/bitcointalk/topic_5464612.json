      "body": "I don't know how a game of monopoly fits your journey to accumulate 1 BTC. What I know for sure is that it's supposed to be just a simple process. First, if you want to accumulate 1 BTC, you need to have a work. You will have to earn before anything else and then acquire small amounts every now and then, self-custody your Satoshis in a safe wallet, and hodl until it reaches 1 BTC. That's probably it. Avoid any games in the process. Many have gotten into staking, trading, investing in altcoins to increase their worth in BTC, and so forth only to end up delaying their journey toward 1BTC. Worse, others are even moving backward as a result.",

      "body": "Your Monopoly analogy is a juvenile simplification of the actual mechanisms at work in the crypto world. Sure, its entertaining, but it barely scratches the surface. Accumulating 1 BTC starting with just $30 isnt child's play; its a battlefield of strategies, risk assessments, and constant adaptation.For starters, Monopoly is finite; cryptocurrency isnt. In Monopoly, you deal with a closed system with predictable outcomes based on chance and choice. Cryptocurrency is a complex, ever-evolving landscape that offers both opportunities and pitfalls. People arent just rolling dice here; they're actively manipulating the market, creating new coins, and altering existing technologies.So, if you really want to get to 1 BTC, dont just assemble all the red hotels; educate yourself on the technical aspects, market trends, and social influences that shape this ecosystem. Only then will your $30 perhaps, just perhaps, lead you closer to your 1 BTC target.",

To me getting to the mark of acquiring 1BTC requires planning and hard work because days are done when Bitcoin can be acquired cheaply. Currently, you can own Bitcoin by mining, buying, or earning. Mining Bitcoin is capital-intensive which means you have to save to buy the necessary equipment. You also need money to buy the coin from people or organizations that are willing to sell theirs. Some jobs give employees the option of receiving their pay in Bitcoin, if you have the necessary skills you can get such jobs and earn your coins. You can start with $30 but I will suggest that if you want to buy Bitcoin in lump sum you have to keep saving until you have some good amount. But if your are considering buying gradually in a consistent manner, you can consider using DCA method. But I encourage you to start planning to get to your goal of owning 1BTC because you can achieve it.",

Quote from: Thehallows on August 26, 2023, 02:08:13 AMImagine I'm aiming to accumulate 1 BTC, and all I have is $30 to start with. Let's assume you can save $30 a week, which is going to take a long time to accumulate 1 Bitcoin. If it was $30 a month it would be even worse. Using https://dcabtc.com/ we see that if you get to start about 6 and a half years ago or so today you would have 1 Bitcoin. But the price in the future will go up and it will cost much more to accumulate, so it will take you at the very least twice as long to accumulate 1 Bitcoin. Think that 6 years ago the price was 10 times lower. The good thing is not to get obsessed with round figures. If you start now and instead of accumulating a whole Bitcoin, let's say that in 5 years you have accumulated 0.1 Bitcoin instead of a whole 1 Bitcoin, the purchasing power of that amount will be considerable.",

If Bitcoin goes up in value it might take longer.~snip~There are also some sig campaigns that pay up to $200+ (even $250 per week), which means that theoretically it would be possible to earn 1 BTC in a little more than 2 years if the monthly amount was around $1000. Of course, considering that it is not forbidden to have alt accounts and participate with them in different sig campaigns, I think that some earn 1 BTC much faster than others.The OP is definitely not in that position because he doesn't have a sufficient rank to begin with, and I believe he doesn't have enough knowledge either. But that is no reason for him not to try to go in that direction as well, if he becomes active on the forum, he will surely learn a lot, and he will be given the opportunity to earn something along the way.",

Fun fact: it was developed a woman, Lizzie Magie, as a way to educate people on the negative aspects of monopolization and how focus on privatization of stuff is ultimately unfair to the public. Then a guy named Charles Darrow played it once at a friends' house and decided that, actually, there's a way to transform it into a positive game about capitalism and call it \"Monopoly\".Monopoly encourages buying land and property to win the game, basically encourages centralization of wealth and disregard for public good. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, something that is closer to the opposite of Monopoly as we know it today. So, to be honest, I think it's just ideologically too different to build a strategy of accumulating Bitcoin on this game.",
