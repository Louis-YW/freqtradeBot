It was for selling exploits on ebay. (wtf?) The dude did smarten up after going to jail for the first time. He knew it wasn't going to be his first and the last. That's why he dumped his US passport.Btw this is the first time I hear about Roger's mtgox story anyway. Even after all those years, he can still find a way to surprise me.As for Erik Voorhees, everybody knows he is a jerk...Let me make an addition to your list:Barry Silbert. (another ponzi runner behind the shadows)",

It was roughly $15k.https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2014/33-9592.pdfQuoteThe FeedZeBirds offering raised 2,600 bitcoins. At the time of the offering, 2,600 bitcoins were worth approximately $15,000. He raised much more through SatoshiDice, which is also mentioned in the above PDF.2. I don't like Ver but his biggest MtGOX related mistake was vouching for them in 2013 when they were having apparent solvency issues. Shrem served 15 months of his sentence which was for running an unlicensed money transmission business, which Ver did not.3. Popescu I'm not about to defend... It would appear he is actually dead so its hard to hold anything against him.The thing these 3 have in common is they all think (thought) they're too smart to be questioned. This infatigable sense of self-righteousness is quite common among the earliest of bitcoin adopters, and let's face it, this space has always attracted the not-so-morally-inclined. When conniving narcissists are rewarded with huge sums of money and validation, the result is never pretty.",

By his own admission, Ver owned stake in Shrem's Bitinstant.com AND coinlab.com. There's no excuse for him not catching charges other that somebody else that somebody else took the fall. He was equally guilty, if not more. He's doing it all over again selling unlicensed securities right now on bitcoin.com (that's another thread on it's own but here's a little sneak peak): Nearly nobody talks about that stuff but some of the now most prolific investors in the space made their fortune initially scamming the community. Well god knows what else and how deep the rabithole goes. What happened to all that Bitcoin Foundation moneyz? Holy shit, from that alone we could name DOZENS of people that became millionaires by offering NOTHING back to the community. To begin, Brock Pierce with his initial scam, savegox? You got it...",

It's a healthier mindset than tarring everyone in a certain category with the same brush.  *Some* early adopters were engaged in fraud.  Not all of them.Sounds as though you've already arrived at a conclusion and you're just looking for further confirmation to reinforce your existing biases.  Consider seeking alternative places to ask for help grinding your axe.  You'll quickly find this isn't a conducive place for that sort of thing.",

Ideally originating in this forum. You mentioned only three names, and you ask the question \"Are all early bitcoin millionaires fraudsters?\" That doesn't really make much sense to me, because with your post you are actually contradicting yourself. I think that today there are many more fraudsters than there were before Bitcoin was known, but that is now a matter of statistics or your personal impression.For me, fraudsters were people like John McAfee, Gerald Cotten, along with the recent Kwon and Bankman, although even Musk is not far from that crew, at least for those who believed in him while he was pumping their favorite altcoin.",

You managed to tell 3 names, lets assume it as 20 in total even if we name all the scammers who involved shady practice to make millions while 1000s of others became millionaires simply by HODLing. They bought bitcoins for few dollars and in next 5 years it worth millions.",
