In case you missed the live AMA or wish to review the entire set of questions, below is a full recap of the discussion. Thanks again to everyone who participated in the AMA. We’ll keep everyone posted when we’re set for the next one.Q1：Would you please introduce yourself to the chat and share a quick overview about Over?A: Hi All! I'm Diego DI Tommaso, COO and Co-founder of OVER. Over the reality is a platform to create a decentralized AR metaverse. Over the reality is a platform to create a decentralized AR metaverse. We connect digital assets to geographic locations. Just like decentraland but in AR, we divided the world in hexagons of 300 sqm mt mapped 1:1 to the physical world, if you own one of those (OVRLand) you can publish AR content on that geographic location.Use Cases range from gaming, to e-commerce, live events, art and much more,basically anything you can dream to create in augmented reality.Q2：Thank Diego for that quick introduction! How do you position the OVER platform? What do you think are OVER’s strengths and competitiveness compared to other similar products?Currently the biggest metaverses work on VR, our main focus is AR. In the AR metaverse space we're by far the biggest project with over 830k OVRLands sold to more than 29k owners. We have almost 900k users, 600k downloads of our app and 60k+ active monthly users of the app.Also in terms of technology we developed a system called map2earn that allows for scanning physical locations and has precision positioning both indoor and outdoor, no other crypto project has this capability.Finally I would add we have a huge market cap growth potential compared to decentraland and Sandbox.Q3：Can you make a brief introduction to your team? What is the current stage of the project or what’s the attraction so far? A：We're now a team of 35 full time employees + 10 people managing the social media channels. The two founders are me and Davide, we have extensive experience in IT and Business development, with experiences ranging from PwC consulting to working with IBM and other major technology companies. The project was launched in december 2020 but we started building it in 2018.On our website you can find a detailed roadmap of the development timelineAs mentioned before we're approaching the milestone of 1 mln registered users and our app available both for IOS and Android has been downloaded more than 600k times. One of our first released use cases is a treasure hunt with pokemon go style. With that usecase only we sent our users to more than 1.6 mln locationsQ4：Which big brands and celebrities have OVER partnered with? Are there any clues to upcoming partnerships?First celebrities we have been working with come from the world of football, we built an art gallery for Ibrahimovic for it's NFT launch and we're going to celebrate the Boateng marriage in the metaverse. Also we have several fashion brands on the pipeline that will release NFT clothes wearable by our avatars.Q5: What will be the most important strategic action in the next three months?A:First of all we will release the beta version of our map2earn feature allowing our community to earn OVR tokens by scanning physical locations with their phones. That is going to be an important job in our metaverse. We're going to further extend our cross-metaverse interoperability, already today if you own a sandbox NFT asset you're able to control it in AR on OVER. We're going to extend these capabilities to all of the actions of the characters, fight jump and so on, the vision is to bring cros-metaverse games on OVER. We're also going to integrate many other games and characters. Finally in the next 3-6 months we're also going to release Avatar AIs, you're going to be able to buy programmable brains for your avatar that will autonomously interact with users.Q6：For our community partners, this is a question they are very concerned about. What is the simplest way to take part  in OVER?A:Very easy, just download the app and start playing with our treasure hunt to earn OVR tokens and NFTs from other projects that are partnering with us. Test the AR experiences and the live eventsThan if you like it move on to buy some OVRland (very cheap starting from 10$ each) and start publishing in AR with our web builder of if you can code with our Unity SDKThere are some living questions from the chat below. Q: Is this your project only for elite investors, how about others with small funds, is it open to everyone?A:This project is open to everyone to invest we have no big funds that invested in us and are going to dump the token like it usually happensQ: Hi @DiegoDDT Does your project support staking programs? If yes. How does your stake system work? What is the requirement for users if they want to stake in your platform?A:Yes we have staking program that just got fully filled we're going to release a new one in the next 2 weeksQ:How can users stay updated with this project? Are there channels, including local communities where users can get the latest updates?A:Telegram is the best channelQ:Can you share with us your tokenomics? How much is the total and circulation supply of your tokens? Will there be a buy back system or token burning in the future?A:We already burned more than 2 mln tokens you can find the counter on the first page of our websiteQ:Too many projects promise magic but never release any working product or prove any revenue, Within a short/long time of release. Is your project also like this? If not can u tell us, What makes your project different from other projects?A: We're live since 15 months and we released a huge amount of developments, please check our roadmap on the website that includes also the past releases About OVER Over is an aggregator, a community using a real economic system that can revolutionize AR world-class experiences.
