No matter what, there will still be individuals that value these government jobs to any other job. Until there is a collapse of government, government jobs will continue to exist and be highly sort after. In my country for instance, some people go after government jobs because it pays well, reliable and permits a lackadaisical behavior to work, which gives them the opportunity to do other things, some other jobs soak up all of your time.",

I may not be totally correct but I think that in the future, the so-called government jobs will still be relevant because the would have either would have incorporated the different elements of crypto and Blockchain industry or they would have adopted it fully. The government will partner with those in the industry and we will see the creation of jobs in this space.  That is why it is important to skill up to prepare for what is coming.",

Yes, definitely.These two fields are different and there will always be that opportunity to come for both of it. While we see too many openings are coming for crypto related jobs, the government opportunities will remain to be there.But I hope that it won't come to a day that many people wouldn't fill those openings as the majority chooses to be self-employed.
