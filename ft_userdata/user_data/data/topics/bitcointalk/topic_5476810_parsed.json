      "body": "First, the format you use to report your scam is not correct. You need to use the right scam accusation format to make things easier. Secondly, you don't just need to believe whatever welcome note you see on a platform, be it a casino or any other platform that requires you to entrust them with your money. Always make time to go through their T&C and see what they say about your account registration, withdrawal, and deposit, and see if they truly do not care for KYC. I just did a quick search and found out that some other members of the forum have already figured out the KYC part and quoted it in a thread where someone asked for it. I will quote their terms and conditions for you to see where they clearly state they will request KYC.Quote from: https://justbit.io/policy/kyc/Know your customer (kyc)After registration process the User shall provide JustBit with valid identification information under these Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. The User shall undergo KYC procedure after completing the registration of User’s Account and:    Before first withdrawal of funds irrespective of the amount;    In case of a deposit for the sum equal to or exceeding 2000 euros or its equivalent in virtual currency;    In case of depositing in amount of 7 500 euros (or its equivalent in virtual currency) or more (by several installments) by the same User during a month.You can either give the KYC a try if you want to get your withdrawal out of there or you can let it go and don't hope on getting the money out. Maybe the previous withdrawals were not yet up to the amount where they requested KYC, and this your last request could be what clocks it up to that. Maybe that's the reason for the KYC request, just my guess.",

I would understand if it was large amount of money but its only the equivilant of $50 ish on each deposit in DOGEI have been lucky enough to make a few withdraws of around $200 from them plus another win which is now being KYCIts so obvious KYC has nothing to do with money laundering or fraud, who would try to do either with $50  It has everything to do with me winning so lets put a stop to that withdrawal..I mean I dont mind giving ID but giving ID to some random casino that can then be potentially used for fraud...The whole point in playing crypto is to get away from that endless circle of documentation and giving some random place enough details to steal your identity!!",

And will just go along with their \"excuse\"?You know what banners (no kyc) are for? Its just marketing gimmick, you should read other information more, they obviously have their kyc page[1] means that they ask for that, not mandatory though because you said you already got a successful withdrawal before. It only means that they have limit user overall withdrawals, and other stuff to required KYC. And isn't most casino asked KYC? You should know better than that, and ready yourself anytime a casino ask for it [1] https://justbit.io/policy/kyc",

Still banner on homepage \"No KYC for Crypto\", they are scammers and thievesI am not surprised. It's a clear message that they hate when you win and probably want to make your life hard on the platform until you abandon it. This is a common practice with some casinos, and I don't like it any bit.I prefer a casino that;1. Asks a client for KYC the very first moment they want to make a deposit if they are really serious about their KYC/AML Policies. Not only applying it when they make a win.2. Returns all the client's funds (deposits and winnings) and close the account if he refuses to perform KYC verification. Not using a client's funds as a ransom to acquire his KYC documentsCheck this thread: Casinos not asking for KYC to register and play, but do require it to withdraw",
