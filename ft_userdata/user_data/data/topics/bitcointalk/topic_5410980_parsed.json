  "content": "I have been in the crypto space since 2017. Ever since then I have only experience 1 hacked on my eth wallet back then I make use of myethwallet to create all my wallet and this wallet consist of a private key which I always safe guard with every means possible, my greatest mistake back then was saving my private key on my email which I think that's where my hijacked was from.. until when I bought a new PC which I was using peaceful until it developed a hardware problem which requires me to change my Hard-disk and new operating system was installed. I used my hand to install my browsers activate my my metamask, logged on to it and try to send out BNB from my metamask to my Binance Receiving address. I just copied my address as usual from my Binance and pasted it on my metamask and authorize the transaction. After 30 minutes of the transaction i decided to check if the coin has actually arrived, but nothing was showing on my account. I went back to the transaction hash and check the address which received the BNB and I realized it was an address which I have never seen in my life. The hackers address (0xbed9dA8f130aCC29F2580df183F3995eff78fb4D) I later went to Google and searched for the address and I realized this kind of scam/spam has been in existence for years and I just happened to know about it after I lost my crypto.  Saw a post about the virus which was post on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/mlvqd0/clipboard_virus/Don't know how the hackers were able to get to my pc. All I know is that any address I copy which is similar to eth address automatically change to that of the hacker. I don't know if any one here have experience anything similar to that. I stopped using my pc to run bsc/eth transaction until I was able to solve the issue and everything was fine again . If anyone is also having same issue you can follow the Instructions from the article below and get ride of it. https://www.2-spyware.com/remove-clipboard-virus.htmlEven as I am sure the virus is off my pc, I still cross check my wallet about 3 good times before I execute any transaction again. Can't allow the mistake to repeat it's self.",

Hackers are on rampage so one need to be extra careful to protect your devices from being cloned by hackers.",

That would be so traumatic in my end knowing that I sent it to the \"hacker's address\".This was the thread that I was referring by the way : How to lose your Bitcoins with CTRL-C CTRL-V",

I have been years using my PC and my laptop but I have never encountered this clipboard malware infection, maybe I'm just being careful downloading unknown sources, especially those that are not safe to download.However, to avoid this a simple action might be to check the address before sending if you copied the right address the 3 digits from the start and 3 digits at the end of the wallet address that you wanted to change, double or triple check would be better.",

My hunch is that this is how you got your clipboard hijacker virus, that is, if you're sure you've never clicked on links that you received in your emails, social media, or any online messaging apps. I advise you to visit official service centers rather than ordinary PC repair shops. I don't know where you're from but in my place, repair shops normally use crack or unofficial versions of softwares downloaded from unofficial sources. And, worse, they also update these crack versions. This is usually what you get from wanting to have things for free or dirt cheap.",

I guess it's not directly from Microsoft most of the Computer/Laptop repair centers here in my country use Windows OS from other sources and use Activator like KMSauto to bypass or to activate the Windows license. Which I think is the reason why the newly installed OS is being infected with the clipboard virus.

If it's not a genuine copy, most likely it came from a pirated website for which the developers of those pirated Windows copy have a backdoor that  was able to insert you the clipboard virus/malware.IIRC, I've seen it somewhere and that's why it is advisable to get a genuine copy. Aside from that, there could be some apps that were downloaded that contained the malware. It's either of the two and there's really a source for it because if there's none, you won't get that clipboard virus.",

This virus seems to be coming from an app I've downloaded. It seems that they inserted a virus, and strangely, the application I installed did not even appear in the list of applications. At that time, I had a video editing task, so I downloaded Videopad.It looks like this virus is sticking to Chrome like AddOns. I tried to delete it but it always came back. Finally, I reinstalled Windows to get rid of the virus. What is certain is that we have to check again when copying and pasting the wallet address, so one of the cars avoids clipboard viruses.",

Don't trust anyone, learn to install the OS yourself because it's not something that requires great expertise - and you can download W10 from the official Microsoft site, and (if nothing has changed) use it for free with some minor restrictions. Furthermore, do not base your security on any desktop hot wallet, and you should also be careful about which websites you visit and what you download to your computer.In addition to all that, it would be good if you have one of the better (paid) AV, because maybe just such software will protect you from computer infection in a moment of carelessness. Last but not least, do not save your wallet backup in digital form if it is not protected (encrypted), it is a big risk and you should avoid it.",
