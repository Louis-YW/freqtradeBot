If cryptocurrency mining is legal in your state, I see no reason to be in doubt.how mining hardware requires a higher degree of cleanliness, It is to be expected that the owners will keep the whole area tidy. otherwise, it is like any other business.",

      "body": "The previous post got it pretty good:* it depends on the prices in your area* it depends on what other offers you get or you can get (COVID is over, businesses may slowly start expanding, but it may be slow)* it depends on the legal status of bitcoin mining in your place* it depends on the electricity contracts/status in relation with mining in your area (I'm not so much technical, but I'd guess that electricity still has to be bought)* I don't know whether the noise is or not a problemThere are plenty of things you know / you have to think about. Ah, and it also depends on how badly and fast you need the money too.Really, it's not so much of advice we could give - whether the offer is good or bad - since it depends greatly on local things.And although the answer is imho completely irrelevant (I don't live in America), I'll still give it:I would probably accept the offer, since it would mean I'd almost double my monthly income.",

After all they are the ones running a mining operation in his building, so it's only fair if they pay for stuff like electricity and taxes. OP only pays for building maintenance (and building insuranse but that's strictly it).But that is where it gets tricky.Mining is a lot more abusive on equipment then being a warehouse.I don't know what this building has for cooling but most units that were not setup for data center use are not rated for 24/7/365 use that will shorten their life.Same for transformers. It's usually 75% (IIRC might be a bit lower) of rated for 24/7 above that their lifespan drops.In most places the building owner is responsible for the bills if the tenant leaves without paying. They bail on 60 days of unpaid power you have to pay it.And so on. As with everything YMMV and the local rules will vary on location but having people in the family and friends that own commercial property it's not always that simple.Hell in the building down the block from where I work there was a business leasing space that managed to skip out on close to $150000 of gas and electric. They were using about $40000 a month so it was only a little over 100 days but still a staggering number since the landlord was only collecting $30000+CAM+taxes for rent. -Dave",
