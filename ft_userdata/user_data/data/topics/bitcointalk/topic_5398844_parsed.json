Any incompatibility would've resulted in a failed transaction and in no circumstances would Electrum initiate a transfer to any other addresses for you. It is natural that you can see the funds with a watch-only wallet because the funds aren't moved from that address but you won't be able to spend it without the key.The only two plausible reasons would be either you forgot about a transaction that you've made or if your wallet is compromised, with the latter being far more likely.",

If one recovered your wallet on any device in the world, he could easily spend your funds (i.e. transfer them under his control).It doesn't matter the money stays on that specific wallet address. If it's not an address under your control, or, even easier, if it's a transaction you didn't do, then your money is stolen.Quote from: novamims on May 16, 2022, 09:39:24 AMhow i can check this address if are not mine ?In Electrum, go to Console tab (you may need to View->Console) and type:Code:ismine(\"bc1q4tjunthvhp6c6hqun6yylvy0hewqp4fkgpplde\")",

There is nothing like address is not compatible, you can send bitcoin from any bitcoin address type which starts from 1, 3 or bc1, you can also receive bitcoin from any of the listed bitcoin address type. You just need to be careful of malware and attackers, including people around you which can compromise your wallet.You will find the OP of this thread interesting: Good topics on security and privacy",
