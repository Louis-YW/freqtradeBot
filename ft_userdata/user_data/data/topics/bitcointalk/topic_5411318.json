  "content": "INTRODUCTION There is no doubt in the fact that exchange and other Bitcoin payment gateways have contributed 80% to Bitcoin adoption globally and 150% in African countries.This thread is aimed at the contribution of cryptocurrency exchange and payments gateways in Africa a case study of Nigeria and the Central Africa Republic.                                 THESIS1: NIGERIAThe impact of cryptocurrency exchange and other Bitcoin payment gateway in cryptocurrency adoption in Africa and Nigeria the African most populous country and biggest economy in Africa, which rank the highest in cryptocurrency trading and highest in Bitcoin adoption majorly among the youths. Even though the Nigerian central bank stopped banks from providing Bitcoin-related services, exchanges like Binance and other payment gateways like Luno, Patricia, and Remitano have continually provided a platform for Nigerians to get involved with Bitcoin trading which participates in a reduction in youth dependency on the government thereby reducing the impact of unemployment on the youths and the government as a large number of employable youths now find alternative sources of income in Bitcoin trading and other cryptocurrency businesses.2: CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLICThe Central Africa Republic is the second country to make Bitcoin a legal tender second to el Salvador and has a relatively positive mindset towards Bitcoin and the invention surrounding Bitcoin development and how to work around it to see more economic and alternative financial ecosystem that will allow small and large scale businesses in the country.The country has a low internet penetration of about 11% and a low electricity supply of about 14% this factor has made the economic conditions of the citizens to be below the poverty level, and have turned to a global economic tool like Bitcoin as an alternative. And mostly the unemployed youths are largely involved in Bitcoin trading on major cryptocurrency exchanges and p2p platform.",

But just that they are centralized exchanges, which means you don't have total control over your funds, but yet the best and reliable way to start your crypto journey for people living in these part of African region (Nigeria & Central African Republic)",

The drastic fall of Nigerian currency led to an increase in the adoption of cryptocurrencies because people began to use them as a hedge against inflation. Also, in Nigeria their are restrictions on bank transfers. Customers are restricted to withdraw more than a certain a amount. If one want to exceed the limit, a certain percentage of the excess must be heavily fined.",

I quite agree with you that exchanges aren't all that perfect since themselves looks centralized and the sole aim of bitcoin is decentralisation. But currently it's the best way to exchange your coins to fiat, because the issue of P2P is very risky. To embark on it one has to fully trust the other partner or better still look for an escrow. Sometimes these escrows team up with the other partner to scam people of either there coin or fiat. I have being a victim of such circumstances. So currently the I only do give advice of Binance and its like to people. But if at all there are better P2P with trusted escrows I would love your suggestions on them",
