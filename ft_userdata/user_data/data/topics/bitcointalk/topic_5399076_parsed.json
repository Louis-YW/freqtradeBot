The suspect seems to recycle their whitepaper from the old projects to the new ones, which... the original WP itself is copying from other sources [see screenshot section below]. Basically, they create a project, abandoned it after a few days, and made another one, an exact copy, with different name. So if Cryptokool001 said they're just hired to be a CM, they did an extremely awful job of DD because they can't even spot plagiarized materials which an exact copy of the project they previously moderated. With that said, I think it is safe to rule out the old \"I'm not part of team\" excuse.Second, rug pull. 2 out of 12 of their projects telegram group are no longer available, and the others were not so good, with months of gaps in between chat, all were only made by the team because they limit their members from writing on the group, most likely to prevent people asking something like this:Quote from: hippon on February 06, 2022, 10:30:30 AMhello alltell everyone this is a scamwe can't sell the tokens on pancakeswap after buyingthese men are scammers!!which wouldn't be too far fetched to think that the latest and the ones that is yet to come will also be a quick money grab before they abandoned their TG group. Departing from this opinion, I think I am not too harsh to the suspect if I raised a newbie-warning flag against them, and hopefully people will support to activate it.Flag raised: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=2963 Some screenshot for easy view:",
