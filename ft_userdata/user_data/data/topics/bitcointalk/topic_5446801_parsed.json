As for the ETC I mentioned above, I don't believe it can do more than 2 or 4x of the current price.If you provide more info about the coins you choose, you can make this thread more relevant I confess that I know almost nothing about these coins you mentioned: Ironfish and Prasaga",

      "body": "Yeah we have been there in 2015. Most don't remember or went around but GPU mining was a mess. The only way to make a decent profit back then was to wait for some promising coin to hit the Announcement Section, and as soon as it launched you would instamine it while difficulty was low. And usually 25-50% of those coins were listed on Poloniex or Bittrex back then.And you pretty much sold the top when it launched and rinse and repeat. Only way to make money back then. So many turned off their rigs or they went with BTC ASICs instead. Back then many bought the SP20e or Antminer S5 and they mined, profits were not that great however.",

That removes the gambling aspect of holding a coin that’s sole purpose is to pump and hope to sell for more later. This really depends though.I also think that is a good idea for people who are in only for Bitcoin and this is a great way to little by little get some amount every day with our mining rigs.This was very popular in 2018 and since then the popularity has come on the decrease because of making better crypto rewards by mining directly the coin we are interested.The gambling side of it can be removed easily now as there are wallets that support at least 500 hundred cryptos and have a built in exchange with low fees,like Atomic wallet for example which if the user wants he can convert to Bitcoin as soon as he makes the minimum amount to do so.",

Kaspa price +800% since the beginning of the year, it is hard not to hear about such a coin. And this is a bear market.At such a time, it is profitable to mine such coins, because their price can go up a lot or video card manufacturers want to pump up the prices of coins for mining. I switched my graphics cards to mining Nexa.",
