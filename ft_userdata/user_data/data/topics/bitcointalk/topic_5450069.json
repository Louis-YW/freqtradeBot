All they did was release this video:https://www.weforum.org/videos/this-start-up-catches-waste-methane-to-power-data-centres, which doesn't even mention Bitcoin (unless I missed it), but the featured company is engaged in Bitcoin mining.So it's only a praise for utilising a waste gas (such as methane) that can be converted into cheap energy.WEF's have previously made negative statements on crypto mining and are demanding strict crypto regulations. I don't think this video is a sign of a change of heart.",

Full Article : https://crypto-economy.com/world-economic-forum-recognizes-the-benefits-of-bitcoin-mining/ I don't think that they will ever change their mind to favor Bitcoin. After watching the whole video I haven't found anything regarding promotion or support of Bitcoin mining. It was basically showing that how can we transfer that renewable energy that comes from wastes into energy that we can use to run data centers.Their initiative is a positive step for data centers but I don't think that WEF will ever promote any firms that are going to favor Bitcoin or its mining. Their mindset won't allow them to accept the mining as a possible way to utilize wasted energy into something as good as Bitcoin.",

On Crusoe Energy's part, would they have even mentioned Bitcoin mining even if it wasn't a WEF video they are making? I also doubt.There is actually nothing very special about this. This is neither a metanoia on the part of the WEF nor an effort of Crusoe Energy to somehow spread awareness about Bitcoin mining turning green. This is far from recognizing the benefit of Bitcoin mining.",

Full Article : https://crypto-economy.com/world-economic-forum-recognizes-the-benefits-of-bitcoin-mining/ There's nothing positive and nothing to be excited about. Rather WEF again tried to prove that bitcoin mining is harmful for the environment and shared an example on how to minimise the impact. WEF is definitely not praising the bitcoin mining industry. It is rather showing ways on how the carbon footprint from bitcoin mining can be reduced by moving to sustainable energy source. That's it! WEF doesn't care much about economical impact.",

Full Article : https://crypto-economy.com/world-economic-forum-recognizes-the-benefits-of-bitcoin-mining/ That's a very positive news, hopefully it will signal a change in WEF's narrative regarding Bitcoin. Interestingly enough, it had no effect on the price of Bitcoin, even though it was tweeted by Michael Saylor. At the same time, personalities like Elon Musk seem to ignore it. Not sure why he keeps ignoring the positive side of Bitcoin mining and only point out the negative aspects (Elon balls deep in doge?).",

Because Crusoe Energy is a partner of WEF. They're probably not ashamed of Bitcoin mining, of course-- there's money from it, after all-- but they have to walk on eggshells because \"Crusoe is part of the World Economic Forum's innovator communities.\"[1] It is telling why despite the WEF being largely composed of Bitcoin critics, they chose Crusoe to be featured.  Is Bitcoin mining their main source of income? It doesn't seem so. Try dropping by their official website and it appears they didn't even mention Bitcoin mining, even in their Values and Mission, except perhaps in a number of the many articles featuring them which they linked.

Full Article : https://crypto-economy.com/world-economic-forum-recognizes-the-benefits-of-bitcoin-mining/ As a firm believer and bitcoin advocate, I have for the longest of time preached about the numerous benefits of bitcoin mining for our environment especially using alternative energy sources, contrary to the arguments of the anti-bitcoin mining folks. When I first saw Michael Saylor's tweet about it, I remembered all the so-called articles written against bitcoin mining and the false energy consumption. However, after reading this WEF article , I think it is a win for us as it is a step towards global awareness of bitcoin. I recall mentioning on this thread that using biomass, solar, wind, and geothermal energy for bitcoin mining is both cost effective and has little to no impact on the environment.",

They SHOULD be taken seriously. WEF, like it or not, is a powerful organisation. It's not just a bunch of bored guys who meet up once a year for no particular reason just to talk about nothing. They're pretty overt with their agenda and most countries seem to be following it.Here's an incomplete list of politicians that graduated the \"Global Leaders of Tomorrow\" WEF's program, compiled by Malone's Institute: https://maloneinstitute.org/wef that gives some idea of the scale of their influance.To quote K. Schwab, WEF's Chairman: \"What we are very proud of, is that we penetrate the global cabinets of countries with our WEF Young Global Leaders\"",
