  "content": "The rise and fall of TerraUSD (UST) has shown us that algorithmic stablecoins aren't as ready for the world as we've thought they would be. If the UST collapse didn't happen, people would've still trusted algorithmic stablecoins with their money. Now that things are different, developers may need to re-think their strategy in order to make such stablecoins shine once again. If done right, algorithmic stablecoins could prove to be the \"holy grail\" of decentralized finance. It would mean having a stablecoin that's not backed by real world reserves (in Fiat) whatsoever. I think algorithmic stablecoins will prove to be even more decentralized than collaterized stablecoins such as DAI or USDJ.What are your thoughts? Will algorithmic stablecoins have a future? If not, why? What do you think will be governments' response against stablecoins that are decentralized by design? Will they make them illegal for mainstream use? Or will they embrace them? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

This is the worst stable token in the crypto history, this is also triggering a huge dump to the market.Decentralized in the sense that's entirely driven by algorithms. It isn't based on real world reserves, making it the perfect \"tool\" for decentralized finance. Trusting a collaterized stablecoin (even if it's claimed to be decentralized by the issuer) is no different than trusting a third party (someone correct me if I'm wrong). Algorithmic stablecoins are practically new to the industry, so it's going to take some time before they're perfected. With the UST collapse, I'm confident developers will improve other algorithmic stablecoins for the better.Quote from: shinratensei_ on June 01, 2022, 03:16:38 PMThis kind of stable token will have no future. UST has proven that if algorithmic stable token was a failed experiment. Should we revive it again? this is just another disaster for anyone.I think it's still too early to tell that algorithmic stablecoins are a complete failure. After all, they're just starting to blossom. There's high hopes developers will continue working on such coins in order to improve them for the better. With better algorithmic stablecoins, decentralized finance apps will take the world by storm. The possibilities are endless. Who knows what the future holds for these new kinds of stablecoins? Just my thoughts",

I am sure that soon there can be some creative people who can devise ways and means to avoid the historic collapse of UST but am sure that they may not be getting the support they can be looking for...as of now we are all doubting any other stablecoins in the same category. This can be a very sad story but there is nothing we can do about it...but to move on and start to rise from the ashes.",

But it was able to run smoothly because of the confidence of investors to hold the stablecoin. The bad image of stablecoins has been shown by TerraUSD with a value not equivalent to USD. And USDT has added very high supply, but we can't confirm that Tether has USD reserves according to USDT supply. If investors throw it away, of course this will happen the same thing as TerraUSD. Tether to maintain a good position in CMC simply by adding USDT supply. If we look at the current value of min $0.0006 of USD. Even though it's a small number, it shows the inequality between USDT and USD.Not to mention we are talking about market cap with supply circulation which has different numbers. If the value is equal, then the market cap must of course be the same as the circulating supply. Of course this cannot be the same, because the buy order must of course be below the sell order. As I said in a post on another topic, USDT should not be paired with USD to maintain equal value.Perhaps we rarely highlight stablecoins that have a country's Fiat equivalent in value. That's worse than USDT or USDC or dollar stablecoins.",

      "body": "Algorithmic stablecoins are a false concept. In fact, the value of currency fluctuates tidalally, and this tide comes from people's approval and veto. Even gold cannot escape this law. Therefore, rather than using \"algorithms\" for \"stabilization\", it is more about attracting \"herds\" for \"stabilization\". So, how to attract the \"herd\"? We can see that whether it is UST or USDD, they are attracting people's convergence with high interest payments.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5400154.msg60220935#msg60220935As I said in this post, the biggest mistake of UST is the 20% super high interest rate of the anchor. But when we look back, maybe, it wasn't a mistake, it was probably DK's intention. He knew the pattern he had created would not last, and he looked forward to rug.In fact, if we stick to the current model of algorithmic stablecoins, we're going to be in a ridiculous cycle. On the one hand, we entered the crypto world because of our natural distrust of the real-world financial system. On the other hand, we are still expecting the real-world financial system to firmly accommodate stablecoins in the crypto-world.This leads to another larger question, and that is the definition of cryptocurrencies: Are they currencies or securities? Except for Bitcoin, I think all cryptocurrencies will be afraid to answer this question. Because this question points to the nature of the crypto world, which is them, is it a giant bubble?Currently, I am rewriting an article based on the last discussion on algorithmic stablecoins, and I look forward to having more discussions with you.",
