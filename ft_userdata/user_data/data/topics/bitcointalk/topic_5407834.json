  "content": "FirstQuoteBitcoin girl. Just to let you know I never used duelbitsAnd I have a question for you did you read the OP last posts ? When he said he. Found a bug and used it won 1btc using the Bug and withdraw it 16k still there.If you read that post and still defending op and his scam then you have a problem too.  Beside that in other posts he lied he said he never done a thing wrong. But today dramatically the story changed to him using a bug and already took 1btc. Even added his mother to drama since he lied before I doubt his mother story also right.If you defending a scammer who also admitted to scam and liesPlease stop posting in this forum then. Since you no different than him https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405780.msg60635524#msg60635524I already sent you a PM.Apology that I did not read OPs last post. \"Some users are clearly defending duelbits \" was not intending to you too. It was specifically intended to user JollyGood. It seems he was happy with your response and appreciated with a merit which proves a point for me. You could be a bit nice in your response but it's okay, I apology from my end.I was following jollyGood and found that it's annoying how he conduct any scam accusations against individuals or company. He always comes from a suspicious perspective enjoys to create unnecessary imaginary arguments against the individual possibly he does not like or against a company which he possibly use to increase his reputation. The way the OP of that topic created the scam accusation with evidences (obviously until his last post it was not clear who was at the wrong side) it was hard to take a side even though duelbits was able to gain huge reputation in the forum over the years. But JollyGood seemed took the job of advocating for Duelbits not only in that thread but also in other thread too which obviously does not go alone with the JollyGood image. That's all for you aew.Second for JollyGood, I tried to reach out via PM but unfortunately you did not feel to respond me. So let's conduct it here. Would you explain the feedback you left for user starmyc and nemgun? JollyGood    2018-09-20    Reference    starmyc is a very difficult coder to deal with. I made the mistake of paying him in advance to make an Ethereum and Ripple key generator. When I asked for the source code he declined asking for more money. If I did not get the source code I would have to go back to him for every small tweak I wanted to make and therefore he would ask for more money again and again.With all the delays he took in completing my work and then getting stuck on the Ripple part working with Ubuntu I was not happy but gave him the benefit of the doubt. It was when he deleted my access to Gitlab and when he was getting work from other sources that he delayed my work because he did not know how to prioritise.I am very disappointed with starmyc. Please avoid working with him, there are plenty of good coders around so please use somebody else.I learned a big lesson, never pay in advanced, I should have paid after receiving the source code. I just read his negative feedback for me, he is lying because he never gave me the source code.  JollyGood    2019-11-05    Reference    BEWARE OF NEMGUN - do not trust himHe was a senior member of the team that scammed investors out of $millions in the NVO scam. Do not invest in anything he promote as you will probably end up losing it. I did not contact with nemgun but I took the time to ask starmyc and following was his response.Quote from: starmyc on July 17, 2022, 01:34:57 PMHello,No, not at all, despite the really low cost of the work done. He took the stuff, and even asked me for a refund for a previous work.I recommend not working with him, or asking to be paid using a third party and really well defined & trackable requirements to not get cheated on.Regards.",

Another drama on the reputation section.I quite like this section but sometimes it seems the gossip section.For the time being, I am going to remain neutral with respect to Jollygood.As for the Duelbits case, I comment here what I think, since the thread is locked. If a casino has a bug, it's the casino's fault, and if someone discovers it and makes money from the bug, he has every right to do so. In a lawsuit the casino would have everything to lose, and so it happened with some poker players, mathematicians by profession, who found imperfections in the roulette wheels of physical casinos around the world and took advantage of it.",

It's a problem for a casino which hasn't made it's name yet but when a casino earn a reputation we respect their decision because of their long term loyalty to their clients. From that perspective I have no problem with the decision Duelbits made (In fact they didn't close the case, JollyGood closed it on behalf of them). QuoteSince Duelbits did nothing wrong and a malicious claim was made against them, this thread should be locked. The claim made against Duelbits by the OP has no ground or merit. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405780.msg60635599#msg60635599But in a scam accusation against any service or person without knowing both side of the story I can not advocate for a side. On the thread until the OP admitted the bug it was impossible to know OPs accusations were wrong. Even Duelbits were not sure otherwise it would not take them a month to investigate. But we saw JollyGood was always advocating for Duelbits as he was protecting them. Judging from his nature it was a completely different behavior by him. If this was against any other casino then he would harass the casino.Hhampuz seemed pissed because they were taking unnecessary timeIt worried yahoo62278examplens was worried tooThen we hear a response from Duelbits. Case in ongoing investigation and it was the only response from them. But as you will see our friend JollyGood was always trying to calm the OP as if he knew nothing could go wrong with Duelbits. All it for $70 a week? It seems JollyGood will advocate for anyone if they pay which is obviously very dangerous (in the past, I was in a signature campaign. I used to get request from campaign manager and other participants to advocate for them. I could not do it a single time in the specified threads and eventually I was removed form it. By the way, I am not regretting for it but using an example). The completely different approaching from JollyGood  leads me to suspect his motive of scam busting all these days. Although now a days he lures from 1xbit. All are aware, they are scam so there are no additional work is necessary to hammer them all the time. Could we consider JollyGoods intention is to make a good name, earn trust and then finally dump a huge scam? We have many examples including Master-P. It always make me worry when I see a user is too focused to make a name. Have people checked the positive feedback sent by JollyGood to the users who already have their names established? I am not saying the feedback are wrong but these were not necessary too. The only possible outcome is to receive a positive back.I am still waiting to know about the feedback he left for starmyc and nemgun. starmyc received another feedback from AdolfinWolf which clears that starmvc possibly is not that JollyGood explained. AdolfinWolf    2018-03-30    Reference    This user has set up a script for me. Very polite and extremely professional.Went out of his bounds to explain to me what he did, and always responded extremely quickly in clear terms and good english.

Can highly recommend dealing with him..https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/bff13fb4819fbd5e4ce04642e0db1aec12f1d8c31b4659f341c2ce7cb3637132",

I feel like some things are a blanket term that gives a casino outs to take a large win away from a player. I do agree too. Terms are like we reserve the right to confiscate any winning, we reserve the right to cancel any bet and many more one sided terms are to protect their business. I am not sure legally a company really can say it. But we all understand, casino makes money out of the loss from their clients. They are happy when customers lose money and worried when they win. They ensure everything is in right place to make as much as they can.QuoteMultiple accounts is bullshit.

They usually can not check every customer one by one because it's almost impossible to continue with the volume of clients. They set some flags especially when a client request a withdrawal. The algorithm of the flag alerts them when something is not right. That's when they act.QuoteWhen sites are getting their games from a 3rd party like the slots on most casinos, sites have to wait for a response from the provider if there is an issue. 3 weeks plus seems a bit nutty to me.

They will do everything not in good intention but to pocket revenue.Leaving a red feedback to starmyc could be a well attempt to justify not to pay him for the work, leaving unnecessary positive feedback to others also indicates that making a good reputation is the intention.",

Everyone of us act to a proven scam. If anyone speaks in favor of proven scam there is problem but you should not leave red tag for something that has not happened yet. Your tag damage the business. A red tag sent wrongly damage the motivation of a member who wanted to have a pleasant journey in the community. Honesty is something I only know. I can well use the honesty as a way for me to make a place for me. We don't know the real motive but a person who are always too harsh to leave red tag and too suspicious in everything, how do they took it as guaranteed for a casino they are promoting was clear until it was proven. My problem is there. If OP of that accusation was not admitting the exploit than the case still would continue and JolllyGood may still continue defending (from the history of his involvement). Clearly the weekly payment took a part in the changed behavior. So honesty, possibly something you are seeing that he wants you to see.

If there are obvious red flags and valid reasons, You personal judgment (when wrong) should not damage others reputation.This point has given me food for thought recently and I think it is the subject of a thread on its own. I agree with Stalker22, I prefer to red tag someone when I have clear suspicions even if I don't have hard evidence rather than wait for the scam to happen and red tag then.I did so in two recent cases: Royse777 and Shaker_finance. In the case of Royse777 I red tagged her and supported the flag when many people didn't want to due to previous reputation. I was seeing that Bitlucy could be a clear exit scam and she was involved. Something had to be done to try to put pressure on her to fix the problem. When the scam had already happened, it was when many in DT supported the flag and red tag her. The red tag should be used if you think that trading with that person is high risk, and here there is a component of subjectivity, which should be minimal.In any case, if I'm wrong, I can change the red tag and nowadays it doesn't hurt anyone to have a red tag for two or three days until things become clearer. If negative feedback is only used to tag someone when they have already scammed, then it is useless.",

I quote from starmycQuoteHe took the stuff, and even asked me for a refund for a previous work.There were two jobs. The first one was paid and supplied. He must be talking about the 2nd one. JollyGood took the 2nd work but since he was not happy, he even asked for refund for the first work. starmyc obviously is conducting a business in the forum (from the stuffs in his signature). You and me know JollyGood leaves feedback for no serious reasons but it is not necessary for his potential clients to know who is what in the forum. They will see the feedback from JollyGood, starmyc lose his potential clients.Read (including the quoted message of JollyGood) where I am coming from for nemgun: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5195361.msg52985918#msg52985918I don't think it's justified to keep him tagged. JollyGood even decided to block his PM LOL",

It is not useless because it prevents others from falling into the same trap, but as it works what happens is that if you wait for someone to scam to tag him, what usually happens is that after being tagged he disappears from the forum. But I will rephrase that by saying that it would be more useful if it served to prevent the initial scam. Btw, why JollyGood has not defended himself in this thread?",

It's more of ego than giving a good reason. If this is the reason then it's obviously a childish which questions his mental stability. If someone is too childish to accept constructive criticism then how would you trust his feedback left from left to right, everywhere. Feedback system is not for children. It's for adults. Ignoring PM, ignoring public calls question his self-confidence.Quote from: Poker Player on August 03, 2022, 04:08:23 AMBut I will rephrase that by saying that it would be more useful if it served to prevent the initial scam. As long as you are right it prevents but if you are wrong then you are accountable for the damage you made to the account.",
