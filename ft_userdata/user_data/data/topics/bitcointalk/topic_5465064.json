In other words, what type of taxation am I subject to?Intuition says there is no tax, for this is not income, is this true?Taxation policies are not uniform in all the countries. Every country has its tax policies and calculations. It will be better to seek the advice of a tax officer in your location to determine how crypto taxes are calculated and paid in your country. In some countries, the exchange acts as a tax collector for the government. In that case, the tax is added to the transaction charges and the tax will be remitted to the government. These links of Coinbase about understanding crypto taxes might help. https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/understanding-crypto-taxes#:~:text=If%20you're%20holding%20crypto,you%20have%20a%20taxable%20event.https://www.coinbase.com/learn/your-crypto/understanding-capital-gains",

In other words, what type of taxation am I subject to?Intuition says there is no tax, for this is not income, is this true?Depends. As Fiatless says taxation is relative to the country you live in, but I can tell you that, in general, if you have received that amount of Bitcoin for work you have done, it should be subject to income tax. Also if when you sell it you obtain a profit with respect to the fiat countervalue at the time you were paid for the work done, it would also be subject to capital gains tax. The same applies if you simply bought it. If you make a profit on it when sold, it is subject to capital gains tax.But as said this may vary depending on your tax residence, and there are for example minimum exemptions or other exemptions that may apply.",

P2P exchange. The user uses his own money to buy Bitcoin on the Bisq P2P exchange for $10,000, then sells Bitcoin via bank transfer for $11,000. So, the tax office will most likely consider $11,000 as income, although you earned $1,000.Therefore, in financial transactions you need to study tax and criminal laws first.",

The procedures and guidelines to enforce the tax is being worked upon by the Federal Inland Revenue (FIR) and Joint Task Board but my guess is, it will be through centralized exchanges that have the jurisdiction to operate in my country.

In my country there is a concept of \"tax agent\". My employer performs this function and submits an income tax return for me and withholds tax from the salary, which he then transfers to the tax bank account. If every citizen did this on their own, but it is unprofitable to administer some taxes, because the costs for all actions will be more expensive than the tax itself.But it’s easier to work with a salary, because it is paid several times a month, but how to check traders who have thousands of transactions on crypto exchanges?And if the trader does not agree with the decision of the tax inspector and goes to court? What if a thousand traders go to court? The system collapsed.On the exchange, traders go through the KYC procedure and the exchange can withhold tax depending on the citizenship of the trader.This system is also not perfect, but it saves a lot of time and money for the government.",

We declare the earnings from the signature campaigns as income tax, depending on the country we also register as self-employed for it (no matter if you have another job) then every time we pay with bitcoin even if it is $20 we have it well noted to declare it in next year's income because it is a taxable event and if when you spent that $20 the price of Bitcoin was higher than when you collected it from the signature campaigns, or you bought it or got it in another way, you will have to pay taxes for it. Then we also pay taxes for every exchange we make in the currency exchange section, which you can sometimes see in feedback trusts \"I exchanged 100USDT for his Bitcoin, he went first.\"And let alone everything that moves in the gambling section, which is obviously also all declared as it should be. Only a few clueless people like the OP and a few heartless people do not fulfill these obligations, but I would say that the majority of the forum does.",
