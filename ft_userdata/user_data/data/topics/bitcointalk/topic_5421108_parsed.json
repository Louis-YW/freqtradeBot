  "content": "I encountered this yesterday; I'm not sure if it was a general issue or if my source merit was confined to a specific board/post. I wanted to merit a post, and this is what appeared; I went back to another post and was able to merit it, then returned to that same post and was unable to merit it. Has anyone else had this experience before? Is it something normal?N/b; its been 12hr and its still not working.When one is out of smerit and i still want to merit a post it shows like this (current i have 0 smerit) so definitely there was a problem with the first one screenshot.quick one; ApllicationQuotetheymos I need source merit. I know this isn't the proper way to apply, but there's nothing wrong with giving it a shot when you're feeling brave. It's difficult to combat spam and not be able to merit a merit worthy post when I come across one. I'm not sure what qualities I need to have to become a merit source, but I pledge to continue distributing to quality posts as I have/am doing. I've been getting messages about post-reviews that I never asked for, and I've been doing my best, but my best isn't enough with a limited source. thank you very much.ref ( recent one)note: this user is not on my spammer list.theymos silence = acceptance.  >",

Try to checking your ignored boards then unignored the board for the moment then try to merit the post.Here's quoted reply of theymos explaining the same thing what you experienceQuote from: Re: \"YOU CANNOT MERIT THAT POST\"Permissions and ignored-boards can also cause info to be missing per-user. In this case I think that it happened because The Pharmacist is ignoring the board in which that post resides.The ignored-boards page says, \"Be advised that by ignoring a board it will be completely inaccessible to you.\" How it works is that almost all forum systems view you as being not allowed to see the board, just like hidden boards. This is also why you can't quote a post in an ignored board.",

Z-tight is right, but if you think about it, why would you want to merit a post you can't even read? If you have someone on ignore, you can't read their posts. All you see instead is a message saying that user is on your ignore list. To read what the user wrote, you would have to unignore that person, read the post, and then merit them. Otherwise you are just meriting a post blindly without having seen it. And if someone has found their way to your ignore list, they surely most have made many things wrong to deserve being there (this is my personal opinion), hence why merit their posts?",

Someone who has been on my ignore list right now deserves to be there, but I'm always open to seeing if they change next time or not. So far my ignore list will be not permanent for certain users. I don't think it's fair to those who are able to change their behavior as long as it's not a scammer.",
