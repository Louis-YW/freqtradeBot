  "content": "today i came across a very interesting and factual documentary series about bitcoin on the french channel arte. this series includes 6 very well done documentaries in which also some well known personalities have their say like e.g. Dan Held or Andreas Antonopoulos.this series is really interesting and i recommend everyone (no matter if newbie or legendary) to watch it (length 10-15min per episode)enjoy it! part 1: The Mystery of Satoshi - The Genesis of Bitcoinpart 2: The Mystery of Satoshi - The Bitcoin War Beginspart 3: The Mystery of Satoshi - The Impenetrable Fortress of Bitcoinpart 4: The Mystery of Satoshi - Money, Money, Moneypart 5: The Mystery of Satoshi - David and Goliathpart 6: The Mystery of Satoshi - The End of an Empire?this great documentary series about BTC is also available in 5 other languages (french, spanish, german, polish and italian)Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on December 10, 2021, 02:46:32 PM✂For those who can't watch the videos, I've uploaded them here: https://mega.nz/folder/PmJQGLrB#NegfRAO3bfe9Cjm9I0ltzwQuote from: NeuroticFish on February 03, 2023, 07:25:18 PM✂It can be seen on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ETcLj5jBy4It's by default with French subtitles, but if you play with the settings (gearwheel icon) you can select that the subtitles get auto-translated on the fly into English or the language of choice. It's clearly not optimal, but it can be a solution.",

      "body": "This is a great docu-series. Also, content creators like Cold Fusion and Lex Friedman do their own to promote not just BTC but crypto in general with mini docus and lengthy podcasts. These types of education are really important because people tend to gravitate towards shorter video content (as of lately) than reading economics-based books. But as always, not everyone that has a video about BTC is good content so there needs to be some quality control done on the viewer's part.",

Parts of it discussed threads in the bitcointalk forum thread like satoshi's post, particularly in the Bitcoin War Begins. In the 3rd part, I believe is where Zimmermann really said, Wright is not Satoshi and he had not proved it with a sign message. Just sort of things that I'd just want people to know if you aren't able to access. But yep installing TOR or using VPN will make you see them.",

Subs are fitting, whilst not being an exact direct transcript of the dialogues.I really liked the Satoshi type back narrator and the comments he made throughout, rather in tone with what one would expect of the character or a spokesman for the group (whichever suits reality).",

This won't be possible because of the copyright. it would be available only for those who will get the permission to diffuse it. All the new produced films will not be available for public (for free).In the meantime , it's just a matter of time, you have to wait a certain time until you will can find it translated in your local language for free in streaming platforms. Reaching youtube is not that mandatory in the case of new interested concept .",

I think it is stupid to put barriers for information sharing... because there are tons of content on the Internet about Bitcoin, so you not going to \"block\" certain countries from getting to it.",
