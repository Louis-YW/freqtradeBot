Yeah, I am aware of the fact that ToS are too long but you should use some keyword search like \"identity, withdraw, VPN, KYC, fees, etc\" to read the most important part before you start using that service.Back to the Op, Since you mentioned that you created this account before you became a member of bitcointalk and now a preacher of the importance of using non-custodial wallet, do well to also practice it.",

By staking, you are locking a coin on the exchange and providing liquidity for that coin and in a way, your leaving that coin there which translates to indirect storage.Quote from: Faisal2202 on June 30, 2023, 01:58:29 AMBut do you really think, having a key to your wallet means wallet is yours?

In your case, as you've said that it is not that much and nothing to worry about. But we can sense that if the amount is quite high and this has happened to you or to anyone, that's stressing.

So with all these do you think in the right sense it is advisable to keep holding your assets with CEX?OP it is nice you received such mail and i commend them for that as it is amongst what they should be doing to keep customers abreast ahead of time to get them engaged as well.

Quote from: hosseinimr93 on June 30, 2023, 07:12:29 AMJust to clarify, i have already mentioned in my reply that I know the limitation also. which means the same what you just discussed above, I do know, to run a full node you have to download the full blockchain which is more than 350 GB (roundabout) plus you need a better CPU with an internet connection. To make a full node wallet you do need some more ingredients in comparison to SPV wallets.. As mentioned by Helena Yu, the purpose of running a full node is helping the network and having more privacy. And Yamane_Keto also does not agreed with my statement Quote from: Yamane_Keto on June 30, 2023, 08:06:35 AMwait WHATTT Where did you get the confidence to say this? SPV wallets are the same as full-node wallets, but they are lightweight that store block headers and Merkle roots,First of all, let me tell you i was born confident, and i do have 100% confidence to say that SPV and the full node don't provide the same privacy and security features. Let me tell you all, that, I came to this statement due to this topic. Quote from: d5000 on June 29, 2023, 07:31:46 PMDue to the privacy limitations of SPV wallets like Electrum and Sparrow, in the case you use them connecting to public servers, I would like to know if there is a SPV wallet which does only rely on other nodes/servers to download block headers and certain groups of blocks to verify transactions myself, without sharing data like transaction IDs or addresses.Maybe, I took the context of OP's post wrong here, but let me repeat it. I meant to say, SPV wallets do provide us with the key phrase, but what if the services behind that any SPV wallets got attacked and started to misbehave which could lose you money even if you have the seed phrase. Take an example of the latest hack on Atomic Wallet which caused a loss of around $35 million dollars. The point here is, if we do not own the wallet, then how can we be so sure and satisfied with that wallet amid the difference of open and close source? Because we own nothing they are also software made by some third parties. (maybe i am wrong here).But full node wallets, are not made by any third parties because you configure the inbound and outbound network securities here. and also own the wallet too. (have you ever heard the hack of full node wallets? if yes, then what is the ratio here.)Quote from: Mr.right85 on June 30, 2023, 09:57:17 AMYou might forgive his misconception, am sure he meant it differently,Not your keys, not your coin.Are you agree with me?    because it's an encouraging point for me because others didn't agreed with my point, but your positive reply had increase my confidence about which Yamane_Keto had raised questions.",

If you use a trustworthy open-source wallet like electrum, that's not possible. In electrum, you sign your transactions locally.

You may lose your fund if there's a vulnerability in the wallet. If you use a trustworthy open-source wallet like electrum, you can be sure there is no vulnerability. Electrum being a SPV wallet doesn't mean it's not secure. It's open-source and there is nothing hidden from users.  You may lose your fund if your device gets compromised. If your device is compromised, it no longer matters you were using an open-source wallet or not and it no longer matters whether you were running a full node or not.",
