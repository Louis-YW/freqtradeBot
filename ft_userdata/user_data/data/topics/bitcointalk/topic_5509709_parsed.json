To be comfortable to use as medium of exchange, it needs to become practical to use at a scale of hundreds of millions of people. But, even after 15 years of active research, it still cannot satisfy this criterion. There are other second layers developing as we speak, which will presumably solve the scalability problem to a great extent, but self-custody of Bitcoin will likely remain less appealing compared to the convenience of entrusting it to third parties, like banks.Only the people who will truly acknowledge the value of self-custody will bear that cost.",

      "body": "While it is true that projects of Layer 2 are highly contributing to the functionality of Bitcoin, it should be frankly noted that between the original Bitcoin blockchain and the Bitcoin ecosystem created by these L2 solutions lie great differences. The Bitcoin blockchain itself remains a secure, decentralized, and immutable repository for storage and transfer. Its main function has been to sustain the integrity and security of transactions about Bitcoin, done through its consensus mechanism called proof-of-work.Nevertheless, we shouldn't ignore the fact that not all L2 scaling solutions are risk-free. The greater the intricacy of a system, the more challenging it will be to maintain security, where users might show concern for the trust models such systems introduce. While these scaling solutions increase the feature set for Bitcoin, they also make it dependent on other secondary systems, like the Liquid Network's federated consensus, which may also introduce centralization concerns.",

Yes, because they are basically on top of the bitcoin blockchain so it doesn’t affect actual bitcoins because the native bitcoin blockchain does not really support smart contracts. There’s also WBTC, which is again not actual bitcoins, that is on the ethereum blockchain that can be used in smart contracts. It’s just basically erc20 that is pegged 1:1 to bitcoin.",

Various alternative cryptocurrencies are essentially experimental laboratories. They test various technological, software, financial and social innovations. The best of them (I believe) will eventually be implemented in Bitcoin. Therefore, I am quite tolerant of projects such as ordinals and runes, despite the fact that they negatively affect the size of commissions in the Bitcoin network. Experiments are also needed.
