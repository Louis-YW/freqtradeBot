  "content": "A woman in Lagos has been arrested Â for allegedly selling her own child for loan repayment. https://www.facebook.com/100068662700306/posts/pfbid02wJ4dCkxnhCP6p5eHek3sYzvEENGSdqw1xzCDxNwHiSBgA178hmZMoXZfmRLN7Rpl/?app=fblwhen I first read this story there were two observations that came into my mind as food for thought:1. She was asked the reason for her actions. She said she wanted to repay a loan company, the loan repayment amount was 600,000 thousand naira, an insignificant amount not even enough to exchange a human being, no amount is even enough compared to a human being.such action by a Mother exposes how hard the economy is really biting hard on the citizenry, for a mother to go through the process of pregnancy for 9 months and the pain of childbirth and yet still go ahead to sell her own child just to repay a loan, it's like taking us back to the slavery era in modern 21st'C. Â 2. The second was in relation to how people take loans for ostentatious purposes such as birthday parties, wedding or luxurious living. Â However as a human being, is always advisable to alway take loans for the purpose of financing projects with a Return-On-Investment potentials Â you can use to pay back your loan. Just because the opportunity Â availed itself for you to borrow a certain amount you Â know you cannot pay back, doesn't warrant you to jump on the opportunity, as it's rather not an opportunity in real sense but a debt trap.",

What did she used the loan of such amount for, and how important was it to her at that time? These are questions only the woman knows well to answer. For we know the country is hard and that's why it's demanded of us to make wise decisions as it concerns money. There is no justification to selling a human being be it your child or not, she just have to face the full wrath of the law for such action.",

I know it can be really difficult at times, but people should learn to live a contented lifestyle, because some people are not contented with what they have and really want to live like others are living big, even if they can't afford it at the moment. They will want to borrow. With the economic situations, now is the time to handle every financial situation intelligently, so that debt will be lessened and also so that one will not find themselves in a pressuring financial situation and don't end up taking action that is not right.",

I dey here about father's sell children as me no too reason that one because father's Dem no dey too care about their children. But a mother, aba no na she messed up. Mother's are supposed to protect and fight for their children. Except na these modern generation girls wey run go carry belle and no know the meaning of pikin.No matter the reason, a mother stays with their children and na my mama I take know. Even that times wey we no dey see food chop my mom go make sure say she use her last card buy food for use. She go come go sleep and she no go eat just to make sure say d food reach us. Also the idea of borrowing money, people for our country no understand watin e mean to borrow money from lapo. If u no get work wey u dey do or wey u plan to do no try am go borrow money, it's unwise. How u wan take pay back, please we should all use our heads, Make palmpay no come knock for our door.lol",

Borrow more from another source to clear up 2. You pay with something more dear to you that's more valuable than the actual amount you borrowed. 3. Depression and confusion always play in mind when you fail to pay. which in turn cause you to do what is unthinkable like in this case selling of your own child which is very bad so its pumped plain for someone with no good of money to always shy aware or dangerously avoid loans because it can ruined your whole life.",

This same child that she hasn't valued is same child that so many other person's are seeking to have and get.

Some months back, it was the story of a woman somewhere in Ogun state who ended her life all because she owed a 70k debt and couldn't afford to payback when due. A loan is supposed to be collected by those who can pay back. It is supposed to be at least 3times lesser than what one earns or could spend on a normal day if there was enough cash. Above all, delayed gratification, living creatively and in contentment are key boosters to wealth creation and accumulation. Thank God for Bitcoin, the only thing that remains would be to sensitize those on how it works and mentor them if interested till they can earn from it too.Arresting the lady is just a deterrent to others who fall in this category to only borrow only what can be paid back, no matter how much is placed on the table.",

Even if she's living a tough life and might end up going to prison, it's her problem, not the child's.
