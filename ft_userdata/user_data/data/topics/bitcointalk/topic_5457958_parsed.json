  "content": "Hello, I have been holding off on posting this as it's likely, if there were a chance I would get paid. It's not happening after i go public but after 3+ months of jumping through never-ending KYC hoops its obvious to me that Stake.com have decided not to pay me under the guise of KYC and i want to warn people out there that if you play there, even if you are verfied to keep your balance low. Limit your exposure. Or just play somewhere else.I am a Thai national currently travelling abroad on a working holiday which i assume is what initially triggered the Level 3 / 4 kyc request.Thats ok, the account is legit, made in thailand. Thailand is my primary residence and i still reside at the premesis that is on my drivers license. All good right? I will just provide them with the information.I was already level 1/2 verified but they asked for and i sent them.Drivers License Back and frontMe holding drivers licensePassport back and frontMe holding passport.Now the fun begins. Level 3 verification.I send in Me - official thai housing document. Stamped by thai government. Showing i live at this address. not approved. Stake - They ask for a bill.Me - Send in Gas billStake - ask for a bill and proof of paymentMe - Send in Gas bill and bank statement showing the transferStake - Ask for a bill less than a month oldMe - I wait a month for a new bill to come in and send this along with another bank statement showing payment.Stake - Not accepted. Ask again for a bill less than a month oldMe - Starting to get worried.... Go back and forth many times with chat. They cant (or wont) tell me whats wrongMe - Send in a different bill. physical electricity bill and physical proof of payment (this is written in thai)Stake - Not accepted. They dont tell me why but i assume its because its in thai.Me - I transfer my electricity account to an online account so i can give them new bills and payments in englishMe - Send in a new digital bill and digital proof of payment in english ( It even has a QR code on it ) Stake - Now they are asking for THREE months of phsycial bills and physical payment receipts, not digital, Signitures? ( signitures on what and from who??? ) and also stamp  Stamp from who ?My problem is, in 2023 who gets physical proof of payment? But luckily in thailand, i can get phsyical receipts if i change my online account back to physical. I could collate the physical bills and receipts over the next three months however my bills and receipts will be in thai, the electricity company will not give you a phsycial receipt or bill in english and stake wont accept thai. Ive offered to pay for translation. Not accepted. I offered to meet someone in a thailand office and they said this. Which is ironic.During all this they have also reset my level 2 verification and asked for a photo of my holding papers four seperate times. Which i have also supplied every time and i am now level 2 verified again.I have never withdrawn from my account, I was not bonus whoring and i was not hitting bad lines.Am i being unreasonable here? To be clear, they will not let me withdraw my money out. Maybe i deserve to lose 6k USD on a legitimate account because i vpned while working overseas? Can someone with a clearer head here suggest what my next steps should be.I cant imagine how level 4 proof of payment is going to go when i show them wages from overseas ( which i sent back to thailand every week ) Which i can show proof for as well.I have pm'd stunna a couple of weeks ago and to be fair, i see he hasnt logged into the board since i pm'd him. Maybe he can help and if he does, I will be equally embarrassed and grateful.Frat Version :- Stake.com is withholding 6000 USD from me. Hiding behind impossible KYC requirements for internationals.",

      "body": "Doesn't look good, to be honest! The driver's license and passport should be more than enough. In majority of the countries, a passport is considered the highest level of verification because it usually requires police verification before you can become eligible to get a passport. At least that's the case in my country. Also, your background is checked to find out if you ever had any criminal cases against you or not. So Stake should have paid you on that verification. Also it's just 6k, not a million so I really do not get the bill thing they are seeking from you. If you have all documented proof, open a thread here, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0Let someone from Stake admin team reply to you.",

The only passport and Driver's license that you have when you sent the photo are very valid compared to the bills that you submitted to them.That's a bit annoying and worrying if there is a large balance on their casino platform. It seems like they didn't want to allow money to be withdrawn from their platform. But when you make a deposit, it's okay with them. I have a feeling that what I see is not good.",

They are one of the largest casinos and sportsbooks in the cryptospace that also sponsors famous MMA fighters. Why would they hurt their own reputation only for $6000?What is head scratching here is they are asking for physical receipts of bill payments. Similar toWillowbitcoin's argument, only very few people do this in 2023. @Willowbitcoin. It might be better to ask someone from Stake's security department to check into your problem. The people you sometimes speak with in live support are agents working for a call center.",

I don’t find anything wrong about this if he really still on that place. I’m not defending Stake but it’s a standard requirements for address verification to make sure that it’s still valid.There’s other KYC that you the most updated bills just to verify address verification. What I’m intrigued on this case is why OP needs to verify on that level while he only have 6K on his account. That’s not reasonable for that kind of bankroll so I believe he done something fishy that trigger Stake security to be this kind of strict with their requirements.",

I believe it has nothing to do with the amount of his withdrawal. $6000USD is not that big and there are some users in this forum that I know who withdraw bigger amount than him without any issue in Stake. The user I'm referring to is not even a verified user, but he could withdraw thousands of dollar easily. The main question here should be, what is the main reason for Stake to ask him to do level 3/4 verification while he is level 2 verified already.

One of my friends has the same problem as you (OP), but with a different gambling site (https://www.pnxbet.io/). He is from the Philippines but is currently traveling abroad, such as Singapore which is not allowed on PNXBet. They asked for the same thing which Stake asked you, which is the KYC requirements in order to be able to withdraw funds from the site. It's difficult, but it is the only way to withdraw the funds. (That might be in TOS of Stake that we didn't read). And after providing the KYC requirement by my friend, they immediately sent the funds to my friend.
