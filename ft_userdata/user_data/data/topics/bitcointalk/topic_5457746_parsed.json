Your ledger link did say that the microcontroller manufacturer has plans to release a secured version of it in the future but didn't give an exact date. So Jade wallets are in serious trouble, regardless of whether you're DIY'ing it or not.I see Adam Back is trying to run damage control on Twitter, but AFAIK this exploit has nothing to do with the device's PIN, it directly hits the microcontroller.",

This does not mean that Ledger will not use every opportunity to divert attention from its products and its incomprehensibly bad business practices.In the past, their team published an article about vulnerability in Trezor HW, so this is not some isolated case but their way of trying to be good guys, and at the same time cast doubt on the competition.",

I think you got it wrong. I have just gone through Ledger's Twitter feed to see if they reposted or mentioned this Jade wallet extraction vulnerability in the last couple of days and they haven't. As Lucius pointed out, it's a blog post from February of this year. That's when it was originally posted. It's being discussed now because this Stadicus guy on Twitter brought it up today saying \"How did I miss this?\" That sparked a discussion where Adam Back also participated.",

Open-source is a book you can open and start reading and analyzing. Since that is not the case with closed-source hardware wallets, I can see why they try to manipulate those from the first group. Quote from: dkbit98 on June 27, 2023, 10:08:41 PMThey are doing great job with all other wallets except with their own ledger device. It's important to distinguish between threats and vulnerabilities whose successful execution leads to the lose of coins versus things that affect ones privacy or the functionality of the wallet. At this time, I am not aware of a successful way to attack a Ledger hardware wallet to retrieve coins, the PIN, or seed from it. That doesn't mean there isn't one. The Ledger Donjon team focuses on attacks where you can actually lose your money. It is true, though, that their proposed Ledger Recover mechanism is both a security and privacy threat.",
