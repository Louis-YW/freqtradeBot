You sure will be getting feedback soon, and yes the link is accessible from my end and I already have the book on my to-read list in a week or two from now, I will offer some reviews and feedback from the book content.This is a good project anyway at least for the newbies who need to learn the history of Bitcoin and how it all started, I was not aware of your previous thread, and what it was all about but then this particular thread is good enough for this purpose since the content of the previous thread was all about altcoin as mentioned in the first comment.",

What Lucius said is not bad and creating different threads on one project is not good. Even though the attention of the forum users were not much in the first thread, Op would have updated the first thread and make a comment on it. The book will be read some day and review will be also made. As I said in one of your thread, conciseness of the book will attract more readers so try your best to make it brief. And if you can write it in different unit, then it is even the best. It is a nice effort, keep it up.",

As we could presume why Bitcoin is named as Bit and Coin at the same time. because it is digital and it have its own blockchain. So, try to make a background more close to finance and bits (means digital world of finance using blockchain graphics). Just a thought other wise it the current design also looks nice.",

Countless hours have been spent so far lolThanks for your reply Your countless hours spent researching and recording the history of bitcoin from 2008 to 2024 should have been worthwhile. No one could create or even read 258 pages in a single day without becoming weary. I can't even begin to comprehend how long it must have taken you to organize and stay current with Bitcoin history without pausing to update yourself on the past and recent developments. This demonstrates that even though you have fewer or no sponsors to support your project, you still have your project in mind and have not given up just yet for it, for another thing. I simply hope you get the attention you're looking for at the end of this.",
