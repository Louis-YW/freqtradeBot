First about the mixer (strange again that your common sense did not even work about self-moderated thread and in fact the reviews were not posted in campaign thread) and now this. Please don't tell me that the messages were from newbie accounts. It will be interesting to know who else received messages from others against anything about me?Can you ask the same guy to examine these images too?https://imgur.com/a/TeA5vAGI took image of some random chats.When I zoom then I see...When noticed closely, it does not need to zoom in. It seems in some texts that edge of the icon mismatch a bit on the chats.Anyway, I was not responding you from last few days, intentionally but I am reading whatever you are posting. In this one, I thought I needed to reply because people will judge it quickly and make up their mind. You are constantly attacking me with your words, accusing me with possible everything. Crybaby, fucking liar, fucking whining childish scammer, fuckingliar777, whiny fucking lying dishonest crybaby - all do not sound nice. When I am not any of it, it automatically go back to you.Haven't you got tired yet? I really have no time to spend for you. Notice my post history, check my telegram group you will see how busy I am. The time I am spending on writing this post, I could use it to check post history of 3 to 5 users in campaigns. Understand, talking to you is a waste of time for me.Few last advises: Please stop creating alt accounts and sending messages to yourself. Please stop sending messages to my clients or potential clients.Please stop doing everything to frame me.None is going to make you trustworthy, it needs to earn by honesty, care for others, love for the community, supportive mindset and years of positive influence.Quote from: Poker Player on January 21, 2023, 05:24:18 AMQuoteHi Poker Player,I examined the screenshots that Royse presented as proof against you here.

So that website, while it can be useful in some cases, it isn't here.That's right. The website utilizes EXIF metadata analysis to detect fake photos. However, unlike real photos that can be fingerprinted and contain EXIF data, screenshots don't have the necessary EXIF information for this purpose. Besides, as you also noted, the images are no doubt already modified anyway (censored sender) so any further analysis is irrelevant.Quote from: LoyceV on January 21, 2023, 09:20:57 AMI never trust screenshots, unless I trust the sender.

Unfortunately, some members will accept such flimsy evidence at face value to incriminate a member.",

So that website, while it can be useful in some cases, it isn't here.I don't know much technical details about the Image metadata, but what I also think is that once you upload an image to certain sites like facebook or even some image hosting sites like imgur, there is a very big chance that the metadata gets wiped off or altered when you download that same image and try to analyze.This is probably to avoid the uploader exposing their information such as location where the image was taken to the public in the platforms. So in this case, it's useless to analyze an image that has been uploaded to imgur or postimg.cc",

I can't say it's very clear.The second instance where the name is deleted supposedly from the chat bubble, it doesn't look like it's even with the rest of the text.

If someone has something to say, he should do it!In part I agree, and I have not promised to keep the secret, I've been simply asked for. If it were the case, I could say who he is, but as I said he is Legendary, positive trust, a established member of the community.Here is another invention of Royse777, to say that I create alts to send me PMs, LOL, if he insists by that way I will try to convince the one who sent me the PM to be himself who says he sent it to me or authorize me to say it.In any case, I don't think I'm going to do it without explicit agreement with that person if I'm not forced to because when Royse777 presented the garbage screenshot that at least doesn't prove anything, nobody questioned it and everyone considered it good, but on the other hand, when I published mine of my outbox I was told that it didn't prove anything. So, why am I going to publish it?Quote from: LoyceV on January 21, 2023, 09:20:57 AMI find it difficult to take your arguments serious if you talk like this.You are partly right, and since you are partly right, I will henceforth try to spare me the insults, but the part you are not right about is that the truth is what it is, regardless of the fact that you use some insults in several paragraphs. For the rest, in the chat bubbles I see an inconsistency in the screenshots of Royse777, in some of them there is that drop and in others there is not. Neither in my Telegram nor in what I have been able to see on the Internet there is such a drop, let alone a drop in some chat bubbles and not in others.On the other hand, the name supposedly deleted does not match with the rest of the text, it seems slightly elevated.And finally, since Royse777 has deigned to respond, I ask him to publish the other evidence he said he had, such as that screen recording, which I have repeatedly asked him to publish. Edit, I was leaving the forum, and when I took a last look at the image I saw another proof that it is a gross manipulation.

How shameful and disrespectful even for the people who think you are still genuine.I remind you that these are the appreciations of a person of great reputation in the forum with which I agree.I repeat them:1. The drop in chat bubbles, that neither in our Telegram nor searching the Internet we have been able to see and you say they are normal in your Telegram.2. The name. To what I said about it I will add another thing: in my Telegram conversations in PM I do not see the name in the text, only at the top. Surely it is due to my ignorance in Telegram but it would be necessary to see why a name appears in the text.And what you say about emoji characters does not make sense because the endings of the names are not emoji characters, they are letters of the alphabet, one looks like an o clearly, the other could be an m or n.Quote from: Royse777 on January 21, 2023, 03:54:56 PMIf we had our previous trust system then your account would be give red by now by many.

The income I receive from the forum is a very small part of my total income, and for a long time now I have been spending less than I earn, I have an emergency fund and I invest, reinvest and reinvest. On top of that, I have four sources of income.So if by doing my duty, which is to expose scammers when they scam and liars when they tell lies about me, I would be red tagged and not be able to participate in signature campaigns, the impact on my financial life would be very small.Quote from: Royse777 on January 21, 2023, 03:54:56 PMAnyway, continuing with you is just nonsense but how stupid I am that this will be my 2nd response to your BS.

Either way, they're useless as evidence.Just completing the information presented. Since I work with images, I am very attentive to these details of moving a pixel.And agreeing that screenshots are always very difficult to prove something, I will just present a simple and quick analysis that I did on the presented statement.It will be noted that I had to edit the image, to highlight the point.This analysis was based on the chat opened by Telegram itself to present the news on the platform. So I believe it's something that any of us can check.QuoteWhen I zoomed in on the image enough, I noticed a 1 px offset from the bottom edge of the chat bubble. It shouldn't be there if the screenshot is genuine.This is the deviation that the user says:As you can see, and without any kind of zoom, there is a deviation of 1 pixel next to the place to write the message.But, you may also notice, that you are not seeing the full message. That is, the box for writing is in the middle of the message.What happens when we scroll down and put the text box at the end of the message:As you can see and without any kind of zoom applied, that 1 pixel deviation no longer exists.Conclusion: This is an effect generated by Telegram itself, when the write box is in the middle of a written message. This should happen to all users who use Chrome on Windows to access Telegram. I say this because it was on a device like this that I did this test.However, as I'm a bit stubborn, and what appears online is because it exists in code, I went deeper into the source code of the respective page.Note:As I marked in the image, this line is displayed, and a definition in the CSS of the active page is highlighted in yellow.When you disable this option in the CSS, see what happens:The 1-pixel line no longer appears.Conclusion: this theoretical deviation that was mentioned by that anonymous user is nothing more than a configuration created by Telegram.Honestly friends... stop these tantrums, please!  EDIT: Link to all the images I posted: https://imgur.com/a/ANqatEYEDIT 2: Regarding the username that was deleted from the Telegram images, nothing can be evaluated.

I think I'm going to pass on what I'm told in PMs, although I thank the two people who sent them to me for doing so, and that I'm going to come by the reputation section less to de-escalate.",

A faint \"n\" could be an \"a\", an \"m\", a \"b\" or a \"p\".And what is encircled in yellow? It is clearly seen that it does not have the same shape.One thing unrelated to another!In the first yellow circle is the name of the person you are having the conversation with.In the second yellow circle is something that was written by this person. In this case it may have been the name of some user, I don't know.Since they are different things, they cannot be mixed in the analysis.Analyzing screenshots involves having an understanding of how things work in that app. One must look at all the details, and where each situation fits.I'm not trying to defend anyone with that. I just want to show that the analysis of a screenshot has to be much broader than simply looking at some images.*As LoyceV has commented before: emails, PM, DM, or screenshots, do not serve as viable evidence as they are highly manipulable.*Maybe I have to open a screenshot analysis service... Let me know what you think.",

It shouldn't be there if the screenshot is genuine.This is the deviation that the user says:<...>And what is encircled in red in this image? Isn't that the deviation Poker Player was talking about in the first post? Royse77 says that this happens often in his Telegram, but I looked through dozens of screenshots on the forum and elsewhere on the Internet and didn't find it anywhere. There is probably some logical explanation, so I'm interested in your opinion on what could be the cause.Quote from: Poker Player on January 22, 2023, 04:52:16 AM1.
