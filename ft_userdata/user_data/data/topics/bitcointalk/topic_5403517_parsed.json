Even after the Fukushima disaster, Japan stopped relying on nuclear energy and replaced it with fossil energy and liquefied natural gas, which did not cause inflation.Can this go on forever? Could Japan be \"a deflationary island on its own?\"\"Borrow at Yen %, invest at USD %\"Now the question is, HOW BAD is japan's situation? https://www.mof.go.jp/english/policy/budget/statistics/IMFSDDS/index.htmlQuoteNARA, Japan, July 8 (Reuters) - Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving leader, died on Friday hours after he was shot while campaigning for a parliamentary election, shocking a country in which political violence is rare and guns are tightly controlled.Many thanks and source @genesisvol twitter account",

I hope people can compare russia's debt numbers to other nations and comprehend what it means.Over the past few decades, many prime ministers of japan have unexpectedly resigned. As if they didn't want to be involved in the political agendas taking place. That was one key indication of something not being right about japan's future direction. Japanese automakers like toyota tried to share industry knowledge to help american automakers improve the quality of their products. When americans refused to improve their methods, even after being shown better methods of production. Japanese automakers seemed to reduce the quality of their own cars and trucks, so they would no longer be distinctly superior to american made automobiles. There were many red flags and indications of behind the scenes dealings going against what was in japan's own best interests. Japan's military and defense were crippled by post world war II restrictions. Once japan became dependent on the USA and others for protection, it was all downhill from there. A slippery slope of debt and reduced standards.",

GDP (gross domestic product, i.e. the value of all goods and services produced in Japan in a year) is the second highest in the world, and Japanese brands such as Toyota, Sony, Fujifilm, and Panasonic are well known worldwide.but after being hit by inflation and the omicron, Japan's GDP contracted by 1%. namely in the first quarter of 2022 experienced a contraction. The rate of inflation as well as the surge in cases of the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 variant, turned out to be pressing the economy of the country of the rising sun quite deeply.but I was so impressed with the discipline of the Japanese people and their government that I thought Japan would be fine.",

I hope people can compare russia's debt numbers to other nations and comprehend what it means.A country's Debt to GDP ratio might not be what it seem. Its numbers do not immediately suggest whether a country is economically strong or not, or whether a country is prone to default on its loans or not. This is not a straightforward data. In which case, we cannot jump right into the conclusion that since a country like Russia has 19% Debt to GDP ratio, it is economically doing better than the US which has 134%, or even than Japan which has 256%. This isn't like comparing two similar bananas. Much of Japan's and the US' debts are domestic debts. These are loans borrowed from themselves. These aren't debts that are owed to China or whatever country.In other words, these countries are not really buried in debts as if they are having a hard time. We have to take note that the US has the largest economy in the world. Japan has the second largest in Asia. Singapore is also a very rich country and has one of the highest GDP per capita. The same goes to Bahrain. But they all have more than 100% Debt to GDP ratio.",

It even tried to give negative interest to attract Japanese people to spend. Now, inflation will increase for reasons beyond the control of the state, which leads to reverse deflation on the part of the Japanese, which may increase the matter either.",

Japan has advantage of small demographic and geographical area thus easy to maintain the finances or at least keep up with the worlds inflation in their own ecosystem. I am not sure how much these factors can affect but it’s important one when you run whole country and maintain the finances. Japan is also very advance country and are capable of emphasising modern era problems in shortest way possible. This helps in reduction of costs, easy to adapt solutions and more.

Could Japan be \"a deflationary island on its own?\"Yes, it can go like this forever as there is nothing anyone can do about it.You rise oil prices, people will travel less, you raise food prices people will go only after staple food, the thing is that you can't have any of these commodities rise up in price only in Japan for example at 300% without impacting in the rest of the world, and form here it will be only a matter of who blinks first.Let's assume gas prices double from now and it forces even Japanese people to spend more of their budget, by the time that happens the demand destruction in other places where others can't afford this will bring prices back in check.I've always said, Japan is the perfect example of a country that highly depends on imports of both food and energy that goes against every global trend because of its people, if they don't want to there is nothing you can do, simple as that.QuoteJapan's debt to GDP ratio FAR exceeds any other country in the world (it was okay in a deflationary environment)It all depends on who owns this debt.I owe 20 000$ to a loan shark, I'm fucked.I have a mortgage of $20 000 over 20 years at 100$ a month.My business owes my parents business 5000$ for different products, is that a problem?I owe 5000$ to a guy that owes me 6000$, we both have a debt of 11k$ which can be settled with $1k.Same here, who has all that debt?Another nice example was the European debt crisis, you know, that things that was supposed to destroy Europe and send it back to the zerohedge , stone age!Remember those?   Quote from: so98nn on June 22, 2022, 04:04:16 PM Japan has advantage of small demographic and geographical area Yeah, the 11th most populated country in the world.Quote from: Pesona1 on June 22, 2022, 12:25:33 PMJapan still looks pretty great at the moment as a developed country, but according to some statistics, Japan economy is currently in a deteriorating condition due to high inflation and also the impact of the increasing spread of the corona virus and omicron in the country, according from BBC NewsQuoteIn April, the benchmark measure for consumer prices rose 2.1%, enough that inflation this year is expected to finally hit the Bank of Japan's 2% target, after three decades of essentially no rise at all.High inflation?

This will cause a drastic change in the Japanese economy and social security system in the upcoming decades.I think I read somewhere that it was about how much of it needs to be paid asap, and how much money they had. So, let's make some numbers up, let's say you have 200 dollars in debt that you have to pay, and you only make 20 bucks, but only 10 bucks of the 200 will be needed to pay today, what do you do?You pay that 10, and have 190 left, and use the rest of the money you have to build something. That is why Japan might be doing fine, because even though they have big debt, due to inflation and many other aspects, the amount they have to pay asap is not that big deal for them. Many nations have that, USA has that as well, it is quite ordinary to have debt.",
