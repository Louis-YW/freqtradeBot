  "content": "The National Committee for Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in the Sultanate of Oman had decided on November 9, 2022 to form a committee in cooperation with members of the Central Bank of Oman to study the possibilities of banning the use of virtual assets in the Sultanate of Oman or allowing them according to a new regulatory framework. Then, in December of the same year, this authority summoned experts and specialists to prepare a law regulating the uses of digital assets in the Sultanate of Oman.https://cointelegraph.com/news/oman-financial-regulator-seeks-feedback-on-proposed-virtual-asset-frameworkOn the 27th of last July, that authority issued a detailed regulatory draft law and presented it to the Omani public for their assessments and suggestions regarding the law. The draft includes proposals for certain basic definitions and the reasons for their adoption, regulatory requirements for obtaining a license to provide virtual assets services, proposals on the methodology for processing applications, and proposals for transitional arrangements for passage to this new regulatory legal framework.All components of the Omani people are invited to participate in this national consultation, whether they are individuals or institutions, in the form of an answer to the questions contained in the draft law via an e-mail to an address belonging to the authority. The last date for accepting proposals is August 17.Link to the draft law in Arabic and English: https://cma.gov.om/Home/EParticipation/LegislationDrafts",

This shows that the government is committed to getting a comprehensive view of the people towards the regulation of the sector. Although regulating the sector is against the philosophy of the creation of Bitcoin, there is a need to make laws to control altcoins and other crypto service providers. Without regulations, the sector will be flooded with diverse shitcoins and other services that are targeted at defrauding the public. We hope that these inputs from the public will be considered in the formulation of the main law. And these laws will not be too rigid which will make Oman unfriendly for the crypto community.",

I was also surprised by the news, and I continued to verify even the linguistic formulas contained in the report in Arabic. Indeed, there is a will from the government to study the project, based on the opinions of the national community. Or rather, the adoption decision has already been taken and work has been done in a record time to prepare for this draft (less than nine months) taking into account the ambiguities that these definitions and concepts may pose. Therefore, it decided to carry out something like a \"national consultation\" for audit.We also do not cancel the hypothesis that the Sultanate of Oman has a traditional society clinging to the teachings of religion, and perhaps this consultation is in order for there to be the most compatible percentage with the laws of Islam.The Sultanate of Oman is considered one of the rich and open Arab countries to development despite the excessive religiosity of society, and it preceded many Arab countries in pursuing policies opened to technology and development before even the United Arab Emirates, but the nature of society has always been an obstacle.I expect good results from this consultation, and I expect some neighboring countries to follow it, such as the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which currently have the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which preceded the Sultanate of Oman to regulate the sector.",

My guess is they don't want to be left out in the digital era as most nations around the world are beginning to look at the possibility of having their own digital currency, and Omani sutanate is giving it a second thought. Though the proposed regulatory frame work is not all about CBDCs, but security tokens, utility tokens, fiat-backed tokens etc and if approved would be great for the Omani people and I hope other Arab nations can take a cue from this.",

The Omani government may have taken such a step to avoid clashing with hardline jurists because a large number of them prohibit dealing with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.Although Bitcoin is still a matter of disagreement among the jurists, most of them prohibit Bitcoin, and the Omani government may seek, through this consultation, to find a compromise that is acceptable to all.",

I think it is too early to be optimistic that bitcoin or any of the cryptocurrencies will be officially recognized as an official currency or even in the blockchain as a method of payment and money transfer. We must not forget the contrast between the decentralized nature of the blockchain, according to which Bitcoin was developed, and the central nature of countries in their dealings with everything.At the same time, it is good to establish a legal legislative framework to regulate the digital assets sector (including encrypted) to provide investment and trading services at least.I support the idea that the Sultanate of Oman does not want to remain behind in the circle of development in the financial sector and public banking. It is also affected by its neighbors, since the countries of the region have economic agreements that make their markets a free economic space open to goods and people, and therefore there must be compatibility in the financial systems.",

For example, when all the Gulf states cut off their relations with Iran, Oman did not. It maintained its relations with Iran and always played the role of mediator.If they follow the same balanced policy in the Bitcoin issue, they might come up with a somewhat balanced version of a legislative act to regulate Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.Let's not be in a hurry and wait and see what their decision will be.",

It is clear that these recent decisions are affected by the degree of adoption reached by some Emirates in the UAE and how this encouraged many investments in the sector of encrypted currencies and blockchain services. Do not forget that an Arab country grants a license to a trading platform that is in Bahrain, as the rain platform has been active for years before the UAE even began its adoption policy.I expect new developments during the coming period in the Arab Gulf countries and some Arab countries in North Africa.",

The state is the one that called for these investments, which are considered the first of their kind in the field of cryptocurrencies, since no company has a license to operate in this field, and the draft law is still under national consultation. Only the state can make these exceptions.About the Blockchain technology, there is no field in which blockchain technology is used more than cryptocurrencies and crypto networks. It is known that the main reason for this delay is the lack of development of technologies that allow storing data in larger sizes on the blockchain while ensuring easy communication between the various nodes, and the world is likely to succeed in doing this during the upcoming developmental stages. But in general, it is not permissible to blame the Sultanate of Oman in the launch stage. It's an experimental stage.",

This is a bold step that is not easy for any country to take, although many companies in several sectors accept payments in Bitcoin and governments are forced to deal with it. The Emirates, for example, or Bahrain, or even the projects under construction in both the Sultanate of Oman and Morocco, are all projects to adopt crypto transactions and accept crypto as recognized investment products and not as an official currency. There is a big difference between the two matters.Currently, the experiments with full adoption have not been as successful as expected. I mean the experience in El Salvador and Central Africa. This is because the adoption was not to support the financial policy of either country, but rather in a desperate attempt to save what can be saved in a worn-out economy. El Salvador is suffering from massive inflation in its local currency and wants as much as possible to limit its need to use foreign currencies (the dollar) due to its limitations, and Central Africa has not found alternative solutions to get rid of the African franc (CFA).",
