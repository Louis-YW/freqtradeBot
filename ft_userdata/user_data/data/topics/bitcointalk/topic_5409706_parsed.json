If they want to bar him from running over a document dispute, in which they waited 18 months to pursue, then I question which one of the remainders in the field they would rather have as their opponent. Ron DeSantis? Ted Cruz? The republican nominee could be any sentient human and walk away in a landslide. Trump is the only person democrats could beat.I'm more inclined to believe the radicals in the Biden Department of Justice want to energize Trump and his base to win the nomination in 2024. This way democrats have a beatable candidate in the general. So they'll go as far to conduct an FBI raid, but won't actually prosecute him and bar him from running.",

They are grasping at any straw they can think of, to the point of destroying themselves if only to take him down.The interesting thing is, DeSantis would be way more damaging to the Dems. If Trump failed, DeSantis is what we would get.",

It is not possible for Congress to impose additional qualifications above the above-cited qualifications. This is something that was decided in US Term Limits, Inc v Thornton. The Supreme Court ruled that the requirements to hold office stated in the Consitution are the only requirements to hold said office. The case in question was regarding the ability of state legislatures to impose additional qualifications to become a Congressman, but the principle applies to the office of the president as well.Quote from: Gyfts on August 13, 2022, 02:55:09 PMI'm torn on whether democrats actually want Trump to run in 2024 or not. I think they want him to be part of the political conversation. Trump is someone to motivates his opponents to vote. Democrats have little more than abstract failure to run on, but if they can make the election about Trump, their turnout will be greater than it otherwise would be. It is hard to say if they actually want him to run again. There are a lot of people who believe the election was held in a way that was unfair to Trump in 2020. There were also many people who voted for Biden because they believed he would be moderate, and a unifier, both of which turned out to be false. Early polling generally shows Trump with a modest lead against both Biden and Harris in a 2024 matchup.",

It would be stupid for Trump to not declassify a document he intended to bring to his home -- it is trivial for him to declassify a document. Yes he did have that authority.  But he did not have the authority to steal them and keep them in his basement after he left office.  Also, none of the laws cited in the search warrant, like the espionage act for example, are dependent on whether or not the documents were classified. Of course, Trump will continue to pretend like this whole case is about whether or not he declassified the documents he stole and kept in his basement, and then you will continue to repeat what he says, and I will continue to remind you that by repeating Trumps nonsense you're arguing that a President has the power to take any document he wants from any of the intelligence agencies and keep it for himself as a civilian - which is obviously a really freaking stupid argument.",

They are almost certain to be communications between him and NK leader Kim Jung Un. There are no other documents that Trump has any reason to want to keep that are related to \"nuclear\" secrets. There is a reason that the DOJ wants to keep the affidavit that the search warrant was issued based on sealed -- it is because if unsealed, it would show that none of the documents really would cause any threat to national security if disclosed to the public, and that the search was just a fishing expedition.",

Trump, upon having the election stolen from him, declassified and took the documents to find the names of the deep state people who were engaged in espionage. He couldn't search while in office. So, he took them. Sure, it was risky. And none of us know what he found. But Trump is very confident that he found enough to destroy the workings of the deep state.Trump has the info. If the Dems use tactics like a crime of espionage against him, he will use it right back against them, along with all kinds of other things they are doing illegally and unconscionably.According to the law, whether or not the documents are classified doesn't matter, it only matters if they contain  \"information relating to the national defense\".  Declassifying a document relating to national defense doesn't make it not related to national defense anymore.And most likely he's full of shit when he says they were declassified, at least according to people who would know.\"Nothing approaching an order that foolish was ever given. And I can't imagine anyone that worked at the White House after me that would have simply shrugged their shoulders and allowed that order to go forward without dying in the ditch trying to stop it\" John Kelly, chief of staff, Sec of Homeland Security, 3 star general\"a standing order to declassify documents taken to Mar-a-Lago did not exist\"\"You don't just sort of get to say off the top of your head, 'oh, everything that I see today'\"Mick Mulvaney, chief of staff\"I was never briefed on any such order, procedure, policy when I came in.  If he were to say something like that, you would have to memorialize that, so that people would know it existed.\"\"When somebody begins to concoct lies like this, it shows a real level of desperation,\"John Bolton, chief of staff",
