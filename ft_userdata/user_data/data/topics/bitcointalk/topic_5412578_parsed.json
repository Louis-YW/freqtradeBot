      "body": "I do not know much about what that happened in the past, but I think that information is accurate to some extent. I started to knkw about cryptocurrecies in late 2019. About Elon Musk that twitted that Tesla will no more support bitcoin payment which was a manipulation for people to buy more of doge. At the time, bitcoin was around $65100, bitcoin only falled to $48000 ir above, it rose back that day but continue to fall until it reached $46950 on the 25th of April. That was not up to $30%What made bitcoin falled to 55% is the China crackdown of bitcoin and other crypto miners. When it was declared, bitcoin falled to $28100. The 55% bitcoin downturn was as a result of both Elon Musk manipulation and Chinese Crackdown on bitcoin and crypto mining, not only Elon Musk.",

At the moment, a record correction occurred in 2016, in which bitcoin lost almost 87% of its value. Now 2022 is coming to an end and the total correction of bitcoin (starting from its ATH) is about 70%.Anytime Bitcoin has a crash about -30%, that is very good time to jump in. It is good even you just want to enjoy short term bounce.If Bitcoin has a correction about 80% from its latest all time high, I don't have reason to hesitate to jump in for long term investment.Currently, Bitcoin is in accumulation after crash from $30k to $17k but don't forget in 2019 we have a crash from $6k to under $4k that is a last wash out. I think in future, we will witness a same washout before a new bull run to celebrate 2024 halving. However, now it is good time to accumulate discounted Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Well if we are going to look at it's historical corrections then for sure we will have a grasp how big the next bull run is. Prior to the halving in 2020, we have the pandemic scare in March that really plummeted bitcoin to it's lowest low, but then again following the halving in May, we slowly get back and then we eventually reach as high as $69k. So now historically the lowest low is $17,500 and maybe next year we will see the price continue to decline. So this bear market is a period of accumulation for all of us.",

So this bear market is a period of accumulation for all of us.I's still not convinced that 17,500$ is alread the lowest price on this current cycle since the current price is still close to it while it's been more than 2 months since that occur which means Bitcoin is still not totally recovered. We witness already how the price easily rejected at 25,000$ price level which is an indication that the recent price recovery is just a price relief. I believe Bitcoin should hit the old strong resistance such as 15K or 10K before we can see a strong bullish movement.",

      "body": "Quote from: Ratimov on September 06, 2022, 11:08:03 AMWhen bitcoin first lost more than 80% of its value, it was still very difficult to determine whether this was a good point to buy bitcoins or if it was already an overdue option to exit the asset. Now, when we understand that the market is cyclical, and after a deep drawdown there is always a reversal, then, on the contrary, you begin to wait for such corrections in order to profitably buy bitcoin.It's hard to beat the market and it is super hard to identify absolute bottom. So my approach is trying to accumulate in the bottom range and has a long term vision for my investment. With this vision, I don't feel fearful when price suddenly drops deeper than what I thought.People who think they buy Bitcoin at absolute bottom will likely feel fearful when it falls much deeper and they will panic sell. With this psychology of the crowd, the market usually reflects it by a final washout. We saw it in March 2020",

We saw it in March 2020  Yeah tranthidung,that's apparently one of the most nomadic decisions they make and the more they try to curtail the loss,the more they keep loosing.QuoteThe problem with most of these investors is that they are looking for an absolute bottom in the hope of buying everything in one lot and with all their available money. As a result, they are overtaken by 2 troubles:1 - They could not wait for the right price and the market turned around, as a result of which they have to buy already at the actually increased price.That's what everyone does and infact, that's what you'll take on too maybe if you never had an insight of the whole cryptographic stuff. Right price? But that can't just be guaranteed, yeah?Quote2- They waited for their price, bought bitcoins and the market gave them the next bottom (their investments were immediately under water)Heh,. This, infact is adversely the same reason why they HODL btcs in the first place so why should they be taken unawares? QuoteFor myself, I did not identify a specific price, but a certain range at which I will buy bitcoin in parts with a gradual lowering of the price. In such a scenario, it will be possible to be ready for any development of events and at the same time already have cheap bitcoins in your wallet (even if these are not absolutely cheap bitcoins).Apparently* that's prolly because you've gotten alot of knowledge about the system and have known it intricacies,it is much appreciated by me; facts they don't understandwhen we are talking about FIAT, it isn't that magnifying in terms of \"stock\" but it can be considered on asset basics and exchange levels but when we talk about BITCOIN, a different ordeal comes into play. Several occurrence overtime should have made bulls realise that Bitcoin is more than a \"way to make wealth\" and that's why they keep being indecisive; whether or not to HODL and when to do either of this two preference.Maybe it should increase in the nearest future, maybe not, most especially as we now have many other NEW-BEES on the rush to stampede over these money-making new-age resolution (atleast thats what they think)  but it's not gonna be so,why?  IMo,I think the answer is BITCOINTALK.ORG and that exactly the same reason it was structured.Cheers,Sandra❣️",
