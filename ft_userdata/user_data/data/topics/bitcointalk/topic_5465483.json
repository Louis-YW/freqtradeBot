Ended up finding 7 by text search. So it seems these people were using site-specific email addresses; would be weird if they added \"bitcointalk\" for any other website...Oop, yes there was https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#BitcoinTalk & I checked all of them, they all matched as pwned from 2015.Nevermind...",

Could that be the case?What were the possible entry point for these hackers andWhat was put in place to prevent future occurrences?Seems probable accounts remains accounts within the 2011/2015 time frame for now. Even then, Bitcointalk haven’t gotten more recognition or interest in the minds of most, how about now!",

In the time of AI and what not, does anyone think that the forum should think about forum version upgrade. I am not a software engineer but I can relate to issues that can come up in the future. For example there is a dedicated thread to detect AI written content. Whereas the mods are still trying to understand such a contents uniquess. In the end it would be a simple to compile a reason.",

You should disable your secret question and assume that the attacker now knows your answer to your secret question. You should prepare to receive phishing emails at your forum email address.",

Even if I have come across some of the forum details threads, I have not really read this email leakage part.Leak or no leak I just prepare myself to receive emails from any scammer, provided that I have registered the email someplace. That's why it's good to register some things with just a specific email so that when you get some kind of mail, you know it's spam without even opening it, as you were not even expecting them in the first place.",

Fortunately, it was still the early days of the forum, because if something like that were to happen today, it would create a real circus.Quote from: theymos on September 11, 2011, 04:17:26 AMThe attacker first paid for a donator account so he could change his displayed username. The displayed username field is not escaped properly, so he was able to inject SQL from there. He took over Satoshi's account, and from Satoshi's administrative interface he was able to inject arbitrary PHP code by modifying the style template.",

And I don't remember receiving spam that has any reference to the forum.What could have happened is that the email entered some database, and they received spam - which I don't even see - about some other subject. Personally, I am extremely selective about opening an email, even more so when clicking on a link.",
