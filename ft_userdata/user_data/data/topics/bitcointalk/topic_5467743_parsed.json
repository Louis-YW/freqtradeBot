  "content": "Inspired by the german merit sources i tried to figure out, how to highlight the most helpful posts and users without creating a bunch of rules but in an simple and organic way.I came out with an evaluation to concentrate on those posts and users which were found to be helpful and are likely to serve as a role model. Maybe this leaderboard can inspire others on how to create interesting content and push forward the community at all. The evaluation was made by using @DdmrDdmr Merit Dashboard and @TryNinja Ninjastic.space.   After I had restructured a lot, you will now find evaluations for local quality poster and most merited local posts here:October 2023",

Imagine a range from shitposter (Top10 per post but >100 by merit) to quality poster (Top10 by merit but >50 by postrate). To get a Top30 list you need to go down until maybe 100 in the other list to find everyone, which means beetween the matches you have twice as much names to sort out. The problem here is that data is linked one by one which is very time consuming adding not much additional value. I don't know, maybe it is possible with excel to match the names atomaticly? Same with profile link which i need to gather manually one by one by clicking each post. Of course i would apreciate to provide those data too, but within my process these are the data with the least automation.     If you can help me to improve my process and solve those problems, i will enjoy to implement some more columns or data.",

You are taking both sets of data from different sites (ninjastic.space and Merit Dashboard) and since each data point is in a different \"position\" in your Excel file, it's extremely difficult to link these data points. Probably, it's best to keep your table as it is but not sure here, if it's just too time consuming anyways. It's up to you if you want to offer such a table as it is (from your example above).    Quote from: Turbartuluk on September 25, 2023, 08:48:08 AMIf you can help me to improve my process and solve those problems, i will enjoy to implement some more columns or data.

      "body": "Quote from: Turbartuluk on September 25, 2023, 08:48:08 AM<...>I don't know, maybe it is possible with excel to match the names atomaticly? <...>You can use VLOOKUP in Excel to do the matching. For example, I’ve copied the data from your table above and pasted it into Excel, and the added a trailing column with the following formula (inserted in cell I2, and then extended throughout all the I column):Code:=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(F2;B:C;2;FALSE);\"\") The column will display the number of posts for each entry in column F (second Name column).What it does is search for value of cell F2 (Ratimov in the second Name column) within the range of data conformed by columns B (Name) and C (Number of posts). If it finds a match, it returns the value on column C (second column in the range B:C, thus the 2 in the formula) related to the match (249 posts). False performs an exact match. The IfError function returns a blank if no match is found.Of course, using the data from your table, it only matches about 50% of the entries (those that are matchable).See for example: https://www.perfectxl.com/excel-glossary/how-to-use-vlookup-excel/Quote<…> Same with profile link which i need to gather manually one by one by clicking each post. <…>  In Ninjastic, you can ask for the UserId to be part of the post count output:Code:{number}. {username}  {uid} {count}Then simply create a column in your Excel that concatenates the UId column to a fixed value of:\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=\"",

Last step is the conversion from excel to html tables for bitcointalk. Is there maybe a smart way to do this within excel itself, so that 3rd party excel-html converter are not necessary?",

First evaluation was made for August, when Ratimov was international highscorer. I switched then to evaluation for local boards because of redundance to bitcointalks internal meta statistics. Finally i decided to rank the local leaderbords depending on merit/post ratio to present some more unknown names. The evaluations for october is the final stand for now.Quote from: Turbartuluk on November 04, 2023, 10:20:44 PMWith a little delay i started my evaluations for October for 3 major local boards:Pyccкий (Russian)Deutsch (German)Nigeria (Naija)",

Do you used a kind of translator to read and study how quality those posts are, except for my local board that are mostly being mixed with simple english that can be readable by anyone if not in Pidgin language which I know many people from external board are becoming more familiar to read them since some of our brothers often translate it to simple english.",
