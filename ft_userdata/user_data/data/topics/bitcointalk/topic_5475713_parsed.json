Should trading be exclusive to financially comfortable and rich because of how risky it is? If someone has the knowledge to do the technical analysis in trading but no money to do it, then it’s not for them at that moment because you must have money before you start trading, and those who have the knowledge but are scared of losing the little money they have also don’t have to worry about it; they can still wait until they have the funds to trade. There is no rush in the industry. And if they make mistakes in their technical analysis, then they definitely still need more knowledge before they trade to avoid too much loss; it will not be motivating. However, trading is not only for the rich; everybody needs funds to live, so we need to take the risk and make it as far as we are ready to make money. Any business has risks, so for us to be successful, we must take the risk. The only thing that I will advise both the poor and rich is that we should use the amount we can afford to lose. Because even the rich cannot afford to lose all the time because of the risk it takes.",

Should trading be exclusive to financially comfortable and rich because of how risky it is? No, of course not. That's why there is trading to give opportunity to people that want to earn using their assets, like bitcoin or other crypto currency. It may be good that you have a lot of capital before trading because the more the deposit, the bigger the equity, so you will have a big margin in your trade. But that's not it. That's why knowledge, training, and patience are important in trading so that even enough capital and equity will lead you to earn, and that's going to depend on the skill of a trader. Let's say you have a lot of capital because you are rich and are just placing trades in the market. Let's say the trader is educated and has experience. Yes, he could earn because he has a lot of equity, but still, it is not guaranteed. The same as the middle class or having enough equity, we all can lose money or capital in trading, but the effect depends on their status in life. It may be harsh, but yes, having a lot of equity or capital is an advantage in trading, as having limited equity could make trading too risky.",

Should trading be exclusive to financially comfortable and rich because of how risky it is? Not technically only the rich, you just have to have capital for it. And well, the amount of capital is pretty subjective depending on what your goal is so it's pretty flexible, granted profits grow/reduce depending on said capital though. As for losing money well, it all comes down to the scale of how much you want to grow the capital. The more risks you take, the greater the growth, but the greater the risk and vice versa.As for the worry of losing your capital, that always exists in any venture whether it be investments, businesses, and whatnot. It's always there and hence why it's called capital. It's supposed to be spent for \"something\" so always consider it money lost really and don't expect to use it for something else.",

The crypto market has greater volatility than other markets, even with small cap you have the same opportunities as large cap. It should be noted that profit in this case refers to a percentage of cap, not based on the amount of cap.",

Should trading be exclusive to financially comfortable and rich because of how risky it is? If you have little amount of money that you can afford to lose to trade, then why not trade. But rich people have their advantage and they have the money that can help them not to leverage. Leveraging can be tempting people that have little amount of money to trade, but the simple rule is that do not use leverage, but if you want to use it, use low leverage. People that use high leverage will most likely lose, be it rich, average or poor person.",

In my opinion, forcing yourself to trade when you don't have capital and a stable monthly income is a bad choice.

Even with just $5 or lower, you can trade without obstruction with both Forex brokers and crypto exchanges.",

Very few people can use what they learn from Demo account trading to actual trading. Because when they use their own money and chase profit, they let greediness controls their decisions. So knowledge, experience with Demo trading can not help them. With actual trading, they will have to face with fud in the market too and as newbies they will mostly fail.QuoteThe traditional Forex brokers allow a demo account, maybe you would start from there just like I did, and if you are well stable with your income, you might move to exchanges and deposit a little amount for further training on their platform instead of missing out entirely thinking trading is only for the rich.

Leverages, in both markets, traders can use very high leverages but if they do this, they are doing bad practice that will cause big losses for them. So if they fail in Forex market with leverage, they can not succeed in Bitcoin market. If they succeed in Forex market, it is not a guarantee that they can succeed in Bitcoin market that is harsher than Forex market.",

If someone practices sensible and detailed risk management, it doesn't matter whether you trade with $10, $100 or $100,000. What is important here is that you set percentages of your available capital and stick to them. This is especially true for newcomers to the market. They tend to quickly put a lot (or everything) on one card when making trades. If the trade then goes wrong, they have not only lost everything but also burnt their fingers so badly that they will probably give up trading for a long time to come. In terms of profits, it also makes no difference whether you have a lot of money available or not. For someone who, for example, has a monthly income of 100$, 10$ profit from trading is an enormous amount. For someone who has 100 BTC in their wallet, of course not. However, they will probably stake exactly the same amount in percentage terms as someone with less money, which means that their profits are the same compared to the capital invested.",
