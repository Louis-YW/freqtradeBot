  "content": "QuoteNearly 40 million people worldwide work in jobs related to clean energy, according to a Sept. 8 report from the International Energy Agency. That number represents 56% of total energy sector employment, meaning that, for the first time ever, clean energy jobs outnumber those involved in producing, transporting, and burning fossil fuels.The clean energy jobs includes those upstream, like building solar panels and producing crops for biofuels, as well as downstream, like operating wind farms, installing energy efficiency upgrades in buildings, and selling electric vehicles.The majority shifted during the pandemic, the report says; in 2019, clean energy was just shy of half of jobs.Since the pandemic, clean energy has accounted for “virtually all of the growth in energy employment,” the report says. That’s largely due to the opening of large new manufacturing facilities for solar and electric vehicles, especially in China.In spite of headwinds from rising raw material prices and trade disruptions, the report projects clean energy job growth to steam ahead, adding at least 13 million new jobs by 2030, and more than offsetting the continuing loss of jobs in fossil fuels.https://www.yahoo.com/video/more-people-now-clean-energy-151000220.html....That would seem to correlate with other sources of data.There are also proposals to place large mirrors in orbit to redirect sunlight to solar panels at night. To sustain night time power generation. Although I don't know how feasible it would be.Awhile ago apple co founder Steve Wozniak helped found a crypto project to help fund alternative and renewable forms of energy. There haven't been many updates on this. But I would have to guess that crypto is being used to fund many renewable energy ventures around the globe. Is renewable power taking over? Or is it simply less efficient. Requiring greater manpower and more jobs to generate an equivalent sum of electricity? But then if it does create more jobs. Maybe that makes it a good thing.",

Renewable energy wasn't a thing much back then but now, at least people realize the importance of having an alternative resource of energy because of the causes that fossil fuel has to the environment and how it affects the global temperature which everyone is affected on. Quote from: Hydrogen on September 15, 2022, 11:39:16 PMThere haven't been many updates on this. But I would have to guess that crypto is being used to fund many renewable energy ventures around the globe. I don't think that there are more crypto-funded projects in the renewable sector but it's definitely increasing. Everything that has been part of the side of mining should find ways to lessen the cost of mining a BTC so probably that's why there are crypto-funded renewable energy projects.

Imagine the amount of energy you can generate if you just have the right equipment to capture and store energy. The world can be saved because of that IMO.",

It was big news back in 2019 due to the surviving apple co founder being involved.I think they raised close to $1 billion dollars in funding.QuoteSteve Wozniak Co-Founds Blockchain-Based Energy Saving Firm in MaltaSteve Wozniak has co-founded a company in Malta, which will reportedly use blockchain technology to save energy.Steve Wozniak, co-founder of American tech giant Apple, has invested in a new blockchain-based company headquartered in Malta. Wozniak is now the co-founder of energy efficiency company Efforce, according to a report by Maltese news daily The Malta Independent on July 18.Wozniak co-founded the company alongside Jacopo Visetti, who — according to his LinkedIn profile — works in the renewable energy and environment sector. According to this page, Visetti co-founded Efforce in January, 2018 — approximately one year and seven months ago. According Efforce's LinkedIn page, the company provides the first blockchain-based platform focused on investing in energy efficiency, with its stated goal “to be recognized as the first and main platform in the world for tokenized energy savings.”As per the report, Wozniak recently spoke about Efforce at the pre-launch for the Delta Summit, which is a blockchain conference held in Malta. Wozniak reportedly spoke about how he thinks blockchain will be a great boon to decreasing the public’s environmental impact without requiring people to change their habits. Wozniak also spoke on the local government’s pro-blockchain attitude as key to Efforce’s decision to launch in Malta.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Wozniak also co-founded a blockchain investment project in October 2018. He founded the venture capital fund EQUI Global to support investments in blockchain solutions.https://cointelegraph.com/news/steve-wozniak-co-founds-blockchain-based-energy-saving-firm-in-maltaUnfortunately we have no updates.Which seems par for the crypto course. All of the cool and exciting projects that are announced completely lack follow up news and data.They simply turn into ghosts or phantoms and disappear.",

There's a lot that run under the sea between European countries already that share a power grid - this is probably the best alternative.Quote from: Hydrogen on September 15, 2022, 11:39:16 PMIs renewable power taking over? Or is it simply less efficient. Requiring greater manpower and more jobs to generate an equivalent sum of electricity? But then if it does create more jobs. Maybe that makes it a good thing.Efficiency of both would probably be hard to measure. A lot of oil, gas and coal extraction have been automated since the mid 20th century if not before. I think there's more space for research in renewables and more work left (like making solar panels that are more efficient or making them out of different parts and for different things - steam based v silicon based v carbon/metal alternatives based). There's also different sized wind turbines and nuclear fusion research. A nodding donkey doesn't need much manpower except an engineer to maintain it every so often (and they can probably maintain a few at once).The highest cost for oil extraction looks to be the exploration and infrastructure imo too which might not need too many people working on either as exploration can be done by a small team and the infrastructure can be manufactured automatically (and then likely gets assembled into place by a larger team).Renewables will probably become more efficient over time too as some become more robust (I think hydroelectric kry from dams might be close to that state as dams and \"doors\"/gates/locks? have existed for quite a long time for canals and seas).",

Because his project will surely died in the future since the price of the token always continue decrease [1] that's why there's no discussion about his project. Nowadays almost every countries always discuss about green energy and CO2 emissions, if his project is successful I believe it should be place on the top 10, but the fact isn't. His project has no use cases, the news only contain about the token listed on several exchanges.[1] https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/efforce/",

It's pointless to think that clean energy will eventually replace fossil fuels completely, but that's not the case. In fact, humans and power plants both need a variety of energies to function properly. Fossil fuels have their place, but so does clean energy. I think the crypto community also recognizes the importance of clean energy, and those involved are also innovative in their efforts to bring it to market.

I would prefer a better world, and this Russia crisis showed the world that if the nations of the world do not go energy independent then we are going to end up with being depending on dictators.So, the benefits of renewable energy is higher, maybe not so much great when you look at it today, but in 10 years it would be better for the consumer as well, you would be happier about it than old school sources, and you will have it cheaper by that time as well.",

Maybe that makes it a good thing.It's in part due to the government subsidies that are allowing renewables to dominate the job market, also ESG. Part of ESG are environmental concerns, so companies are going to be investing into environmental enterprises/initiatives in order to check the box, not because they believe it'll be profitable.Fossil fuels still hold the vast majority of energy market share and will for the foreseeable future. I don't doubt that fossil fuels will phase out with renewables taking its place.

For example, Solar energy only provides power on a sunny day and even its power load isn't fixed, very varies. Carry a risk of spiking your power grid hence you have to spend a lot of money on power stations and electric lines aka putting a burden on the grid.Wind energy main concern is its wind blade waste which cannot be recycled. Mean you can only bury it under some landfill aka waste of land resource. Talking about land, both Solar energy and Wind energy require a lot of space for their solar panel and wind turbine to work.
