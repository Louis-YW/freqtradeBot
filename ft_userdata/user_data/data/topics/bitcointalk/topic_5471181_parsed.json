That's why I said I didn't expect to win the game.It's your bet though? what do you mean that you didn't expect how it supposed to end? I'm sure that as a gambler and you made your bet, you are going to hope that you're going to win. So for me, my mindset will be that I'm going to expect a huge win regarding what the odds are. Maybe what you see is that your bet has no chance to win as it might be over. But that's how gambling goes, it's not yet over till the last second. So don't lose hope, specially in sports betting as some \"miracles\" do happen and most likely that's what you experience so good for you. The same goes for those who thought that they are going to win already and feels like going into a early celebration and suddenly everything change in a inside. And for sure that's going to hurt the gambler,  . Experience it though many times that's way I learn to really wait till the final score is announce or after the game is officially finished.",

      "body": "Isn't this the reason why gambling is actually beautiful, enjoyable and exciting? Making predictions based on the odds, considering the potential to win several times the bet amount and always following the preferred options for betting in an action-packed way until the last minute conclusion. In fact, although it sounds like a sweet excitement when I say it this way but gambling is a very risky method of fun and potential profit. In order to win money in gambling you always have to risk some money and complete the exciting waiting period. This causes gambling to create certain expectations and excitement in the person.The most important factor in gambling is that a person learns to control their own emotions within the framework of a certain discipline. For example, winning 49 USD with a bet of 0.13 USD is a great success but the self-confidence that this gain will create and the desire to earn more need to be controlled. Otherwise, the money earned will be consumed by gambling again. On the other hand, in gambling choices are always made to take higher risks in order to gain more profit and to minimize the chances of possible gain. The important factor here is that the person makes the best use of these high odds bets by controlling his/her own balance correctly.In summary, gambling is a risky hobby and potential earning method that requires a person not to act out of fear but to be able to control their emotions. If money is not risked in any way in gambling no profit can be made.",

When you hesitate in a game and you lose, you will definitely regret it a lot and it will have a bad impact on your mental health. So I totally agree with you that doubt doesn't make a game that should be won lost, it has no effect at all but it does have an effect on the mental",

That moment when you feel that the game you are trying to bet is actually going to result to win and you go all out and make the stake with the amount you are currently regretting you didn't play with and you will be surprised what the outcome will be when you have the played the bet and the result have finalized because gambling can be really cruel sometimes and that game you feel it's very sure might end up just being the wrong set of games that's if it's a parley selection like the one you placed.",

But sometimes, when we don't have high hopes for the match, we can win some money like you experienced. And that is normal because maybe we don't expect anything from the match and want to place a bet so there is no burden for us.And sometimes luck will come to people who don't have any desires. They want to place a bet and forget about it but suddenly, luck comes and gives them a big win. You are really lucky to be able to win that amount of money and you should be grateful and grateful to your luck for helping you win. Maybe another day, you won't be so lucky.",

      "body": "I disagree. It's normal to have doubts about gambling or your play, especially if you are experiencing a continuous loss. It will affect your gambling strategy and your decision-making. Maybe in your situation it's not because you won, or, in short, you didn't let yourself be affected by your doubt. I have experienced a lot of that kind of situation. That's why I train myself to not be affected by my doubt; instead, I use my mind and focus only on what I'm doing, because I believe having a clear mind in the middle of gambling will help you to decide and think carefully. If you let doubt take over, then it's over. You will certainly never think straight while gambling. Anyway, congrats on your win. From a small profit, it becomes a big profit, which is a good sign that you have luck. Keep up and earn more. I hope I also have the luck you have.",

Well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion but sometimes our doubt affects our gambling as there sometimes, after making an accumulation of events, you start developing doubt on a particular event don't be surprised that that event may possibly be the one to spoil the tickets so in the case the best way when you're having a doubt in a particular event is to remove it from the accumulation. However, using $0.13 to win $49 is a very huge achievement as the accumulation are much and possibility of winning wasn't certain but at last it all turned out the way you predicted it. Congratulations on your winning, I know some colleagues here gonna pm you for gambling tips and predictions due to your current achievement thinking it is easy.",

I always suggest playing single events, victory is more easy and there is no risk that a single event could ruin everything I agree with your POW. Placing many small bets on many games can result in lower payouts and increase the risk of losing a significant portion of our bankroll. When we lose more our minds record the percentage of money lost, which can cause us to take more risks to recover those losses. By only playing one game, we can minimize the possibility of losing a large chunk of our funds/bankroll. This allows us to approach the game in a more disciplined and strategic manner, concentrating on each and every event.",
