FUD or real you can verify with past events.The Bitcoin network, its hashrate is decentralized from hashrate owners to mining farm locations geographically. It will be fine even all hashrates from China turn off. Recent years, total hashrate originates from China has less dominance on Bitcoin network than in the past. It is good for network decentralization, its health and it is good to prevent negative effects from China bans, floods and so on.Again Bitcoin is named as a dead asset. How many times? More than 450 times so far. This figure will reach to 1000 soon.Bitcoin is not dead but it was called as dead 450+ times.",

I already know some will be foaming at the mouth but for China to say that Bitcoin and the Crypto market is a western creation and heavily influenced by the western market is music to my ears, the moment someone accuses a thing of being under the western influence is the moment you an know for sure they are scared shit of it. The sooner they cut every single forgotten thread linked to bitcoin the better, let them deal with their own non-leveraged not manipulated not Evergrande markets, and with their own advanced technology that made the leader of 5G communication unable to make a 5G phone.Quote from: mk4 on June 23, 2022, 04:21:56 AMNot gonna lie — they totally sucked at FUDding on this one. They could've probably used something that could convince the normies far easier such as the \"quantum computing will break Bitcoin's security\" or something like that.It's not about throwing FUD at bitcoin, it's the usual CCP propaganda as the original was published in the official paper of the Central Committee, thias is like 10 times worse than Pravda, their aim was another jab at the USQuoteThe lack of regulation in Western countries, such as the United States, helped create a highly-leveraged market that is “full of manipulation and pseudo-technology concepts”. Tightening monetary policies in Western economies have led to a global sell-off of a range of risk-laden assets, including cryptocurrencies, while a growing number of crypto lending platforms, hedge funds and stablecoin issuers are now mired in financial distress, cryptocurrency trading and speculation severely endanger people’s “property security”, breed criminal activities and disrupt financial order. The usual propaganda from back in the 80s, the corrupt western world is falling apart, the fact that they don't stand in queues for a loaf of bread shows how unhealthy, undisciplined they are and how they lack the moral duty of starving for the motherland",

Let's be honest here, the crypto markets are full of manipulation, high leverage and pseudo-technology. The important thing is that Bitcoin isn't  connected to those accusations. We the Bitcoin maximalists cannot be blamed by anyone for the thousands of shitcoins, crypto scams, stablecoins, NFTs, HYIP scams, which are true \"pseudo-technology\". We never asked for this shit and putting the blame on us is simply wrong.Yes, the Bitcoin price is volatile, but so what? Aren't stocks and commodity prices volatile as well?Crypto traders are really making money by buying low and selling high. Is this a crime or something? Aren't stocks and commodity traders also making money by buying low and selling high?",

Yeah, and add to that, with the looming financial crisis around the globe, they don't want to experience \"capital flight\". Because they know that their citizens can used bitcoin to hide their wealth and move it somewhere else without them having knowledge.They ban bitcoin mining causing a massive exodus of Chinese miners outside and then make mining not a monopoly of Chinese anymore, so this is the good effect of them driving them out of business or pushing them outside.",
