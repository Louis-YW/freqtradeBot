  "content": "if you read the title, yep, you got that right, a female boxer called out Kieth Thurman for a fight. several days ago I saw articles going around talking about Claressa Shields calling out Keith Thurman and saying that she'll fight him and thinks that she can outbox him. I thought this would just die down because Kieth Thurman wouldn't respond to it but then earlier I saw an article where Keith Thurman basically accepts her offer to fight for a charity event and also would give her several advantages more protective gear just to make it safer.anyway, I've seen some highlights of Claressa Shields's fight and I think she is a good boxer(her belts shoes that) but I don't think she can handle Men's Boxing, especially with someone like Kieth Thurman. not sure if this fight will ever go through but I am extremely curious to see how she'll show off her skills if she ever actually fights Kieth Thurman for a charity event.if you are curious, after Kieth Thurman accepted her offer, she responded by showing a video of her sparring with men, and I gotta say, it wasn't good.",

If it is, then I think it's just an exhibition fight, right?I saw the highlights of the female boxer, and she is quite good, but it seems she forgot that the one she challenged was a former boxing champion who only suffered a defeat against Manny Pacquiao, a legend. If this fight is going to happen, I hope Thurman will slow down a bit, as I don't want to see a female boxer badly hurt because of a wrong decision in life.as per her record, https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/777865..... She is currently undefeated, but I'm sure after the fight, she will experience her first loss, although unofficial.",

But if it's just an exhibition fight, Thurman might be not really serious with the fight.",

It's not like there should be any exceptions and special treatment. I bet she's going out there to give all she's got, why should it be any different from his side?Girls these days have too much equality bullshit in their heads and think they can win against men. Weight and sex divisions were made for a reason. If you think they don't matter, you're in for a hard lesson. Also, she's not a child that you can go easy on and give a spanking to. She's an adult fighter who must have sparred with men before challenging Thurman. If she gets knocked out hard, it will be a great lesson for her.",

This match is just an exhibition that gives her a lot of advantages. She might have a chance to outbox Thurman but I doubt Thurman will really guve a 100% of his strength by defeating a woman. Men and Woman genes has a lot of differences in regards of strengths.I read this news yesterday and I thought this fight is impossible to happened because Thurman already show lack of interest.",

Nevermind that the gender disparity even just the fact that Thurman was virtually undefeated until Pacquiao and its was through a split decision too. So for Claressa to think that she's going to beat a literal war machine is a little delusional to me. But whatever, let people play stupid games so they can win stupid prizes. She may have the disadvantage in the ring but after this fight Social Justice Warriors and PC motherfucks will flock upon the after fight calling Thurman a war criminal or something after he brutalizes Shields. Either way I'm going to watch this fight for the lols and to prove a point that Women cannot compete in male-only fights so they can stop smearing their protests for \"gender equality\" when all they really want is to get more rights than men.",

But this is a very dangerous league for Shields to cross over, eventhough Keith for me is about to be on the sunset of his career, but he can easily fuck up Claressa if we wanted to and there's no way that a women trained can win against a men trained boxer, simply as that. Again, this is not going to be a fair fight, unless Keith shows up and wanted to lose the fight just for the sake of getting a lot of money in the process. But everything sets aside, it's going to be the men going to win here.",

And I also doubt that Thurman is going to sign the contract, he used to be one of the best welterweight prior to his injuries, but even that, he can still knockout someone with just one punch at the current batch of best 147 or even 154 lbs division fighters.I know that Shields doesn't have competition and has wipe out his entire division and even a unified champion if I'm not mistaken. But she is asking too much here. It's better for her to just stay in the lane. Just give Savannah Marshall a rematch and I think it will still sell.",

But if this is going to be a real fight, full 12 rounds, with judges and referee, I don't think that Shields will have a change against the likes of Thurman, so this is a bad idea. I think Thurman will love to fight if this is for a cause and charity though and that's why he stated that he is willing to accept with some protection for Shields as he might not control himself in the end. So just imagine if Thurman can hit Claressa in the body first, for sure it's going to hurt and later Shields might have regret about this idea of fighting Keith, IMHO.",
