At the same time, if America wanted to collect its debts around the world to pay its dues, it would certainly create economic chaos that would threaten the stability of countries.If you mean any other country, this depends on the amount of debt it has and who the creditors are. All countries of the world have debts, but there is something similar to a general state of stability.",

Just to make it short, I will ask few questions:What do you think, how this situation will be resolved? What did happen to any other nations who had huge dept in history? Is there any ways offered by economists to resolve the situation?I will give the answer based on my experience, our country was on the edge of declaring default, we consider it already defaulted but till now, our government has not declared that openly (publicly). Well, we are on the edge of default because of huge debts taken from all over the world. We took most of the debt from the IMF and the debt that we had taken is now less than the interest rate that is on that principal amount. Overall, the thing is we saved ourselves from this by taking more loans (hehe) and we used those loans not to enhance productivity and provide more jobs instead we used that money to open more schemes that are totally useless. Well, leave this discussion and the answer to your queries will be that the US has big icons and legends, companies, big tycoons, etc. The most rich people and companies are there. People of the US are so rich and the US has resources that they have gained access to using their democracy slogan (hehe   ), I doubt if there is any need to worry about this thing, as debt can be dealt in a blink of an eye if they really want to solve it.",

America is in one of the most desired positions of any country in the world, they are so credit worthy that other countries will continue to lend to them even though they have these vast mountains of existing debt. Not only that, they owe the central bank that allows them to print as much money as they want, which effectively allows them to shrink the debt over time. As they have the main reserve currency of the world, they are able to negotiate excellent deals and even enforce actions on other nations that wish to trade heavily in US dollars, which they have done for many decades now.",

Taxes - we've seen and heard that they are still rising their taxes.b. very controversial, but it was mentioned by @Yogee, they can make money in conflicts because they are going to supply the armaments.c. Create jobs - but this is very difficult to achieved without investors money coming inI'm not sure if there are nations without any national debt it. Sooner or later they will need to borrow money from someone else.",

Is there any ways offered by economists to resolve the situation?This debt was faced by Japan in the early 1900s but they followed the necessary measures and controlled up to some limits. In the case of the US, there are several ways that the US can rid of it. According to me the one and best option for this is to increase trade with other countries. The US needed to increase the surplus trade and reduce its imports. This will provide a backbone to their economy and have good consequences. The surplus trade is the one in which your export is higher than the import and when the less import they can hold much profits which they use to solve this issue.However, there are also many economists which also give their own thoughts that the US needs to increase the tax on wealthy persons which will create good revenue and the other solution is to stop spending on unnecessary or useless things and some economists give these both planes through which they can easily solve this problem.",

Biden did have a plan to counter the Belt and Road initiative of China (BRI) but instead of building it in Europe, they should just build it from Alaska and then Canada down to Argentina. Covering the whole continent without having to cross the sea. Maybe they could even extend it to Northpole to Russia which is the new field of gas exploration.",

Is there any ways offered by economists to resolve the situation?There are lots of ways government of different countries tries to unburden debt, the country that is in debt can decide to give out their  revenue-generating agency to the country they are indebted to, to be collecting the money from that agency, for example, they can give out their port authority to the country they are indebited to,  to be collecting the revenue for a particular period of time pending when they can clear the debt.The indebted country can also give licence to a particular company to produce a certain product,  for which the country they are indebited to will be the sole producer of that product, for a period of time pending when the debt will be cleared. But in the international law, there are ways government's of various nations try to come to level of agreement in settling their debt.  Borrowing is good, but what your borrowing for, is the most important question to ask.  as a country if you're borrowing for consumption, it will be hard to pay back, because there will be little for you to fall back on. But if you're borrowing for production, it will help your revenue base so you can at least pay back little by little, if not, you will suffer the consequences of he who goes borrowing goes sorrowing.",

To be honest, they are not going anywhere near default because the US is a big economy and they have numerous ways to make money, and they also have a lot of brands generating billions of dollars. And the US is collecting huge taxes from them.Even though they have imposed taxes on NFTs, crypto, etc., that's not something new.They might be stuck in a debt cycle, but their relations with other countries are damn awesome, and they don't even have to listen to anyone else because they are so bold in taking actions that other countries need their assistance and love to sit with them at a table.This condition will be solved by paying off the debt.",

Now that system has been replaced with debt. So every country in the world have huge amount of that on them and that's how the money circulation happens. There is literally no solution until we go back to the gold reserve again. That is how the money is printed.",

War or print money.  Usually, An empire will pick the printing of money since ancient times but before it happens there will be war in an attempt to grab resources and riches. Roman Empire, Ottoman Empire, and even the Chinese Empire did the same thing, there was always a war before the empire collapsed. It seems to be the pattern of this world. One nation rises up as a global leader and then collapses after hundreds of years. The US is no different to them.",

Even super power countries like the US, Japan and China itself. The thing is that their country is also moving, so at least they were able to survived, unlike any other countries that really sink in the hole and can't get up and not sure how they are going to pay for it. Perhaps they will do trade and barter with the countries that they have a loan and that's what most of them are doing. However, it's very difficult on how this situation will be resolved and it might be cyclical. After they paid, then they have to re-loan again and again. Printing money could be any option, but it's not the answer as it will cause inflation pushing their economy down.",

You borrow money today but you pay it 10 years later, with inflation you hope you did better with that money than you should be paying it back, and by that time you are going to get more debt anyway, so when the time for your debt comes, it has been 10 years since you took it.Plus most of the \"debt\" is not really debt, that's just inflation, they are literally printing money every year anyway, so that means they are going to just use that and pay it back and hurt their currency a little bit but because other currencies are doing even worse, they will be fine.
