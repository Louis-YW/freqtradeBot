  "content": "Has anyone studied how companies have performed in previous halvings? Im looking at some exposure on the mining industry and im considering the 3 following stocks:-MARA-BITF-RIOTWhat's going to happen with these post halving? I've read BITF is the most efficient in the game. MARA has got the #2 biggest stack of crypto so im assuming they are going to be pretty wealthy to reinvest on their business. 13,396 BTC by MARA vs 385 by BITF. RIOT got 6,974 BTC. Of course there are more things than holding BTC on a mining business. Apparently BITF got some cool proprietary technology.I would like to hear the view of someone that actually has money in the game or is considering making an investment. Some of these are around 100 to 200% up this year already. How higher could they go before it becomes ridiculous to get in?",

The price of shares of mining companies directly depends on the price of Bitcoin, and over the past month the price of shares of mining companies and Bitcoin has been growing symmetrically.",

      "body": "It may seem like a good bet that the rise in the price of Bitcoin will encourage these companies to avoid selling their Bitcoin, especially during the coming year, and given that Bitfarms (BITF) is less exposed to the possibility of the Fed cutting interest rates due to its deleveraging campaign, I find that buying Bitcoin and investing in MARA It may give you a good chance to make a quick profit.It is not investment advice and I do not advise you to go out of your way to invest long-term in these stocks.",

      "body": "I am also of the opinion to buy bitcoin rather than buying companies that are mining bitcoin. They are exposed to the risk of price drop in halving and government regulations on miners. While buying bitcoin has lesser risk than that.I am personally interested in investing in a mining setup - buying their shares but this is different, here you are buying stocks of the company not the mining setup and what costed it to be developed - there is a subtle difference here.But I have failed to see any such mining setup and investments in the same till date that are legit and have not been scams.",

The average miner has very few opportunities to buy cheap ASICs and get a good price for electricity, so most new small miners will now find it very difficult to compete with large mining companies.Buying bitcoins or shares of mining companies is an individual choice. The stock market is more regulated by law, and many investors find it easier to buy shares while there is no Bitcoin ETF.",

I think could mining is definitely the hot space right now. It's constantly advancing and these mining stocks are proving to be a great way to gain BTC exposure without actually buying the coin",
