  "content": "Hello all, looking for some help. I opened a TRUST wallet account some time ago and transferred USDT from Crypto Exchange. I then was automatically placed in staking activities. At the end of staking, upon trying to return my funds to my wallet, I was notified by customer service I have to pay 62,000+ USDT in capital gains taxes (I am based in Chicago). They are now holding my funds until I pay this tax. I currently have about 315,000 USDT in this wallet. Is this standard practice? I don't have these funds to pay the taxes and my funds will be frozen soon. I can't get a loan for this amount. Is there anything I can do?",

Also, if its the legit site they won't ask another payment for tax deducting your balance is enough since you already have 300k usdt there. What i mean isÂ  it's a scam attempt to scam you more. And i doubt that trustwallet really do such kind if service. So mentioned the url of the site if you care.",

But why is it that it's making me feel that this isn't the right TrustWallet that you've downloaded?Because if it's related to your taxes, any wallet don't have a thing or two to say and that's your responsibility on filing it. Why they're interfering with someone's taxation if they're not an auditing firm but just a bare wallet? From your story, what was the exchange where you've transferred it from? And what's the website where you've downloaded TrustWallet? Because like they say above me, they wouldn't do such holding of funds and ask you to pay them.It's a typical scam and how did the TrustWallet reached out to you?",

Is there anything I can do?If I can understand you better, you transferred some usdt to Trust wallet and your usdt was automatically staked?For me, Thats not trust wallet because trust wallet is a non custodial wallet. You need to approve anything before it can be done. Only centralised wallet like exchange wallet can do that. Or maybe you are dealing with a scam wallet.",

They said upon completion of paying this tax, they will give me an ETH award double the tax (125091 USDT). And I have only 3 days to complete then there will be a 1% fee.

That's no doubt about it, but I'm 100% sure he's been scammed. I remember when I first started investing online, I was looking for HYIPs that paid high interest, and I was in a similar situation. I can't withdraw my money, and every time I request to withdraw, they ask me to deposit more money to open the withdrawal function. As a newbie, I naively believe and follow, but everyone knows what the outcome is. But I'm more careful than OP, I just try to invest with 20-30$, not big numbers like OP.",

I don't know what to do.Some of the pig butcher sites don't spend much or bother about SEO to rank on google. Like OP said, he trusted someone online who introduced him to the site. Most often they target dating sites and build trust with their victims before referring them to the site. Sadly, it's another loss for the cryptocurrency market. If the money was invested mainly into cryptocurrency it would have helped the network. But, the urge of making quick money in crypto without prior skills has pushed many people to fall into such scams. The only help I can render to you OP is to always research about sites on scambuster sites and also don't trust most people you met online, you see some have bad intentions for you. Stay safe.",
