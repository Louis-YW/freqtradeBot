  "content": "Hello Bitcointalk community,We are excited to introduce Endless Runner Fish Coin (ERFC), a GameFi project that combines endless runner-style gameplay with blockchain technology and cryptocurrency rewards.As a player, you control a fish swimming through an endless underwater world, dodging obstacles and collecting coins. But what makes ERFC unique is its use of blockchain technology to create a decentralized, player-owned economy. Players can earn ERFC coins ($ERFC), which can be used to buy in-game items, trade with other players, or be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.The use of blockchain technology also ensures that all transactions are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. Additionally, ERFC features a staking mechanism that allows players to earn additional ERFC by staking their coins for a certain period of time. This incentivizes long-term holding of ERFC and helps to stabilize the value of the currency.Tokenomics:Name: Endless Runner Fish CoinSymbol: ERFCBlockchain: BSC BEP20Max Supply: 10 billionCirculation Supply: 2 billionContract: 0xBe055654011E1FD1CC141F96Bb2edAe4930dCa28In addition to being a fun and engaging game, ERFC offers real rewards through cryptocurrency.
