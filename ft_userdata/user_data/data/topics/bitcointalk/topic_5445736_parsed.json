From what I've seen people go from higher to lower rates all the time most likely because it's better than being vacant. It's worth nothing that most people probably know CM's rate was above average hence previous CM participants just went back to current average rates which I'm guessing has been followed by campaigns for some time already. The competition has also been increasing over the years, I would say posters who couldn't keep up has been weeded out over time as well. But since CM is a big campaign mostly filled with top posters plus it all happened in less than a week, it was more impactful/noticeable.",

And if their campaign ends, they can easily hop to another campaign if there are available slots, and managers are all too willing to welcome them aboard, provided they are the kind of posters that the campaign is looking for. Otherwise, even if they are brilliant posters, I guess the managers would prefer other applicants.

Most people use the Signature earning as a pocket money or as a wage for part time work and they are satisfied with what the get. Also, when you see that people are working blindly for bounties, where nothing is grantee if they will get any valuable tokens or not, working is signature campaigns is far better and people are willing to work.Also i remember that in the past Campaigns used to play in bitcoin without calculating its dollar value, but ever since the bitcoin price has raised, campaigns will pay in term of dollar value, the equivalent bitcoin.",
