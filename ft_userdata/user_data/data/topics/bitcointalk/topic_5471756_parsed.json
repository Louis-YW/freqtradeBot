Granted it might differ in the future, but they're most likely the more solid options compared to the rest of the coins out there. There are other good altcoins out there as well, albeit a bit less influential I guess if I were to pick a word for it. I'm mostly looking at MATIC, LTC, and maybe XRP as well for a bit of a short term or so. Anyway, I reckon any of the top 10 is a solid pick, just don't expect much profit immediately though.",

The support that it has got is also increasing and I also use it for transactions because it's cheaper and like any other quick transfers, it's quick as well. I think with all of these connections that each project has been doing like to have another support from different chain, that's making each of them known in the market and also helps to ease the fees although they're not truly expensive at all.",

Because I have seen some reason that made me to apply for long term in this little shift of the price of altcoins which the bull run will show up fully next week.Aside from the almighty Bitcoin, I can say that only Ethereum so far is the best altcoin to hold this season and in many years to come. I do not know about BNB, XRP, ADA, LINK and the other fellow top-tier altcoins in the market. In my own instinct, these altcoins other than ETH are just good for either short or mid-term results. Why I only root for Ethereum for the long term? It is because they are currently the best in terms of building Dapps on top of their market capitalization, trading volume and usage of the ecosystem despite that their gas fees aren't that cheap even if they have transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). They are now impossible to be overtaken because of their usage despite that we acknowledge about XRP briefly overtaken them years ago not just once but twice or thrice. As of this moment, Ethereum is already solid at the #2 spot next to Bitcoin.",

Because I have seen some reason that made me to apply for long term in this little shift of the price of altcoins which the bull run will show up fully next week.Take a look at the coin market cap. at least we can see some data that might be useful. Although it's not absolute. However, when it comes to altcoins for the long term, Ethereum will definitely be in first place. because however, when we look at the fundamentals, and of course the market cap, this is no longer in doubt compared to other altcoins. So in my opinion, ETH is the first altcoin that you should own to prepare for long term holding later.Next up is BNB. I think this coin from the Binance exchange is also quite promising for future bullish preparations. apart from the market cap, perhaps you could say that BNB is still quite affordable if we want to buy some.actually, I also thought about another altcoin, namely Matic. However, I personally am still testing for long term holding until the next bullish era. So, maybe this will be a little more risky. because after all, this coin is quite interesting and has quite a high market cap, even though compared to several altcoins above it, Matic is still number 13. But this should have quite good potential to rise in the future.",
