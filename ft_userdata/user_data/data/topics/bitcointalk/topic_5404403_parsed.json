This one could really be applied effectively on physical casinos/gambling places but not totally on online casinos which people could always have the access if they wanted to thats why its not totally that effectivebut at least the government do really shows up some action on fighting or being that in concern about gambling addiction which is something that you cant really see that government do take out someaction in regarding on this manner.It might not really be that efficient or fully effective in terms of stopping addiction but at least this is a good initiative.Exclusions are options if someone do really want to take some break but the best thing or weapon to have on fighting addiction is on how you would gonna control yourself.",

Another things problem, online gambling activity are really hard to \"self-exclusion\" because the person still can coming back by un-blocking the site, register with new account or playing in other site.IMO, still hard.",

But I overall like the idea to control the whole Gambling addiction. Thoughts? It's good news really, effective self exclusion - like allowing a player to block themselves from a site for 6 months, 1 year or even 5 years should be required for every single gambling site that wants to be responsible. They make plenty enough money as it is and there should be no way to reverse the block until the time runs out. Effective enforcement is required but VPN's do allow a way around it. More countries should act like America in that respect, stating that any gaming operators targeting Australian citizens better comply otherwise they will be prosecuted if they step foot on Australian territory and it has the advantage that it is a desirable place to visit. If every country had this sort of setup then the problem side of gambling would gradually reduce.",

You know how some casino's are very aggressive in their marketing and don't care about if a user is trying to quit or not, this will put them in check. This development will be most beneficial to individuals who truly want to quit gambling due to personal reasons.Â Some people know they really need help and are well aware that they are not disciplined enough or can't help themselves effectively unless being assisted, this program by the government can solve that challenge and be of assistance to them. I like the method indicated by the government on how they intend to be of assistance by going after casinos that try to lure back users who are trying to quit by sending mails offering bonuses to individuals who voluntarily included themselves in the self exclusion list. This will make casinos direct their effort to people who have not opted for self exclusion and let those who have opted for it leave in peace.",

It's good thing, but first of all you should understand yourself that you have gambling addiction and it's big problem. Without it, nothing won't help. Same like with other addictions.But at the same time such register have weak points - it's so easy to bypass it. It only works with casinos registered in that country (Australia in this case). So, you can simply use foreign casinos without any issues. Or crypto casinos, obviously.",

Last month if memory doesn't betray me there was a case of someone here on the forum who was addicted and deleted his account in one of the casinos and then accidentally the casino sent him an email with some promotion and the addicted guy came to complain, maybe this measure of the australia government will be useful in these cases",

And then the responsibility, it will be a 3 way party, the gamblers themselves, the gambling casino, and then the regulators or the government. If just one of them didn't participate then this program will be a complete failure, in my opinion.",

I didn't know they were so far behind on the issue. In other countries there has been a national database for many years, so if you exclude yourself, you are not allowed to enter any casino in the country. This serves to some extent but the gambler can always find a way to gamble again. For example in a cryptocurrency casino without KYC.In the end, those who have problems with gambling have to develop self-control not to gamble or even seek psychological help because all these responsible gambling features, even if they help a little, are not the solution to the problem.",

In this way we can be sure that the gamblers turning themselves in on the self-exclusion program would have no other way but to really keep their gambling addiction to themselves, and be forced to look for a new hobby that doesn't include gambling. I believe the Australian government can do this, and hopefully a collaboration between nations to keep a list of people in self-exclusion program can be made available and be kept safely to curb gambling addiction across the world.",

Unfortunately a very addicted gambler will find every time a way to escape from such rule  (likewise playing with other user account or just ask to a friend to place a bet for him). but this is a first step to really fight addiction in gambling. Of course crypto-gambling sites are excluded from this law... and we know it's very easy bet with crypto . I just hope this is will not become a \"trojan horse\" to force KYC even in this field!",

Self-exclusion can only be effective if the person themselves admits that they are a gambling addict.Â  this is the biggest challenge of self-exclusion.Â  Aside from that, a gambler should be able to identify what a gambling addict is.Â  If he can't he cannot admit that he has a gambling disorder so I think a nationwide campaign of gambling disorder awareness should be launched together with the self-exclusion plan.",

But I overall like the idea to control the whole Gambling addiction. Thoughts? Self exclusion is an utter rubbish! Gambling becomes problem gambling only when the gambler is unable to control his gambling habit as he/she lacks the willingness to control the habit. So if someone is lacking the willingness, will he/she self exclude from gambling platforms? Unless their family members are forcing them to self exclude, they wouldn't do it willingly. Also crypto gambling is global in nature and isn't governed by country specific regulations. So even after the self exclusion, problem gamblers can head towards crypto gambling. Problem gambling needs medical attention and psychological support. Nothing else can help!",

Self-exclusion will work 99.99% okay for online casinos but I doubt if I can say the same for land based casinos. As a matter of fact, it was in the news some weeks ago that the Dutch Gambling Authority was going to investigating some gambling operators for failure to check and prevent players who registered on the Cruks self-exclusion scheme from gaining access control in slot machine arcades1. I bet we might see some occurrence of this situation in Australia. I hope they can find a way to nip it in the bud before it ever happens. 1. https://casinobeats.com/2022/06/17/ksa-initiates-slot-arcades-investigation-as-role-model-ad-ban-looms/",
