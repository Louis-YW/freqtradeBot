So its possible that everyone will see it. Hoping that newbie will check it out cause what theymos wrote there is really helpful advice and a very nice realization and fact on asset holding our tokens and coins.",

This is just the worst thing, the market has gone through difficult times; bitcoin dropped to 3k, Luna crashed which affected Bitcoin price, China banned Bitcoin, Celsius disputes etc, but this situation right here is unbearable. Companies that trusted investors money on FTX are facing hard times too. This bankruptcy not only did it affect FTX, it has ruined good businesses and the effect of it like thermos said will continue to spread out to other companies. The only remedy, is taking your funds out from any online company and save them in a wallet.",

However \"not your keys not your coins\" advice is has been repeated for a bunch times before Theymos put this warning, I think they're deserve to lose their coins since they're careless and don't care with be your own bank phrase.",

Of course, this is a repetition of information and also a reminder. I didn't even notice that theymos embedding some pretty important up-to-date information related to recent events.There's nothing wrong with the OP about a non-breaking loop, it's a reminder to those who don't focus on the main embed. and this thread also helps us all discuss what theymos explained because in the main thread the thread can only be seen and cannot comment.Discussing the essence of the announcement, Theymos reminds us not to save our money or assets in online accounts that we cannot fully control. It is best to store it in a private wallet which of course only we have access to. Bankruptcy will occur if we keep all the money or assets in an online account and the account website disappears and goes bankrupt, then our money will also disappear.",

Important Announcement as it is made looks pretty good. regardless of whether new members will read it or not. information has been embedded.",

So it's only the newbies who are some weeks old will not likely detect such pinned announcement by the theymos.

One might think there's always a link there about anything. However, what's in the link is also something anybody must have stumbled upon in the news, whether mainstream business or finance news or crypto-related online news sites. It is even all over social media. I guess this is just the admin doing his part in spreading awareness. Also, even if a newbie doesn't click on the link, the reminder is already there, concise and on point!",
