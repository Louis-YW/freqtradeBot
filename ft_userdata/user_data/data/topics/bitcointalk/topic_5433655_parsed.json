In whatever field one wants to pick an investment in!You can always pick an investment in whatever field whe you want to, there doesn't have to be a timing to it and I think at age 28, your pretty young and have got a lot of future ahead of you. By all means, buy some coins and see how you could secure it for a far longer term. You sure would be doing yourself some actual favour than seating on the sidelines due to age and whatever reason you could think of.",

Grab the opportunity while bitcoin was still considered in a price correction. It is 2 or 3 years more left I feel there is a big event in the market, after the next halving which commonly the price to go up and have a bull market condition. [strike while the iron is hot]",

Its not about age but the ability to invest or have knowledge on something they are interested about.There are many reasons why someone would want to invest, and one of them is as savings for old age or maybe for the next generation [children and their families]. So age shouldn't be the main reason why someone doesn't want to invest, so anyone can do it at any age now unless their health condition is no longer possible.Michael J. Saylor, he is 57 years old now and he is an entrepreneur who is known for consistently investing in bitcoin until today. So I mean, it can always be done but it also takes preparation and the important point is how to secure the assets.",

The things I am gonna hear on the forum...  Seriously, I would say that 28 yo is the perfect time to start investing because if you are much younger than that, you probably don't even have much extra money to invest in because it takes time to finish education and find yourself a good job that can enable you that. Don't stress yourself with that and instead seize the opportunity to acquire bitcoin at discount.",

We are still in 14th year, which means it still remains another 14th year to get to that time. It is not worth to think about, what we should think about is the present.
