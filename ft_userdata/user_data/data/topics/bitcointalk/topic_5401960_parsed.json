Here we can see that the USDT claim is not completely 1:1 with the Dollar. Ifinex Inc company which owns Bitfinex Exchange as a company from Hong Kong Cash Only 3 - 5% in US Dollar backup and the rest is United States government bonds and private government bonds.In fact, we see that the strength of the 1:1 value is actually demonstrated by USDC with Circle holdings joining Coinbase, namely 100% Cash and US government short-term bonds. What's interesting is whenever it can be redeemed. In my opinion, USDC's resistance is much better than USDT which is currently showing weakness. Plus the biggest companies like BlackRock and Fidelity also invest in USDC.",

But in the Luna case it was not that's why it de pegged and then didn't recover on time.",

Agree with you, see the movement of people who panic with what they have to incur huge losses. There are some people who can't avoid the panic that builds up inside of them. So you should continue to see the latest charts about the coins you currently have. But I've also been at a loss for the past few months.",

In theory, in design, 1 USDT is backed by 1 USD.The attack on USDT comes after the massive meltdown of so-called algorithm stable coin UST. Then this attack on USDT makes people panic and sold their USDT to get USD. It is kind of bank run but USDT is strong and it holds its peg so far.Historically, it is not the first time USDT falls like that. In the past, it even fell more. You can zoom out and see some more dramatic falls of USDT.",

Many crypto users are now choosing BUSD and USDC. because these two Stablecoins conduct regular audits.Meanwhile, USDT in terms of audit, regulation and underlying storage is less transparent. so many sell it and switch to USDC and BUSD. maybe this is also one of the reasons.

That being said, it definitely is not creating a lot of trust and confidences towards USDT when a bear market like the one that we are experiencing in the last few weeks is enough to make the price go below 1 USD for a few weeks already now. Like others in this thread already mentioned i also think that the problem is that the company behind USDT has not enough money anymore to directly back every USDT with a real USD. They just have reserves and those reserves are not so easy to reach and so fast to cash out in order to keep the price at 1$.",

      "body": "Quote from: hugeblack on June 10, 2022, 09:50:55 PMwhy USDT not back to 1?Well I will answer as simple as possible, but this is up to you. From my search for a question: why is USDT not returning to the price of $1? This statement or at the same time an answer published 4 years ago by the Former Co-founder of Tether himself. Whether that's true or not, I don't really know.Here's how simple it is: QuoteThe short answer for why Tether does not trade for exactly USD $1 but instead fluctuates in price - close to by not exactly USD $1 - is because Tether is not literally USD $1. Tether is a derivative representing USD $1. Each Tether is backed by USD $1. But to redeem a Tether for USD $1 would require effort or as an economist would say ‘transaction costs’. For this reason one would expect Tether to trade below its redeemable value of USD $1. But why then does Tether sometimes trade above USD $1? This occurs because it is much easier for someone holding crypto currency - who is urgently seeking the perceived safe harbor of less volatile fiat money - to acquire a fiat-like crypto (ie Tether) than it is to acquire actual fiat. This is why when you see Tether trading above USD $1 it is nearly always when blood is in the water in crypto land and people holding cryptos are desperate to move into a perceived safer asset.https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Tethers-price-fluctuate-around-one-dollar-by-half-a-cent-or-less-and-not-stay-exactly-put-at-one-dollarIs that enough to get rid of your doubts?",

This is evidenced by this data:Also, additional reasons could be the capitalization outflow from USDT and the massive sales of tokens on exchanges with the subsequent transition to other assets. Also you should not forget that now there is a big demand for USDT withdrawal, and USDT is not 100% secured with fiat money, this may create difficulties in funds withdrawal.",
