Therefore when it comes to reputation, I'd also consider how one does their business or should I say their ethics? especially if I wanna prevent ledger-styled surprises lol.In short, my take is, find an alternative first for your use case. Now, if you must use this, keep the amount small.",

Oppositely if they hack a person, what they get will be smaller if they don't know what that person owns. I am not discussing about targeting like a millionaire or a billionaire, just a random person and reward should be small even if you successfully hack into an individual device or account.Because of potential big things from a system hack, hackers will aim at systems like cloud storage, a corporate data base and similar big systems. I agree that storing sensitive personal information, wallet seed, wallet passwords in cloud is bad. It is worse when it is done by a big system, a wallet and I don't advice anyone to do this individually.Using Nunchuk wallet and accept that risk, it is your choice. I don't choose it because I have better wallets without risk from cloud storage, backkup. I am fully responsible for my keys, my backups and my coins. I am fully aware that if I lose my keys, my backups, I will lose my coins but I don't want to lose my coins because I trust a third party and it fails to serve me.",

But they're wrong on that, until they see the problems that lies with these wallets that have been backing up the seeds on the cloud although it's just an opt-in, I still don't like a wallet to have this feature. They're breaking the purpose of what seeds and private keys are for and it should have been kept only by the owner, not with a cloud storage or any other third party.",

Shamir's secret sharing (SSS) is an algorithm that securely splits your private key or seed into several parts and then you can assemble those parts back to the seed.Instead of splitting your seed in two which is bad advice and reducing its entropic strength, it's better to use Shamir's secret sharing (SSS).However, there is much discussion that using multi-signature addresses is better than Shamir's secret sharing (SSS).You can find the discussions here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5433064.0https://medium.com/bitbees/shamirs-secret-sharing-or-multisig-why-not-both-ad1be6dbccffI searched for any details about providing a cloud service, and I did not find it, on the contrary, from the same article I found.QuoteNever make digital copies of your recovery seed or recovery shares. Never upload it online!What happens if I lose so many recovery shares that I can't meet the required threshold?If you canât meet the required threshold, your wallet will become unrecoverable. Â For example: if you use a 3-of-4 scheme, where 3 is the required threshold to recover the wallet, and you lose 2 or more of the recovery shares, your wallet will be unrecoverable.
