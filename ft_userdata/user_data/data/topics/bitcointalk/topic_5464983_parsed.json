On the other hand btc and eth both are the best coins ever and you are 100% safe. Also you must have collected bad tokens from bounty which are constantly dead. According to me after getting bounty token no risk should be taken and when u get decent normal money sell them and buy and hold best coins like btc or eth.",

I won't disagree that most altcoins have made people millionaires in a single shoot upward, which has drawn more attention to them than bitcoin, which has a higher success rate. No matter how you communicate it to people, they will choose what will make them rich overnight. They can find it in some altcoins, but the danger is larger and might cause you to lose more than you can think if you buy in the wrong choice.  Not only may greed and ignorance lead to mistakes, but so can the altcoin you've chosen to invest in.",

Risks is more higher but the rewards or possible profits is high too and this what sparks their interest on why they would be investing on something like this despite of the higher risks. There are people who do really get used to deal with high risks higher reward of things which they dont bother on whats the thing that in front of them.Invest on what you can afford to lose as always on which on this way this is the only thing that you could really at least assure that you wont really be getting wrecked up on the timethat things turns out to be messy.",

Thats why doing bounty is make sure whay you choose is worth it to do cause youll gonna do some effort for the tokens. When it comes to investment. Doing one with bounty programs isnt suitable cause it might not be progress but its case to case basis.Maybe picking top tier project as investment is wiser than newly projects with unknown reputation.

Many altcoin investor they not invest for long term and take profit when hype moment only and then leaves that coins looking for another promising altcoin for investing. Many new project launching can give us chance awhile to earn profit but all investor never take risk with long term investment, they are investing with short term after hype moment ended all new coins investment have been sold.",

Scamming always happen on new tokens alts so better not to listen to any hype createf by devs or other fellow token holders.Believing on top alts to hold is best decision since those coins already gain popularity and have solid community so we can expect something good to it if we decide to hold those top alts.",

But anyone can invest his money wherever they want.Actually it's depends upon project and it's hype. I remembered many bounty Tokens which rised 20x-30x from the time of distribution. Binance also listed some coins. after 2021 when market crashed then very fewer good project launched, investors afraid to hold and all ICO, Private sell users selling their coins thus you will see only dump in these bounty coins. I think better idea when you receive tokens is to sell 80% or 50% if you think that project is good and could do something extraordinary but if you think that there is no hype than sell and book profit. I am holding CRP(crypton) for  long term which i recieved from review and hope it will increase in future, if its not then no tention because still i got it without investment. That's quite right, BTC and ETH is considered safest coins so far. Many people talked against Eth when it's migrated from Pow to Pos but i think Eth is still best coins to hold for long term but it will not give you fast profit and you have to wait long.",
