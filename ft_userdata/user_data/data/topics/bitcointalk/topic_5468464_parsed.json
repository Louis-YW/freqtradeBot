  "content": "There are a lot of forum members, who spend their free time in this forum. And sometimes forum life need some fun for development, so I think admin must make virtual roulette in the meta board with free spins for all members. So forum member make free spins and win - either merits or next membership each day, even hero and legendary membership. So this will be more attractive forum and not so serious.The forum merits is one of the biggest admin mistakes, they are 100% useless, ( for example, forum member with IT higher education will almost always be step higher than any other member with just home made IT knowledge, so how can home educated forum member can give merits in IT field to member with university education ).Spammers and trash posters are present in all forums, also here - merit system can not help, if the member want to spam & trash, he/she will do it.Spam/trash is subjective too, for me this Economics board thread with many replies Has everyone become too pesimistic about the economy? for forum with international members is spam/trash, but at the same time other forum members may be like it.So I think this gamble roulette will make forum life more fun & happy.",

      "body": "Is this butt hurt I’m detecting here?Merit is useless? and a spin game that gives forum members the opportunity to win either merit or a higher rank would be better, Op sport to say but did you even sit down to think about your post before you posted it? How were you even able to come up with such an idea in the first place? I guess too much gambling has been affecting you lately.The reason for merit creation is to discourage spamming here in the forum, since spammers won’t be able to rank up if they continue with their posting style and to also encourage those that are contributing things that are related in a discussion so if you’re unable to earn merit then you need to sit down and reevaluate your post history and check if you yourself should that same type of post you have been making from a different user will you award them with merit? There’s no need for you to start bringing up dumb suggestions just because the merit system did not favour you. Trust me, there are many of use that came to the forum with zero to no knowledge of what bitcoin is or what the forum is but we took our time to learn and it did pay off, but nowadays instead of learning you’d rather just copy from different platforms and present it as yours or look for other ways to bypass the merit system.This suggestion of yours will not be put into consideration because the suggestion is basically useless so I’d advise you lock this thread and face reality because you’re going to receive so many bashes from this thread.",

It doesn't matter if you are higher educated or not; as long as you are contributing to the forum, you will get some merit as appreciation. Why do you need merits in the first place if you think it was a mistake by the admin to introduce the merit system? It looks like you are not happy that your useless post is not getting enough merit to rank up so that you can join the BTC-paid signature campaign. This forum is not to make someone's life happy. It's a place for newcomers to bitcoin to learn about it. There are many boards in the forum that serve different purpose and for people from different backgrounds. There is an economy board, speculation, trading discussion, meta, Games and Rounds, Gambling, local board, politics, bitcoin, and WO(where all the fun stuff is going on ). Anyone without an IT background can do better in the forum as well. I rank up from the beginning, and my educational background is not in IT.",

      "body": "You weren't here before the merit system was introduced. There are still spammers and trash posters in the forum, but the number has significantly increased. Just because you're unable to gain merit doesn't mean that the merit system is broken. It's not perfect by any means, but why don't you look at how you can improve yourself rather than blame the system instead? This forum has thousands of members, a huge number of whom have managed to rank up to the higher ranks. There's a decent chance that I won't rank up to Legendary anytime soon, but it's not the system to blame, and it's not really necessary, to be honest. Sr. and Hero member ranks are equally great, and the forum has an abundance of members in those ranks.A quick look at your posts and it's pretty safe to mention why you haven't gained more: little to no contribution in your replies, some with poor grammar and vocabulary mistakes (this is the least of the issues), one or two lines at most, and generally not creating any proper engagement with the forum. I don't mean to attack you, but your claiming that the merit system is a complete mistake is rather offensive, taking into account that you signed up a few months ago.",

Here I am with 3700+ merit, all self earned, no single one from airdrop when merit system kick-off.How did I do this?Learning and contributing. A message for you, no contribution, no merit.You will get same guide in Welcome messageQuoteIf you make ten thousand posts in a week, your activity will be capped and you will still be a Newbie. If you make ten thousand useless posts over any period of time, you will gain zero merit and you will still be a Newbie. You can rank up only by making good posts consistently. It's quality over quantity.When trying to write quality posts, a lot of people act as though they're writing a book report for school: putting facts that we already know into their own words. Nobody wants to read that, and you will not get merit for it. Moreover, the length of your post and the quality of your English are only minor factors. In trying to write a quality post worthy of merit, you should offer new ideas, personal experiences, or perspectives that other forum users will actually find new and interesting.",

Now we still have many posts made just to post something, just to get enough activity or reach a week quota in a signature campaign, but we have much much less meaningless content.
