Mine could be one of the unaccessed wallets and I wouldn't have to wait 10 years to get my coins.I think the assumption that everyone on central exchanges has their own wallets in form of a public-private key pair is wrong. Instead, there are several larger wallets from which the public keys for many users are simply derived and only assigned to an account in a database. This can also be easily observed in block explorers. Deposits are always forwarded to central wallets from which the payout is usually made.",

Are there ways to do this? As in, in case something happens to the exchange like Mt Gox. Why is the key accessible to a hacker but not to the owner of the coin? Why are there no exchanges giving users private keys?I think exchanges make use of some kind of wallet that generates multiple bitcoin wallet addresses, which could be enough to allocate funds to their customers. Each address is attached to a particular account, and when deposited, they can see it in their account. The exchange has access to this wallet, but the customers don't. This is the only way they can control the funds from their end. If hackers want to hack an exchange, they target the wallet or how to penetrate their data base and initiate withdrawals from their wallet, so it's not an individual account that's being hacked but that of the exchange wallet that is being penetrated. Maybe they have 10 or more cold wallets where they authorise their withdrawals; if one is being emptied, the others will still be safe, but you can tell which user fund is being touched and which is not touched because they send almost all user funds to their safe.",

Why are there no exchanges giving users private keys?If you want to have full control over your coins, then you should only store them in a self-custodial wallet; that's only how you can be in full control. Centralized exchanges don't generate private keys because that's how they are designed. If you have some coins on an exchange, what you can be more concerned about is your log-in details, which you must keep safe. In the past years, a few exchanges have been hacked, and investors who had their coins in those exchanges lost their funds. If exchange allows each user to have a private key, then it may be difficult for them to run smoothly.It's not a feature that can not be initiated on CEX; if it were possible, then it would have been done since, so don't even think of storing your coins on any centralized platform because it's not safe enough, as long as that coin is not in your custodial wallet.",

In non custodial you have a total control of your assets but in custodial.Quote from: OddJobsForBitcoin on January 25, 2024, 08:03:28 PMAs in, in case something happens to the exchange like Mt Gox. Why is the key accessible to a hacker but not to the owner of the coin? Why are there no exchanges giving users private keys?You are really funny about this. Exchange can never give you the private key.  That is why it is called a centralised exchange (CEX) because everything is handle by them. Your question is just like telling the bank to give you information to there data base which is not safe. One of the reason why CEX can't allow you to have total access to your fund is because they serve as a third party to every transaction you make. For example if you want to sell USDT on binance and money is paid to you why you haven't released the assets for sometime maybe you where drunk and forgot you where on a process of transaction, and the buyer of your USDT report you to binance, your assets will be transferred to your client without your notice. So that is the more reason dey have to control the CEX, incase similar issues like this will occore again.",

Why are there no exchanges giving users private keys?Because most of these exchanges are regulated, they are controlled by the government. You won't find any CEX that will give private keys to their users. Unless with DEX, we ourselves have control over the private key, and no KYC will be needed.The only advantage with CEX is that p2p transactions are fast, and DEX rarely has p2p features. When there are hacking issues on the CEX platform, your funds can be recovered just like in Binance. I don't know about other exchange platforms besides Binance. And with Dex, when there is a problem with hacking issues, the risk is quite high, and the recovery of our funds is unclear, as far as I know.",

Why are there no exchanges giving users private keys?When you put your money in banks, you can access your account through a password. The bank can decide to deny you access to your funds because you don't have control over your funds. This is because they gave you a password but not the keys to the bank vaults. This also relates to exchanges, because they don't give you keys to your funds rather you just have a password that might not even grant you access to your funds on some occasions. The only option for you to control your funds is to put your coins in a decentralised wallet and devise good means of keeping your keys safe.   Quote from: Orpichukwu on January 25, 2024, 09:27:14 PMQuote from: Knight Hider on January 25, 2024, 09:12:34 PMQuote from: OddJobsForBitcoin on January 25, 2024, 08:03:28 PMWhy isn't there a strategy to grab the private key from the exchange.

It seems people put large funds in exchanges because of ignorance. Most people don't know much about non-custodian wallets.
