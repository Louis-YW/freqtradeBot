Damn, it's gonna be worth a life time to wait.  Well, I don't think the Bitcoin community will allow that to happen, since we have very good and active developers that are working tirelessly to make things work. They will surely find a solution to it, though the LN has been a recent solution, but am not sure of how fast it will work for transactions like the one specified above.OP, you should know that your transactions and balance history can be viewed using the url on the image above. Incase you care about it, do well to blur or edit that part.",

It can be a bug from mempool.space. Fee rate used for the transaction is 15 sat/vbyte that is good if we see current mempools.https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,1w,weightThe attached image shows with 12 sat/vbyte, mempool.space estimates it might take ~ 10 minutes for confirmation. Even the site has conflict of information and how 15 sat/vbytes transaction can need 55 years more to be confirmed than a 12 sat/vbyte transaction?You can try it with different block explorers and see estimating time.https://blockchair.com/https://blockstream.info",

May this sarcasm be the driving force for the congestion problem to be finally solved.You can increase the fees if the network is congested or swap your Bitcoin to Bitcoin Liquid Network in Aqua wallet, so you can send Bitcoin without need to spend too much for the fees.As long as internet connection, device and other chains are available, Bitcoin will not become useless.Since Bitcoin is a free market, so it's always about supply and demand, if there's something wrong, people will try to fix the problem.",

Remember that mempool is NOT a queue, it is a competition. Whoever pays the most will have higher priority to get into the next block. So what you said is not possible because you would just pay a higher fee and get into the next block.Very high fees should not be able to last long either because theoretically if they do (eg. if you have to pay $100+ to transfer bitcoin every time for over a year) it will be the end of Bitcoin. Why would people use something that keeps getting more expensive to use when there can be an alternative that doesn't have the same problem (eg. a Bitcoin like decentralized payment system that doesn't allow spam attacks like Ordinals).We can see that already happening as people switch to using shitcoins for transactions. The only reason why people haven't mass abandoned bitcoin is because (1) fees don't remain high for long (2) the alternatives are terrible (centralized, mutable, useless, insecure,...). Things may not remain like this forever though...",

Damn, it's gonna be worth a life time to wait.  I don't think it's possible for a transaction to await confirmation for a period of 55 years that is about 28.5 × 10⁶ minutes? Like it's damn too long. Just like pooya87 mentioned, the mempool is actually a place of fee competition where transactions with bigger fees are given priority and thus confirmed faster. This means that the time it would take for your transaction to be confirmed using a particular fee depends on the level of competition in the block it was broadcasted.The only logical way to keep a transaction waiting that long is to use a fee as small as no fee at all. However, Op don't forget that although you can customise fees for your transaction via a nice wallet software like electrum, the nodes on the network have a minimal fee rate and if your transaction carries a fee less than that nodes will automatically drop your transaction thus purging it out of the Blockchain. This will prevent excess transactions waiting on the mempool. A transaction with the fee rate for 55 years will simply be a waste of computational and electric power to miners they would rather just. Drop it instead of wasting power to keep broadcasting it.",
