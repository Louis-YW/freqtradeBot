You don't just say, \"I'm going to give my money to this guy and I'm going to lose it,\" because you believe that your gambling will make you money because of your own analytical ability or luck.Let's put it this way;When you do a job for the first time and make money from this job, you ask yourself the question \"what if?\" Because your luck has gone well and when you make money from an area you don't know, especially from gambling, you gain self-confidence.Gambling is, of course, a money-making / losing mechanism that always involves risk. You will continue on your way in a way that minimizes this with the risk and amount that only you will determine, because it is in your hands again. Even if your friend or friend says stop it for you, psychologically, it is difficult for those who step into this addiction once to get out.Because here, when you look from the outside, it seems like easy money, but when you get into it, you realize that it is not always like that.Even if you have your last 1 dollar left, maybe with that 1 dollar you will start dreaming of becoming a millionaire.",

They would say you shouldn't have bet at all if you think you will lose. So, yeah, I agree that most gamblers are optimistic, at least those who are thinking of winning or looking forward to the prize before they even place a bet. But I don't think that this is a positive attitude. I've heard how a lot of people believe that one day they will hit the lottery and all their problems will be solved. I'm 100% certain that most of them will die without winning. Being optimistic without being realistic would make you blind.",

Betting money is more like a thrill that I add to simple games so I can enjoy it. I mean, who would actually enjoy a dice rolling around right? (Well, there might be one or two people who enjoy that, but most don't). Plus, blackjack and poker are fun games in of itself really since it's a PVP type of game. Well, I turned to sports gambling nowadays though so can't speak much about it. While I do believe that having such beliefs is good, I don't think that's the case for gambling. If it was a skill game then maybe. And additionally, such beliefs are actually a thing in a LOT of people, especially in competitive scenes like in sports. Mostly because that's their passion in life, and they put literally every hour of their lives in training.",

Gamblers have strong a positive mindset about their games, which has significantly boosted their streams of earnings from the system. Other than unwilling hobbies, gambling with hope tries for higher luck. It is very feasible to get a lot from the system, but only with luck, which explains everything. We bet to make money, we put in enough effort to get things right, but without luck, our planning may be rendered useless and our predictions incorrect. A further incentive for gamblers to keep winning is commitment.",

These people don't have the hope and confidence to win because they know they don't have a chance to win big. So they just choose and play gambling.But some gamblers are very careful about spending their money playing gambling and always avoid big bets and stop playing gambling when they have played enough. They also don't chase victory because they know that it's hard to do.Playing enough gambling allows him to control his emotions and keep his expenses from being too big. But indeed, gamblers are people who are passionate about trying to get a win. But we also have to know that gambling doesn't always get wins.",

Even when we come to the last bets we still hope for that \"lucky hit\" that will recover our balance with some extra profit...But after so many years of gambling, something that comes with experience, I guess most of us are also very realistic about gambling. We know our chances and it's not going to be a disaster if we lose... we know that things can go both ways in gambling in seconds/minutes.",

I think that is what drives gamblers to risk their money more. If they can somehow find that chance even though it's a super low percentage then they will do it. Also, it's the competitive spirit. Against the house it is almost impossible to win so they want to compete against that and prove a gambler can win even against the house.Gambling to win will always be their focus, some are doing it while having fun while others are just purely money-based objectives. But I agree with you, if we want to look for people who always want to win then the gambling industry might be the place for it.",

I can say that gamblers also have doubt and fear of losing along with their belief of winning. It is normal where people have both belief and doubt at the same time for anything they are going to do in life. As gambler, some time I have my own doubt when I started my gambling session, the positive thing from this doubt is that it helps me to control or even to cancel my gambling session. Belief of winning sounds like a good thing in gambling but it can be the one that lead gambler into something bad.",

I mean a gambler who is always sure of getting this win is just like he is too confident in gambling and it can be said that his life and death depend on gambling. this is very bad because in the long term or short term the person will be mentally and financially devastated because gambling is for the benefit of the gambling owner not for the customer and the customer profit from gambling is just entertainment.well, I admit that maybe someone is lucky to get a big win or like the case of someone who get a big jackpot from the lottery but I wonder if the big win is equivalent to the money lost in gambling? I do not think so.indeed, in gambling, you must always have faith and believe if you can win, but you don't need to overdo it, just think of it as entertainment with a little luxury that wants a little victory and if you lose, come back if you already have money left over.and there is no need to take the luck of winning big from gambling seriously.",
