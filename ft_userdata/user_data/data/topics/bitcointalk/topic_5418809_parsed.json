      "body": "I think the explanation for this is clearly stated in the image you posted, it reads that \"max bet exceeded\" which i personally believe to likely mean two things.1. Is either your account is limited to a certain number of bets or a certain amount(in dollars) which you can bet at a go, and it happens that your account have reached that limit, so this clearly explains the error .OR 2. The fight in question received an enormous amounts of bets already and Stake place a general limited, and that limit has been reached worldwide, which means that you might not be the only one that experienced this, so we wait to see if there are other users of stake that will complain of this same issue so as to confirm this assumption.But in a case where you are the only one who experienced this, then it simply means you have some limits on your account.",

It's pretty common for casinos to set limit to users who usually wins on certain games, on your case UFC games. The error message you've receive is self-explanatory and I suggest that you contact support about the limit set on your account as they are only people who can help you and explain more about limit set.",

I think you're missing the main point here - I don't need support to do that, I can place bets elsewhere on the MMA.All I'm saying is big guys show off their $100,000 bets on Stake and my UFC betting history has perhaps brought a net of $3k - $4k profits, not a huge amount - and still - already limited.That's the point here.How come Pinnacle for instance (or Fairlay) - they accept UFC bets without any (small) limits and Stake doesn't?Don't get me wrong - I want Stake to go to the next level, I want them to succeed, I am not against their site - we promote them on our sites and we would keep on doing so - but it's a shame they choose the limit option over options that their competitors are offering.That's the point this thread is trying to make.",

The title is misleading too, they accept bets but with only limited amount as seen on the screenshot.No I don't think it has been discussed many times here, and many players are not aware of it unfortunately. Moreover we have never seen a representative explaining why they are doing that, how it works precisely and how they decide to restrict one customer, until now.It's not a fair and honest practice to shadow ban customers without notifying them. They should at least be transparent with the customers and telling them for which markets and for which amounts they are restricted precisely.",

I think that will be able to answer a little about the curiosity of why he can bet a large amount when you don't even though it is on the same event.I checked he is a youtuber whose twitter account is followed by stake.com, my guess is they have a collaboration so they can have a very high limit bet but that's just my guess. What is certain is that it is because of the betting limit, because becoming a sponsor of the UFC will certainly not eliminate the betting limit of each player on the sports betting",
