I guess all we have to worry about now is the impending global recession and nuclear apocalypse.” Musk commented: “It sure would be nice to have one year without a horrible global event.”In the responses, another Twitter user proceeded to ask Musk about the current global economic situations, asking that:“How long do you think the recession will last?” The Tesla boss replied: “Just guessing, but probably until spring of ’24.”",

      "body": "That’s when the next bitcoin halving happens so that works out well for me if that is when the recession lasts until.It seems reasonable to be honest, I don’t even think most governments have publicly accepted that we’re in one yet so it will take some time until things get better.",
