  "content": "So here was a very intriguing encounter that I had, about 3 or 4 months ago. I was in the sauna in LA fitness and it was just me and one other guy in there. All of the sudden he started talking to me, had some very positive things to say about my \"energy\" he said he liked my energy and that he could tell that I had some big things in store in my future. Very intrigued I questioned him on this and asked him what he did for a living. He told me \" Its my job to usher in the next payment system into the world\". After talking to him more and more about it, it turned out that this guy was traveling country to country making huge deals in BTC with high ranking government officials. He kept saying that its his job to keep BTC in \"Sovereign hands\" I found this all very interesting. He elaborated some more saying that the CIA was the group that really created BTC. He went on to speak about the white hats and the black hats in the CIA, aka the good guys and the bad guys, and that basically the whole agency was at war with itself. Crazy wild stuff here. Just an average day out at the gym for me, lmao. Anyhow, I finally got a chance to write it down and talk about it. I could go way more in depth but I don't want to sound crazy here, a lot of what was mentioned truly had me a little taken back. Like what if what he was saying was true, he said that the best way to play the field is to play both sides of the coin, to ensure your success, because then at that point no matter what you would do you would win. I don't know if anything what he said was true that night, but i'll tell you one thing, it sure was entertaining.  Has anyone else had any strange encounters like this?",

      "body": "sauna's cause dehydration and thus at extremes hallucinations and delusionsin short.. expect weird conversations with people in sauna's, dont take what people say in sauna's as fact..the story (guy creating reputation by saying he talks with top level people)seems scammyhe then giving investment advice to show good planning.... all that is missing is the pitch part where he say he will do it for you if you just hand him the funds.. and then.. you never see him again..as for the trade advice (ignoring the first and last parts)i too would play it both sideshaving a reserve of btc and reserve of fiatwhen the btc price is low 'sell some of your fiat, buy btc'when the btc price is high 'sell some of your btc, buy fiat'that way you are always \"accumulating\" in one stash of value or another. and if timing it right you end up accumulating both. and not missing any opportunity on the ups or the downs..just dont hand funds to guys you just met in a sauna. invest it yourself properly. \"self-sovereign\" not \"stranger-stealing\"",

He kept saying that its his job to keep BTC in \"Sovereign hands\" I found this all very interesting.I'm sorry, but this doesn't seem like a legit story to me. What's the point of travelling countries in order to set big BTC deals in person?Can't the \"high ranking government officials\" simply use a big crypto exchange(or a DEX) to buy/sell Bitcoins?The conspiracy theory about Bitcoin being created by the CIA will keep lurking around the internet forever. So far, nobody had found any legit evidence that CIA created Bitcoin. I assume that the guy you were talking to was a little bit delusional.I don't believe that a random guy would just meet me somewhere and start talking about his business. What if I was a criminal and that guy told me that he owns lots of Bitcoin? I would probably kidnap him and ask for a ransom.  Telling random strangers about your business is a stupid move.",

It seems to me that you have a very vivid imagination and that you are selling us stories for small children - because your story is nothing but a poorly conceived fantasy. Given that you have already had strange topics involving drugs, lost friends and multi-million dollar deals, I would say that this story is constructed on old conspiracy theories that some three-letter agency invented Bitcoin - and now some strange people are walking around fitness centers and reveal top secrets to complete strangers - don't make fun of us, we're not all that naive.",

(I know what he wrote on that matter). At that time, it was obviously important for him to earn an easy $3000, and a few years later he showed that he did not even know how to verify a signed BTC message and believed that some scammer is Satoshi. No, I don't think that Bitcoin is an invention of any agency with three or four letters, because they basically were and still are very unintelligent for such things. If terrorists roam the country for months or even years and then steal passenger planes and carry out attacks across the US, then it is clear how much IQ those who work in such agencies have.",

Sure, he's having some sort of veeery secret mission but suddenly, he's telling YOU all his secrets. Secrets, no one has information of, at least outside their group (must be a lot of people to keep it secret, especially if CIA is at war with itself and it's a pure coincidence no one from these 2 opposed CIA groups has exposed the other group publicly so far...). And you are the lucky one who gets told about it. Maybe you'll meet a Nigerian prince tomorrow in your LA Fitness Sauna as well and you'll get rich.  Quote from: tread93 on March 02, 2023, 03:50:38 AMHas anyone else had any strange encounters like this?

Currently, it's just a playground, where big hands launder money, nothing has been applied in practice, it's all just a money game. I also agree with your thoughts, bitcoin could very well become a tool of war, and politics like gold or oil today.",

I assure you that this conversation happened. Think whatever you want to think, I don't have time to convince you. This is my life, and the things that transpire in it I have little control over. Particularly with the people that I meet, I never expected to have this conversation. And to shed more light on this we were only in the sauna for 10 minutes because the LA was closing and we continued the conversation out front after 10pm when it closed. The only thing that I can say, is that if this man was a con man he was pretty good one. He had photo evidence of himself with the queen of england, putin, the golden dragon, and so much more. He was showing me crazy pictures of himself in rooms full of gold, and boxes filled with trillions of dollars worth of goverment bonds. I can't make this shit up lol. He did mention he was a truste for all the royal families. All wild stuff, and why the heck would he be telling some random stranger he met in the sauna all this? Beats me man. He did mention he has nobody to talk about any of this, and he felt good about my energy so maybe thats why? lol idk man. But I appreciate your concern here Lucius, i'm trying to live in the real world here and go about my business. Every day the real world gets crazier and crazier!",
