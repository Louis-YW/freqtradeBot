How can you prove that it's no longer good? Unless you're living in a place where it's not really ideal, location is the key to it.Aside from real estate, there's no need to go that far for you to look for another investment. You're in a bitcoin forum and you know where you can invest better and that's with bitcoin.",

I don't know what's your main purpose but if you are only wanna promoting the scam platform like that and this is not a good place.",

Cryptocurrency real estate is still very profitable and very secure as the value of cryptocurrency can change quickly. This means that bitcoin may decline in value or rise in price. You never know what could happen. However, buying an asset is equivalent to trading a volatile asset for a more secure one.",

Here's the link ro their site: https://intelfin.io/Lol, if the \"profits are promised\" then why do they have to \"sell it to the users\"? Why don't they trade themselves and make all those profits? Because, no, the profits aren't guaranteed nor are they promised. Hence they sell their \"bots\"/\"platforms\" to their users where they charge some small fees for every trade executed. So yeah, it is a promised profit for the owners of the platform, not the users. They earn all those profits without taking any risks.",

Maybe try to research more since for sure you can learn a lot of things in real estate if you are really willing to learn about it. Also the site you link here us obviously scam so I guess you better not to try because scammers offer promising profits so that they can scam people.",

Investment depends on either long term holdings or short term holding, for me when it comes to long term investment I invest in the top coins on coinmarketcap because these coins are among what makes cryptocurrency what it is today. While for the short term investment I invest in low sat coins which have little awareness on the market and once am able to make a little profit I sell off till I see other ones. To me I believe each trader has his/her own mode of investment and the best thing is to always follow your instinct.",

Investment is not all about get rich quick, most of such investment don't usually last long, if you are prepared to take such risk with your money you are at liberty to do so, but since you ask for help am giving it to you freely without any cost.",
