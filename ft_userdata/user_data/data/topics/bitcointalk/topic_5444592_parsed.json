      "body": "Quote from: cafter on March 12, 2023, 03:33:07 PMis it right to say nonce is just a number/ attempt at which the block is successfully mined, ?To an extent, yes.After miners have created a candidate block, they double hash the block header and see if the result meets the current target. If not, then they increment the nonce by 1 and try again.However, the nonce is only a 32 bit number, giving around 4.3 billion possibilities. Big miners can exhaust this in a fraction of a second. And so there are other fields which can also be changed by the miner in order to create more possibilities for them to run through in order to find a successful block. The most commonly used additional fields are the extraNonce part of the coinbase transaction, and the timestamp.",

That being said the difficult part of mining is finding the solution via the nonce or some other manipulate-able part of the block.",

Mining is about constructing a new block in the chain and setting the header in a way that this 80-byte construct has a specific hash lower than the target. In each block header there are 5 fields: version, previous block header hash, merkle root hash, block time, target, nonce. From these fields the previous hash and target are fixed while the rest are variables with version and time having some limits. As I said the miner finds a combination of these that has the desired hash. For example by changing the transactions in the block or their orders the miner can change the merkle root hash hence change the header hash.Quote from: MIner1448 on March 15, 2023, 05:59:03 PMEach block contains data about new transactions, as well as a special code called \"nonce\" You are getting some terminology wrong, blocks contain transactions not some data about them.
