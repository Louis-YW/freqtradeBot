But how did Elon notice this meme? No matter how many potential memes there are, I personally only trust shiba and doge, other than that the rest of the memes are really unreliable.",

It had a pre-sale for quite some time which turned out to be a huge success.Totally they raised $19M from beta sale and presale so you are right to call it as a huge successful crowd sale.QuoteAccording to the website, the \"meme\" coin will have its own P2E (Play-to-Earn) game where you can earn TAMA on the ETH blockchain.The concept and financial model of Play to Earn is broken that result in huge selling pressure from gamers. They have to buy NFTs at beginning and can play to earn forever (in most Play to Earn projects) that is unbelievable.Tamadoge has idea to reduce this buy-once and use-forever NFTs with Tamaghost. It is a smart step to reduce selling pressure. To support this, support token price, they have buy back and burn from their Tama store with which 5% of money by selling NFTs in store will be used for that purpose. I can not deny it is good strategy from Tamadoge team but I don't believe it is enough to balance their finance model.QuoteWhenever the project will be a success or a failure in the long run, it's yet to be seen. While I don't think TAMA will become extremely-valuable in the future (it's a \"meme\" coin after all), it could certainly become a profitable venture for early investors within the short-term.Play to Earn projects are projects for non-gamers to play and earn. Real gamers don't play it that is hilarious.QuoteWhat do you think about this coin? Is it a scam or is it legit?Scam or legit won't help all people get profit because it's a zero-sum game.QuoteDo you think it's possible TAMA will reach $1 within the not-so-distant future?I don't believe in its financial model and its future but in near future, I believe Tamadoge team can create hype and price will make higher all time highs. $1 is somewhat possible price for it but I don't recommend it to anyone. It's risky!",

It is utility of the mint function that is red flagged on Coinmarketcap as you see.No one knows what their actual intention to reserve 600M tokens for 10 years and the mint function. We are right to be doubtful about that but only time can tell us what they will do with the mint function.Quote from: jossiel on October 10, 2022, 06:39:35 AMIt has 1B supply.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tamadoge/Their total supply is 2 billion tokens, not 1B. The 1.05B tokens you see on Coinmarketcap is self-reported circulating supply. Their tokenomics is like this: 1B tokens for beta sale and presale; 400M tokens for exchange listing; and 600M tokens will be minted in coming 10 years.

I haven't seen one \"meme\" coin that's finite by design except Garlicoin. With inflation \"baked\" into the protocol, how would you except TAMA or any other similar coin to retain its value over the long term? I guess the new \"meme\" coin will turn out to be like the rest of the other clones being traded on the market right now. The odds of Elon Musk or a popular celebrity/person endorsing any other coin than Dogecoin are very slim.How far will this coin go will greatly depend on mainstream market demand. $1 per coin seems to be impossible for TAMADOGE right now, but with a decent trading volume, anything could happen. It's best to take advantage of the short pump in price to sell your coins at a profit before it's too late. Who knows if TAMA gets replaced by another \"meme\" coin soon? Just my opinion",

It sounds like Tamagotchi. I think everyone already knows what is it but for those who didn't, its a small piece gaming machine or handheld device in other terms but I think there are already projects before who have this concept and one of it is axie infinity but the game is pretty much dead right now so maybe this one can have its own chance to get noticed at least by the public.You said its pre sale is a success? Then it's a good sign or a good start rather. The team and those who invest on it will get motivated to improve the game more and to invest more money. It's not literally a meme project but it is a project with purpose (it's a p2e game).",

It's best to take advantage of the short pump in price to sell your coins at a profit before it's too late. Who knows if TAMA gets replaced by another \"meme\" coin soon? Just my opinion If Axie AXS can touch $200, TAMA can touch $1 but with so many conditions.Trading volume should be big and they must be listed on other Tier 1 exchanges especially Binance.Their marketing team must create hype in the air and I think they can do it from their successful sales.However, my advice is even if TAMA touches $1, it is temporary price on market and it won't actually reflect value of the token. I expressed my opinion above about weaknesses of Play to Earn concept and I don't see how Tamadoge project will be able to solve it.Quote from: fullhdpixel on October 13, 2022, 01:58:22 PMYou said its pre sale is a success?

It's not literally a meme project but it is a project with purpose (it's a p2e game).It is a success for their team as we can not say raising $19M within about 1 month is not a success. In addition, so far it brings success and profit to investors in either beta sale and presale. But if you are speculator after their listing and buy with price higher than $0.04, you are in loss now.That project is at beginning and if it breaks $0.2 and makes a new all time high, you can consider to sell it. Because with Play to Earn projects, a longer you stay, a higher risk to lose.",

That should also mean that its supply is much lower than a common meme coin.In case, it pumps up then I think it will be easier for it to reach a dollar or even more than that but in order for us to be sure if this meme coin really have a potential, we need to check what they are offering. Not only that but we also need to reverse search the documents that we see, only to tell that they are not fake. Stay safe everyone.",
