(But make sure the 2FA device is different than the one your browser or Exchange app is.)I use a password manager (Bitwarden) and it has a great password generator too. Since I started using this my passwords are longer (all 15+, usually even 20+) and with bigger set of characters too; and more random too. Just look how nice the Generator is and how beautiful the resulted password In this context I will add something more: don't keep too much money on exchanges; the hackers may be from outside or from inside; in some cases (bankruptcy or exit scam) even a strong password or 2FA won't help.",

I prefer my password to be 10 character long, but the more the characters, the better the strength of the password to resist brute force attack.Quote from: NeuroticFish on December 05, 2022, 02:24:44 PMA strong password, also maybe 2FA added on top of that, all do help.

Just look how nice the Generator is and how beautiful the resulted password What I am mostly bothered about with my exchange accounts is to have 2FA which would be on a different device, without that I think my security is not complete without 2FA. But 2FA can not protect you from SBF kind of exchange bankruptcy and exchange hack like you said.",
