Wouldn't be so sure that they are directly focussing on Bitcointalk users. This is most likely the case. Being a multi-billion dollar company, they would have a large team of professionals who are constantly researching and updating the best keywords based on a large amount of factors for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency related keywords. BitcoinTalk would definitely be one of those keywords against the hundreds of others. It may even be an experiment considering that not many others have been able to see the same result in other countries and that they are just seeing the metrics. The two topics (exchange vs bitcointalk) are not really correlated, so I think it being an experiment is quite likely.",

Agree, it doesn't seem like Binance is trying to specifically target Bitcointalk users with a Search campaign. If that were the case, the ad copy would likely mention Bitcointalk specifically. Also, I think advertising directly on the forum or through a signature campaign would be more effective Google Ads generally suggests using the broad match option for keywords matching, which is also the default setting. If the keyword \"Bitcoin\" is set to broad match, it will likely show the ads to users who search for \"Bitcointalk\".",

Google collects information about you, including using it to display its ads, and therefore searching for words such as \"Bitcoin, Bitcointalk, Bitcoin talk\"  is enough for these algorithms to understand that the person is looking for something related to bitcoin, and therefore the best results based on the information that has been collected from you is Binance advertisement.Also, these advertisements differ according to the country, cookies, the nature of your search, and the information that was collected from you, and therefore it is not necessary that Binance have paid for this specific word.",

Was it some momentary test?  Not a momentary test is just that the AdWord ad algorithm differs in so many ways. Maybe your device has been detected for visiting binance or searching for binance on google or even discussing with a friend about binance. For instance, I discovered that after entering my namecheap dashboard I'd see ads relating to namecheap on google or other social media platforms. So, google is working hard to see that they target these ads as accurately as possible, especially for android users. I don't know your Os, but it has been confirmed by some sources that google tapes people's discussions on social media through android phones and they use it to target ads. And to add to the claim the keyword bitcointalk isn't anywhere on the Ad you just shared.",

      "body": "When you place an advert on Google it will ask keywords which you want to target to a specific location. Sometime a keyword like Bitcoin for a specific location can trigger such result. Alternative it is a possibility that a specific country has got a large traffic on Bitcointalk and this may be the reason why they might have targeted this keyword. It is just an advert and most cryptocurrency investors or enthusiast who have understanding about privacy will use ad blockers or ignore such advert. Those who are not that literate will fall for it.",

Is it Tesla, Amazon, Lamborghini or Apple? Because one thing you need to understand about ads is that there is always a spot for related keywords which has high search volume, and bitcointalk is one keyword that has a very high google monthly search volume of over 2 million, followed by other keywords such as \"Bitcoin news today\"\"Bitcoin price\"\"How to buy bitcoin\" etc",
