The repayments would be end in October 2024, it seems bull season will happen in that time.Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgoxinsolvency/comments/18r0w98/comment/kf0offg/depends on what your selections/registrations werepeople who chose \"all cash\" AND had any crypto balance will get more cash later. the crypto allotment, as crypto or cash can only be expected as of end Oct 2024 (the crypto in the trust hasn't moved yet)if you chose \"cash and crypto\" repayment but didnt register a crypto exchange, then, well, you've got a problem you need to sort",

Gox have reportedly started to receive fiat repayments for their Bitcoin, which had been trapped on the exchange since February 2014, according to numerous reports across social media.Great news and good work from the trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi. I was thinking they will still postponed the payment for they third time. But it good to see that these creditors are receiving funds after waiting for this long. They might have made some profit but some persons might have died before the release of this funds which means they have lost all. This is a reminder to everyone to be careful of centralised platforms.Quote from: Despairo on December 27, 2023, 04:32:43 AMMy speculation: If Mt.Gox paid all they owes, I think this will give a good impression for people to trust more in centralized exchanges because they will think it's safer as the coins can be recovered than non custodial wallet where you lose your seed phrase, it's gone. Your speculations are correct this news will encourage people to keep large sums in centralised exchanges because they have a hope of recovering the funds. But this case is just one out of many exchanges that have gone bankrupt and many people lost money that they will never recover. And how many people will be willing to wait for ten years before having access to the money they Invested?",

Many of these people were very angry at the time and some still are... so they might opt out of receiving any bitcoins and will opt for the Fiat. The Fiat had to come from the selling of some of the coins, so I reckon those sell orders has gone through already and it is priced into the current Bitcoin price.",

So these seem to only be the fiat portions. It’s pretty crazy how it’s been exactly a decade since it went bankrupt and people are getting their money back.",

You know that if your seed phrase is lost your coin is lost. Then why not protect it? I have not lost my seed phrase before and I do not think that is going to happen. How about exchange like Cryptopia? What I know about the exchange is that people's coins has not been refunded. MT. Gox has been hacked over decade ago and that is disappointment for many people if they are just getting their money now. The best is to use noncustodial wallet and have complete control over your coins.",

SnipI also think this is a good impression by the way.I read an article that they will make repayment in October 2024 as you mentioned.But suddenly they are now paying. Question is that if they are paying in fiat so what will they pay. The original amount which they credited before exchange crash. Or they will be paid according to the current current value of the Bitcoin. If they will be paid according to the current rate so this will be profitable for them. Otherwise they are just receiving money which they staked and they are just getting back without any profit.",

And good thing to see that if repayment will be done to all Mt.gox affected user all of them are happy because they earn a lot of interest from their bitcoin force to hodl just because of that incident. Its like blessing in disguise for them so lets get updated with this news since somehow their refunds might create a fud and can possibly move the market. Imagine how big needed to pay by Mt.gox to settle this issue and maybe this actions they made can cause a dump to the market especially if all those people receive a refund will sell all their coins and then there are institutions will ride it and use to create big fuds to manipulate the market.",

Gox refund for all user exactly using fiat trough PayPal make bitcoin keep stable on higher price, not get correction yet with bitcoin price and wish if this information true refund payment using fiat not bitcoin. Actually some exchange have been scam difficult to recovery or refund their user assets regarding Mt.

Moreover it would probably be impossible for everybody to receive exactly the same amount of Bitcoin they had when the exchange collapsed. That's not going to happen. Also the repayments are done in fiat. There is probably no explanation or breakdown as to the price of Bitcoin when the conversion took place. So it is now very hard to expect that the fiat repayment will be equivalent to the price of Bitcoin today and based on the whole amount of Bitcoin left on Mt. Gox. But the good thing is that Bitcoin's price has already increased a lot since Mt. Gox collapsed and it is being repaid now although in partial.",
