To make it challenging to modify the data? Maybe you can post more details on how the platform will generally work so potential customers can also learn about it. If I'm not reading it wrong, the card grading service helps people judge the value of a collection and help potential buyers to confirm if the collection is fake or not (plus its quality). Do correct me if I'm wrong. As long as it doesn't involve any new tokens you'd probably see some demand here and there.",

Anyways if you like TCG and sports cards and also into blockchain an want to start selling some grading services would love hearing the feedback.So basically the system you want to build is like that offered by PSACard, but supported using blockchain technology and later controlled by DAO? this is an interesting concept.but a few things to note. You are here using DAO which means that anyone who buys your token will be able to participate in voting? or only professionals can participate in evaluating the card? because as far as I know the scoring system for cards is usually done by professionals. And what about the system? usually card assessment is done centrally, but here you use a decentralized system, meaning you have to have criteria for members who want to do an assessment right, how do you manage that?it's good if you can provide a little enlightenment about the project you want to build, so people will understand this project better and maybe someone will be interested in building this project with you.",
