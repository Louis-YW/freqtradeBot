There are open source block explorer projects on github which you can find with a quick search.Quote from: NotATether on November 12, 2022, 03:40:57 AMThis functionality seems to be only available in the CLI, so open a terminal and type bitcoin-cli dumpwallet <wallet name> .

Be careful which software you trust, I haven't tried any of them by myself.QuoteI need all Blockchain data in text format is basically what I am sayingHow about Bitcoin block data (728 GB): inputs, outputs and transactions? See the Samples in that topic to see if it's what you're looking for.Quotethen I need to have that shown preferably in a gui program in which I can use Ctrl F to find specific transactions.A GUI is terrible to load large data files, unless you mean putting it in a database first. I just use CLI grep to search, which is as fast as your hard drive can read it.",

Do you realize converting them to ascii hex will be 10's of terrabytes of human readable data and very hard to manage on computers??Most of the time with our small python code we do stuff likefor all transactions in all blocks ..find address of transaction, if value of transaction > 1000 satoshi then print addressThe above two lines will generate 400M lines of text of hex addresses, which you can then feed into another algo;If you post a request for an example of a small one page python routine to do the above I will post; Keep it Simple Stupid is the law of the land;On github its common to see 10M code files of block-chain parsers that don't even run 10% of the blocks before they dieFirst step is to define what you want from the blocks, back in the day a common was to dump the 'pristine', e.g. dump all BTC addresses that were mined +50 BTC, but never spent, that's the kind of DUMP that people do in the real world; Once you have that list, then if your a hacker of BTC blockchain, you know what addresses to look for.",
