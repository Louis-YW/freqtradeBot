One of the biggest deterrent of this is the volatility of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is highly speculative; someone can have $1000 worth of Bitcoin today which that reduces to $600 in a couple of weeks. An emergency can come up at any time, and if it occurs during a down market, the person may not be able to get the complete funds to save the situation.Secondly, the bank is still a factor here as the person would need to convert back to fiat.If the bank can withhold savings which have been there for a while, they can definitely delay an incoming transaction and restrict the user from cashing it out.Advising people to put their money in \"Bitcoin or crypto\" could lead many to shitcoins; a large amount of altcoins are not worth investing in.",

I get why he did it, and I can't blame him, but that really wouldn't be heroic as he caused more problems for him and his family than previously. Something in the story doesn't add up. His brother says he just needed 5.500$, but he ended up ''walking away'' with 35k? Nevertheless, in most of the world, at least for us regular customers, you can't really come into the bank, ask for any amount of money and expect them to just hand it over, they simply don't have that on them. The banking system has, (some time ago), moved away from having the exact amount deposited on hand, and have transferred into numbers on paper or a screen. We all know that and complyed with that when we decide to do business with the bank, I think it's even in their terms of the agreement. Those that make it ok? No, but we still do business with banks. What needs to be asked is what kind of hospital was not willing to wait one day (as it usually takes that much for the bank to get the money) that it was needed to take hostages for the money to be there that day?

Put your money on cryptos or centralized exchanges are similar you like put it on banks, there's nothing of full control.That's right, storing Bitcoin or some altcoins on CEX carries with it even greater risks than storing fiat in a bank, given that at least in the EU there is state insurance for deposits up to EUR 100 000. If someone hacks CEX or makes an exit scam, in most cases the client will not get anything, or will wait for years to be compensated.Quote from: Jawhead999 on August 16, 2022, 09:48:26 AMAlso you're not completely correct, even they already invest all his money on Bitcoin, when you're convert your money to Bitcoin, you still need a bank to withdraw your money. Which third party you will use to get your money then? you need the money ASAP, if you're using gift card, it's slow.In most cases, banks cannot be avoided when selling cryptocurrencies, but in some countries there are physical crypto exchanges or people sell and buy cryptocurrencies in person. The latter is not really something that is recommended because it carries certain risks, but people can always manage if they want to bypass banks when it comes to trading cryptocurrencies.I personally feel much safer when I have Bitcoin in my possession, than when I give my trust to banks, regardless of their reputation and the insurance that the state offers on savings deposits. However, such an attitude towards saving comes from where you live, because if you have Bitcoin with which you cannot buy anything or exchange it for fiat, then you really have nothing.",

Either to receive your money from your job, or as proof of earnings. If you want to buy a house for example, you have to show proof of where your deposit came from, that means bank statements. You can do it with Bitcoin, but Bitcoin can't be used to purchase most houses, and a lot of mortgages class Bitcoin as a risky investment, and therefore you wouldn't be able to get the same amount that you could with fiat. So, I do get it. Banks are something that we want to avoid using, but in a lot of countries it's a requirement, that people can't avoid. I guess it depends on your living circumstances, if you have already paid off your house or you don't mind just putting the bare minimum into fiat, then that's alright, but the reality is a lot of people that aren't over 40/50 aren't going to be in a position to do that.",
