  "content": "To begin with my story, I was a working with this guy to a small company way back 2016 when I just newly discover Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I was new on crypto trading that time so I usually invest on shit coins and trade on CCEX. One day my supervisor caught me doing trading while office hour but luckily he became interested so I was saved that time. Then our whole team in office become interested on it since my supervisor keeps badgering me about it but I was hesitant at first to introduced Bitcoin to them because I know how risky crypto is due to volatility at that time. The price swing is more terrible back then compared now so I’m concerned with there money in case they will start investing because of me.After a week of slowly educating them during our break. I told them to just buy Bitcoin and never invest on altcoin. I firmly instructed them to just hold and leave there tokens as is on there Bitcoin wallet until the price reach 1M pesos(20,000$) before they sold because our target that time is to become millionaire even if we are just fooling around. Then we decided to buy 1BTC at the same time and after that they all became addicted on checking the price time by time. Some of them sold early because the price dip a few percentage and they are too scared that they will lose everything until they stop investing in crypto because of volatility.I thought all them already sold there Bitcoin and loose interest  since no one talking about in our office until we start leaving our job 1 by 1 so I don’t have any update anymore about them until yesterday, I received a message on social media from one of my co-worker who luckily didn’t sold his Bitcoin way back then. He follow my advice because he trust me as his senior and he knew that my goal is true, He said that he just forgot about his Bitcoin investment during bull run 2017-2018 and missed the first bull run because he live on his province after we leave our old job and become busy on his job there. He still hold after that and he just remember to check his Bitcoin investment this after 5 years of waiting. BTW his province is still not developed so internet signal is very weak and most people there is very focus on there own job. He was surprised about the growth of his investment. He sold at 20K+ approximately 1M pesos in our currency. I told him that if he only early open his wallet, he can get almost x3 of the current value but he still happy of his investment because it’s already huge in our country and he is only doing a job with minimum wage rate in province. But he said to me that if he always check his wallet, He maybe sold on much lower price and his target on checking it is after 5 years since he miss 2017 bull run. I was very amazed on how dedicated this guy is and even as coworker, He is just very silent and keep listening whenever we have group conversation.  Right now. He is planning to buy back at lower price level and use the half of his earnings to start his new business. He is planning again to have another 5 to 10 years Bitcoin investment after he buy back. I will try to get an update about his business and post it here to inspired other new Bitcoin investor. Hold is really powerful strategy isn’t it?",

      "body": "That's a nice story to hear. The takeaway for me was that unlike the others he held because he forgot about his investment. The irony being that he could of sold back in 2017 just below $20K and started his business many years ago, but that's beside the point really. The most challenging parts of hodling is not taking profits too early, selling too late, or failing to buy back. Forgetting about the investment certainly helps here!Glad to hear he became a peso millionaire either way",

It's like the current price and the hype current price target of 1M USD per Bitcoin back then.Until now, He still didn't want to venture out on altcoins which is a good thing for him as safe investment.

They probably did not fully understand how Bitcoin works or why it was valuable and would be more valuable in the future.Many users take repeated market cycles to realize how Bitcoin volatility works, while some are sold in on the technology immediately and create an estimate of how valuable it can be based on its potential and qualities.Congratulations to your friend, hope he becomes a bitcoin holder again pretty soon and hope he actually keeps up to date with the news around the network to know the most ideal wallet to use and maybe grab a fork or two, who knows.P.S, did you friend pick up some Bitcoin cash airdrop after the fork?",

But yeah, Bitcoin was and remains the safest crypto investment because the risk of investing in other coins it higher. I am happy that this person became a millionaire, even in terms of pesos rather than dollars. $20k is still significant money, especially for a developing country. And buying back for long-term hodling is IMO a good idea as well. I hope it all works out for that guy.",

I never got anyone to adopt bitcoin and I was even accused that I was planning some kind of scam by using bitcoin as a tool, so at some point I just gave up and never discussed bitcoin with anyone, except with the people at this forum.",

The best strategy is to hold no doubt, besides making a good profit you also have a rest of mind while holding, it is a win-win. Am happy for your friend, you could tell how happy and glad he is with his investment. Am sure he will be so excited to share his story with others who might be inspired and interested as well.",

And I didn't teach him to exchange later.Then after three or four months he came to me and said, look, is it showing such a high price, is it a scam or not? My eyes widened when I saw it.  I see that the token of that 12 dollar amount has become close to 1200 dollars . And then he was telling me that you did well not to teach me how to exchange. Then maybe I would have swapped it out. And the token was a meme-coin and that was Goma-finance. And that's how a friend of mine became a pro profitable trader  through Meme-Coin",

Bitcoin is going to stay here for long, It is in consolidation stage and the crypto transformation is a long process, which will take a few decades to complete. As more and more people will understand blockchains and bitcoin, there will be higher adoption of bitcoin and bitcoin will rise high.",

Your influence from your coworker have made them rich especially for an average earner from our country which is Philippines (based from the currency and conversion). Holding is such a powerful strategy as a long term investment especially when the person forgotten his investment to avoid continuous checking and possibly selling which what happened on your friend.I have a similar story as I've been encouraging my friends during college to invest or even check bitcoin way back 2016 as I see a potential of earning money while studying. Unfortunately, I have only succeeded on getting their interest on early 2017 as bitcoin has been reported on various news and articles. At that time they were able to earn enough to be necessary things such as Laptops, PC, Motorcycle and other things. Most of us halted our bitcoin and crypto activity during the 2018 massive bear market and focuses on our studies.Right now, most of us are back with our crypto and bitcoin activities and most of them are now doing trading as their main source of income and now able to buy houses, cars and businesses. We have been helping each other and guiding on where to invest and even lend for us to be able to buy all the things we want.",

A friend mining it back in 2011 when it was considered \"magic money\" didn't interest me. Then I came in contact with a team of core developers (not gonna name names), but again the idea that it was already worth hundreds seemed too expensive to me at the time, especially when it was already down 50%+ from $1K. It was only when I started to probably learn about it when it was worth thousands that I began investing. That and the fact to me it had proven that it wasn't going to go to zero in a hurry, which takes time to prove, that was an important aspect for sure.The problem is without some research - mainly into the total supply as well as inflation - it's hard to understand how Bitcoin could be worth more than $1, let alone hundreds of thousands.",

Hold is really powerful strategy isn’t it?My thoughts are that the goal should not get rich by selling it back to fiat because that (seems to me) is equivalent of devaluating Bitcoin. I see it like 2 pool. One pool is filled with fiat money and the other with the current supply of Bitcoin. When you buy Bitcoin, some of the fiat is kinda trnasformed into Bitcoin. So Bitcoin \"aquires\" that fiat money value. If you sell Bitcoin back to fiat for more fiat than the initial invested, then, you are transforming more Bitcoin back to fiat, than the fiat that you transformed in the first place to Bitcoin, therefore you kinda devaluated Bitcoin. So, my view is that we buy Bitcoin and hodl it, or in the best case scenario, you trade it for goods, services, etc. Give it use! But not sell it back to fiat!",
