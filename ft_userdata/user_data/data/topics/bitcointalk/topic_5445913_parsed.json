I mean anyone breaking the rules, spamming, then there's no arguing when the OP delete the post.Quote from: examplens on March 22, 2023, 02:31:50 PMI would also add the rule that whoever applies here must have enough activity for the next rank.

Countdown to the next rank should only only suggested to anyone who already has enough activity to advance through the ranks, but they only need small amount of merit from the next rank.

Great initiative by you as far as the topic goes, but has definitely been abused by a few. No offense to newbie ranks but I think it's a great rule to have the must be a jr member or higher to apply. Newbies need to take time to learn the forum, not come in here and try to be Legendary rank in the 1st month(I know it's not possible, just making a point).",

There was a lot of spamming in the previous topic where a new brother member after creating an account would make two or three posts in the account to count down to earn merit and this kind of spamming was happening constantly. Even though they were warned against spamming, they kept spamming. Which is why the decision to lock Tropic was so important that you made it. And reopening this threat to help achieve new ranks is highly commendable. Hope everyone will follow the rules to prevent spamming and post here.",
