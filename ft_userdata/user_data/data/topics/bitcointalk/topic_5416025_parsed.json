Checksum of what? Base58 decoded address or WIF?The code you showed does not make really any sense as is provided completely out-of-scope.",

So lets talk about python-decora:Example useThis will connect and turn on the lightCode:import decoraswitch = decora.decora(\"00:21:4d:00:00:01\", key=\"key\")switch.connect()switch.on()This will set the light to 50% intensityCode:switch.set_brightness(50)And turn the lights offCode:switch.off()Source:https://github.com/mjg59/python-decoraIf you want to learn how to encrypt or decrypt an hexkey, you can start here:https://secretscan.org/PrivateKeyHex",
