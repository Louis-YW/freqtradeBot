  "content": "What happened: 25th April 2023 did i lend out  $55 to Rohan. He also asked me first if he could borrow $100 but I refused and said that $55 is what I can do.Reference Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445759.msg62144289#msg62144289Amount Scammed: $63Payment Method: BTCProof of Payment: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445759.msg62144289#msg62144289PM/Chat Logs: PICTURE IN THE MESSAGEAdditional Notes:FLAG https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3179FLAG https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=317925th April 2023 did i lend out  $55 to Rohan Kotkar https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2690537He also asked me first if he could borrow $100 but I refused and said that $55 is what I can do. (Why just $55? Because I only dealt with money I could afford to lose)Here is proof: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445759.msg62144289#msg62144289He promised to pay back $61.38 not later then 10/05/2023.When it was time to pay back i had to message him like \"Hello you gonna pay back??\", the day after he told me he need more time to pay back and wanted to extend the loan, i said ok no problem you can get two weeks more and then the new amount was $63.38....Then when it was time to pay back $63.38 he was in silence and I had to spam him on TG to get a reply that was \"I'm really sorry for being irresponsible. There are some things which came out of nowhere and my salary went like nothing. Please be assured, I will payback the amount no matter what.You can also add up the interest until & unless I pay the whole amount.Once again, I'm really sorry for the inconvenience\"And that´s okay.. but then I have see he is online on TG and ignoring me, he also have zero interest in solve this.. he not reply to me or coming up with any kind of solution.I also offered to him that he could pay back like $20 monthly or something like that, but no reply.I am pretty sure I will never see this money again, and that´s fine its not an big amount. But now are everyone else warned to not deal with this user at all! (at least for the moment)Why did I lend out money to a person that just had come back and been inactive?Yeah I know I did take a risk, but I did not think you could be such a loser so you fooled anyone for $55 (excuse my language) when you had a good standing account that has been around for many years.But I was wrong!Please if you gonna reply like \"How stupid could you bo lend him money? Blame yourself blabla\" don´t reply.I know its my fault, i know the risk i took. and I hope he will change his mind and pay back. but as it looks now, he has ignored me! But it would be wrong of me if i did not warn the other people on the forum.ROHAN IF YOU PAY BACK OF COURSE I REMOVE THIS AND REMOVE THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK",

OP, mention me here in case there is a repayment or positive solving of this case so that I can remove the negative tag.@CYBER_COWBOY, I am sorry for this most likely loss of yours, I think that you will not get your money back. But consider that this is a very useful experience for you, costs you only $55. I looked at the history of Rohan Kotkar posts, he was almost desperately looking for a loan. His request was ignored by the more experienced members, and that should have been a directive to you as well. He is also almost aggressive towards others when they ask him about collateral, and all this is a red flag for loan approval.Quote from: btctalk-memeboss on June 04, 2023, 02:03:11 PMWhy lend for such small gains? 6.2$ ?You can make that with staking on an exchangeIn an ideal case: Invested $55 and get a profit of more than 10% in just 15 days. I don't think any regular exchange offers such a profit from staking. How much do you think is realistic to expect for the initial $55?",

It's good that you decline his request for a big amount but you should have asked for collateral even if it's a small amount,I guess because it's not a higher rank and he cannot use it to participate in the signature campaign so planned to scam through taking a loan, I hope you'll get that amount back in other ways.",

He was a member, i.e. lower rank but the loan was low as well. If he came from a time of inactivity it is another red flag, but if he had at least managed to participate in a paid campaign when he asked for the loan, he could have been making $40 or $50 a week, so it would make more sense to pay back the loan in order to continue earning money on the forum.

That´s not how my parents teach me how life works when I did grow up.But of course I  know nothing is 100% & he did talk me over at Telegram and also I think a 5 years old account was not worth leaving behind for $55. (I did not know so much about merit, rankings & signature campaings at the start)I was wrong and I have learned a lesson for next time, as I am new here its impossible to know everything from the start, I learn with time and take this as a experience.I am glad I did deny him when he asked for $100! I see the positive things out of this that it \"only\" costed me $55 to learn the lesson and not more.  Its awful that people using honest people to get some money instead of actually do honest work, but but... Also as I said I was thinking if I was gonna do this accusing, I was pretty sure it would make me never see the money again, but IF I did not do it and he scammed somebody else, it would not feel good at all for me!Wish you all a great day and thanks for all tips and inputs! Its very good information for me for the future.THANK YOU ALL!FLAG https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=2690537;page=iflags& Thanks Sashan for showing me how I link direct to the message, how is it possible to link direct to a specific message on a site instead of just to the site for the future?I bee searching for this long but can´t find how to do it",

Maybe he see OP as good target to do his loan and quit scheme. For sure he will never go back here as he do this dumb action.This is another unfortunate incident happen to a lender and I guess if many like this will happen for sure it can affect the trust of other low rank member to get a loan.
