      "body": "3-phase supply is *mostly* irrelevant as all miners use single phase power. Where 3-phase does come into play is if you use phase-to-neutral connections for breaking out the power, you MUST ensure the resulting voltage is between 208-240VAC and in most countries your phase-to-neutral voltage will either be too high or too low.",

Well this is btc only and people frown on discussing other coins in this section.But I havebtc asicsltc/doge asicsgpusI constantly juggledebtgearcoinscashand attempt to balance risks that way.I make less money this way. ie going all in on the right gear at the right time will earn more money than my way.but I lose less when shit happens. ie going all in on the wrong gear at the wrong time can be crushing.",

NotFuzzyWarm answered you about that, and I remembered you asked about your electrical setup and you're fixated on these issues when the main question is obviously the same, how much per kWh and how much can you really pull out at that price?Seeing you're from UK, and knowing you want to mine from your own garage so it's probably residential rates, are you sure about this? I have (not sure for long) still single digits rates and I wouldn't throw a penny at gear now.",
