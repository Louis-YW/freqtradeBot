This is my first time of hearing about a bitcoin bonus website  and I can't for sure say it's genuine or not but what I can throw at you as advise is that there are lots of scam schemes out there preying on the greed of those that want everything for free. So be careful.I can see you're a newbie and this is your second post on the forum. You're welcome.

That's by the way.About the Bitcoin bonus, without looking at the content of the link (impressive by the way newbie knowing how to add link into a text) I will boldly tell you that their is not good that can come out from sites which promise's you bonus of any kind, this are just means of attracting potential victims into their site with audio reward, which will convince them that they actually own Bitcoin Bitcoin they don't have access to (Not your key not your Bitcoin) and if the users is greedy enough they will want the users to pay some sort of fee before they will allow the users to withdraw the fund from their, or better still ask you to refer users to the site before you can be allowed to withdraw which will be a means of attracting more traffic for them to their site. My advice is to avoid such sites that give you a free Bitcoin bonus; they always end up being time-wasting stuff, and no one is giving free money anywhere else on the internet. Nothing comes too easy these days.",

Free satoshis are too old, and the only one I've tried when I was a newbie was freebitco(.in), they are indeed giving free satoshis but I've never tried withdrawing it since it takes a lot of time before meeting the required amount for you to be able to withdraw your \"free bitcoin\". For me it's a waste of time believing in such nonsense, nothing is free anymore. You have to work hard in order to attain something.",

Generally, it requires several conditions and tasks before it actually becomes claimable, such as sending KYC and a deposit of a certain value.However I would study carefully before sending money or any identity to a service, especially if the bonus figures offered are unreasonable.",

To be honest I never heard of it and after doing some research, I don't think it's legal and it appears to be a scam. If I'm not mistaken, the website in question is this one here. It looks like an ordinary website to me but there isn't much information available about it (like it's owner and if they have any other social as Twitter)I tried using a scam adviser site and it gave it a score of only 22 out of 100, which is considered low and indicates that it's not safe to use.",

We have many Bitcoin faucet website that uses various names to attract traffic, maybe the site has other agenda that mightn't be harmful but don't make a deposit uf the site request for a deposit before you withdraw. If the site is just giving our free Bitcoin without requiring you to invest or do some online tasks then there's nothing wrong in claiming the free bonus.The first bonus might just be a welcome bonus and usually they'll demand you accumulate the bonuses to a certain amount before you can withdraw. Make sure the site isn't a scam or you'll do alot of tasks without been able to withdraw your money and it'll be a waste of time.",

But if the main purpose of that website it to give bonuses for no cost, then that's already suspicious. Why would they be giving free money to users without anything in return? They will just probably ask you to invest on their website in order to claim those bonuses which is a big big no. I tried searching about it but I don't know what website op is talking about... Just don't engage in something you're already in doubt about in the first place especially if there is only few information about them since you can't check if it's legit or not.",

As far as I know, I have not heard of any such site till date where you can get bitcoins just by making an account. All these sites are created to trap many people who are new they don't understand anything they make an account and get there bonus asking them to make a deposit to withdraw that bonus. Later when they deposit they freeze their deposit and they are given many conditions which the customer cannot fulfill thus they fall into the trap of fraud. In my advice I would say such websites should be banned now.",
