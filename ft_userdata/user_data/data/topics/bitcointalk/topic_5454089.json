This is my first time of hearing about a bitcoin bonus website  and I can't for sure say it's genuine or not but what I can throw at you as advise is that there are lots of scam schemes out there preying on the greed of those that want everything for free. So be careful.I can see you're a newbie and this is your second post on the forum. You're welcome.

My advice is to avoid such sites that give you a free Bitcoin bonus; they always end up being time-wasting stuff, and no one is giving free money anywhere else on the internet. Nothing comes too easy these days.",

Generally, it requires several conditions and tasks before it actually becomes claimable, such as sending KYC and a deposit of a certain value.However I would study carefully before sending money or any identity to a service, especially if the bonus figures offered are unreasonable.",

It looks like an ordinary website to me but there isn't much information available about it (like it's owner and if they have any other social as Twitter)I tried using a scam adviser site and it gave it a score of only 22 out of 100, which is considered low and indicates that it's not safe to use.",

We have many Bitcoin faucet website that uses various names to attract traffic, maybe the site has other agenda that mightn't be harmful but don't make a deposit uf the site request for a deposit before you withdraw. If the site is just giving our free Bitcoin without requiring you to invest or do some online tasks then there's nothing wrong in claiming the free bonus.The first bonus might just be a welcome bonus and usually they'll demand you accumulate the bonuses to a certain amount before you can withdraw. Make sure the site isn't a scam or you'll do alot of tasks without been able to withdraw your money and it'll be a waste of time.",

Later when they deposit they freeze their deposit and they are given many conditions which the customer cannot fulfill thus they fall into the trap of fraud.
