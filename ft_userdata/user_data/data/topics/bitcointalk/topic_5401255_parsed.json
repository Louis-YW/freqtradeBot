Let go of the nukes in your coven, then we can talk. Even though the US denies taking part in the recent Israeli massive airforce drill to stimulate a nuclear base in Iran, the world knows that no such drill can take place without the knowledge of the US intelligent community.",

The question is: would you rather have a country like Great Britain have the nukes, or an islamic dictatorship like Iran?It'd be better if no one owned nuclear weapons. Ideally, you shouldn't be indebted to another nation to maintain the peace or risk a nuclear winter. We just accept the current predicament because the countries with the nukes are supposedly the responsible ones. Everyone in the international community has agreed that Iran is not responsible.",

      "body": "Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism. There is no reason why Iran should be allowed to have any nuclear technology. In fact, Iran even pursuing nukes is a pretty strong argument in favor of launching a pre-emptive nuclear attack against Iran.Typical leftist nonsense defending terrorists.",
