  "content": "Ki Young Ju, CEO of South Korean on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, has predicted that $30,000 will be the starting point of another bull run. Ju has pointed to the fact that most people are still underwater at current prices in response to a tweet about MicroStrategy's realized price being $30,664. The business intelligence firm recently announced that it had purchased another 480 coins. As reported by U.Today, Ju predicted a \"big short squeeze\" last week ahead of Bitcoin's recent rally. Earlier today, the largest cryptocurrency spiked to $23,855, the highest level since June 13. On Tuesday, Mark Newton, global head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, predicted that Bitcoin could potentially reclaim the $28,000 level before taking a breather. The cryptocurrency is now up by nearly 37% since hitting the local bottom of $17,592 on June 18 during a massive sell-off.Read more on U.Today https://u.today/analyst-names-starting-point-for-next-bitcoin-bull-run",

If most of them have yet given up, have yet capitulated, bull run won't start.I meant starting point for next bull run is still in future, we did not get to that point. Selling what you own to cover something does not mean you are capitulating.",

If the price of bitcoin has increased so significantly, then sell and wait until its price decrease very well and you can buy. At $30000? The bull run will begin? Why not just hold and see if it will be true or not. I do not believe in analysts though, I prefer to hold after massive bear market which had occured already.",

And I rather think not, because there is nothing to indicate that we can beat $69,000 this cycle, it would be quite unlikely. Rallies from these levels, sure we will have, but bull run I don't expect it before the next halving.",

This is not also an encouragement to ignore the advice or analysis of other people who you know are more knowledgeable than you are, it is an advice to task yourself to become more knowledgeable that your analysis become your first opinion completely uninfluenced by another persons own.",

They always want to influence the market either in their own interest or in the interest of somebody else. The question is always: Did they buy coins and want the market to go up, or do they have coins they want to get rid of and therefore want a better sell price. Since nobody knows it all those analysis are worthless.",

But there are also enough noobs that follows these news anyway.I think this is more about $30K that acted as strong support for 18 months, so if price is able to get above this, there could be a \"bull run\" up to $50K (relatively easily). This is more based on the dead cat bounce scenario such as in 2019 from $3.2K to $14K, whereby once the bear market was considered over, many buyers emerged and/or returned. I don't think this means a \"bull market\" would begin as such, as there will be many metrics that suggest price needs considerably more time to consolidate (moving averages, usual cycles, etc). But more that above previous support price can go considerably higher.Likewise price rebounding in the near future to $40K, even $50K, doesn't mean it'll make a new ATH. Quite the opposite. I'd argue there's as much chance it returns to $25K to $30K afterwards. The more relevant analysis here would be that if price get's heavily rejected from $30K, and fails to move above it, there will be no continuation of bullish momentum for a while and price could make a new low.",

And probably those who have been buying at $19k will no longer getting when the price hits around $28k. It could be that they are exhausted already, or just waiting to take profits anytime soon.",

I don't think you should listen to all these analysts, because more often than not they are wrong. There are even infographics for many of them, where who said what and where the price went after that. Sometimes it is very funny, because the result is the opposite of expectations.Well, the market is already confusing ever since, so it's only up to you if you will got carried away with it or you will only listen and stick on one side. For me, I am just one sided at all times. I only believe that bitcoin will rise even if it's already dumping.As long as it is true that they are really an analyst then I think it's not bad to listen on their advises especially if you are not confident enough on your decisions but I better I like it when there are infographics, charts and other tools which are more convincing than this one here. It is also normal for a prediction to fail, because they are only human, not super humans which can see the future.",

The problem with analysis about bitcoin is, we cannot say about a starting point because, bitcoin market is well known for showing us the same starting point for months. Remember that we had predicted that $4000 was bottom in 2018 but we got to see it another time in 2020 thanks to beginning of pandemic.I guess we may see bitcoin for one or more time around $20k still we may not see anything below to that for longer period. Similarly, we may see $30k at any time soon but that doesn't means that we again will never see $29k levels. Like people do say, the long term trend of bitcoin is always bullish but the short term is really a confusing one.",

Ju has pointed to the fact that most people are still underwater at current pricesReally? I'd like to know his reasoning for that. He basically says that most people who are still holding bitcoin bought at higher prices than 23k? That's bullshit. From what I've seen, the majority of current holders have Bitcoins cheaper than 20k and most of those who bought at 50k and above sold at a loss when we broke below 40 and then 30k. Most peopel are not underwater below 30k. Maybe he means the whales like microstrategy, but it clearly says most people. Most people did not buy bitcoin in 2021 but in the 11 year prior to that. Even trading volume proves it because the 2017 bull market had much higher volumes than 2021, so much more coins changed hands and I'm not talking 2 times more, I'm talking over 5 times more.",
