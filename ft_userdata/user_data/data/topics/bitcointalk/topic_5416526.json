      "body": "Though we may all cast vote base on assumption but the accuracy to how far the bitcoin price can go high or low is ultimately unpredictable, but if i may go by my own level of convinctions the least we could encounter with dip in orice is $17k and below $30k all through this year before a major event can take place such as halving where we can have a new all time high, bit for now i don't think bitcoin could go further beyond this low, instead there might be slightly surge in price, this is just base on my personal approach and research.",

Price is totally unpredictable and there's no way that we could really predict on when this bear market ends, whether it would be on this year or into the next.This is why lots of technical analysis and speculations had been floating around and telling that 10k price or even 8k would be the possible bottom if ever this market would really be crashing but no one really knows on what wouldhappen next.We cant really able to tell on whats the next move and this is why having the step or action whether you would really be risking out or would really be just waiting upfor some market action before you would really be making some move.",

Inflation this week will also lead to hawish action from the fed. Same with the fed meeting they will have. The last weeks employment numbers didn't look good.Eventually stocks will go down but crypto will stay flat or go up, same with gold. People will realise that fed is damaging the global markets and QE will be around the corner and crypto will most likely take off first. This will happen sometime soon because its already getting bad out there.",

I am not saying this, many veteran traders have already mentioned about this.Now Bitcoins will only struggle in this price segment for the next few weeks.Once the bear market gets over definitely, the price will boost up. So I am advising everyone to buy as many Bitcoins as they can in this cheap yet affordable price.",

A few days ago OPEC + announced to cut world oil production and the price of brent oil continued to reach 100 USD, today the news of the war is even more terrible when Russia attacks directly the Ukrainian capital kiev. Bad things are still ahead and I believe it is more likely that they will bottom sooner if the Fed continues to increase 0.75% in November is inevitable.",

Because in crypto currency he market is very volatile and unpredictable . It is fully depends on the current situation of world economy and also the market of Crypto. And speaking of now, the previous market conditions suggest that Bitcoin will not bottom below 15K, because every time Bitcoin drops below 20K, a small resistance is created that holds it back to move higher.Many tries to buy back BTC everytime the price drops since we don't know where the price will drop last, so many take advantage of it's downfall when they can since it might rise again after that drop. We cannot see upto how much it will drop or when it will rise again since the market is unstable and there are economic news affecting investors decision. There is also no influencers that can hype the market now unlike before.",

Don't let the market spike we will miss the opportunity to buy low.$19,000 is regular purchase which is considered Dips by me so it's not the lowest price but I don't want to speculate too long but I make sure that I have bought at that price.Well that's the case if you think too much about the lowest price and even want it even lower, no one knows so I have tried to take this opportunity during a volatile bear market to continue to hoard more Bitcoin in the portfolio.Even if the price reaches the lowest of $15,000, I will enter again, nothing difficult but we are more prepared to have funds prepared for the next Bitcoin purchase.",

I believe that the bottom of Bitcoin is not stagnant and it can never be stagnant and that should be well understood.",

We should instead try to focus on something that is more realistic, like when will we start to go up because it's obvious that we are going to start going up in the future for sure.",

Bear season isn't over yet, so there might be a bigger drop than it is now but I don't want to expect it to be real.Basically, no one can predict the future with 100% accuracy, if anything, I think it's just a coincidence. So it might be good not to think too much about where the bottom is during a bear market, the best option is to buy what you can afford to lose and accumulate your assets while the price is still discounted. There is a unique fact, bitcoin has never dropped below ATH before, meaning I don't think the price of bitcoin will drop lower than ATH 2017.",
