We know that the big miners control most of the mining power? if the big players can be identified in the top 5 countries and their governments collaborate, can BTC survive?cc: o_e_l_e_o, Notatether, nc50lc, ImThour",

Bitcoin still remain to be censorship resistant and decentralized. Satoshi tried his best to make bitcoin an asset and a commodity, just like gold in digital form.Centralized exchanges are centralized and licensed and they have nothing they can do than to face more regulations.",

      "body": "Quote from: Newchanka on June 10, 2023, 09:04:32 PMCan They Find A Way to Do It To Bitcoin?I mean what they're doing to exchanges....The answer is no! Bitcoin is not centralized, which means it is not controlled by anyone, not even the founder of Bitcoin. The SEC can only disturb and attack centralized platforms dealing with Bitcoin and other crypto transactions. They can possibly fight against Bitcoin through platforms used for Bitcoin transactions, both centralized and DEX, which can slow down the adoption of Bitcoin in countries where those restrictions are serious, especially if people buying Bitcoin in such countries can only acquire it through one medium, which is a centralized physical or online exchange.All these are the reasons why some experienced forum users discourage the use of centralized exchanges and also any platform that requires you to pass KYC, because if you buy your Bitcoin through KYC platforms, there is every possibility that any investigation agency can get your details from those exchanges and can investigate you and cease your Bitcoin (but that's if the situation gets to that extent). So, it's wise and very advisable to use a decentralized exchange to buy and sell your bitcoin, so that there is no way your identity can be exposed.",

Part of this brilliant idea was why satoshi actually did want his identity revealed. The only thing the government can do to directly affect bitcoin aside regulating exchanges will be to ban it’s mining and even if this happen people will migrate to a favourable environment or country. So it is entirely had to attack or regulate bitcoin directly",

So what they do is attack those associated with those exchanges and the exchange as an entity as well. But Bitcoin doesn't have any of this, so they won't know where to start from. They can only control a few Bitcoin holders, sanction them, and seize their holdings, but they can't harm Bitcoin directly; they can't file a law suit against Bitcoin; they can't arrest Bitcoin; and they can't freeze Bitcoin transactions. So the answer is no; they can't do the same with Bitcoin.",

But to people who truly care about what Bitcoin can do, BTC is pretty much invincible.They can’t fully destroy it. I will continue using BTC even if only a handful will. To me it’ll always be value and it can’t really be stopped but rather slowed down. The exciting part is that I’m not the only one who thinks like this, which proves my point.It’s not like shoes. You wear them out and replace them. Bitcoin’s more like a plague/epidemic. You can’t fully wipe it out no matter how much you try.",

And then China attack the Chinese bitcoin mining industry, and yet several countries took over and many companies established themselves to carry the torch. So no one can stop Bitcoin at this point, it's too big to fail and many entities including government like El Salvador see it as beneficial to them. So it's going to be cyclical, there might countries who will go hardline against BTC, nevertheless on the others side of the fulcrum, there will be groups who are going to embrace it.",

Even if they fund to attack it, that will be useless, worthless and just a waste of money if they do so.

It does not act outside of its intended purpose, it is governed by hundreds/thousands (or more) interests, and does not have one central point that is able to be taken down or fined.
