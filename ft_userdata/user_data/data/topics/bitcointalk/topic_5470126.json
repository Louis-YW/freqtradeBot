If forum user is interested in Coinomi wallet, he/she can not get true information, because forum search find only old results, but not the newest ones, which can give true information. There are problems with Coinomi multi coin wallet at the latest time according to the thread from August 29, 2023, - \"It looks like they've abandoned the project but left some existing servers running.\", so this is serious forum admin fault.Forum users can only get old search results.So forum search option in fact do not work due to admin fault and sleep.

If the forum search engine is rate limited, it is also forum admin fault and nothing more.Just so you know, there is an advanced search option where you can sort the results based on the newest one, relevancy, and so on. Granted it is probably not as accurate as other options available above. That being said, from a utility point of view upgrading the current forum is probably not the most beneficial since we're on the way to moving to the new software, CMIIW. At the end of the day, it is just a question of cost and benefits.",

This can throw us off our tracks somewhat at times.Since the search results are delimited to 5 pages, when there are many returned results, it’s best to delimit the scope by (one or all):-   Setting the sort order to \"Most recent topic first\" (*).-   Delimiting the message age if you want recent posts (i.e. between 0 and 900 days will bring back results posted over the last 900 days, trimming all the old results off).-   If you really can’t the post to contain \"Coinomi wallet\" as two consecutive words, and not just to figure within the post either together or separately, add the quotation marks to the search string. This delimits the results even more, though you may not need the filter to be so strict (2 consecutive words).(*) This on its own may not be sufficient, since it still seems to prioritize selecting the last 5 pages of oldest posts, but sorting them by descending date, thus, if applied on its own, the search for \"Coinomi wallet\" yields results from 30/08/2017 .. 02/05/2013 (go to the actual post to see the date, not the same as the one viewed on Date Posted as mentioned before). You'll need to combine this with delimiting the message age.",

In the specific case, you are interested in a wallet called by a certain name, and instead of searching the entire forum, why not search in a specific part of the forum where there is a discussion about wallets?For the test, visit the following link and enter the keyword \"Coinomi wallet\" in the forum search engine and view the results. You will get 2 pages of search results that will include the latest results related to that wallet.Quote from: Joeyp on October 12, 2023, 09:45:05 PM~snip~So forum search option in fact do not work due to admin fault and sleep.
