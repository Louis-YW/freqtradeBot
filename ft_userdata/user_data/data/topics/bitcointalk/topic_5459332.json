I saw a comment for OgNasty from a year or two ago showing interest in metaverse.. so what is up  Will it happen one day integrating this website into a metaverse.. and if someone do it himself will @theymos be against that or fill a copyright claimThanks!",

Everything is working like this and I don't see much utility on converting the forum to metaverse which all threads will be available on virtual 3d concept. The forum still run on SMF for a long time that makes the forum feature very limited. I doubt this proposal will be approved or considered in the near future since there's a lot of pending updates here that forum users really need.Metaverse hype is already over and there's no Metaverse project that is currently perform to meet the expectation of everyone. Most metaverse project is a failure due to the poor development. Bitcointalk will just waste funding on a costly project that is not a necessity.",

As he showed his interest toward metaverse projects only and i think you will find hundreds of members showing interest in Metaverse.Even i am included, i have wrote so many article for Metaverse projects and i do know some basics   so i coming to main point even if you wanted to convert this forum into metaverse, first the developers had to make 3d Environment then the NFTs etc. Like for characters, giving trust to each other or merits to each others. I wonder how the replies would be given and how one can read the topic of another member who is living another region of the mao while we are another corner. This whole idea needs so much efforts like you are asking a hell lot. I have a small request to developers that before making the metaverse for btt just put a small is equal to sign inside every img tag so that we do not have to put it there. 99% of the images needs customization for resizing and putting this = sign become a headache so please install this first.     (Just kidding)",

Metaverse needs time at least in underdevelopment countries it really needs 7 to 15 years.You don't need virtual reality equipment to join existing metaverse's...most of the time you just need a desktop, audio and web3 connection capability. The way he is describing BitcoinTalk in metaverse format makes complete sense. If a developer were to create a character for each user, from there the metaverse could work in many ways. The flaw in the concept is that it would not work without interaction, and I doubt that users of a very analog SMF forum will prefer to use the metaverse version after the novelty wears off, especially with no incentive to use it over the SMF version. Interoperability between the two would be a challenge too. Even if every user was an NPC until they became interactive (character does what is being done on the SMF forum), it would not just be a resource intensive effort but it might take the fun (and the point) out of it for interactive users, as they'd be in a metaverse 99℅ full of bots. I do suppose with good development that it is possible and it could be made to work...it wouldn't be a small job though, that's for sure.",
