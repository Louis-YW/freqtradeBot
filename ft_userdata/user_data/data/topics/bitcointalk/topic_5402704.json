  "content": "I am doing my daily reading of online news and articles when I stumbled on this one.  It has an article title of Casino Guru’s Šimon Vincze on How Problem Gambling Can Become a Thing of the Past So I read and wanted it to share in this forum for some healthy discussion.Here is the opening paragraph of the article to establish the questions.QuoteWe sit down and speak with Casino Guru’s Šimon Vincze, the man behind the company’s sustainable online gambling and reducing gambling-related harm juggernaut. Vincze most recently published the blue paper for the Global Self-Exclusion Initiative, a massive campaign that intends to tackle problem gambling with the participation of industry stakeholders and build a future where gambling-related harm is no longer an issue. Find out who Vincze is and how he is reshaping the industry.More detail can be read on the link above.The 3 key points that summarize the article:QuoteThe gambling industry is missing a system with the possibility to self-exclude internationally.Thanks to our global presence and active approach toward sustainable online gambling, we saw a gap in the current self-exclusion options, practically overseen by the rest of the industry.Read the blue paper and dedicate a few minutes of your time to imagining a world where blocking one's access to all gambling opportunities is a possibility. \"Digging deeper into what is this Global Self-Exclusion system (GSES) is, I found the pdf of the blue paper.  GSES is also deeply explained in this website, Global Self-Exclusion Initiative, with a tagline :  \"Let’s make online gambling safer, together.\"It said that to be able to solve the gambling problem in the gambling industry it needs GSES.Why the gambling world needs a global self-exclusion scheme?QuotePresent self-exclusion options can be circumventedOperator-level and nation-wide self-exclusion do not create an effective barrier that stops problem gamblers from playing. Players can avoid them by gambling at other sites, or even opting for unlicensed operators and ending up playing at objectively worse gambling websites.QuoteRegulators and operators do not work together on a global levelNational schemes do not work together on a global level or let foreign operators take part. Even if they wanted to, the rigid rules individual entities have to follow do not allow them to team up to better protect players.What Self-Exclusion Is and Why It Is ImportantWhat is self-exclusion?QuoteSelf-exclusion is a responsible gambling feature available to people playing in casinos or partaking in other gambling activities that allows players to block themselves from gambling for a certain period of time.How does it work?QuotePlayers can usually self-exclude from an individual casino in one of two ways:Turning on self-exclusion by themselves, in the ‘responsible gambling’ section of the casino website. This usually involves choosing the desired duration of self-exclusion, but some casinos also ask about the reasons why the player wishes to use this feature.Messaging customer support via live chat or e-mail. Some casino websites don’t support a feature that would allow players to turn on self-exclusion themselves. Instead, they need to message customer support and ask them to turn on self-exclusion for them.Why is self-exclusion important?QuoteThe importance of self-exclusion has a lot to do with reasons why players use it. While these can be very diverse, a considerable proportion of players resort to self-exclusion because they struggle to keep their problematic gambling habits under control.How would global self-exclusion scheme help?QuoteOvercoming gambling addiction requires major commitment and often also professional help, but self-exclusion can make the process at least a bit easier and more effective.The only challenge to this system is that it can be easily circumvented by gambling addict by finding a foreign casino willing to allow the player to gamble. The only solution to this problem is simply by making the self-exclusion global and affecting all available casino can make the system very much harder to circumvent.Personal Input:Having this kind of tool in every online casino is really helpful but the main challenge is the people involved.  Are they willing to participate in the program?  That is the main issue unless Casino will cooperate and force implement this procedure to their players which is highly unlikely.  Aside from that this is still in the experimental stage so it is too early to say that this kind of tool will solve the gambling problem that had been in the industry since the beginning.  I think it will help but it won't make the gambling problem a thing of the past. So what do you think about this article's claim?Sources:https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/casino-gurus-simon-vincze-on-how-problem-gambling-can-become-a-thing-of-the-past/https://casino.guru/global-self-exclusion-initiativehttps://casino.guru/global-self-exclusion-initiative/self-exclusion-and-its-importance",

While these can be very diverse, a considerable proportion of players resort to self-exclusion because they struggle to keep their problematic gambling habits under control.Addiction can be worse than that, most of the gambling sites makes self-exclusion easy to be circumvented. But it can be a good way if addict's family knows about this and make sure they call the customer service of the betting the addicted victim is using for them to enable it for him. But the person can resort to other gambling sites, that is how addicts can do. Also an addict  can enable self-exclusion, but later make use of another gambling site, that is just an addiction. It is possible that self-exclusion can help to some extent though, but there are more to do in a way to restrict yourself from addictive gambling. As for me, I do not see self-exclusion that useful because their are other means an addict will resort to, to gamble and lose more. The best way to solve gambling addiction is about addict himself to realize that gambling is never a job, it is never a profession, it is never a means to earn because losses will come because of that poor mindset.",

      "body": "Self exclusion can become useless for couple of reasons - 1. It all starts with oir willingness. If a gambler has a strong mind, he will be able to self exclude himself from gambling for as long as he wants. It all starts with us. Think about cigarette addiction. Unless the addicted person is willing to take action, nothing really happens. 2. There are multiple gambling websites available, including unlicensed ones. So even if someone has a strong mind to self exclude him from gambling for a specific period of time, it will be pretty easy for him to come back to gambling through another website. Addiction can be treated through regular counseling. No measure of exclusion will work unless it is a forced one.",

      "body": "The issue of multiple gambling sites could be fixed if there was a central organization that could take hold of all the gambling industries licensed out there and if the said organization was to properly enforce proper rules and laws so that unlicensed casinos wouldn't be able to work. I honestly think it isn't impossible for a said organization to be developed, just that it could take a LOT of time since there are a few conflicts that may come to play such as religion. A different part of the problem would be an addiction, now this really all boils down to the player themselves. It's like how developed systems or websites always have loopholes or bugs, you can't indefinitely remove a problem imo, unless you completely remove the activity that causes the problem, in this case, gambling.",

Is the casino able to block the person if he can control it and slip and try to gamble again?And the gamblers has also the responsibility to inform the gambling platform specially if you break it. So again, it boils down to both parties, and take reasonable steps to prevent this gambling problem not only for the individual, but for others as well.",

It's still good to have something slightly better than the regular self-exclusion as it's one way to close most of their accounts in one go and change their ways one step at a time. It's indeed a good tool but like you've said the difficult part is how these gambling addicts are willing to do the initiative knowing it's not that easy to admit your own addiction if you're in the shoes of the gambler.",

The short version is you aren't going to remove gambling, and therefore you aren't going to completely eradicate the problems associated with it. Counselling is probably the best approach, although it's not pushed enough. I don't get the impression that most mainstream betting sites care about your well being. They care about how much you're giving them, and as soon as you start taking off of them, in a decent quantity at a regular interval, you'll be banned.",
