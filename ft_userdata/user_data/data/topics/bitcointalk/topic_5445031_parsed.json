  "content": "I try to stake DOT in Lido and it doesn't pay much.  I go to https://polkadot.network/features/staking/ and stake DOT by myself by nominate and choose validator.  I get a lot more DOT every day.  The process is very simple and easy.  I think that I will stake ADA Cardano, SOL Solana, MATIC Polygon by myself instead of staking them in Lido or AllNodes.com which doesn't pay much.  What do you think?  Thanks.",
