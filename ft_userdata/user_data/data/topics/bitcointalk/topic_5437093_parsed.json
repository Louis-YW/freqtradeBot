  "content": "Someone I knew, a mentor who showed me what I was missing by not getting into crypto invested 100k in crypto, he started DCA'ing in 2018 to 2020, I was still struggling because I had no job then, he kept me close and kept me informed, in 2020 is wallet turned 4,000$ from 100k, he was so calmed like it was nothing, when he told me this I freaked out..  He replied \" I was ready to lose the money anyway\" that's investment for you..he said. In 2021 he made a bit over 1 million dollars when market started to recover, the once 100k that turned into 4k grow over a million in dollars, he his an icon of motivation for me today , the reason why I shared this story today is for you to learn a lesson or two .If he invested what he is not ready to lose he would have freaked out just like I did and took out his 4,000$ in big loss, so my point is, why would you invest money that you aren't ready to lose in the first place? This is wrong, you won't be able to sleep at night, you won't be able to take your eye off your portfolio, there will be no single calmness in your world. Crypto is very volatile, invest only what you are willing to lose, no amount is too small as far as that's what you can afford to lose. Have a great weekend.",

But I have certain percentage I am investing on cryptocurrencies, I DCA when bitcoin is at $20000 down to $16000. I planned it very well and I did not invest during bear market. I invested one third of my money, expecting bitcoin to get to $17000 which can make me invest the remaining two third, I mean the % of the total money I want to invest on crypto. I will advice people not to invest more than they can afford to lose too, but this goes to beginners.",

Wanting to lose and what you can afford to lose are a bit different.No one wants to lose even a Kobo, penny or cent, but if they did lose that amount while taking a stroll, they wouldn't freak out or call the local authorities to help them out. If that same person lost a $100k or $1 million however, they would have a panic attack and do everything possible to try and find it.That's the concept of what you can afford to lose; amounts that would not greatly impact your standard of living or overall purchasing power.",

Crypto is very volatile, invest only what you are willing to lose, no amount is too small as far as that's what you can afford to lose. Have a great weekend. First you really need to understand how crypto works and how it give this kind of problem. As you have said, it's a long journey and he knows that in a bull run, his money will grow so he is willing to risk that. So if you have that mindset then you can sleep at night thinking long term, 2-4 years down the line. So obviously, he is willing to risk and you can say ready to lose or afford to lose, but he knows in the long run he won't.And maybe his strategy of doing DCA also help him a lot, he doesn't have to like invest $100k instantly. So second lesson is that this bitcoin investment is a long game, it's a marathon and you need to have a lot of mental toughness to stay focus and not panic and think that you might be losing big.",

Meanwhile, if we avoid these unhealthy habits, the funds when saved can be enough to invest in bitcoin no matter how small it might look. I just calculated how much I spend on junk and it would have been enough to invest. And the good part of this advice is that even if you lose your investment it might not be very painful because you know that you would have spent the money anyway. It might not be a bad idea to start saving in a piggy bank from today henceforth.",

In every investment, it’s always safe to just invest on the amount you can afford to lose, otherwise you will end up being rekt because you invest the money intended to pay for the bills, or you invested from your borrowed funds. And once you invest, prepare for some initial losses because you won’t be making profits in the long run without having to experience mistakes and losses at first. And always know that those who became successful investors at the end are once those who were losers at the beginning, but because they were resilient enough and have remain on their faith, that motivated them to work hard to end up successful.",

But it would be much better to invest on the amount you can only afford to lose, as there’s no security from investments and you might only end up losing so better yet, anticipate losses too more than you anticipate for profits. Because if you’re only focus with profits, that makes you greedy and will certainly invest because your emotions are telling so, which i think won’t be helpful at all.",
