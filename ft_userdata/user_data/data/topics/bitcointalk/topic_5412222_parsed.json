And also maybe the timezone difference is what makes the duration a bit longer. Just wait a couple of hours and days before the ban punishment is lifted since this IIRC automated base on the time of the ban punishment. There’s no reason to be worried for your account if it’s not permaban because the mods will surely unban it incase the punishment didn’t lift for more than 7 days. Just gave it a cool down time to take effect.",

The OP should know about this, and tell his friend not to post anywhere else with his alt account other than in meta. If his friend ignored him, then it was clear that it was a ban evasion [if catch]. Quote from: hilariousandco on November 17, 2016, 12:46:01 PMStaff do not want to hand out bans for unconstructive posts but if we feel that you as a user are continually making very poor or unsubstantial posts due to your paid signature the following bans will be issued:First offence: 7 daysSecond offence: 14 daysThird offence: 30 daysFourth: Permanent banYour first ban is your first warning. If you have to be banned for a fourth time it is permanent and you will no longer be allowed to participate on the forum under any accounts. Note: If you are banned on one account then you are not allowed to post under any accounts you own for the duration of your ban. The only exception to this rule is Meta where you can discuss the circumstances of your ban if you wish to do so but anywhere outside of that sub will be considered ban evasion and will get your ban doubled, but it is generally best to just patiently wait out your ban and improve your posts on return and hopefully no further bans will be needed.Usually temporary bans are shared due to spamming, but I don't see that the user gets more than one post deleted so far on a bpip basis. There must be another reason why it's banned, but spamming is most likely.",

OK, Maybe a link to the achieved copy of the post that got the user banned will help me understand better the situation that lead to the user getting banned, because right now, I think am lost.Was the user the one that created the giveaway thread?~if this be the case, then I understand exactly why he got banned. Or did he just comment on the giveaway thread created by another user?~if this be the case, then I don't understand why he got banned if his or her comment/post wasn't spammy.

In case you didn't know, now you know.Replying in a giveaway thread means that one is under an incentive to post there hence it still counts as spam. if I create a post asking 100 members to reply and each receiving $10 for replying. According to you, aren't the 100 replies I will get on my thread not considered spam?",

I think the OP is not asking for his friend, but maybe asking for his own account which has been rank up to Jr. member after getting 1 merit. He started his campaign service, so maybe that's why he asked. I'm not accusing, but it seems so.",
