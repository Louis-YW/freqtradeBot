  "content": "Sometimes I think I check my gears and hashrate way too often, I think I log in to the farm PC at least once or twice a day, but I look at the pool status no less than 10 times a day to make sure everything is working fine despite having notifications all over the place, I can't help but look to make sure everything is working fine.How often do you check on those boys? what do you think is normal and at what stage would you recommend someone to go see a therapist? Also what measures do you take to reduce the need for you to visit your pool app or webpage?Things that I do (which obviously aren't helping pretty much with the constant paranoia) 1- a local monitoring software that monitors hashrate and temp with Email notification to an email that's open on my mobile phone, I get emails for over-temp, gear off-line, and lower-than-expected hashrate.2- a temperature and humidity sensor with an app notification for temp/humidity.3- phase monitoring relay which shuts down the whole farm when there is under/over voltage or phase failure.4- Motion detection on the CCTVs to spot any intrusion.5- Some Fireball fire extinguishers placed at the farm (want to get more of them soon since summer is approaching).6- Oversized all the wirings and electricity infrastructure and not going above 80% of anything.7- A heat gun to monitor all wires, sockets, MCBs, Busbars, etc when I go to the farm, just to make sure nothing is getting hot.8- weekly check-ups on the transformer gauges to make sure the oil level is in place.9-I shut down everything during rainy storms and abnormal heat waves.10- periodical dusting and cleaning (depends on the weather). These are pretty much all the things I do to have some peace of mind and to ensure that everything runs smoothly for as good as possible, looking forward to hearing yours.",

I think Bitcoin pool nowadays can give an alert when something goes wrong, Just make sure the cable is nice and tidy",

      "body": "6 minutes Firstly, as I explain with statistics, on Help->Luck on my web site, if you check every minute you'll get false positives.If you check every 2 or more minutes, you'll get false positives about once every 450 years if you have 1000000 miners If you have fewer than 1000000 miners and checks longer than every 2 minutes you'll have even less false positives.However, the 6 minutes is a script I have permanently running that emails me and the datacentre, when a miner hasn't been mining for 5 minutes.If you have miners that fail a lot, that can be problematic, but mine rarely fail so it doesn't matter.The 6 minute check is pretty good also to allow miners to reconnect if there's a temporary outage/glitch/reboot and not complain about them.The thing to most take note of is that noone in a datacentre is ever going to run to your miner and coddle it back to life as soon as it fails.How long they take to do that would help deciding how often to check them.Obviously it doesn't hurt to have something check every 6 minutes, so that it lets you and them know pretty quickly.",

I think getting email notifications for lower than average hashrate for all pool users (if they want to set up) would be a good addition to any mining pool.",

It's well worth it!In our installation we also have CCTV and alarms, I can't imagine having so much investment in hardware and so much money at stake without a minimum of protection.For one of our places, we also have private security patrols but we pay the costs in a shared way with the neighbors, it costs a lot . But this one is in an area where it is justified and necessary.Otherwise I only look at the hashrate a little, I have alerts when a worker is offline for more than 10 minutes and that is enough for me. I can spend sometimes 2 weeks without going on site because we can do checks remotely. I monitor once a day if everything is fine, and then I rely on the alerts.I used Antminer-Monitor for a long time (https://github.com/anselal/antminer-monitor) but we have since switched to something cleaner.Where I feel like I look too much is my bestshares on the rigs that are mining solo, even though I know it's useless, I look at my bestshares at least 5 times a day",

Still, the work they will do doesn't require any special skills, so if I had to look for a guy like that,  trust and desire for work would be the only things I would look for.",
