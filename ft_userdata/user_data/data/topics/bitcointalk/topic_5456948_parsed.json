  "content": "A question arises in all of us that the world will ever be able to escape war and conflict? Because there was almost always war and conflict in the world and is constantly increasing. At this time from a small war, it is turning into a big one. New countries are added to intensify it. Every country is always active to protect their own interests. Political instability, climate change, risk of economic recession, etc., however, play a major role in deterring war. However, the main reason for this war is the arms race of the global superpower countries and the aim of increasing their business.Palestine and Israel have been in conflict for a long time. Israeli oppression of Palestinians continues. Every day which appeared as headlines in various newspapers.The first conflict of the 21st century started in Afghanistan, an Asian country. After the Twin Towers attack, the country was widely attacked for harboring terrorists. The war between Taliban and American soldiers started.But that war was not only in Afghanistan. Every year war has started in new countries. We have seen wars organized in Iraq in 2003, Libya in 2006, Syria in 2011, and Yemen in 2015. This war continues. Before the war, there was peace in those countries. There was economic prosperity. But because of the war, all those countries are broken today.Again, Myanmar was another country in Asia that was ruled by the military for more than 6 decades, but there are also various conflicts and wars going on in the country through a military coup in 2021, which has now turned into a civil war.Stability has not yet returned to Myanmar, and a fierce war has erupted between Russia and Ukraine. Russia's war with the West has caused massive losses and the war continues. Due to this war, the world economy has now had a major negative impact, including inflation. Thousands of people have already been killed in Russia and Ukraine.Considering the above situation, we can realize that this war will never end. War will not stop as long as there is arms trade. We will constantly see war somewhere in the world. Do you think that it is possible to stop the war?",

And with the events going on around the world, even with the ones you mentioned, it's just a clear interpretation of what was spoken in the Holy Book. In another angle, as long as there is a choice between good and bad, humans will always be at war with themselves over which side to be on. Some people say \"we can resolve the war\", but in all honesty won't because in a way, they seem to be getting something from it, either power or more arms or even the chance to prove superiority over the weaker one. But the truth still remains, war can't be stopped as long as man still has greed inherent in him.",

It will only take a little while before another one starts in another corner of the world. I think one reason why there will always be wars and cris is because some people and companies as well as organisations benefits from crisis, they need crisis because it is during this time that their business blossoms, so they always try to influence situation and ensure that is crisis somewhere. Another reason there will always be wars and crisis is because people from different places with different beliefs will never agree on one thing.",

But because of the war, all those countries are broken today.I will not forget these wars that destabilize the Middle East and Africa. Specifically, the war in Iraq and Libya destroyed some of the best economies in Africa and the Arab world. The most painful part of it was that the US and its allies lied about their hidden agenda for starting those wars. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction but nothing was found. The reason for invading Libya was just because of their hatred for Ghadaffi. Today these nations have not recovered from these wars and Libya has become a habitation of criminals and terrorists. I remember that many people from my country migrated to Libya when the land was peaceful because they had a sound economy. QuoteConsidering the above situation, we can realize that this war will never end. War will not stop as lan ong as there is arms trade. We will constantly see war somewhere in the world. Do you think that it is possible to stop the war?Wars will never end because greed and the uncontrollable pursuit of power are in the DNA of the world powers. They will always cause war to enable them to test and sell their military hardware. They will always want to control the government and resources of other countries. And if the government of these nations refuses to abide by their dictates, these powerful nations will sponsor rebels to fight the government for power. These world powers will always fight among themselves in proxy wars so they will manipulate weak nations and push them to fight wars.",

An excerpt is below, but go to the link and read the whole thing.Daniel 2:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm44In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will shatter all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, but will itself stand forever. 45And just as you saw a stone being cut out of the mountain without human hands, and it shattered the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold, so the great God has told the king what will happen in the future.",

However, no harm of life occurs in this war. But when there is a war of arms, there will be great disaster. This arms war will never end because the countries that depend on the arms trade will always use new technologies to develop more deadly weapons and war is necessary to sustain that arms trade. I understand that this war will only end when the superpower countries reduce their dependence on the arms trade.",

We often talk more about the Russia and Ukraine war but we left alone the discussion we have concerning our own internal war with insurgency and political game players causing unrest in the society, as long as there's no peace irrespective of the settings there's war and people will not have every meas to remain in that settlement, some current challenges with internal crisis were left undone and we are more concerned about the global one, if we want to give peace, we must have one first.",

War is not the absent of Peace but is the state of ignoring one another to have peace. If you want to count conflicts for a day, you will count more than 100 wars every day in the world. After the break out of the Russia and Ukraine war, I have heard plenty wars in the world. Talibans, Pakistans, Afghanistans a lot to mention. Even in my country, Boko Haram to Militia of the Niger Delta and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) etc. War is within us.The only time when will have peace in the whole world is when ruling class press our faces in the mud without dead. Please that is figuratively, and it means, when they kill us all and bury ours. Definitely when one died has peace because he would not see the things in this world again. War in one place affect another area. That was why a poet said, \"we are all casualties of war\". From the creation of the world war has not ended in the life of human. Human beings face one problem to another. When you think that you have solved one problem, another problem just emerged. And that is why people die untimely because the problems and challenges they face in the world. Peace comes from the peace of mind. And that is all. Once you have peace of mind then everything is fine with you.",

No countries support each other without having any benefits. It seems those war will continue for ages. You are absolutely correct. In my country, you can't do anything but sit down and watch people suffer and die because of the decision of one or a few men. The citizens are not allowed to vote if they want war or not. Putin never consulted his people that he is going to war because he has the power as the president to declare a special operation. Look at the war in Sudan, just because of a power tussle between two greedy men the nation has entered a civil war. Generals Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo are two power-drunk fools that don't care about the lives of their people because they want to gain military and political power. They are not like true African leaders that are selfless like Nelson Mandela and Goodluck Jonathan that had the interest of the citizens at heart. The war has killed hundreds, wounded more, and displaced thousands just because of two men's ambition.In most countries of Africa, you can't protest against government policies. If you protest in my country you can be harassed, beaten, imprisoned, or even killed by the government and nothing will happen. It happened during the End Sars when many protesting youths were murdered by the army and the police and to date nobody has been indicted or persecuted.",

War is part of human begin exitance as it has been around for a very long time. As an advance form of human existence we have to be different. This is the reason I dislike Vladimir Putin for putting Ukraine through the situation they're going through now. He didn't have to go to world with them, he should have been the bigger person and not invaded Ukraine. Ukraine are also at fault but they both should have found a war to resolved their conflict without putting their innocent citizens that consist of young boys and girls at risk of getting hit by missiles and guns. We can reduced the wars by dialoguing and resolved whatever conflict any two or more nations are facing. We have some evil business man that invest heavily in firearms and they're those secretly sponsoring this wars going on in different countries. The government need to find this people and put an end to their betrayal to humanity. We should be able to live in peace and harmony without war.",
