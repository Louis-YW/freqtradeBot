Of course, it's going to be a cat and mouse game, but everyone should involved themselves to at least reports this sites, we do our part and hope that no one will fall for the trap.Quote from: hugeblack on October 21, 2023, 02:02:39 PMI began to notice that a significant percentage of scam topics on this board were linked to phishing links.As you have said, they are like an armies of scammers in crypto industry and as we approach next year which is considered to be a bullish year, scammers are going to ramp up their activities so we should be very watchful and be critical that not every websites is safe.",

They promote their poor tricks on social media in the hope of trapping a victim with limited experience. And they steal and deplete his wallet assets, which will compensate them for the few dollars it costs them to create their phishing sites.So, the solution, as mentioned by Hugeblack, is to educate beginners through information and advice adequately.

And then just wait for newbies who found out this side to fall for this trick and losses all his crypto once he connect his wallet.But it's good that it has been flag down already. But for sure there will be more to discover.",
