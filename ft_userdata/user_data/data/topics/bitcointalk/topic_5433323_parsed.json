  "content": "Since the failure of centralized exchange (CEX) adoption, those holding cryptocurrencies have been far more concerned about storing cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges. I am one of the many holders in this regard. I store all my cryptocurrencies in Binance and Kucoin centralized exchanges, not in any other wallets.Â  I know keeping cryptocurrency in an online wallet is the same thing as keeping money in someone else's pocket.Â  But I don't know what to do, especially since cryptocurrency is completely illegal in my country, I can't share any steps directly with anyone.Â  Especially if he gets involved in legal trouble in my country, his life will end completely.Â  In this case I am looking for suggestions from senior members on how to get a hardware wallet completely hidden from the public eye.Â  Hardware wallets are commercially available here and there in other countries but hardware wallets are not commercially available in our country.Â  So can you give me a proper suggestion on how I can purchase a hardware wallet completely safely.",

You don't have to declare you have them once you enter your homeland. That could be more costly but safer than buying them online and having the item delivered to you (Customs might open/scan packages). If that's not a good option for you, then you might as well consider non-custodial and open-source software wallets.Buying from your local crypto community is also an option but it could still be dangerous.",

Â So can you give me a proper suggestion on how I can purchase a hardware wallet completely safely.You have the option to build your own hardware wallet, if you dont want to risk prosecution. There are some tutorials about it on internet.For example, since Trezor software and hardware is open source, there are ways for you to build your own which would work perfectly with their wallet (and other compatible wallets) using common electronic supplies you can import without breaking any law or raising any suspicion.There is an example: https://www.pitrezor.com/2018/02/pitrezor-homemade-trezor-bitcoin-wallet.htmlAs always, if you go for it, please make your own research.I have seen some nice packs on Raspberry Pi websites which come with everything you need to build your own Trezor. Here you can see one of the packs: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3192Good luck.",

In the unlikely event that you are searched, it looks like a USB memory stick or similar. Besides what will be prohibited will be the possession of Bitcoin, not a HW in which you have not yet withdrawn the funds. In other words, it is extremely unlikely that you will have any risk by buying a HW in a neighboring country and returning to your country.",

Â But I don't know what to do, especially since cryptocurrency is completely illegal in my countryYou don't have to store your money in a centralized exchange because you can't buy a hardware wallet yet, there are good software wallets that are just as safe as hardware wallets if you do things correctly, Electrum is a very good software wallet that is open source and non custodial, you can use electrum for the meantime before you find a way to buy a hardware wallet.Electrum can serve as a hot or cold wallet depending on how you use the wallet, it is a hot wallet if you download, verify it and use the wallet on the phone you do your online and internet activities. It is offline or cold storage if you have two devices and use one as an airgapped device that would never go online to store your funds and the other one as a watch-only wallet to 'watch', create and broadcast transactions, all your offline device or wallet does is to sign the transaction. But make sure that the device you use for cold storage is free from malware or any virus, you should also format it if it is an old device you wish to use; if you do everything correctly your money will be safe and you may not need a hardware wallet.Download electrum: http://electrum.org/How to set up electrum offline storage: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html",

Just keep two devices, one for crypto only and other for nsfw/social media I second this. Buy a cheap phone or install a live OS on a USB stick, store your crypto there, and secure your seeds somewhere safe. You can also use the cold storage setup with Electrum as mentioned above. It is easy to setup and the cost can be lower than buying an HW wallet. Not having an HW is not the end of the world, no need to risk getting jailed to get one. As long as you manage your security properly there should be no problem. Most of the time phishing attack is the reason you lost your crypto, even if you have an HW wallet you won't be completely immune from that. CMIIW.",
