You will still need to KYC if you mine your tokens when you are already cashing out your profit to fiat. You will still need CEX no matter what happened if you are planning to get a fiat out of your token investment.",

Some people even do both things even used they sell them for more bitcoin while maybe renewing with more efficient models.Since we can't guess the future, it is unknown. I have seen many past scenarios where buying bitcoin and holding would have been better than buying miners. But sometimes, if you bought the miners cheap (like with a bear market) and then later because of the Bull market they end producing more than anticipated reaching their ROI faster.So yeah make your guess.I don't like Nicehash, its not Bitcoin, they rent your hashrate for whatever clients want to do. If the altcoins are green you will get that perception, when altcoins go red, well you will see. It happened in 2018, it will happen again. Supposedly when altcoins go red, they now fallback to Bitcoin. There are other rentals with more control too where YOU define the fallback pool, etc.",
