      "body": "This reminds me of my niece that her Facebook was got hacked recently, it was through OTP she sent to the hacker.Some years ago, I got a call from a scammer, telling me something like that, asking me for my bank account details. I knew it was a scam already and I bother not to go further with him.Recently, some weeks or days ago, I got a call. Exactly the same type of scam. Telling me they are requesting for only FCMB bank account or so, that if I do not have FCMB account, that I can use my relative bank account. Telling me about Tinubu (our next president) grant or something.Recently, some days ago, my mom got similar message, but through our previous conversations, she has understood already it was a scam. Many scam like that my dad do show me. One even a name that is almost the same with the bank he is using. He almost fought with me that it could be real, but I still told him they are scammers. He later knew I was right. Anyone's account can be hacked through OTP given to scammers, thinking you gave it to an official worker of the bank that you are using. Any thing that requires OTP for authentication, it can be used by scammers to take over your account and do whatever they like before you gain control back.Surprisingly, bank official has never called me before, but people are falling for this scam when bank officials are not calling except they are suspecting something wrong with your account and that is if you are a very rich person that the bank can not afford to lose.",

I don't know why our people still dey fall for that one again.~~~Have you ever felt tensed before? Or have you ever been in a situation where you almost shit yourself? That's how it works most time l these scammers or fraudsters tend to use cases where the victim will be scared that they are about to lose something important to them and out of that fear they would be willing to handout whatever the scammer demands from them and that includes OTP. I have experienced something like this, it was when I went to open my bank and account and to also generate my BVN. On the supposed day the bank had issues and couldn't complete mine so they asked me to return back the in two days time on getting there I received a call while they where attending to me, the called claimed that he (it was a masculine voice) works for the bank and that they would be needing my account number and my bvn is that they can complete my account creation, I informed the man attending to me and he confirmed that the person I just spoke with is a scammer. Okay now, Imagine if this had happen to someone else?  someone that's still new to the system?",

No matter how well-educated you are, if you are unaware of the scammers' contemporary tactics, you risk becoming a victim. As  Africans, we believe in Jaz, but Jaz hardly ever affects those who are properly informed about the unfair games that scammers, particularly want to play against them.This brings to mind the time a scammer scam my brother's wife by pretending to be a banker and offering to help her activate the ATM card she had just received from the new account she had just established with UBA Bank.She was readily taken advantage of because she was unaware of the scammers' tricks.",

Na true say some of them de use jazz, but you know say no be everybody wey de use Opay and other wallets they educated, and therefore, those scammers can use their head and get what exactly they want from them.I also see one for Facebook where some Edo boys scam one woman for palmpay wallet, and the woman no be illiterate;The woman get issue with a transaction, she send money give customer and the money no gree enter customer's account, so she no get who to complain give based on say dem no get physical bank around wey she for go complain, so she use her phone to search for palmpay customer service, na there she see one number and she call the number that how them start with her oo, so tey she send them the OTP and them log in, pack her money, come still borrow money join for her account.We need to de very careful with all these online wallets because the risk is very high because u no get who u complain give incase of this kind scam cases.",

One needs to be extremely careful and alert as not to fall victim or prey of these crooks. They are everywhere but I still wonder how they get to know that one is an account holder of the platform they are targeting and they get your details and comfortably call you telling you that they are from the customer care service of your service provider wanting you to cooperate with them so that they could help restore your account but what baffles me most is that they mostly call at night to carry out their act so that before their victim could raise an alarm they are already done with their act. One needs to be careful these days on activities pertaining to details being released as scammers are on the spree to hack people's funds.",
