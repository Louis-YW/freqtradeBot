The bears don't seem to have impoverished their grip on the trend from all trend indications more dips awaits the crypto market so fellow crypto enthusiast should position for a more fierce bear market and wait to take profit as well as stuck their portfolio",

It is quite enough to say that the market has a big chance to recover despite the challenging situation of the market. May the situation will take longer than expected to see but if we can manage to hold and be optimistic for the incoming, there is nothing to worry about.",

To achieve certainty to greater extents you must endear yourself to conducting various analysis and market researches that atleast gives you a 90% accuracy when it comes to crypto currency price movement. If you read the emotions in the market you would see that the market is bearish, when a market is bullish or bearish; you must learn how to trade and get profits by reading the emotions of the market to a greater extents. Your questions, will there be a recovery? yes, there have been recovery more than 2 times since the last dump, and there will be more recoveries even as the market dump. The question is, are you in profit or losses as the recovery takes placE?",

Yeah, we may see a spike for the past few days but it may go down again. If you are aware of its growth or what has been already achieved in terms of the prices then you'll think of the buying opportunity, taking advantage while the prices are low again.

Before that, we'd probably only see a gradual steady increase instead of the usual pumps we've seen in the past year or two. There might be a bit of a few fluctuations but it wouldn't be too big. I wouldn't expect any recovery in the next few days or weeks, we might even see it dip down a bit more. Small spikes can be seen but it'd go back to a middle point at some point imo.",

But only fool people who will sell their Bitcoin under the price where they purchased, just keep holding until your profit was there because the market has a chance to resist and might at this moment there was still a barrier to pump the price.Stick on Bitcoin instead in altcoins, altcoins will follow on Bitcoin price movement and that's proven and tested in crypto space.Hodlers will receive a better prize when they have their patience, wait for the bull market.",

My opinion is that 1.It is a market and there will always be someone buying and someone selling. 2.No price is forever here. 3.The bull nor the bear markets stay forever, but they are continuous cycle.Hence the above question in the OP title becomes a null one. When we are going to recover from the dump the bull market will gradually start again. But the strange thing is that during a bear market the attention towards that asset declines but again rises during the bull market. It should actually be the opposite if everyone was to make profit.Truth is that if everyone joined in during the bear market, there would not be so many rekt people.",

But that's the case for all other assets too, sometimes having to go down a bearish wave to take a deep breath to prepare for a higher bull run. The cryptocurrency market fluctuations are faster and it works as it should. If you think the market should stay bullish there may be no discount from buying bargains. Each price that has reached the highest price will be corrected in either it in the long term or not depending on the velocity of money. Plus we are currently facing ups and downs in inflation in the US and as you can see a lot of drawdowns have occurred during this week.",

There are way too many people who think that we will continue to dump and that alone is a good enough reason to think that we will recover. I personally believe that when the chatter is one way then the market is the other way. Why? Because whales and people who can actually impact the market can see what the chatter is all about, they could literally just go on twitter and can see it, and there are way too many people selling and fearing this period so they will buy a lot.
