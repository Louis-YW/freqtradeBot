What that makes this moment good is that you are having big bags in bitcoin so as the price increases, you make more money. Also some people will see it exciting as they do not want to spend their coins but leave it for their children to inherit the ones that they did not spend.",

It solidifies Bitcoin's role not just as a speculative asset but as a legitimate financial revolution. The next chapter could very well be Bitcoin becoming a global reserve asset, paving the way for broader adoption of blockchain technologies.BTC",

Because this are good opportunity and the government are missing on it and it's annoying me. And now that it as crossed 100k for sure there is more to come in the future. And that way people will keep profiting.",

I sold Bitcoin at a price below 90 assuming the price would correct again so that it would be an opportunity to buy back in. But the market said otherwise. Bitcoin went up to $100k.Part of history, yes. I am the one who will be part of the historic moment when Bitcoin is able to break through the price level above $100k in 2025.",

It does its thing in its own way and no one can tell how the next move of it will be. The market moving sideways for some weeks now doesn’t mean that bitcoin does not have the potential to reach $100K. Just like it has become something of surprise, it will continue in that way for anytime it’s going to attain a new all time high. Now that bitcoin has reached this milestone and is now reason one a six figure price value, let’s see what becomes of the market soon, either a dump or a pump upward. A dump will simply means people may have lost faith of the market not going to continue the pump and we may be approaching the bear season soon. While an upward trajectory still means the bull run is still very much alive. The market is unpredictable, but let’s see what happen next by end of the year.",

It's a fantastic milestone and a slap on the faces of those who have always hated Bitcoin and tried to spread negativity about it. They must be so angry yet ashamed of themselves for being on the other side instead of embracing it at the right time and benefiting from it like others.Quote from: kotajikikox on December 05, 2024, 02:50:55 AMI personally did not think it was going to happen this week because of the market moving sideways but Bitcoin never fails to surprise me.

We thought it was going to happen by the end of the year or start of January but December 5th is finally when history was made.I agree with that. I wasn't expecting Bitcoin to hit $100k before the new year started. I thought we were going to see it decline towards $90k or even below in December, and then it would start rebounding when the near year began, but to our surprise, it has reached the milestone before we were expecting it to.Quote from: kotajikikox on December 05, 2024, 02:50:55 AMHow excited/delighted are you?

What were you doing or where were you when bitcoin reached $100k? and what does this now imply for the next few weeks for bitcoin?I don't know if I can express my excitement in words. The first time when I saw Bitcoin's price, it was below $500 years back. I wasn't a member of this forum back then, nor did I know it existed. Today, I'm active and have witnessed it doing almost 99x from that time.",

Those people who believed about cryptocurrency really deserve the pump and those who are not, maybe it's not too late but probably not a huge growth in portfolio. But don't get me wrong, I'm happy with the current pump because my portfolio is green. Congrats everyone!",

But for those people who continue to hodl lets have fun more with bitcoin for more years to come with this asset.",
