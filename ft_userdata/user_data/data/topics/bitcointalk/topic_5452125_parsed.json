  "content": "I have a couple of graded crypto coins from ICG that have scratches on them. Slabs are made from acrylic, so I was hoping to find a solution that would help me remove scratches in the safest way possible.Has anyone ever tried this? I'd like my graded coins to look just like new. Any suggestions and/or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

And to boot, ICG upgraded their font to a sharper, more clear print. Looks good!! With the old font, it was sometimes hard to tell a 65, 66 and 68 apart",

I will try this method on my PCGS-graded coin slabs (non-crypto collectibles) just to be safe. Other members suggested me to ask for a replacement slab from ICG, which is exactly what I'll be doing. Acrylic coin slabs are easily scratched, so the best way to protect them would be to place then inside a plastic ziplock bag and forget about the rest. I want to keep my collectibles in pristine condition, especially if plan to sell them for profit sometime in the future. Now the real deal would be protecting the slabs against fire and water, but I think placing them on plastic storage boxes (like the ones made by Pelican) would definitely do the trick. Wish me luck!",

Wish me luck! yeah I've damaged more than one slab in my life on accident just in handling alone... 10 bucks is not too much to pay for a redo, IMO. Have done it several times with ICG, also a lot of times where they got the label not exactly right I had to send them back in for free \"fixes\" etc...  I wouldn't even try to get the scratches out, I think it will end up being worse in the end, but IDK for sure ofc.",

My first thought was a sealed stainless steel box but then there would be the possibilityof excessive heat from the steel which could melt the plastics/acrylic so a considerationwould be a sealed waterproof fireproof box which are heavy and bulky.It would have to be both fire and waterproof!On the removal of the scratches I have some acrylic sheets which I have beenmeaning to \"scratch and remove\" with the sand paper technique to post here butI just cant get the time. maybe next week....",

Perhaps the plastic storage boxes that are waterproof, shockproof, and dustproof are a better solution? I own many unbranded small plastic boxes from China, but they often feel cheaper compared to the bigger ones made by Pelican (although these are much more expensive). If there was a plastic storage box with foam inserts for graded coin slabs (at an affordable price), I'd pick one up without hesitation. I might try sealing the coin slabs on vacuum-sealed bags for added protection. Wish me luck!

I may have to try this solution on my PCGS-graded collectibles someday. Both the sandpaper and the scratch remover solution are cost-effective methods that don't break the bank. That said, I appreciate everyone's suggestions. I'm locking this thread now as my problem is solved. Feel free to contact me on PM if there's anything else you'd like to add. Have fun collecting!",
