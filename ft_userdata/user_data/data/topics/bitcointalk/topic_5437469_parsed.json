Oh! how I love that warmth of euphoric sensation while directing events to work out of nothing, Speaking for the voiceless, defending the helpless, giving food to the hungry, giving to street beggers etc...All of those benevolent acts means more than carved Oscar award to at each of the moment deep down.I have no doubt what my life vocation is.Yes, for me, Ultimately this is going to be an institution eventually.",
