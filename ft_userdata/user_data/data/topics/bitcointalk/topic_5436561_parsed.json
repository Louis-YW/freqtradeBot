Although KYC is not mandatory to use the service, BitSwitch reserves the right to require KYC for a certain user at a certain moment and may block funds. May be that a transaction is detected as suspicious or any other reason.In this case, check if refunds without KYC are available.QuoteKYC-RELATED TERMS OF SERVICEAML/KYCis not mandatory to use the Our Service but BitSwitch.io reserves the right to require AML/KYC when detect suspicious activities or for any other reason.BitSwitch.io is entitled to apply any combination of AML/KYC procedures based on a risk category of a client and on a risk-based approach to each client of BitSwitch.io.In accordance with the applicable laws and the requirements of international organizations, BitSwitch.io may, where appropriate and without the obligation of obtaining the client’s approval or notifying the client, notify regulating and/or law enforcement agencies of any suspicious transactions.source: https://kycnot.me/exchange/bitswitchWhat is certain is that we are tired of fighting, where several KYC systems for users fail and end up losing the value of the coins being exchanged, aka stolen. Who, wants to deal with kyc failure.Hopefully BitSwitch.io is not the case.",

Are BitSwitch.io a stand-alone platform or are you working API for other platforms in the background?If you depend on other platforms, it is impossible to pass this amount without verifying identity.Well, they do depend on other platforms so... technically the KYC issue may come up any time. One just has to be ready in case especially by reading all the terms and conditions of all their third party providers. It's a whole new level of hustle getting your coins swapped, isn't it?  This is what they say in their terms and conditionsQuote from: https://www.bitswitch.io/termsUse of third-party providersWe MAY use third-party liquidity providers for some exchanges that are not owned or controlled by BitSwitch.io in case of lack of local reserves.BitSwitch.io has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, terms of services or practices of any third party services.

Or what? I expected that the provider would be one party and that the application would be its interface, but several parties would increase the risks, and so on.",
