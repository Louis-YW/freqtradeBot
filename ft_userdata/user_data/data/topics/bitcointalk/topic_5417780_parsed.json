For example, limit the displayed bitcoin amount to only 8 decimal places (now 16).I would like to see that you are connected, therefore checked by a third-party service in which we have a little more confidence. Best Change for example. Trust pilot feedback is not so reliable, it can be easily faked. especially if there are only 14 reviews.where we can see the fee structure, I see that the percentage changes depending on the amount of exchange.",
