I can even send you a picture of me holding my Canadian Photo ID if that will make you more comfortable.DM me if you'd be willing to provide this small sum loan.No one will give you a penny for the reasons mentioned in the quote above.Begging for money is not allowed in this forum.$10 is a very small amount whatever the country you live in. Why you don't get a job and earn it !!Btw, don't believe in any airdrop that required you to deposit any amount of money.I like your username",

Quote from: OpportunityWasted on April 18, 2023, 05:29:03 PMI am on income assistance and am expecting $1300 CAD in my account tomorrow morning.Why not just wait until tomorrow?Quote from: OpportunityWasted on April 18, 2023, 05:29:03 PMAbsolute worst case scenario you lose $10 which wouldn't hurt too much.Given the track record of \"newbies asking for non-collateralized loans\" on this site, this is the most likely scenario.  Not to mention, $10 is a week's worth of groceries in some countries and your attempt to minimize the amount doesn't exactly make you look honest.",
