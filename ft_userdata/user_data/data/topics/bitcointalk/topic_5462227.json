So e de very important to learn how di forum de operate. I thank you and di OP for sharing di links, Aldo I don see some of dem before, but e still good to come across dem again, to de refresh di memory. Sometimes sef you fit to de post relevant topics wey de related to bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general, but still no merit, even sef you go still follow all di forum rules, start new topics, members go de make comments but no ranking up. Sodiafo, I don reason and conclude say, especially for new members like me, na to focus on updating on your knowledge of crypto and trying to follow di rules to make quality posts, eventually top ranking members go notice you and begin to de merit you, and you go rank up. For me di basic thing for dis forum na to take di advantage of oda people experiences, teachings and informations to expand on your knowledge of bitcoin, in general.",
