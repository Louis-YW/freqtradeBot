  "content": "I have viewed the first republican presidential debate. For me, a relatively good candidate was Nikki Haley; but I suppose that she will be unable to win the primary elections. At the same time I think that Trump will be unable to beat Biden if Trump meets him at presidential elections, while Haley can win in this case. I mean that the rating of Trump is somewhat higher than the rating of Haley, but Trump also has a huge anti-rating (as well as Biden), and if Trump comes to presidential elections, Americans will vote not for Biden, but against Trump.This is a common situation in modern democracies: when the second tour of presidential elections is performed, two politicians with relatively big ratings, but huge anti-ratings take part in it, and the voters vote not for their candidate, but against its opponent. In Russia, this situation was in 1996 (Eltsin vs Zuganov), in Ukraine in 2010 (Yanukovich vs Timoshenko), in France at last elections (Macron vs Le Pen). I have heard, that the polls in Ukraine after 2010 election had shown that if another candidate, Yatsenuk, came to the second tour of presidential elections, he could win easily.So, possibly a solution for solving this problem can be simple - instant-runoff voting:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_votingI don't plagiarize",
