Egypt has more chances of being a double agent for the OTAN. Saudi Arabia is mostly standing for their own interests, they had already given some clues they would not mind to get closer to China in order to develop an strong economy in the long term, after their oil reserves run out.",

Movement towards a one-world currency.Biden's team/handlers knew that sanctions against Russia would only make Russia stronger, even if Biden didn't realize this. So, they weren't actually acting against Russia when they did the sanctions. And now the US wants to join BRICS through Saudi Arabia? They will be accepted, of course.BRICS... the new one-world currency, combining the major countries of the world in one currency.If you can't beat them to make a strong one-world currency, join 'em to do it.",

I feel like ousting of Donald Trump out of power in the second political dispensation was an error for the country even though the elites umpire felt threatened with the Trump‘s administration. Now the adverse effects of some of those decisions are manifesting as the NATO under the US power is gradually becoming weak with the recent news of Saudi Arabia and Iran joining BRICS.I am rather of the stronger opinion that NATO is losing it gently to the BRICS than saying the BRICS is being infiltrated. The BRICS is vehemently careful in their association as they understand the “divide and conquer” or “divide and rule” strategy of the world order.Interesting moments ahead indeed!",

A few days ago, with the initiative of China, a long-standing enmity between Iran and Saudi Arabia was removed, and a beautiful relationship was developed.I think America entered BRICS in some cases through Saudi Arabia and its allies because they have an alliance With Saudi Arabia, India, Israel and the United States, many people think that the United States may be trying to infiltrate BRICS through these countries, but China does not protect everything from China.The main objective of BRICS is to reduce US hegemony and dollar dominance so that the US cannot dominate unilaterally through the dollar.Some countries of BRICS have good relations with the United States, and it is not a natural reason to have them, but the country is very strong, a country that is strong in all aspects.The competition between the two countries has some objectives, Saudi Arabia's only objective is to expand its business and Iran's objective is to protect itself from US aggression.Open strategy is why they joined BRICS.As long as there is oil, all countries of the world will maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia will develop good relations with all countries to protect their interests. Today, Saudi Arabia is the only tool for selling all oil.It will not be easy to reduce the tool dollar and dollar dominance, but if other institutions such as BRICS act in this way, it may be reduced.The United States has created various organizations to reduce China's influence, but its failure is seen by its member states as trying to join.The US should remember that the embargo scam they are running is kicking themselves in the foot China wants to strengthen its position through BRICS, maybe, or soon it will succeedFinally, I can say that the emerging countries of the world no longer want America to destroy their future and people are always looking for innovation and are always determined to find new energy.It is natural that the countries that were with the US are turning away from them day by day and leaning towards China, but it is very plausible that the US is writing intrusion. No, because their diplomatic system is not very good, and they are looking towards failure.",

Just take a look at Zimbabwe or Venezuela, those countries had their currency completely destroyed by the choices made by their own central banks and the people living in those places started to accept and do commerce with the United States Dollar and the Euro, because if they held their currency they would lose their savings in less than 2 months. The Federal Reserve of the USA has a target annual inflation of 2%, which is bad if one has cash doing nothing, but it is not fair to compare that to the 200% of MONTHLY inflation I saw with my very own eyes here. Again, I do not see BRICS issuing their own currency any time soon, China does not have much to gain from doing so, they want their Yuan to become the new global real deal, and the rest of the members of the BRICS may not like artificial devaluations of their new currency by China, so Pekin can continue to be competitive at manufacturing.",

Many people and nations are becoming sick and tired of a fiat currency that inflates, thereby devaluing the value of the currency that they own. Tiny amounts of inflation are built into any currency. But the inflation of the USD is almost double the value of all the USD, even though nobody sees it, to speak of, and even though it isn't spoken about formally.The devaluation comes through the loans made in the USD. How? The loans are really creations of new money... not loans at all. More cash? That's inflation.Nobody wants a currency the valuation of which is reduced by loans being made that they have no control over. If they had understood how this worked right from the time that they started using the USD, they would never have used it at all. Now that they are losing value through the lost inflationary value, they are wanting to change to a solid currency.Certainly the conversion to a BRICS currency will come about gradually. But when it does, it will be strong. Why? They don't want to have to go through the same thing all over a second time. So, they will do it well the first time.don't be such a dumBAss, if there is something that is clear to absolutely everyone but you is that BRICS economies and currencies are much more unstable than those of more developed economies such as the US, UK, EU,... do you think the dollar in inflationary? Try any currency called \"peso XYZ\", try Turkey's currency, brazils,...The BRICS block is still a high risk / high yield pair block, nothing at all related with a \"good currency\" that you wish for. For that use bitcoin.I'm beginning to think that maybe you are a bank president or something. You seem to like it when a banking system creates new money off loan promissory notes, which devalues all the money so that it is worth less. https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Tom+Schauf+bank+freedom&ia=webYou seem to forget that this system of screwing people out of the value of their money has been around for well over 100 years. But BRICS has only been around a couple of decades.If you want to keep betting on money that screws people out of value, keep on betting on the USD. A lot of other people don't like a system like that.Let me warn you, however. When the USD flops, it will go down fast. So, be wise, and hedge your value with things like Bitcoin and BRICS.The thing is that you talk about the United States Dollar as if it was the worst currency on the planet, then in reality it has been adopted by countries which have gone through inflationary storms regardless of the continent. Just take a look at Zimbabwe or Venezuela, those countries had their currency completely destroyed by the choices made by their own central banks and the people living in those places started to accept and do commerce with the United States Dollar and the Euro, because if they held their currency they would lose their savings in less than 2 months. The Federal Reserve of the USA has a target annual inflation of 2%, which is bad if one has cash doing nothing, but it is not fair to compare that to the 200% of MONTHLY inflation I saw with my very own eyes here. Again, I do not see BRICS issuing their own currency any time soon, China does not have much to gain from doing so, they want their Yuan to become the new global real deal, and the rest of the members of the BRICS may not like artificial devaluations of their new currency by China, so Pekin can continue to be competitive at manufacturing. You must have ties to the Federal reserve Bank. How do we know? Because every loan made by a US bank is a creation of new money. Since it is a creation of new money, it is not a loan. But the borrower pays it back like it was a loan, and the banks are enriched while the people are made poorer... because more money in the system devalues the money already there... besides the fact that the people shouldn't have to repay their loan twice - https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Tom+Schauf+bank+freedom&ia=web.Then the banks sell the promissory notes from the loans, and they get free money... which the bank presidents and bank boards are tricked into investing into derivatives, derivatives set up by the Fed owners, which are designed to fail in Fed owners' favor, and the banks' loss. So, the banks never keep much of the money that they have created with the borrowers. Most of it goes to the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank, and winds up in the coffers of the King of England.Who besides the bankers wants a money system like this? Sure, nations like the apparent profitability of the USD. But cheating like this - which really screws the people more than anybody - also screws the nations. Governments are getting fed up with being screwed like this. The USD will come crashing down when this info is spread far enough that nobody wants to use it Fed fiat (the USD) any longer.",

You have probably been forecasting and waiting for the dollar to collapse for... how long? decades? Your theory is that it will crash when enough people know something only you know? It may be time for you to start accepting the fact that it may simply not happen in your lifetime. Are you sure you want to be \"right\" after your death?Meanwhile the B_I_S, which are in no way opposing the US, are hungry for foreign investment and the US is the best placed country to get that from.",

Are you investing in BRICS just so that you have something to fall back on when the scamming fiat USD collapses? If not, you should be. The fiat USD will go down, soon.Government debt surpasses $34 TRILLION mark just FOUR MONTHS after it hit $33 trillionhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2024-01-05-government-debt-surpasses-34-trillion-mark.htmlThe total public debt of the United States has surpassed the $34 trillion mark for the first time in the nation's history.The Department of the Treasury confirmed the historic event on Tuesday, Jan. 2, just as members of the divided Congress gear up for another series of political battles over government spending. (Related: House passes record $886 BILLION defense spending bill.)The Treasury noted that the historic mark was hit on Friday, Dec. 29, when total public debt outstanding rose to $34.001 trillion from $33.911 trillion on Thursday, Dec. 28.The debt that counts toward the federal debt ceiling rose to $33.89 trillion on Friday from $33.794 trillion the previous day. This \"debt subject to limit\" category is slightly lower because it does not include the unamortized discount on U.S. Treasury bills and zero coupon bonds, on debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed debt of certain other government agencies.This milestone comes shortly after the federal debt hit the $33 trillion mark in September 2023 amid rising federal deficits fueled by falling tax revenues and rising federal government spending.This means the federal government spent a trillion dollars within just four months, growing significantly faster than expected.\"So far, Washington has been spending money as if we had unlimited resources,\" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. \"But the bottom line is there is no free lunch, and I think the outlook is pretty grim.\"Maya McGuineas, president of the fiscal watchdog organization the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, called the $34 trillion debt figure \"a truly depressing achievement\" that the committee attributes to the unwillingness of political leaders to make \"difficult fiscal choices.\"\"We remain hopeful that policymakers will take further measures to reduce our borrowing either by raising taxes, reducing spending or creating a fiscal commission – or ideally by doing all of the above,\" said MacGuineas in a statement.Meanwhile, the administration of President Joe Biden has accused Republicans of being responsible for the historic achievement, with White House spokesperson Michael Kikukawa claiming that the debt increases were \"trickle-down debt\" driven by the 2017 tax cuts passed by the GOP that only benefited corporations and wealthy Americans.\"Congressional Republicans want to double down on 'MAGAnomics' with more than $3 trillion in giveaways skewed to the wealthy while forcing hardworking Americans to pay the price by cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,\" said Kikukawa in a statement.Congress expected to bring up debt, government spending...",
