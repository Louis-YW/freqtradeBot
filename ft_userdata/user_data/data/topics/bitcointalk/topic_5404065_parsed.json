Which part of the device I need to burn to destroy all information from it or keep for safety.Any permanent storage devices, which will usually be HDDs or SSDs. However, just because the desktop doesn't work doesn't necessarily mean your storage drives have failed. You can probably strip them out and use them in another machine instead.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on June 25, 2022, 06:40:12 PMSituation 2.

Wiping a drive doesn't actually delete the data on it, it just tells the OS that the data is unneeded and it can be written over whenever needed. Unless you actually write over the data though, then it still exists after being deleted. There are pieces of software out there which will write junk data to your hard drive to make it safe, but the best option is simply to remove and keep/destroy the hard drive and sell the laptop without it.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on June 25, 2022, 06:40:12 PMSituation 1: The hardware device is not functional anymore.

First of all, I'd like to point out that the video (and the attack) are very old and discussed on this forum already.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on June 25, 2022, 06:40:12 PMSituation 2: How safe it is to hand out a used and reset hardware wallet to someone else who does not know the seed I had for it?How the fuck I never considered to think of these before?Since you can't pull the storage chip off the wallet, in my opinion you should never sell a hardware wallet (reset or not, doesn't matter). It's simply unsafe. Always assume that a 'wiped drive' can be at least partly restored, in most cases.The only reason where I'd say it should be fine is if you overwrite a HDD with a few passes.That's because SSD controllers are smart and don't allow us to e.g. overwrite specific cells (unlike a HDD that goes from start to finish), and a lot of consumer hardware, like smartphones doesn't even allow to unmount the main drive and mount it on another machine / OS to fully wipe it.Hence I say: unless we're speaking of a HDD in an off-the-shelf PC or laptop, that you can wipe with multiple passes, don't rely on the device's data being permanently deleted.Honorable mention: if you have some sort of full disk encryption going on (like many Apple devices), in theory tossing the keys (which is what happens when hitting 'wipe' on those) should suffice. But since I can't check how they do their encryption, I wouldn't trust sensible data to that mechanism. Certainly don't trust Bitcoin seeds to a 'wiped' storage medium that is not a HDD which you know you wiped (overwrote) fully from start to finish multiple times.",

Â I recently bought a ColdCard, and I've spent a few hours tinkering with it before I christen it \"The Hardware Wallet.\" Â One of the things about the ColdCard that I like (it's a Mk4, btw,) is that it has a small amount of storage that can be mounted when plugged into a computer's USB port. Â The storage can be used to transfer wallet files to the PC after generating them in the cold card. Â When the ColdCard is unplugged all the data that was stored in said mount is automatically erased.What I'm wondering, is if the data is just merely erased, or is completely purged? Â I doubt it's overwritten, but since it appears to be RAM is it completely unrecoverable when it loses power? Â The device also erases any Bip39 passphrase that's been entered when it's logged off or disconnected from power. Â I wonder how secure the device's memory features are.As for BitcoinGirl.Club's panic attack; The Trezor and it's clones have open source hardware, which is partially why they are vulnerable to this attack vector, but the risk can largely be mitigated by adding a Bip39 passphrase to your hardware wallet. Â This is especially important for the Trezor wallets, and any that use their source code. Â Even if the hacker is able to steal your hardware, and break into it to extract your seed phrase, there's no way for him to get to your funds if they are locked behind a strong passphrase. Â I certainly wouldn't consider this a cure, more like buying you a little bit of extra time to create a new seed and transfer all the funds.I use passphrases on all my hardware wallets now, even if they are not vulnerable to the attack vector demonstrated in that video.",
