  "content": "The well-known cryptocurrency exchange FTX went bankrupt in November 2022. Since then, the case has taken several twists and turns. While the rest of the community is still waiting for their funds to be returned, the Japanese branch of the exchange will resume crypto and fiat withdrawals. According to a recent statement, FTX's Japanese subsidiary announced that withdrawals would begin at noon in Tokyo.Customers will be able to withdraw funds through the Liquid Japan platform. FTX acquired Liquid Japan, a locally licensed cryptocurrency exchange, in April 2022.How FTX will handle out the withdrawal process:To withdraw assets from FTX Japan, users must first open an account with Liquid Japan, assuming they do not already have one. The details of the procedure were emailed to all eligible clients by FTX's Japanese subsidiary. They must then confirm the balance on their FTX Japan account.In addition, the exchange issued a warning. A large number of customers filing withdrawal requests may cause the withdrawal process to become overburdened. The statement was as follows:Quote“In addition, when resuming the withdrawal and delivery service, it may take some time for our company to process due to the concentration of requests from a large number of customers. Thank you for your understanding. We will inform you about the resumption of other services of FTX Japan at a later time.”This is a positive development for customers who have suffered significant financial losses as a result of FTX's bankruptcy. Customers who traded with FTX.US are still waiting to hear what will happen while the exchange continues its bankruptcy process. Japan's regulators were praised for passing stringent laws to protect its investors so quickly.https://thepaypers.com/https://watcher.guru/",

So FTX shouldn't be getting any merit from this. This isn't about the FTX brand; this is about Japan's stricter crypto regulations. Not to mention that FTX Japan was more or less independent and very young. It was just launched in the middle of 2022, if I'm not mistaken. Many might have misconstrued the news because of the headlines. The headlines are giving more emphasis on FTX Japan and users getting refunds. But the truth is that it's Japan's regulators and policies that actually saved the day for the FTX users there.",

Japan has learned a lot from its dark experience with MTgox. It seems their rules apply to all crypto industries that wanna do business in that country. If the Japanese market has a large enough revenue contribution, no matter how strict the rules don't reduce the company's interest in doing business in a healthy manner and usually it will be sustainable.",

Do not be surprised by this news because Japan is famous for its strict regulations to protect their citizens' rights, any business that wants to operate must register for a business license. As far as I know, FTX only has a business license in the US, Japan, and the Bahamas, so it will not be surprising that users of these 3 countries will be refunded in the near future. But for users all over the world, FTX has no obligation to pay those debts, everything depends only on their kindness.",

They're free but within certain strict regulations. It's either strict compliance or they won't get the registration from the authorities and they won't be allowed to operate. I agree that the resumption of withdrawal a few months after the bankruptcy is largely a \"fruit of their strict crypto laws.\"[1]QuoteQuote from: Darker45 on February 23, 2023, 02:54:45 AMJapan has regulatory mechanisms that protect its citizens from the dangers and risks involved with the likes of FTX.Am now interested to learn more of how crypto businesses survive, and from the sound of this, did you just describe an authoritarian govt  of which I believe Japan isn't... I don't think you need to be an authoritarian government to mandate crypto companies to be registered with the Financial Services Agency (FSA), \"introduced laws requiring exchanges to register with authorities and mandating that they keep their customers’ money separate from their own accounts,\" require exchanges to \"hold at least 95% of customers’ digital assets in a cold wallet,\" require them to \"entrust clients’ holdings of government-issued currencies such as the yen or the dollar to a third-party Japanese institution such as a trust bank,\" among others.[2] QuoteQuote from: Darker45 on February 23, 2023, 02:54:45 AMThe customers should be aware of this, lest they might indeed \"write off all the wrongs done by FTX.\" But there are no dots to connect.

But FTX isn't only in Japan are you also saying other branches of the company are doing the same of allowing clients to withdraw their aledged lost funds. This is exclusive to FTX Japan users. That's why I'm saying that what's happening with FTX Japan isn't FTX doing its thing; it's Japan doing its thing. FTX doesn't deserve a credit for it. Users of other branches of FTX are not as fortunate. Not only will they receive their funds late or god knows when, they would also recover only a portion. Even those Japanese who are using different FTX platforms other than FTX Japan won't be recovering their losses soon. SBF himself has acknowledged that FTX US should emulate what FTX Japan is doing.[1] https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-ftx-customers-get-their-money-backin-japan-at-least-3e0f2d15[2] Ibid.",

Maybe the insurance was openly listed that it's all to be used in paying back all their Japanese investors and customers if the exchange ever experienced any form of attack or filed bankruptcy; those funds deposited in the insurance account should be used to repay their customers.The US customer and other countries are not under the same insurance; the exchange is insured, but the terms are different. I believe those in the US and other regions hope to recover their lost and misused funds on the exchange. Their insurance didn't cover up the customers deposits, but it's only their responsibility to cover up for their investors, whose investment safety is always their primary priority more than that of the customers who are making that money for them.",
