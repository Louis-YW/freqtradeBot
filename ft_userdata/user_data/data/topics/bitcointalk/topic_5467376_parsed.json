There is a popular saying that keeps saying \"Don't wait for what your country could do for you, think of what you could do for your country to be more better\" I know this side of my post will stir up hatred but the truth be told.We are tired of hearing government that government this because we aren't to solely depends on them between government can not offer jobs to  all her citizens to work so we our selves needs to create job opportunities for people around us then we can make our country a better place to resides, though we knew that our government aren't trying but let us not use it as a yardstick whereby you can use them for fun rather we should work our parts. Believe me or not there were some others who made it without the aids of the governments, you are here today is a privilege for you to developed yourself more better because even the government will never give you this forum if they knew about here rather they would made available for their loves one to start glance through and enjoys all the benefits from here. So I will actually advise you to reduce your attention from governments to self development and learn skills that could reshaping your mental thinking and ways of behaviors otherwise you could be mentally affected while thinking and waiting for your government to come rescue you.Please do not mind my post because we are all suffering and sharing pains and burden together, so the best is just move on don't wait for anyone not even your close relatives to come assists you for something you knew you could move away to sources it for yourself instead of waiting for some groups of old men that is already closed to their grave to help you do some changes in the country. Please go for skill and forget about governments, thank God you are in this forum please focused to read things that will benefits you instead of thinking of long gone people.",

The government can't do anything about that,  because some of the economic crisis os a global crisis such as inflation and the rest of the other outcome of economic meltdown that have affected global economy.",

You have to be your own savior and messiah. The day that man desires to spring up and take a bold step, then the universe will conspire to help with. He'll start to attract the help the he desiresYou can take a bold step but how fast you run depends on the what's is pursuing you.

Even the so called government personnel are watching those video and making themselves happy as well, just take a look at 10 year old boy Kiriku is doing pretty much fine without waiting for his father, mother and brothers to give him go ahead order but his doing it fine and today if I am not lying he is the bread winner of their family. He just posted a new Lexus he bought few days or weeks ago, there is no government behind him rather is his skills that fetch him those money (wealth) that he is swimming on today, so let us learn to be creative and utilized every golden opportunities we sees today.",

We supposed dey for a government like the Americans wey be say every state go find their own belle and dey give commission to the federal government. From those taxes, the federal government go come dey assist the state government on some kind things wey dey hard dem and no be this one wey just few states dey do all the work and dem go come share everything to other states wey no dey do anything. This is just making the governor lazy. If each governor was demanded to make a manifesto on how him go move the state forward through the national resource wey dem get, e for make sense then this one wey be say dem go just set down for office dey receive allocation from federal government from other states hustle.Quote from: ColdLava40 on September 19, 2023, 09:03:34 PMIt is interesting to know that some people have realized that the government can't do anything for them, which has made them to take tough decision by striving hard to meet their personal needs.E dey work for dem abi e no dey work for dem, if you wan make am for this life no where wey you wait on the government. The government can only make life comfortable to you reach some can side but if you wan touch block you need hustle without depending on the government. We don't have to wait on the government because dey don't have much things offer especially this our Nigeria government. We need stand up and take advantage of the internet and hustle our own hustle and I no mean fraud oh, I mean legit hustle wey be say you no go fear to dey spend your money because e clean. Dem dun share Nigeria finish and e no go easy to get am back but you can hustle today so your children no go dey at disadvantage like the rest of us but go get some kind privileges wey go give dem a head start for life.",

So if na to fight I no dey for dat one.

Is true na, the worst mistake is to depend on the government to survive were as it will just be like a dream that can never come to pass so the early we take bold step the better chance we have to survive, we cannot depend on a system that doesn't care about your well being because you may end wasting your youthful age and by the time you realize yourself is already late, so just like you said is compulsory to take care of yourself by working hard to provide for your needs and want, so we shouldn't wait for things to get better before hustling because waiting for things to get better first is like waiting for manner to come from heaven and fall on you, so taking a bold step is best because the only time we have to hustle is now as we are still young and strong so failure to take a bold step now could lead to future regrets.",
