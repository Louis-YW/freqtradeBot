  "content": "QuoteOn New Year's Day, several Stanford scientists joined CBS' Scott Pelley on the program \"60 Minutes\" to discuss the global mass extinction crisis. Spoiler: no one had any good news.Tony Barnosky, a Stanford biologist whose work involves using fossil records to map changes in ecosystems over time, told CBS that his work suggests that extinction rates today are moving at roughly 100 times the rate typically seen in Earth's four-billion-year known history of supporting life.According to Barnosky, such rapid population loss means that Earth is currently experiencing the worst mass extinction episode since the dinosaurs. And while Earth itself has repeatedly recovered from mass extinction events, the vast majority of the life existing on our planet at the time has not.Unfortunately, that may well include us humans — or, at least, the trappings of our technological civilization.\"I and the vast majority of my colleagues think we've had it,\" Barnosky's Stanford colleague Paul Ehrlich, who also appeared on the show, told Pelley, \"that the next few decades will be the end of the kind of civilization we're used to.\"That grim reality, according to the researchers, means that even if humans manage to survive in some capacity, the wide-reaching impacts of mass extinction — which include habitat destruction, breakdowns in the natural food chain, soil infertility, and more — would cause modern human society to crumble.\"I would say it is too much to say that we're killing the planet, because the planet's gonna be fine,\" said Barnosky. \"What we're doing is we're killing our way of life.\"In other words? If humans don't drastically course-correct, the havoc we're wreaking on the planet will very unpleasantly do so for us. It's a grim warning, but one that other experts are echoing.Ehrlich, it's worth noting, is somewhat of an overpopulation and mass extinction icon. He published \"The Population Bomb,\" one of the first modern books on the dangers of excess human development and population growth, back in 1968, and was considered an alarmist for the controversial predictions he made at the time. Although not all of his contentious forecasts came true, two big ones — that greenhouse gases would melt polar ice, and that humanity would overwhelm the wild — have undoubtedly since materialized. And sadly, his reasoning for their realization feels depressingly familiar.According to Ehrlich, the problem is \"too many people, too much consumption and growth mania\" — a reality that few would likely argue is showing any meaningful sign of slowing down.\"Humanity is not sustainable. To maintain our lifestyle (yours and mine, basically) for the entire planet, you'd need five more Earths,\" Ehrlich told his interviewer. \"Not clear where they're gonna come from.\"\"Resources that would be required, the systems that support our lives, which of course are the biodiversity that we're wiping out,\" the 90-year-old researcher added. \"Humanity is very busily sitting on a limb that we're sawing off.\"https://futurism.com/stanford-scientists-civilization-crumble....No shortage of doom and gloom here:QuoteThat grim reality, according to the researchers, means that even if humans manage to survive in some capacity, the wide-reaching impacts of mass extinction — which include habitat destruction, breakdowns in the natural food chain, soil infertility, and more — would cause modern human society to crumble.There is a question I have about projected future soil infertility. I think everyone knows there could be a deep connection between soil fertility and animal manure. As species across the world decline in population. There is a decreased volume of animal manure reaching soils. Which could cause soil to become infertile. One example of this is the widespread devastation of bison herds in north america. Prior to european settlers decimating their populations, it was said that bison herds in north america flocked together like locusts in their annual migration across the continent. Reduced bison herds lead to reduced bison manure which contributes towards reduced soil fertility. But even as far back as 100 years ago, it was still very common for many to reside in independent farming communities with many animals to maintain relative fertility of soil. More recently the social exodus from farms to cities and modern living may correlate with lower populations of animals per square acre (hectare). Which could correlate with reduced square footage of arable land across the globe.But to be honest, I can't say I've looked very far into this topic. It is known that independent farmers in remote desert locations have succeeded in growing many acres of forestland in areas where it was considered impossible to do so.",

EG caveman,, wild west,, to become democratic society of citizens with civilityi think civilisation in america died when everyone went trump in 2016-2020 and then went covid crazy in 2020-21however population of humans is still on the increase.. and civility will increase when people stop treating CBD vapes as breath mint spraywe breached the 8billion number we didnt sink below the previous 7 billion numberthe human numbers are fine, calm downwhen it comes to earth population of animals and creatures, yes there are many species and breeds on the extinction list. but its crazy to think that some christian fundamentalists need to cry and demand that all women stop working and immediately get pregnant due to some statistic they read that there are too many women are working instead of starting families and too many lesbians are not having families. the truth is the human population is going to be finethere are more 20year old females in 2022 than there were 20year old females in 2002. meaning more then enough fertile women to keep the population goingin short CHILL OUT!save a lion not a lady, the ladies can look after themselves they dont need to be caged up and spend their lives breadingwhen \"scientists\" scream that women should stop working and start popping out babies because they.. (facepalm) seen it in a fossil.. that is of no bases to say humans are going to go extinct",

I support the results of those researches, but I do not imagine that all civilization will perish within a few decades, because it is still possible to remedy the matter through rationalization of consumption and control of resources, in addition to searching for additional resources in the nearby planets.",

These so-called policymakers and leaders are the ones deciding whether the future will be brighter for us or not. They are the ones that should really get the gears going and do the checks and balances for civilization to move forward. There isn't any shortage of food, but misallocation of food and other important stuff that affect food supply. Why is there a surplus of food in rich countries whereas in poor nations they don't have none? So this is IMO pure fear-mongering at best. Climate patterns will become more intense, but human ingenuity and technological innovation will put us at better odds in weathering these things in the future - at least if we based it at the rate in which our technology is advancing right now.",

Only nations which are in the developing and under developed stages are trying to have income from the farming but that will also end soon in the coming decades. We are already seeing natural calamities which are destroying the farmers which means people will start searching for the regular jobs, move to the cities and over burden them in the process. This will definitely destroy the natural cycle of farming over the time. Increased fertilizers is already a big issue as evident around the globe. We are stressing out many supply chains.

China is currently paying it's citizens to increase the number of children they give birth to. Until the industralized nations of the world make a commitment to reduce the rate of harmful gases emitted in our environment, the earth would keep dying gradually.If Africa would be able to root out corruption, overpopulation wouldn't be our main problem. This is because Africa has enough resources that can take care of it's inhabitants regardless of the size. Africa has massive fertile uncultivated lande that can increase the volume of food production to a larger scale.",

In some cases, fertilizing the soil is used, and in others, fertilizing the crop, depending on the requirements of the particular crop. We can also use chemical fertilizer, mulch, mycohhriza, and many other methods besides animal manure. Moreover, they are effective in managing soils. In general, herbivorous animal dung is more beneficial for soil than other animal remains.",

It is known that independent farmers in remote desert locations have succeeded in growing many acres of forestland in areas where it was considered impossible to do so. On regards to soil fertility, the soil used for food production does not depend on the animal manure at all since decades ago. It is curious, to say it, that the guy that invented the gas used to kill the allied troops during WWI was the same person that industrialised the use of modern mineral fertilisers based on. He is also linked to the invention of Zyclon B, later used in concentration camps during the Nazi period.QuoteFritz Haber (German pronunciation: [ˈfʁɪt͡s ˈhaːbɐ] (listen); 9 December 1868 – 29 January 1934) was a German chemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 for his invention of the Haber–Bosch process, a method used in industry to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. This invention is important for the large-scale synthesis of fertilisers and explosives. It is estimated that one-third of annual global food production uses ammonia from the Haber–Bosch process, and that this supports nearly half of the world's population.[4] [5][6] Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born–Haber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid.Haber, a known German nationalist, is also considered the \"father of chemical warfare\" for his years of pioneering work developing and weaponising chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I. He first proposed the use of the heavier-than-air chlorine gas as a weapon to break the trench deadlock during the Second Battle of Ypres. His work was later used to develop Zyklon B, used for the murder of more than 1 million Jews in gas chambers in the greater context of the Holocaust.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer Before this, it all pointed to gloom and doom and a Malthusian positive check on population (AKA as massive famine).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process",

Which scientists?  It's astonishing to me that anyone is still believing the bull crap that is being put out.  You would think by now that everyone would understand how  politicians continually fund these supposed scientists with our tax dollars to continually put out lies just to create another slush fund to dump more tax money into.So for the ignoramuses out there who still have their heads up their a$$es, here is a list of past doomsday tactics put out there that never came true:1967: Dire Famine Forecast By 19751969: Everyone Will Disappear In a Cloud Of Blue Steam By 1989 (1969)1970: Ice Age By 20001970: America Subject to Water Rationing By 1974 and Food Rationing By 19801971: New Ice Age Coming By 2020 or 20301972: New Ice Age By 20701974: Space Satellites Show New Ice Age Coming Fast1974: Another Ice Age?1974: Ozone Depletion a ‘Great Peril to Life1976: Scientific Consensus Planet Cooling, Famines imminent1980: Acid Rain Kills Life In Lakes1978: No End in Sight to 30-Year Cooling Trend1988: Regional Droughts (that never happened) in 1990s1988: Temperatures in DC Will Hit Record Highs1988: Maldive Islands will Be Underwater by 2018 (they’re not)1989: Rising Sea Levels will Obliterate Nations if Nothing Done by 20001989: New York City’s West Side Highway Underwater by 2019 (it’s not)2000: Children Won’t Know what Snow Is2002: Famine In 10 Years If We Don’t Give Up Eating Fish, Meat, and Dairy2004: Britain will Be Siberia by 20242008: Arctic will Be Ice Free by 20182008: Climate Genius Al Gore Predicts Ice-Free Arctic by 20132009: Climate Genius Prince Charles Says we Have 96 Months to Save World2009: UK Prime Minister Says 50 Days to ‘Save The Planet From Catastrophe’2009: Climate Genius Al Gore Moves 2013 Prediction of Ice-Free Arctic to 20142013: Arctic Ice-Free by 20152014: Only 500 Days Before ‘Climate Chaos’1968: Overpopulation Will Spread Worldwide1970: World Will Use Up All its Natural Resources1966: Oil Gone in Ten Years1972: Oil Depleted in 20 Years1977: Department of Energy Says Oil will Peak in 90s1980: Peak Oil In 20001996: Peak Oil in 20202002: Peak Oil in 20102006: Super Hurricanes!2005 : Manhattan Underwater by 20151970: Urban Citizens Will Require Gas Masks by 19851970: Nitrogen buildup Will Make All Land Unusable1970: Decaying Pollution Will Kill all the Fish1970s: Killer Bees!UPDATE:42. 1975: The Cooling World and a Drastic Decline in Food Production43. 1969: Worldwide Plague, Overwhelming Pollution, Ecological Catastrophe, Virtual Collapse of UK by End of 20th Century44. 1972: Pending Depletion and Shortages of Gold, Tin, Oil, Natural Gas, Copper, Aluminum45. 1970: Oceans Dead in a Decade, US Water Rationing by 1974, Food Rationing by 198046. 1988: World’s Leading Climate Expert Predicts Lower Manhattan Underwater by 201847. 2005: Fifty Million Climate Refugees by the Year 202048. 2000: Snowfalls Are Now a Thing of the Past49.1989: UN Warns That Entire Nations Wiped Off the Face of the Earth by 2000 From Global Warming50. 2011: Washington Post Predicted Cherry Blossoms Blooming in Winter",

Spoiler: no one had any good news.Tony Barnosky, a Stanford biologist whose work involves using fossil records to map changes in ecosystems over time, told CBS that his work suggests that extinction rates today are moving at roughly 100 times the rate typically seen in Earth's four-billion-year known history of supporting life.According to Barnosky, such rapid population loss means that Earth is currently experiencing the worst mass extinction episode since the dinosaurs. And while Earth itself has repeatedly recovered from mass extinction events, the vast majority of the life existing on our planet at the time has not.Unfortunately, that may well include us humans — or, at least, the trappings of our technological civilization.\"I and the vast majority of my colleagues think we've had it,\" Barnosky's Stanford colleague Paul Ehrlich, who also appeared on the show, told Pelley, \"that the next few decades will be the end of the kind of civilization we're used to.\"That grim reality, according to the researchers, means that even if humans manage to survive in some capacity, the wide-reaching impacts of mass extinction — which include habitat destruction, breakdowns in the natural food chain, soil infertility, and more — would cause modern human society to crumble.\"I would say it is too much to say that we're killing the planet, because the planet's gonna be fine,\" said Barnosky. \"What we're doing is we're killing our way of life.\"In other words? If humans don't drastically course-correct, the havoc we're wreaking on the planet will very unpleasantly do so for us. It's a grim warning, but one that other experts are echoing.Ehrlich, it's worth noting, is somewhat of an overpopulation and mass extinction icon. He published \"The Population Bomb,\" one of the first modern books on the dangers of excess human development and population growth, back in 1968, and was considered an alarmist for the controversial predictions he made at the time. Although not all of his contentious forecasts came true, two big ones — that greenhouse gases would melt polar ice, and that humanity would overwhelm the wild — have undoubtedly since materialized. And sadly, his reasoning for their realization feels depressingly familiar.According to Ehrlich, the problem is \"too many people, too much consumption and growth mania\" — a reality that few would likely argue is showing any meaningful sign of slowing down.\"Humanity is not sustainable. To maintain our lifestyle (yours and mine, basically) for the entire planet, you'd need five more Earths,\" Ehrlich told his interviewer. \"Not clear where they're gonna come from.\"\"Resources that would be required, the systems that support our lives, which of course are the biodiversity that we're wiping out,\" the 90-year-old researcher added. \"Humanity is very busily sitting on a limb that we're sawing off.\"https://futurism.com/stanford-scientists-civilization-crumble....No shortage of doom and gloom here:QuoteThat grim reality, according to the researchers, means that even if humans manage to survive in some capacity, the wide-reaching impacts of mass extinction — which include habitat destruction, breakdowns in the natural food chain, soil infertility, and more — would cause modern human society to crumble.There is a question I have about projected future soil infertility. I think everyone knows there could be a deep connection between soil fertility and animal manure. As species across the world decline in population. There is a decreased volume of animal manure reaching soils. Which could cause soil to become infertile. One example of this is the widespread devastation of bison herds in north america. Prior to european settlers decimating their populations, it was said that bison herds in north america flocked together like locusts in their annual migration across the continent. Reduced bison herds lead to reduced bison manure which contributes towards reduced soil fertility. But even as far back as 100 years ago, it was still very common for many to reside in independent farming communities with many animals to maintain relative fertility of soil. More recently the social exodus from farms to cities and modern living may correlate with lower populations of animals per square acre (hectare). Which could correlate with reduced square footage of arable land across the globe.But to be honest, I can't say I've looked very far into this topic. It is known that independent farmers in remote desert locations have succeeded in growing many acres of forestland in areas where it was considered impossible to do so. Saying that civilization will end is like ending human thinking and growth. Civilization simply means the diverse ways in which individuals view problems and solutions. Since no one can stop human beings from thinking, it's also difficult to stop civilization for any reason.",
