I just want some newbies to see how centralized exchanges can be lying to them professionally. If you do not have the private keys and seed phrase, you do not have the freedom. With centralized exchanges, no freedom. But just that we traders do not have option than to still trade on the centralized exchanges. I have $500 to trade, I prefer to go 10x with $50 while having $450 on my noncustodial wallet as backup while transferring the profit out if there is profitable trade.",

Because if they are to be the freedom I know, then users should not be making complaints over frozen accounts and restricted withdrawals because such an action is totally far from freedom.",

I will only advise them not to take Binance seriously because as long as they do not have the keys to their wallet address, they do not own the asset not until they own the key then could say that their assets belong to them.You know Binance got a good marketing strategy and is always positioned to sell its product to the masses, especially the newbies that are new to the system.

Well some persons may not understand this because they may think that Binance really have us in mind because of there reputation and worth. This people are after our freedom indirectly which is something many are still convince about because if you don't have access to your private keys they you can be denied of your account anytime the company or the team decide to do so. We need to understand that Binance want more people to find them trustworthy that is why they always bring in different techniques to make them look more honest and plain to the public. Yes Binance is a good centralized exchange which we one that they are one of the firms that are promoting the adoption of cryptocurrency if not majorly on Bitcoin but that does not mean that we should follow there interest blindly since users do not have access to there private keys which show ownership. We ought to know all these things so that people are not going to blindly confuse us to do what is not ethical as an investor.",

This kind of tweets might be done intentionally because Cz knows it'll be a topic of discussion been talked about and spread to many people just as you're doing. We have to stop taking anything CZ and binance says seriously. This isn't the first time something like this is happening. Cz had numerously told its customer that their funds are safe on Binance exchange and encourage the general public to store their coins using the exchange but we all know that's just lies by Cz to promote his exchange.Centralized exchange had nothing to do with freedom because you never have freedom when using the exchange. They make you feel like you're in charge meanwhile you have no control over your coins whenever they're on exchanges especially centralized exchange like Binance. They determine when you can withdraw and you have to scarify your privacy to be able to use the functions of the exchange properly. Binance exchange and Cz are known for lying and this isn't going to be the last time they do such",

Making money is the sole and major goal of every organization and binance is not left behind. What binance did is nothing but a marketing strategy to position themselves selling their products to the Crypto community mostly newbies with no idea how the system works. What baffles most is the lies told by them that their funds are safe which in the real sense you and I know that's not true. As long as you don't have access to the keys holding the wallets in which you have your assets, you are not the owner of that assets and it is not under your custody which makes it very risky. Not until you have them Under your custody then you can fully claim you own your assets. So what binance is doing is just making people feel they are free to deal with them but that's not the real truth.I would say this, anything that makes you to transfer your assets  from your wallet to any exchange just know that you are not in charge o it anymore.",

But, I think, they may have a goal to create a trusted and compliant environment for users. I personlay think, if there really are problems with this, the user can contact the Cs of the exchange for confirmation and settlement.",

Theres no choice for them to be decentralized at all but to follow the government scheme to exist at all.If everyone wants a total isolation on crypto then use dex that are free from censorship.
