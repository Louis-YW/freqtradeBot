Further, they are both huge transactions, with weights of 19.4 kvB and 20.04 kvB respectively. Given the current fees already paid by the three unconfirmed transactions, to get the combined fee up to around 40 sats/vbyte any CPFP transaction would have to pay over a million sats in fees.OP is simply going to be stuck until the mempool clears out to 14 sats/vbyte. Another strong argument for not using third party wallets where you cannot set your own fees.",

If yes, can this be called transaction reversal?Each node has its own mempool. Each mempool has limits as to how long it will keep an unconfirmed transaction in its mempool, or how large the mempool can be.By default, a transaction will stay in a mempool for 336 hours (14 days) until it is dropped. Code here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3132ec64d9e0f7af88e61ac35807f44315a5ca96/src/kernel/mempool_options.h#L23-L24By default, the maximum mempool size is 300 MB. Code here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3132ec64d9e0f7af88e61ac35807f44315a5ca96/src/kernel/mempool_options.h#L19-L20For a node running these default settings (as the vast majority of nodes do), then if a transaction is unconfirmed for 14 days, the node will drop it from its mempool. Similarly, the transaction can be dropped out of the bottom of the mempool because the mempool is filled with 300 MB or more of higher fee paying transactions.Nodes are free to change these limits, however, and some do, running with much higher limits so they rarely, if ever, drop transactions.If a transaction is dropped from the majority of mempools, that doesn't make it invalid. It is still a perfectly valid signed transaction, just one that the network has forgotten about. Anyone who has a copy of that transaction (which includes each and every node which once knew about it) can rebroadcast it and try again to get it confirmed. Alternatively, if the transaction has dropped, the person who made that transaction could instead attempt to spend those coins in a new transaction. This new transaction would not be rejected as a double spend since the majority of the network has forgotten about the original transaction.I wouldn't call it a reversal if a transaction permanently drops - more that the transaction never happened at all.Quote from: Zoomic on May 23, 2023, 11:47:37 PMIf yes , how about the bitcoin was used to purchase goods and the buyer has gone with the goods?Then the seller is left out of pocket.In OP's case here, a few days after he broadcast his transaction, all nodes running default settings would have dropped it out the bottom of their mempools as their mempools contained more than 300 MB of higher paying transactions. Yet we can still see it on every block explorer we check, meaning that at some point someone (probably Coinbase) rebroadcast it to the network.",

There is no guarantee that an unconfirmed transaction will be finally confirmed. Oh! Thank you so much. This is my first knowledge of this. I have always thought that any transaction that is initiated must be confirmed, even if not at the expected time but surely it would be confirmed even if it took for ever. I have just being naive these while. I also thought that the only means to negate the transaction is for the anticipated reciever to sign a message to alert the network to reverse the transaction. (Just my weird reasoning when I don't know how things happen) @o_e_l_e_o, the way you explain these technical stuffs as if they are ordinary amazes me. You do more than many university lecturers in my country who are paid hugely yet they don't explain ideas and hypothesis in a reasonably connected way.Regarding the case of Op. How sure are we that Op's transaction did not fall in the category of node's mempool as you explained here.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 24, 2023, 06:47:49 AMNodes are free to change these limits, however, and some do, running with much higher limits so they rarely, if ever, drop transactions.If the transaction is stocked in a node with much higher limit which might not drop the transaction at all.

What will be the fate of Op.It's possible that a node has a different setting and keep a transaction in its mempool for a very long time. But that doesn't matter at all. The majority of nodes will probably drop the transaction from their mempool and OP will be able to broadcast a new transaction. The problem here is that coinbase may rebroadcast that transaction. Quote from: Zoomic on May 24, 2023, 09:48:49 PMDoes CPFP method of accelerating transaction I read somewhere not work for transactions broadcasted by CEX?You can do CPFP if you have control over an output of the transaction. In other words, you need to have the private key of one of receiving addresses. If you have withdrawn bitcoin from an exchange to an address you have full control over it, you are able to do CPFP. The problem is that withdrawal transactions made from exchanges usually have a large size and doing CPFP for them would be expensive.",

If an unconfirmed transaction is opted in to RBF it is very easy to cancel it with a conflicting transaction. Full RBF is also being slowly enabled across the network, which will mean any unconfirmed transaction can be replaced.Quote from: Zoomic on May 24, 2023, 09:48:49 PMI also thought that the only means to negate the transaction is for the anticipated reciever to sign a message to alert the network to reverse the transaction.That's incorrect. The recipient of a transaction has no power to reverse or cancel a transaction. Their abilities are limited to performing a CPFP in order to speed up the first confirmation. Quote from: Zoomic on May 24, 2023, 09:48:49 PMIf the transaction is stocked in a node with much higher limit which might not drop the transaction at all. What will be the fate of Op.Nodes generally only relay a transaction to other nodes when they first receive it. There is no reason for nodes to continuously broadcast every transaction in their mempool. So if one or two nodes are running with much higher limits and still have OP's transaction in their mempools, they will generally not rebroadcast it to other nodes which have dropped it unless they are told to do so. So when the majority of nodes have dropped OP's transaction, he can broadcast a different one spending the same inputs and it will be accepted.Quote from: Zoomic on May 24, 2023, 09:48:49 PMDoes CPFP method of accelerating transaction I read somewhere not work for transactions broadcasted by CEX?It doesn't matter who broadcast the transaction; what matters is what wallet is receiving it. If it is being received in to a wallet where OP has control over the receiving address, such as Electrum, he can use that output to perform a CPFP. If it is being received in to a centralized wallet belonging to a third party, then OP has no control over that address and so cannot perform a CPFP.",
