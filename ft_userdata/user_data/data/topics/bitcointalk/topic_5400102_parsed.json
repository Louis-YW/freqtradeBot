  "content": "Gold is the only currency that has ever been considered valuable throughout the entire world. Commodity traders use gold as a universal measurement standard, investors rely on its long-term value, and now it can be used to purchase goods and services, without the need for banks or credit cards.At a time when people are losing faith in the US dollar and other fiat currencies, GGCM was launched an innovative blockchain based project that backed up by real gold!GGCM offers several real-life utilities for their holders such as NFT shares, risk minimization, and more. Let‚Äôs see what are these utilities one by one.1. NFT SHARE SYSTEMGGCM will create a rental-NFT for each GGCM mining share and has set a price for those NFTs in USD. These NFTs are intended to represent 70% of the mining revenue of GGCM, divided into a certain number of shares.More details on NFT shares üëâüèª See the blog post.2. VALUE APPRECIATIONHave you been looking for a safe-haven asset to have in your portfolio? As markets fluctuate and the stock market reaches all time highs/lows, it can be hard to find a place to park your capital that is guaranteed to protect your value.This is where GGCM comes in ‚Äî it was designed as digital gold, and now there‚Äôs a new way to own physical versions of this cryptocurrency.Owning a gold-guaranteed cryptocurrency can help you balance the risk of traditional investments with the safety of gold.3. MINIMAL RISKWhether you are a seasoned cryptocurrency trader or just starting out, chances are you have experienced first hand the wild price action that the crypto market is infamous for. While this can be exciting, it also poses risk to investors who may not fully understand how to mitigate risk when investing in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies.The cryptocurrency market is prone to significant price volatility, making it risky to hold any cryptocurrency as an investment asset. Our gold-backed tokens protect you from this risk by protecting the value of your assets from fiat currency volatility.4. ZERO FEES OR CHARGES üí∞No fees or charges will apply to your trades and transfers (The fees and commissions charged by the exchanges will apply depending on the cryptocurrency exchange that you use).5. MORE SECUREGGCM has the necessary legal permissions and licenses to operate in Mongolia.Investors around the world are searching for new opportunities to invest their money, and many of them are turning to cryptocurrencies. As an increasing number of individuals invest in digital assets, so too will the demand for improved security.The GGCM aims to provide financial solutions that are based on the system of gold, which will stay with you through all market trends and allow you to access your savings at any time! ‚è±üí°",

That facility would have to comply with all the national and local laws, be audited, insured, the asset physically stored, etc. It will be a registered company someplace, It with bank accounts, lawyers, and Lord knows what else if the intent is to have a cryptocurrency redeemable for physical PMs. Shipping, employees, payroll, HR Departments, office space, diversity consultants, etc.I see no opportunity to add value to the current precious metals ownership structures. In fact, all I see is added costs for no meaningful benefit.",

Most of them were obvious scams, and others were caused by legal regulations, logistic or simply low interest of users.It is true this is not a new idea at all and we have seen a great deal of similar projects come and go, besides it does not makes sense to buy any token supposedly backed by gold, if you want gold then buy gold bullion directly and then hold it, the logic behind holding gold is the same we use with bitcoin in which we just buy it and hold it too, we would never buy a coin backed by bitcoin when we can use bitcoin directly, so why we should do this with gold?",

Maybe you got scammed by many scam project before with same idea however don't generalized your assumption since there's still legit company that can manage to create token that backed with there reserved gold. Paxos and Tether are known for there rich fund from there investors, I doubt that there gold audit is fake because they already have a reputation that needs to be protected.https://paxos.com/paxgold/https://gold.tether.to/",

I agree, I mean I can understand that some people may deceived by something like this and may be tempted to invest in a coin with those characteristics, but the more you think about it the less sense it makes, one of the reasons behind the creation of this market is that governments promise to keep their printing of their currencies under control and keep inflation low and they never do, relying on a central party to keep their promise of keeping a certain amount of gold behind their coins goes against what this market is about, and that alone should be a huge red flag and people should stay away from any project which tries to do something like this.",
