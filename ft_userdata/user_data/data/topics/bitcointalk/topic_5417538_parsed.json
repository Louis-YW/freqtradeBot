I need to let someone here know this not only for newbies.There are different ways that you can be scammed from phone calls, email and more but the easiest way you can identify possible scam is the information you get from the team may not be the same and not being the same is showing you something that you have to run. In telegram group, when different account chat you and asking to help you then you know they are seeing a new catch or prey to eat up, run away. Admin is the only account to respond to with care because you don't have to believe everything you hear.Another way you can avoid being scammed is to delay your \"intending scammer\" on the information they require you to give. Scammers don't like for you to delay them , they want you to be easy and fast in giving in so take your time and delay them you must find out something to tell you run away or to know if it is genuine.They always put deadline for you making you to rush and meet up with it. They are mostly trap that is set for you, be careful and don't rush in if you will later rush out. Do a good researching and take your time to delay at times it help.",

It can be a person you do not know but having fake love relationship with you online, telling you one day to send him bitcoin, using  bitcoin ATM machine. This was how I knew bitcoin was money some years ago, when a scammer chatted with me on Facebook messenger with her naked pictures (fake pictures I guess), demanding for $200 worth of bitcoin from me the following day. When I did not send it, he also asked for gift card. I used he for her here because I believed she was not a female.Scam can be through ads and sites you visit. Some can be legit site and some can be fake. But the problem is the ads which you click on can direct you to a site that may lead to getting your information like email, phone number and others document ID, some people were and are still going to be indirectly scammed like this through phishing attack.You only pointed at few means scam can be avoid, but there are still many not mentioned. In short, for anyone that want to know more about how to avoid scam and hackers, the links on this thread would be helpful: Good topics on security and privacy",

Hackers can change email settings and turn off notifications about strange logins and suspicious activities.QuoteIn telegram group, when different account chat you and asking to help you then you know they are seeing a new catch or prey to eat up, run away.

Each of those topic shared also have different ways/schemes or similar scheme used to scam people that's why there's no full cover of it which is understandable. The common scheme used to scam is to own a domain with designs that look professional or similar to existing reputation gambling site which is you must deposit first before you can withdraw.",
