I guess, every new government in Naija used to come up with this fake strategy to us this programs to deceived people like you which they know that it will never come to reality that will help the citizens to be proud of the government than to use poor men children for the program and make the rich men names appear in the benefitiary list for the program. If you can use that 3 months to learn cryptocurrency and hustle for little capital to invest in cryptocurrency, I guess you will achieve more than what they are going to give to the participants in this program.",

      "body": "Thanks for sharing this info, at least people can apply to it so it'll not be like when others were hustling, you were sleeping. But truth be told, schemes like these have come up in the past, people engaged in it, and at the end. It was all wasted efforts and just as a means of the government embezzling money. Promises are not delivered and the level of training are not substantial cos  most of the trainers whom them bring as professionals in the various fields are just newbies whom need the training more than than even those being trained. Its always the adage \"government work is a dead man's business\" that prevails with respect to the level of poor organization and execution strategy I've seen over the years. Well, this is a new government. Let's all be optimistic. I rest my case but put little or no hope in these schemes.",

      "body": "This is a good initiative from the government and it is good that the government is coming up with such empowerment. No matter how poor the coordination will be, there will still be people that will still learn the skill and benefit from the program that they will use it to improve their standard of living. We shouldn't always criticize the government plans to empower the youth because if the government don't come up with such programs, we will still talk against them. The poor youths that are interested, should use this opportunity to learn what they have zeal for so that they can exploit with these skills.",
