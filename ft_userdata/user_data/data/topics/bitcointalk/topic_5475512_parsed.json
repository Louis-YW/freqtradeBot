Like his \"petition\" to remove me as a Merit source. While NeuroticFish is a big contributor, who's beneficial for the community, digaran is a big troll, who's exactly the opposite. And then, he's crying that he's collecting more negative trusts. A bit delusional but what could we expect from such a proven troll. He's proving it again and again that his trusts are well deserved and is even begging for new ones.",

I will advise you to just mind your own business and not thinking that DT members are bad.I think you didn't mean anything negative and just want to help Digaran, But I need to ask, if that's ok? But why would Digaran deserve negative trust when he want to make a review when a bunch of dDT-users do this on daily basis?? Should not them also be giving negative feedback then? This is double standards and this is his opinions and they are worth as much as anyone else's! I am not on anyone's side. I am all for justice.I also use this post to say Thank you to JollyGood for giving me this feedback! Because of you left me this I did remove you from my distrust list. It's a fair and good feedback and I think it's fit on my profile for some time. Thanks!QuoteNot a typical newbie behaviour that registered a few months ago because of the knowledge they have about the forum and the members.Seems to be an alt-account but it remains unknown what the motive behind creating it is.

Yeah it all started when I expressed my political opinion, so don't tell me I'm begging for it, so you think just because they ganged up on me, it's my fault? Show me where I am wrong exactly? If you are unable to read the whole story, keep your insults for yourself, I do not accept such attacks especially when they gang up on me. I opened 3 threads recently, what should I do, In your opinion?Â  Just shut my mouth? No, you should open more threads and keep posting how it's about your political opinion, and definitely not about you being a deranged troll for many years. If you repeat it long enough it will come true.",

Â Yes, Pinocchio, it's funny because your nose has grown back. I didn't leave you a neutral tag after getting into DT, because I've been a Default Trust member for more than two years. You probably mean it was after entering DT1, but I guess you haven't figured out that correlation does not imply causation. If now you see a lightning strike and after a while I leave you a red feedback, you will surely deduce that I left you a feedback because of the lightning, right?By the way, I have deleted the previous feedback and added a new one about what I actually think today.",
