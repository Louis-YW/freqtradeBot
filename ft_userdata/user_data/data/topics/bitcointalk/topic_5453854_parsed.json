The sudden craze on Youtube has me wary and made me question a few of the channels I follow.Is Kaspa any good or is this likely a new scam? Just checked and $Kas seems to be trending in twitter as well with over 2.4M tweets.It listed to Kucoin 18 days ago and after that price has been in a free fall so it was totally sell the news event. Kas doesn't sound like a scam at all, but i don't see how it's relevant either. Price however is in full panic mode and most likely this hype campaign is launched by community to pay influencers etc in order to keep the price up. That doesn't seem to work. It has dropped a lot and i would wait for the price to stabilize for a long time before entering as project with this kind of flash crash doesn't recover fast.",

Not only KAS, but I think the DAGchain concept that is mentioned a lot in some projects in this market has also helped it have an amazing price increase in this market context.Actually, I think there is a certain strength, but they are legit and have not had any problems, I am quite impressed with the way they have pushed the price of KAS up so well, really interesting. The potential this coin is achieving is amazing.",
