In fact, we have only 24 tweets here. I should also say that the number of followers on this page has nothing to do with the level of service and the quality of work of our company. When we started this business 11 years ago (a young group of programmers,franlky) and we were not trying to win any social media audience. We think the same now, so your idea about buying an account with subscribers is fundamentally different from our ideas about how to do business.",
