This is not the first bank that will allow their customers to buy and sell bitcoin, there are many banks like that since two or three years ago or more that allow bitcoin trading. I got a friend in UK that told me he bought bitcoin directly on his bank account since early last year. If the central bank and the government in the country that you are accept bitcoin, this will not be a problem.",

But my thinking is if this is being carried out smoothly bank could actually have full control of people fund since the BTC is being deposited in their app and the app is controlled by their tech department meaning the government will still have all individual records and transaction. Likely all payments and transaction could be track and traced by bank or government this now gives a low credits to decentralized nature of bitcoin and it's holders, still it's better to buy with the app and then moved it to a noneconstudial wallet to automatically decapacitate the government from monitoring your transactions or trades within the user or holders of philippines.",

What I know is that banks are looking for means to increase their earnings, means to continue keeping their customers, and ways to make sure that they fit in with the trends. Those are just what they are after; they are after what can come in their pocket and not what can benefit their customers. What we should ask is: What are they bringing to the table that's not already theirs? The answer is nothing; they just want to make it seem as if they are giving their customers the best of service, making their crypto purchase easier, but what they are truly doing is taking their own little percentage from every purchase and withdrawal you make, making sure they track the address where you will send the crypto from your bank to, as that will be essential for them to use and track your privacy bridge. They can also tax you, as they can use any means possible to trace your crypto profit, so if you are asking me, I will tell you that banks are expanding their budget for milking their depositors.",

Banks like to be in charge of holding peoples money and using in for business. They have seen that bitcoin wants to deprive them of this, and it will make them  run out of business in the nearest future. This is why they have started coming up with motives of accepting crypto trading so that you can buy your bitcoin from them and they will claim that banks is the safest place to store your coins. This will give them the power to be in custody of many customers crypto assets. Trying to turn bitcoin as if it is safe in a centralized system. Also they are business people and they are after profit making and not putting customers interest first. It is good to see banks accepting crypto trading but so many people that will buy bitcoin through banks might end up not being in self custody of their funds.",

But they mention that this service is limited to the philippine. If we think about what should force the banks to support Bitcoin then I found that both the bank and Bitcoin are the opposite of each other, bitcoin is decentralized while banks are central with one authority. the only reason for Bitcoin is for their own interest. They know the world is going to adopt Bitcoin and it will be beneficial so they started this through they also take most of the benefits from it.But I am confused maybe it is valid or not if banks hold bitcoin, will it affect the decentralized nature of bitcoin or not banks are centralized and when they hold bitcoin they have some control over it this is my thought and I don't know is ture or not.",

If it keeps Bitcoin in a safe place for investors and gives them certificates or access in their banking services without the possibility of withdrawing to their wallets, then this type of adoption is bad because it exposes investors to risks. However, it is not possible to guarantee that these banks actually bought Bitcoin.If it is possible to withdraw currencies to wallets, I think it is a good adoption and better than centralized exchanges that do not guarantee anything to customers, with a high possibility that you will be scammed.Quote from: leonair on September 19, 2023, 09:12:37 AMWhere you got this information?

Different bank branches in different countries adhere to the standards of those countries, you may find that they accept the service in one place and reject it in another place according to those standards. This does not prevent the Philippine branch from providing the cryptocurrency service and that it does not exist in Bangladesh.",

Except for other wallet apps such as Gcash, Maya, and Coinsph, when you use them, you can buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.And the only thing I know that is really open to Bitcoin and Ethereum is Unionbank. So if we talk about whether Bitcoin is actually accepted by the banks here in the Philippines, there is nothing clear about that because it is still being studied by other banks that are already planning adoptions here. But there are Crypto-Friendly’ Banks and Financial Institutions in the Philippines",

Some banks have slowly started to understand their path of survival and getting into crypto market for good. I am sure, a lot of other banks will join the bandwagon in coming months and years. Banking business directly contradicts with the cryptocurrency structure. Also banks are seeing the interest around this area so they are stepping up to get into this market as a future survival strategy. Net positive!",

Government here doesn’t care about crypto, not against nor pro so it’s pretty much you can apply for license easily. Law makers has their own personal agenda with their businesses instead of tackling thoroughly all important aspect of our country such as technology development such as Bitcoin.This is indeed a great news since UB is one of the popular bank here due to it's convenient terms which you can open a bank account easily using your smartphone without any personal appearance in the bank.
