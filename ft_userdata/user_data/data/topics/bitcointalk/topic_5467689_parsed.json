  "content": "QuoteThe SEC sued Binance, Zhao and Binance.US in June, alleging they illegally listed unregistered securities in the form of several cryptocurrencies for trading and investment by U.S. investors.\"The SEC recently brought several enforcement actions â€“ including this action â€“ premised on its new position that virtually all crypto assets, and virtually all cryptoasset transactions, are securities,\" one of the filings said.The agency was defining the term \"investment contract\" too broadly, one of the filings said.Binance, Binance.US and Changpeng Zhao filed to dismiss a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit Thursday, claiming the regulator hadn't \"plausibly alleged\" various securities-related violations, and that it was seeking to encompass digital assets under its authority despite Congress not explicitly spelling that out in legislation.https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/22/binance-us-affiliate-changpeng-cz-zhao-file-to-dismiss-sec-lawsuit/The recent victories have emboldened those who want to put pressure on the SEC and generated strong arguments for what is known as \"major questions doctrine,\" which could lead Congress to perhaps limit the SECâ€™s reach, or at least reduce its restrictions.I believe that if these lawsuits continue and more are successful, the SEC will be less cautious in similar cases such as ETFs",

Thought Binance is an LLC which limits liability and the like and should protect CZ legally ðŸ¤” Whatever is going on, hope this doesn't drag on for a long time as this has the potential to bring down the markets If Binance is thrown under the bus with this lawsuit...though a win means green markets to follow...",

The people and management are the only ones that are famous or appear to the media, so I fear that it is similar to FTX. The market is stable and may be the reason for down prices in 2025.",
