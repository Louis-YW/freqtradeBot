This changes is not only limited to the financial sector but it is cutting across the general lifestyle of human existence making impact on the academic, social, technological and the traditional society.Just the same way technology and the web 2 made so much adjustment in different cultures and tradition across the world. Bitcoin and crypto is gradually making more changes and in due time the trustless society might become another history. It might not solely revolve around Bitcoin but its concept will be a powerful building block to bring in a society everyone dreams of.",

This changes is not only limited to the financial sector but it is cutting across the general lifestyle of human existence making impact on the academic, social, technological and the traditional society.The diverse sectors of the world are interconnected. A change in the financial sector would definitely affect other sectors. Currently, some universities are offering courses on blockchain and bitcoin technology. I even heard of some universities that accept bitcoin for tuition and other fees. Just like internet banking has been generally accepted by most people, that one can even use it to pay a bride price in our traditional communities, bitcoin's acception is gradually growing. It would soon become a part and parcel of our social interactions. Bitcoin's technological impact is already visible and impactful. We have seen technologically advanced decentralized wallets, innovative transaction processes, and a creative shift to green energy sources by bitcoin miners.I am sure that bitcoin would keep impacting the multidimensional life of people positively as the day goes by.",

It shaped my investment mindset to understand that everything has its season and it helps me to understand that risk is an important component of life if I want to succeed.",
