But if a pastor is asked if gambling is a sin, he would say the love of money is the root of all evil and uses some chapters in the bible to discourage you which can be followed with some practical examples of how some people lost to gambling. All he will be pointing to is that it is better not to gamble.But not where in the bible that gambling is referred to as a sin in christianity.",

Most people get addicted to gambling and end up spending way more than what they can afford. In such cases you should stop gambling.Now I dont know specific religions but this is the logical basis of how you can handle yourself in case you feel the guilt of gambling on you. A lot of things are considered bad in many religions or are forbidden, but they are often done by the followers of that religion, because nobody wants to be shackled to rules and chains.Your self-control is the key here.",

When you use the Bible as logic, that means those guys are bad and doing bad things while someone is nailed to the cross who is good. It's not forbidden to gamble in Christianity but traditionally it is a bad thing to do because you are wasting money and that is what is taught by Christian parents over the years until now. I have a different point of view about this though, it's all on you. If you think you can control it and gambling to add spice to your entertainment then do so, but if it gets out of hand then it's bad and should be stopped.",

But I guess it his age though, individuals are free to do what they want as long as they know that they are not taking advantage of anyone.So regardless if you are a Christian or Muslim, you have to decide for yourself if you want to be a gambler or not.",

I don't see any sense in that, and there's also the issue of not having concrete evidence of who said that gambling is a sin? In Christianity, gambling is not prohibited and I am not religious either.Quote from: Saisher on December 10, 2022, 12:42:04 PMIt's forbidden if you do it excessively it's not in the bible but any habit where you can develop a vice then it's forbidden we all know excessive gambling can make a good person bad and from excessive gambling, he learns to lie cheat, and dishonesty, some Christian sect teaches not to gamble and some Christian sect teaches to moderate gamble but for me, you cannot serve two masters, you will hate the other and you will love the other.these same priests are also liars, you must have seen a lot of news in which the priest had sex with a 15 year old child or even younger than 15 years old, so it starts from these same religious people to be very liars, of course excessive gambling generates addiction, but anything in excess generates addiction",

And when you have a discussion with ignorant people you find yourself taking garbage knowledge and filling up your brain with those garbage. In most of the case, all of them are wrong information.If you are really interested to know religious things then find a religious forum or reach out the religious leaders of the religion you follow. They will give you better knowledge and suggestions.",
