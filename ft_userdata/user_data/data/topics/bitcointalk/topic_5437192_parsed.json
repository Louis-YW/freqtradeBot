      "body": "NFTs are already beginning to revolutionize the way people buy, sell, and interact with digital assets. It has enabled creators to monetize their work in a new and unique way, allowing them to establish ownership and control. This means businesses can now create and sell digital products with greater confidence that their works will be protected and sustainably monetized. Furthermore, it opens up opportunities for companies to engage customers in entirely new ways through digital product launches, creative experiences, and other interactive activities. For example, game mechanics such as P2E are gaining insane popularity.",
