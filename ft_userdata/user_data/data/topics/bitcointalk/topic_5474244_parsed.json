Unfortunately KryptoKash was helping in the early stages of the project so he is the OP:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=657601.0As you can see I’m still developing the protocol, here:https://github.com/Nexusoft/LLL-TAOHe asked me to see what you guys think on transferring this thread to me. The reason being is it is our initial Nexus history, like the mailing list was for Bitcoin. It would be great to be able to keep the OP updated and keep this piece of our history in-tact. KryptoKash left the project in 2015 to pursue his own projects and seems to have made a bad name for himself…",

      "body": "In my own opinion, if you're the founder of Nexus then it should be transferred to you but you may or may not be able to manage it yourself because I believe it will been complex handling both the project itself and looking at what people think of it. So you should be getting any assistance from someone but where the problem may lie is being the OP you only have access to editing and rewriting the thread so even if you have an assistant he or she can't have access to your account to write and edit the thread. So it all end with you still being the OP, therefore I suggest that you should hand the thread and/or be the OP of your Foundation.",

Why not just continue on that thread?Correct, the @OP didn't even moderate and discuss in his new thread, so I don't see any reason he need to ask theymos to transfer the old thread to him. If your reason is worried your project get moderated by scammer or anyone that has no relation with your project, anyone including myself can create a new thread about your project. So it will not prevent anyone to scam.You only need to ask theymos or moderators to lock the old thread for you, have you report the thread? I'm going to report it now.",

What might be able to be done is for you to make a new thread with your OP, and maybe, the posts can be merged. The only issue with this is the integrity of the timestamp, and the inaccuracy of the timestamp:- If posts are merged, OP timestamp will be after the merged posts.- If OP timestamp is modified, there will be a problem with timestamp integrity.I think that you'll need to either reach the OP, or just make a new thread.There is nothing wrong with a new beginning and referencing the old the thread at the top/bottom of your new one, and referencing old posts if the same questions get asked.",

KryptoKash left the project in 2015 to pursue his own projects and seems to have made a bad name for himself… If theymos asked you to post here, it means he wants to gather the community's opinions, which is an excellent decision-making approach.For quicker results, I suggest creating a poll. To do this, go to the bottom of this topic and find the link add poll.Now, about KryptoKash's absence – he was last online on April 10, 2023, at 10:12:17 AM, which isn't too long ago. If KryptoKash responds here and agrees to transfer the topic to you, that would be ideal for theymos to decide.However, if this option doesn't work for you, it seems you'll need to prove ownership of nexusearth.com (or nexusoft.io) for the community's satisfaction. I noticed your GitHub profile at https://github.com/VidereLicet with a similar name \"Videlicet,\" but this alone doesn't confirm ownership of Nexusearth or Nexusnewsletter.By the way, why is nexusearth.com redirecting to ethereum.org?",

It is clear that everyone welcomes the decision and there is no opposition to this opinion.My opinion, if meaning anything, is no.If anything, the OP can create a new thread with all of the latest information, make a post explaining why there is a new thread on the old thread, and ask an admin/moderator to lock the old thread. This way when people visit the old OP, they can get to the new Ann easily from the last page.",

KryptoKash left the project in 2015 to pursue his own projects and seems to have made a bad name for himself… Why change the OP of the first topic, instead of creating a new topic?This topic has not had any new posts since August 30 2020, more than 3 years ago. After 300 pages of the topic, many images are broken, information is de-accounted, among other things. Recovering all of this can be hard work.For you to be making this type of request, it is because you certainly want to present new things about the project and revive it in the Bitcointalk community. In this sense, I think it makes more sense for you to create a new topic, with all the new information about the project, making reference to the old topic. It was like version 2.0 of the project on the forum.Remember, the topic will not disappear from the forum, so this historical element of the project will always be ensured.",
