      "body": "Mikey is correct.For us to see a gear price drop these prices need to stay here for 2-3 weeks. Prices will then fade more.Back in July/August 2020 height of covid shut down I got an s17 at $785 usd.You need a strong slump that lasts for weeks to push down the prices.A s17 set to 1500 watts will burn 36 say 40 kwatts a day. A six cent miner will spend $2.40 a day in power and that miner will do 48th or about  $6.14 a dayso 6.14-2.40 = $3.74 a day profit.this means a big farm with s17 or s19 is still good.  So no big sell offbut drop price to 20k and daily earn is $3.96so 3.96-2.40 = 1.56 for an s17  which is shitso 31k will not crush asic pricesbut 20k will crush prices.in both cases you need 4 weeks at those coin prices .",

Not your farm, not your gears. Not your gears, not your BTC. Not your BTC, ok that's enough .Agreed. I would never start a farm outside of my home country even if electricity is free. Screw the federal government. But they simply have more hoops to jump through in order to seize a private citizen's business or crypto or mining farm compared to Russia/China/Venezuela. They probably have to go through at least 1 court trial unless the business is obviously criminal. These courts are decentralized (district court, circuit court then Supreme Court) so there are opportunities to appeal.Yes, we saw what happened in Canada with the truck drivers, but they were targeted because they were as loud and in the public eye as possible. If Washington wants to confiscate assets, they will go after Coinbase/Kraken first before thinking about some random mining farm in the middle of nowhere.",
