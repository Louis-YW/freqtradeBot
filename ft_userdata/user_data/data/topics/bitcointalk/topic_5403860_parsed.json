  "content": "The Luna 2.0 is being used by scammers to steal wallet seed phrases from potential cryptocurrency beginners and some smart but foolish people. The phrase \"No wallet is useless, you don't throw away your wallet\" is well-known in the cryptosphere. I believe LoyceV said something similar in a thread I stumbled upon a few weeks ago. The wallet may be empty now, but what about tomorrow? These con artists will keep an eye on your wallet, and one day you might wake up to find it gone! You weren't hacked; instead, the error you made a few years ago has destroyed you.To gather the information I needed, I opened the site through a secure browser rather than using your wallet browser as it is risky.Scam WebsiteCode:https://vocjavha.com/ When you click \"Connect wallet\"",

It is even very possible people that do not hold Lunc at the time can see this type of scam and just fall victim of it. One of the safety means is to never input your seed phrase on any site which. Scammers and hackers like to take advantage of what is presently happening in the community just like the Luna airdrop scam.",

      "body": "Scammers always try to scam with trending things. Since Luna's incident happened, everyone has been talking about luna. And scammers want to take advantage of this. If you search, you will find many crypto users who fall prey to such scams easily. Because everyone wants to get free money, and if they hear the news of an airdrop, they jump into it without thinking of anything. Thanks for the warning OP. Hopefully after seeing this post new crypto users will be aware of such scams.",

The chances of someone mistakenly sending coins to it are near zero.Regarding the scam, no  legit service will ask for your wallet seed or private keys and  it is not needed to connect your wallet. I hope no one will fall for it.",

Usually, beginner and greedy crypto users would fall into this trap. Because most old crypto users are familiar with that type of scam or they know very well to not share your seed phrase with anyone. No matter how trusted is the site. Anyway, thanks for sharing the information. It will help newbies and Google search as well.",

If you are even slightly late in applying the patches it could have a detremental effect to your users. In the case of these wallet browsers they are probably using an outdated version of Chrome which would make it even easier for hackers to get in as they only have to exploit the same vulnerabilities as in Chrome.",
