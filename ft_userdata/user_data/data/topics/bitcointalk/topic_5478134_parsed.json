  "content": "I remembered when I posted this some time ago and some people kept saying to be safer you need to be on an off/hard wallet. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5469814.msg62971784#msg62971784And here, I talk about Hacks that happened both in Cex and Dexhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5471139.msg63031458#msg63031458I said it, if we are in this cryptocurrency ecosystem, our first safety comes from us. No matter what you want to use, there are times when what we believe is the safest won't be the safest. In my post in that link above, I talked about navigating how to be at least 60-80% safe with your assets.I just got this news that some users lost over $600k from hackers on their Ledger wallet.https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/a-ledger-employee-got-phished-defi-users-lost-thousands/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=",

Hackers are becoming more smart and fast, most especially this period, but that doesn't mean we should avoid the use of hardware wallets. They are still the best and the safest for now until a more top secure wallet is built beside, ledger claims that the attack was not centered on hardware wallet but on the Dapps who used ledgers connectkit. Tether have already frozen the account of the hacker while $254k was still found in the hacker wallet address, so it's possible it might be reversed back to ledger, ledger are looking forward to make a more secure upgrade, so let's keep our hopes high that such aren't gonna happen again.",

      "body": "Life’s a risk, businesses are risky, investing in Bitcoin is a risk, but it doesn’t mean one shouldn’t make calculated risks. Now, I can tell you that it is riskier to have your money on a CEX than a DEX. In fact, you can’t even have money in DEX because you only connect your wallet to make a transaction but it isn’t as if you are storing your crypto with them. Many people are conscious to disconnect their wallet afterwards to further reduce the risk (we should try to do so too). But CEX? Your funds are with them before you can even transact. Not only does your fund depend on their security, even the platform can lock you out and you lose your money (not often though). I believe it’s reduced risk to just have your wallet to yourself… that’s the best one can do.",

      "body": "This was really shocking that a hardware wallet was also compromised. If a hacker can put value draining codes in a hardware wallet library then whom could we trust? After this incident, I am thinking of using two separate wallet one for interacting with dapps and another for holding funds that don't need to move for a long time. The hacker only managed to drain user funds from those who have used certain dapps with their ledger wallet. Another thing that we should keep in mind is to provoke connection to any dapps we have interacted with with our wallet. Complex smart contracts are the ones targeted by hackers more frequently than any centralized exchange these days.",

Yes, I tend to agree, that nowhere is safe in crypto and everything is prone to hacking especially when we're connected to the internet but we can minimize risk when we are fully aware of those risks.  Negligence is one of the primary subjects why people keep getting hacked nowadays, especially newcomers.",

The cryptocurrency space has many pitfalls and risks at different levels. Experiencing and receiving reports from someone helps us to be somewhat aware of improving our own protection. I don't like to look at external factors to evaluate because in the end the biggest mistake always comes from personal ignorance. There are many lessons for us to exploit to become more mature over time, the balance of good/bad people is partly the meaning of life. If we don't try to learn, being afraid and not daring to face will never help our goals be accomplished.",

Is that so, I never knew of such. I'm trying not to break any rules that's why I feel posting it here is better. I'll contact the mod right away...I don't know but I think cex might be better in a way if we don't look into the centralised aspects for a second. Now, we know how coins are getting listed every day and everyone is eager to make money not minding what link they click on as far as they get what they want. Same can't be said for cex. You don't need to click here and there and avoid giving hackers your information",

But I guess everything is fine now but still always check for updates if you are the type of guy that usually connects your hardware wallet to these dexes. Well, IMO, these hardware wallets should be good for storage and not for active usage which usually connects to the dexes.
