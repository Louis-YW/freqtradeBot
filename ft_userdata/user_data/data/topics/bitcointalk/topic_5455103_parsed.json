How many partnerships do you currently have? The most crucial aspect is the ability to secure funding for the project.Hello, thanks for the question.Our roadmap doesn't include specific timelines because we do not control the market. How long would it take us to reach 1000 holders before we start our marketing campaign? How long will it take us to break above $1m market cap? Unfortunately, we can only take them one after the other. We will do our best to promote the project to reach a wider audience but we can not say we will reach 1000 holders in 1 month or 2. Right now we are not thinking of partnerships, we are focused on stabilizing our project for both the community and the market. Once this area is a bit healthy, we will move over to phase 2 and reach out to other projects for potential partnerships with what fits us.",
