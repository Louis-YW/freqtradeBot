  "content": "[← Previous Question] Missed me? Time for another quiz.- What's this?Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on March 31, 2024, 12:48:15 PMBitcoin quizzes are technical questions of educational character that improve the average user's knowledge on Bitcoin, and help him rank up. You can read more about it in here. Answer the question correctly and earn merits.Alice wants to construct a Bitcoin script, which can be validated only if the spender provides a solution to the equation: SHA256(2x + 8) = 0xdf3984c3d89ec61f93f2d3060263bbb960a885ffa5d41ca1eb9c2692de71d8b7. In other words, Alice wants to send a bitcoin to an address, which is a script. In order for Bob to claim the bitcoin, he needs to find a 32-bit value for x, such that once you double it, add 8 to it, and pass that result into SHA256, the hash would be equal with Alice's hash.Can you construct this script?

However it's not going to be an easy task for me though since I really haven't created a bitcoin script before. Anyways with the resources you have shared I'll try my best to see if I can create a bitcoin script that would be the correct answer to this quiz. Till then I'll just proceed to reading through the articles hopefully I'll get something nice out of it.",

If you want to put Alice's hash in the stack, just enter it with no opcodes, like this: <target_hash>OP_EQUALVERIFY will fail the script. You're that close!

Removed OP_MUL because it has been disabled Removed OP _2 because there's no need for pushing two since we already used OP _ DUP to duplicate x ( the top stack) and used OP _EQUAL because it's the only one I saw that supports an output been either True or false without a SIG.

However, with x=10499996, you're left with two items in the stack. That doesn't make the script incorrect, but it's better for your understanding to always be left with only one non-zero item. Quote from: Mia Chloe on August 31, 2024, 06:00:15 PMCode:`OP_DUP OP_ADD OP_8 OP_ADD OP_SHA256 OP_PUSHDATA <target_hash> OP_EQUAL`Without OP_PUSHDATA, that's the correct one! Quote from: Ambatman on August 31, 2024, 07:24:58 PMCode:OP_DUP OP_ADD OP_8 OP_ADD OP_SHA256 <target hash > OP_EQUALThis one is correct as well. You should have replaced OP_MUL with OP_DUP and OP_ADD, as you did. The reason you're getting the error in the first image, is that you haven't entered the <target hash>, which is <0xdf3984c3d89ec61f93f2d3060263bbb960a885ffa5d41ca1eb9c2692de71d8b7>. Thanks for your time and question. With this few I can say I'm quite confident in using the various scripts that we implemented in the above question. Is there any site or app that can help in testing my knowledge? Tried searching via web but most are just single questions on Githubs.

Thanks.",
