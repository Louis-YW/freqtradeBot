And so I grew up and also got used to drinking coffee, but exclusively at breakfast, not like the others, coffee at home in the morning, then another cup of paper cup with me. There's probably a habit more to pull time and relax.",

Some say it makes the drinkers feel energetic, high, alerted, helps in concentration, etc. These benefits could be necessary to increase the productivity of people during work. And it's important to start one's day with any good thing that helps boost productivity without abusing it. Coffee consumption becomes an addiction if the consumers can't do without it such that they suffer withdrawal symptoms when they suddenly try to stop consuming it.",

      "body": "Coffee is basically a charge of vivacity. Many do not have breakfast and saving time go near the house for a cup of coffee, many prefer very bitter to cheer up, someone has a sweet tooth to cheer themselves up. Of course there will be dependence here, so many days every day to go and take coffee in one place)))",

Even decaf doesn't cut it. I've tried quitting caffeine to reset my brain's receptors several times now but I relapse after several days. It's something I'm working on.",

The scent of the coffee beans brewing and just enough creamer makes that day even better. If I know that I am going to have a busy day, a second cup helps me to end a workday. I do try not to have so many cups a day and I do give myself a caffeine cut off time. This way it does maintain the number of cups I take as well as knowing that cut off time will help me sleep good night with eight hours of sleep. Coffee is one of my loves and I will forever love drinking coffee.",

      "body": "Whilst coffe in moderation is good for you, you do need toi be careful. It is dehydrating, so nake sure you drink some water with your coffee. It also causes the release of hydrochloric acid, which the stomach uses to help digest food. If it doesn't find any food to digest, then it can release the acid into the body, and this can erode bones in all sorts of places such as your jaw. The answer is to make sure you eat something with your coffee.",
