      "body": "It sounds like there's no other reason except for it being a scam.How much are they promising you they'll send? How big is the fee.To prove this doesn't make sense, you pay a fee whenever you send a transaction which means you'd be paying a fee to pay a fee as apposed to them just paying ONE fee.A lot of scams work by promising higher amounts for you to send a lower amount first (ie spend 0.001BTC to unlock 0.005BTC)...",

Once clients signed up, they were pressured to invest more, and the account manager manipulated their trades so everything would look profitable and promising. Once big money was invested, these same account managers simply disappeared.https://scambrokersreviews.com/forex-scams/bullgeko-review/https://scamsonline.net/bullgeko-review/https://www.scamwatcher.com/scam/view/463589",

I've never heard of this hash power fee term, at first, I thought they meant miner fee but it shouldn't cost that much. Note that scammers often use technical words/buzz words to sound smart/legitimate.edit: I assumed they're requesting .75% of 500K, is this correct?",

If it was for the sake of depositing, then I think it is stupidity of these scammers, when you deposit your money to them, they have the full right to use it.Either if you got *free money* and need to deposit or request data, they are scammers.Generally, try to use a well-reviewed, open-source wallet such as Electrum, and use platforms known to have high trading volumes.",
