  "content": "Welcome to Restratagem!Because Quality Matters!At Restratagem, we pride ourselves on being at the forefront of blockchain and Web 3 technology. Our team of seasoned full-stack developers has a passion for crafting robust, scalable solutions that meet the unique needs of our clients. With expertise spanning various platforms and technologies, we leverage cutting-edge tools to create seamless, secure, and efficient systems.Our commitment to excellence doesnâ€™t end with delivery. We believe in nurturing lasting relationships with our clients, evolving into long-term partnerships. Your goals become ours as we work together to explore new horizons, innovate, and build a digital future that empowers and transcends traditional boundaries.Our ProjectWe have been the creators and maintainers of BTNScan, an exquisite block explorer for Bitnet, and we are currently working on its successor, which will not only have an art-like UX/UI, but will carry the horsepower to face-off even the most popular and most used explorers on the market such as Etherscan and Blockscout. We also provide specialized infrastructure for Web 3 and Blockchain projects, such as Nodes, RPCs, and Managed Blockchain services on a SaaS basis. We are currently supporting Bitnet and are proud to be there, but we will also have the intent to expand further out and onto the ecosystem as Restratagem grows and a strong community forms around it.Got curious? Have a look on our roadmap for more information.Stratus ChainThe launch of the Stratus Chain will mark the end of the first cycle of our roadmap and the beginning of an entire new journey for Restratagem and the team. We want to make sure all I's are dotted and all T's are crossed before releasing it to the market, but we can guarantee that the User Experience is at the forefront of what we want to deliver. The network is not live yet, and there are several steps we will have to take so we can get to the point where it will be live, but it will all start with the launch of the Stratus Token.Among so many other chains, why this one you might ask?In a single sentence, we aim to bring performance and user experience to a level not seen before with any other EVM network, making Stratus Chain the go-to network for large scale and enterprise-level decentralized applications, and a friendly place for DeFi, NFT, and all-things-crypto. As you can judge by our other products and services, we do not content with being average, and our team of highly-skilled and full-stack developers certainly have what is needed to turn our ideas into functional high-quality end-user products.Stratus TokenThe Stratus Token is a transformative token designed to redefine the digital landscape. STRAT functions as a versatile payment method within our ecosystem, creating an efficient and seamless transaction experience. It also serves as a unique incentive, fostering user engagement and loyalty towards our products and services. Most ambitiously, STRAT is set to fuel our native blockchain network, aiming to rank amongst the top-performing and fastest blockchain networks in the industry. With Restratagem and STRAT, we are not just envisioning the future; we are actively building it.Bitnet stands out as the perfect candidate to host the Stratus Token due to a few key properties it has: 1) true decentralization; 2) active development; 3) a proof-of-work consensus mechanism; 4) fair launch with fair token distribution among the community. It will serve as a launchpad for us, and as we continue building and delivering on it we see in this network the exponential growth potential we do not see in none of its competitors.More information below:DOWNLOAD PRE-LAUNCH DECKLinksWebsite: restratagem.comDiscord: discord.gg/n2ERW6HhWeTelegram: t.me/restratagemGithub: github.com/restratagemEmail: team@restratagem.comLike what you're seeing?
