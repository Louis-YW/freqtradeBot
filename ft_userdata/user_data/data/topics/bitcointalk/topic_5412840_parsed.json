El Salvador President bet that Bitcoin will rise in near future and his country is in serious debt crisis. This is his mistake and collapse can occur if his country has to sell all Bitcoin to get cash for paying debt interest or other reasons.However I disagree to anyone accuse El Salvador. They just made a history for Bitcoin and the world and we should appreciate that. Especially if the argument or accusation is from people (I don't say it is you) who got profit with the bull run of Bitcoin that is partially contributed by El Salvador legal tender news. They should say thank you to the President and El Salvadorians.",

      "body": "It’s a work in progress, and although I don’t favour the term failure to summarize the year, it’s likely pretty shy from the expectancies that were deposited on the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender there.From the perspective of bitcoin it’s certainly been a success so far, enhancing bitcoin with a real life case use of adoption as legal tender. That alone gives food for thought to many other countries which had never even considered there being an option outside their status-quo. Whether that moves on for any more of them eventually, is yet to be seem, but it’s on some of their radars. It’s also put El Salvador on the radar, which should do them some good.The country itself has not (allegedly) sold any of the government held bitcoins, so they are not at a realized loss, but obviously the hopes were set in a completely different direction. Not having a realized loss does not mean that there aren’t at a loss in bookkeeping terms. Out of the top of my mind, I recall they created a Trust for the Chivo System with around 150M $, to provide liquidity to the overall system. Bukele’s Bitcoin purchases allegedly come from that Trust (though there is a lack of transparency as to where the funds for each purchase came from), so on the paper, the Trust does have a diminished current value in USD. The Chivo Pet Hospital (and some schools) were paid with alleged bookkeeping surpluses (yet no realized) due to BTC raise during the first months. A bit of one-way magic there.But I wouldn’t just stop considering government based BTC purchases. After all, they’ve likely got a way better position to hold and not realize the losses that the segment I’d be more concerned with, which is the general population. It’s not really that trivial to play along with the Hodl mantra for them, and lacking any real data, I can only guess that quite a few have sold at a loss, or at least refrained from saving in bitcoins due to its descending value trend. The reported abundant failures with the Chivo Wallet, the default bitcoin wallet the people there will use, constitutes additional unwanted hassle and reputation loss to the Chivo System.In addition, remittances through bitcoins are rated currently by the government at just under 2%, which is low for what was one of the key arguments in favour of its usage in the country. One year is not that much though, and the current conjuncture of multiple macro aspects has not helped at all in getting the local population’s mind-set more into bitcoin usage (and savings). I would have like to see a year of rolling on wheels, but instead we got one full of bolsters in the path.",

They completely failed when it came to marketing Bitcoin to their own people as well as to the world. They just hoped the hype would continue on its own and somehow Bitcoin would gain value and the people in El Salvador who held Bitcoin would be so grateful for their profits they would spread the adoption of Bitcoin even more. The president of El Salvador counted on that and did not take into account the fact that his people are mostly poor and would rather cash out without hodling so they could pay for stuff they really needed.But this Pr problem is very fixable.

El Salvador managed to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender and as a currency, it was a success not a failure. If you think that El Salvador is failing its bitcoin adoption, then I think that's the wrong decision to think about.El Salvador has provided a good choice for every citizen about financial freedom especially regarding the payment system. Almost every citizen has a bank in his own hands to spend his bitcoins at any time, it was the greatest success for El Salvador to get out of the centralized financial system. We don't judge a failure just because their investment is now lost due to a drop in the bitcoin price, it's something that has nothing to do with their successful adoption. If their investment loses today, it doesn't mean that adoption is also failing and vice versa, if their investment is successful in the future it doesn't mean all citizens will adopt bitcoin.
