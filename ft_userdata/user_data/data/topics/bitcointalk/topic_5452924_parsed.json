If you stop looking for the money and start looking at the actual changes it made to society and finance, you’ll understand so much faster why and how Bitcoin is the future.Opportunities are many. You get free banking with no contracts and restrictions in countries where unbanked are many. There’s nobody you have to ask for permission to send money to somebody else. You send it whenever to whoever you want. You can set up a Bitcoin payment system for your business and stop accepting the commissions banks take for transactions your customers make. Or you can just invest in Bitcoin and be part of the future. But again, the spectrum of opportunities is so much wider than you think.Understand Bitcoin and use all the opportunities you see around. By taking these opportunities, money will come to you naturally. By earning the % you used to lose through bank POS contracts, by inviting Bitcoin enthusiasts to your business, by purchasing amounts of Bitcoin that become twice as hard to mine every four years and much more.",

Another way again is integrating its payment method into your business, this will allow you to earn some income as the price increases but the risky of losing is also there. If you want to earn from blockchain then you need to be a developer or kind of software engineers, there companies that employ people with the coding skills and since the whole thing isn’t that rampant there is opportunities still much available in this space. You can also be a cryptocurrency or rather bitcoin miner and engage in the mining process. All of these things needs funding and knowledge, for someone who doesn’t have any basic knowledge you need to seek one first. The only way to earn cryptocurrency for free is through the internet faucets where you get paid in coins for performing some tasks, but this also doesn’t generate any significant income again",

Basically, the way to make money through crypto is definitely to make buying and selling transactions or what is called trading. But if you ask what ways you can make money through crypto, apart from trading. As far as I know, the way to make money is like mining bitcoin, or other crypto too, like litecoin and ethereum classic.Staking on crypto.But in essence, all of these methods all lead to trading. Whether it's long/short term investing, staking crypto and mining. Surely everything ends in the name of trading.Because in my personal opinion, if you are an expert and experienced in trading. I'm sure it will be a regular and reliable income.",

The idea of keeping your money safe and having the freedom to withdraw the full amount of it whenever you like is the most helpful thing we have had since the emergence of crypto because we know how the banks controlled us before this great revolution has come to us.",

An example is Bitcoin mining, this aspect used to be very simple with lesser competition than now and then you could even use your phone to mine, right now that aspect is very competitive and also you need heavy devices (software and hardware) that requires high amount of powers to function.There are still many other aspect you can look into but I advice you start simple, investment has been the most famous opportunity that crypto-currency has to offer and it's been profitable but there are risky also attached to it. You can learn web designing and you can help projects create website or build a trading app but one thing is certain you should find a skill you good in.",

This kind of trading is slow but it’s more safe in terms of risk especially for beginners who haven’t perfected a trading strategy. There are other opportunities in the crypto industry aside from trading, and participating in signature campaigns. You can become a crypto educator and start a online course that teaches people the fundamentals of cryptocurrency.

With that, SMM is also a good niche and skill that someone can work for a project and that's the opportunity that can also be seen in here.

That is what you need to increase in order to gain money in the industry. Well, let me try to explain what source of money I know from cryptocurrency.1. Airdrop and bountyYou probably don't need to spend much money (except for gas fees) to earn money through this method, but you do need time, skills, and patience. There are many tasks that you can do here, like content creation, social media promotion, translation, signature campaigns, and many others.2. StakingMany cryptocurrencies offer staking, where you can lock up your funds in a wallet or on a platform to support the network's operations and earn rewards in return. You can get stable coins, other coins or tokens, or even the platform's native tokens themselves when you stake.3. MiningIf you have the technical knowledge and resources, you can participate in cryptocurrency mining to earn rewards for validating transactions and securing the network. However, mining can be resource-intensive and may require specialised equipment.4. NFTsYou can make and trade unique digital assets like art, collectibles, or virtual land to potentially earn profits from their appreciation or through royalties. You probably need to join communities too, so you can have more success in NFTs.5. Become a developerI think this is the biggest challenge with the biggest profit if you succeed in mastering the skills of how to be a developer. There are many projects that need people to become their backend developers.I believe there are still many opportunities out there that haven't been mentioned here. It's just things that I know are common in the crypto world. I hope it can help.",

Trading is the most or fastest way in my opinion. Since you could barely take advantage of the volatility when doing trade daily. Passive income in crypto is quite a myth, but if you want a passive generation of it, then try staking which same with using your bank but with a higher interest. But for that you also have some risk of devalue your asset for holding unless you are ataking a stabelcoin which hold 4 to 10% income on different platform. But still low to have a profit passive income due to inflation.",

Have you tried getting a skill that's relatable to cryptocurency or blockchain in general. One of the best ways to benefit from the industry is to offer a service that you'll receive payment in Bitcoin or other tradable cryptocurency of your choice. With your skills or the service that you'll be offering, you can make both passive and active income. Let use the forum as an example, you can offer your service in the forum and get patronage both on and off the forum. If you're a designer, you can launch your ANN on the forum and start getting job offers. If you're good with community management, you can do the same and get patronized as well.If you want to go bigger then you can take a course on blockchain and acquire a skills that you'll get paid for. There are so many projects looking for skillful people to hire to bring the best marketing to their project. You can spend some months to learn this skills and start been paid for it until you want to stop working for others and maybe develop your own app or projects for the market. Don't just depend on trading, mining or investing. Think bigger by equipping yourself with the necessary skills needed to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves.",
