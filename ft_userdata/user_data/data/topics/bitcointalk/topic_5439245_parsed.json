So someone who doesn’t share what he/she thinks is knowledgeable may just be hoarding bags of foolishness.",

They share, if for any reason some in this forum is not sharing any information which will contribute to Bitcoins growth add to the knowledge of other Bitcoiners, then I will perceive the person as someone who is not truly a Bitcoin lover.",

For example, when the information is confidential and harmful if shared.However, in other situations, sharing knowledge and information is important for the advancement of individuals and society. Knowledge can help people understand new things, solve problems, and create innovations. Therefore, sharing knowledge and information can help advance individuals and society as a whole.And in the end, sharing or not sharing information and knowledge is a personal decision that must be made based on the situation and context at hand.",

So we developed the grading system, to check our levels of performance not just with ourselves but also with other members of our society. Its a thing that starts from the elementary schools and goes through life for some. Due to this, you get people trying to hide information and discoveries from others because, they want to look smarter than everyone else and be ahead.The question here is,Is that really it?Does your hidden ideas do put you ahead of the others in the society?Well, I won't blame those that hide there ideas. Besides, it's there ideas and they get to decide but,I do think sharing your ideas opens us up to even bettering what you already know. Share it and have another head advance the limits for you as much as you, helping society. That's what ought to be.",

Of the many people who are already in this forum, I see that the people here are not stingy in sharing ideas, knowledge and other important information that is often needed by many people here. So don't ever worry about it because those who have gained more knowledge don't just hoard it for themselves, but also always want to share it with more people here when there are questions they need answered.",

The forum is solely for the discussion of Bitcoin first then anything else can come in as secondary which include Altcoin. If OP had made an instance of where a subject was raised about Bitcoin and users who had knowledge about the subject failed to respond it would have been more easier to relate with but as far as i know Bitcoin related topics are hot cake on the forum and so many users are eager to dive into them when such threads are created.",

I wish to assume there isn't anyone here on this forum hoarding the knowledge to a vital information that could have add value to many users on this forum, because moreover, nobody is a vessel of all knowledge, which is why learning should be a collective responsibility of every member of this forum, because there is a popular saying that \"It is in teaching we get to learn more\", and as such it will be of no benefits hoarding the little knowledge of what you have, as you never can tell, you might end up learning something new.So in summary, the solution to changing the mindset people have behind hoarding on to the knowledge they have, is to let them understand that what they know today was thought them by someone else, and as such now is their duty to spread the knowledge all round.",

If it is an idea or a trade secret that you intend to benefit or profit from, It is advisable to keep them secret. If sharing a piece of knowledge will endanger your life or compromise your security or freedom, it is also good to keep it secret. But if this information or knowledge is not for profit and it will benefit the people, there is no need hoarding them because keeping it secret is a waste. In Africa, our forefathers ensured that only their offsprings or people from their cults had access to the knowledge of their profession. They also failed to document some important information about these skills because of lack of writing skills. This blunder led to the loss of many skills because the trade secrets were hoarded. That is why the African current artwork cannot be compared to their priceless old artifacts. The same thing also affected the herbal health system of Africa because we have lost some vital information caused by knowledge hoarding.",

It is from this that many come to the conclusion that someone knows something significant but carefully hides it.I can't say that about the OP, because by skimming through his posts, one can conclude that a person wants to achieve everything with his experience, which is welcome.

Many believe that if they could, then you, the OP, could fight and acquire your secrets, which you would later decide to share or not.",
