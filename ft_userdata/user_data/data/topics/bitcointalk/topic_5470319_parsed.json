OF started on similar merits and only after that grown into amateur porn / webcam site.That aside, if you look around, everything is over sexualised these days. And it is so for a reason - people get out of their houses less, less interactions with each other, more time spent at home in front of some sort of a screen.Yet while most people appreciate erotic elements of beauty, not everyone wants porn.Next, OF is now very much commercial, with same faces over and over again. New content creators are having very hard time to get out and be seen by people.So we will bring that freshness again for both, content creators & viewers alike.More & more people know about crypto and are looking for something after hearing all the crazy success stories. We will be aiming more at retail rather than hardcore crypto people in this case.And while our target market is retail, still for crypto guys, the utility behind the project will give enough green candles to keep them happy!",
