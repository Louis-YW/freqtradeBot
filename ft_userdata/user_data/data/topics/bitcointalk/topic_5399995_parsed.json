Basically this even already done by MXC to attract the volume and users from the major exchange sites that halt the trade in the past. That's why MXC was making future trade for luna with stable token pair available when binance was halting its future for luna in the past. I would not be surprised to see that small exchange sites are trying various ways to attract users to come in but this small even did nothing to the exchange siteIm actively using mxc.",

The intention of this is good and the idea is good as well, it’s just that LUNA developer is not listening to some good advices from other exchanges as well, they instead took risk with the fork.",

Yes, this information is correct, and I will put a source for you belowIt is a good initiative from the Mexc exchange to reward the Luna community who lost a lot of money they invested, as I am not a member of this platform, but frankly, I did not find any of the other large exchange platforms that held a contest like this to compensate for some of the losses of the luna investors. I really thank the Mexc exchange team a lot for that and what they did is a great marketing idea that will bring a lot of people to register and trade on their platform.SOURCE",

As far as i know if MXC was doing double recovery plan just like burning and it has already announced its recovery plan but it seems like this is only airdrop event from this exchange site. So, that's a bit confusing about what recovery plan? Some exchange sites already swap luna to the lunc and the new token will be coming next days. That's a small event by MXC. At least this exchange site was very loyal to the its users. The major exchange sites already announced if they will be supporting the new swap as well.",
