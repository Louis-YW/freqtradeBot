      "body": "I know the forum doesn't have a cyber security board, but there have been suggestions about it in the past, just this year.. Cybersecurity and Privacy\" board in \"Other\" cattegory  Even without any approved board for that already, there are still several places where information regarding security and how users can protect themselves from cyberattacks has been spread across the forum, which I believe most people have come across in one way or another. The need for the security thread could have made such information to be assembled in just one place, but that does not mean they will reach more people than they are reaching right now because you never can tell how many people are going to find the board useful and not only finding it useful but how many newbies will be able to locate it. Let's take the scam accusation board. For example, many scam warnings that are being posted there to warn users about that particular scam don't gain as much attention as they're supposed to when they are posted in beginner and help, which means the information did not reach the targeted audience as it was supposed to. I'm not against the cyber security board creations, but I don't think there might be much of a difference in the passing of information to newbies as it has already been done right now.",

So if admin will not wake up and make the cybersecurity board, forum member BTC and altcoin wallets, also hardware wallets are not safe.When I joined this forum, I learned more about how to avoid malware. If you are on this forum and reading through new topics often, you will see threads that are helpful about security and privacy. I do not think we need a board like cybersecurity before we should also learn more about how to avoid hackers.On the other thread that BenCodie created, it is more about implying that there are many discussions/threads about cybersecurity on this forum and that a board can be created for it, which is right in my opinion. But without such board, cybersecurity discussions are still seen on this forum.I am not implying that we do not need cybersecurity board, there are many threads that supposed to be on cybersecurity board, but for you to imply that without the board, that people's wallet will be hacked, that is wrong. Even if theymos created the board today, that does not mean some people will not be careless. We do not have cybersecurity board but we are still so much discussing about how to avoid hackers and how to have privacy.",

Then why are people on this bitcoin forum visiting this forum if they can not know about cybersecurity? The boards that I noticed many people do not like to involve themselves in discussion are technical boards. There are many cybersecurity threads on bitcoin discussion and beginners and help that most people on this forum have replies.",

So if admin will not wake up and make the cybersecurity board, forum member BTC and altcoin wallets, also hardware wallets are not safe.We already have a dedicated board for \"Development & Technical Discussion\" where discussions are opened for all wallet' aspects. Under that board there is already child board named \"Wallet software\" to discuss about wallets specifically. Moreover there are another 6 child boards dedicated for specific wallet clients: Electrum, Bitcoin Wallet for Android, BitcoinJ, Armory, Mycelium, Hardware wallets.This means that there is not necessarily an entire section dedicated to cyber protection, since these sections can be used to discuss everything related to wallets. I do not think there is a need to create a similar section, but this addition can be suggested in the new software of the forum.",

You are 100% right, but forum members can improve their cybersecurity knowledge from this new board. Even forum members with very limited experience in the field can learn from more educated member reply. Step by step the cybersecurity board will help a lot.",

Step by step the cybersecurity board will help a lot.I think the cybersecurity board will be a nice addition to the current number of the boards, and in that board many users who have knowledge about cybersecurity can share their knowledge with others and which may help many users to get protected from the hackers. I have voted yes in favor of the poll that was created for such board and I will always be happy to see such board on this forum. I'm not an expert in that field by any means but I believe that I can also help others by sharing the knowledge that I have about cybersecurity. There are many security experts on the forum who could also contribute valuable information at such boards.",

As a Global Moderator in a Spanish Hacking forum I can tell you that you are right that kind of sub-boards are filled with a lot of noobs, script kiddies and scammers.A sub-board focused on Cybersecurity can provide valuable educational content for community members. It can help users understand the risks associated with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and equip them with knowledge on how to protect their assets.By offering discussions on vulnerabilities and hacking techniques, the sub-board can raise awareness about potential threats. This can empower users to take proactive steps to secure their investments and personal information.",

People with hacking experience take information from completely unopened sources. Therefore, anyone who wants to hack someone is unlikely to receive valuable information here. The only thing he can calculate for himself is the level of literacy of a particular user in online security. And after that, in one way or another, provoke an inexperienced user to give him access to his work machine. But I also don’t see the point of creating such a topic since there has been an open topic from BenCodie for a long time, covering all the problems and disadvantages of the absence of such a topic on the forum.",

Therefore, I don't see why would that be a reason for not creating a dedicated sybersecurity board which I think would be a good thing by the way, given how ignorant an average person is on this subject and how many dangers lie ahead. @Joeyp please lock this thread and if you want to add someone regarding yhe topic, do it in already created thread that some members already shared.",
