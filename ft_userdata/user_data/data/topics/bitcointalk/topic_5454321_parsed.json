If we are bet on such a coach quite a lot of stakes will go for his continues remains in Chelsea,  but that did not become the reality as he was fired when he failed to deliver according to the club's demands.",

      "body": "That's really crazy thing to bet on the sports managers. The interesting thing we can't place bets based on how they've performed, because most of the managers were removed and replaced by new ones not because of the performance lack. Most happen out of the popular players making some scene and making the management to change the managers. This is what happening around and I'm sure sports betting platforms won't show much interested in adding these kind of bets.",

Do you think sports bookies will incorporate this type of betting?Though the idea seems really interesting, but I think it's not feasible enough to be ever considered as one of the prediction games that a casino could list on their platform for users to bet on..Imagine placing a bet on a manager to either get hired by a certain club, or to loss his job as a manager by being sacked from the club he or she manages, and for maybe after 3 months or more, no Manager was sacked or hired, while your money is locked up on a bet, what exactly would you do? Would you contact the casino to have  the bet canceled so as to get your money back, or would you just keep quiet and just watch your money tied up.?I think this and many more, is something you should have consider or think about before proposing such an idea.?",

As of now I don't think there's any (and I mean that as in me checking over the three bookies I mostly frequent in nowadays) so it's a big bummer but if something like this did come up you'd bet I will always place a bet on it lmao. In any case, it's purely situational too, it's not like every season a manager's getting fired for poor performance so it's a little hard to make out the details and the formalities if such a betting game will be made. I think for now this type of bet would have to stay exclusively among couch watch parties. There's no real guidelines for it just yet for when there are no managers to fire for that season, plus other stuff that will be harder to discern.",

      "body": "I believe that the reason bookmakers don't add this market is because over a season there are less than 10 coaches that are usually fired in a given league so I don't see a market for that, this season in the Bundesliga I didn't see many coaches being fired, I also didn't see many Ligue 1 coaches being fired, in La Liga I also didn't see many coaches being fired, I just saw the Sevilla coach being fired, in the case of Serie A I didn't see many coaches being fired either, and to conclude that it would be a less crowded market, but it would also be something really fun to bet onfor example this season we watched PSG with their coach and many times there were rumors that he would be fired, but the season ended and the guy was not fired on the contrary he reached the end of the season and became champion even with many difficulties and criticism, if someone had bet that he would be fired then that person would have lost bet, betting on the coach who will be fired will only be advantageous when it is a team in a situation of being in the relegation zone, in the case of tottenham and chelsea it was very unpredictable to guess that these coaches would be fired",

      "body": "Indeed, the management merry-go-round in the Premier League is as volatile as a cat on a hot tin roof. It's like a game of musical chairs, but with million-pound contracts! Your idea of betting on which manager gets the boot next is quite intriguing, albeit a tad unconventional.Given the unpredictable nature of football management, it could be an exciting avenue for bookies. However, it would also necessitate a detailed understanding of club dynamics, managerial performance, and a myriad of other factors. It's like trying to predict the weather in England – tricky business, I tell you!Nonetheless, I reckon there's a niche market for such bets, like those Twitter debates predicting the next manager to face the chop. Sports bookies could indeed capitalize on this, as long as they maintain ethical standards. After all, we wouldn't want this to devolve into a grim spectator sport, would we?",

One thing I'm not sure at is if there is a partnership between the league and gambling sites and if there is some sort of agreement to the betting categories allowed for a site to place, 'coz if there is then feasibility would be affected. I had the same idea such that if it is possible to have a bet category on players who won't be able to play on the next game or season; it would be hard to determine which makes sense if odds would be huge. But who knows, maybe some platforms would br able to accommodate such ideas which are unusual for sport bookies right? Other than the usual bets. Quite of a bet builder.",

But with good odds for Betting, it will attract people definetly if they decide to try. Gamblers bet on even more crazier things, this cannot be the craziest.

I'm not sure there are enough data points to cover the sort of erratic dismissals that come up which would make them interested in offering this sort of market. Then again, they offer all sorts of bets on things like politics and even Eurovision, so it does seem sensible. I'd be surprised if nobody is offering this sort of bet, but maybe you can find it on a peer to peer betting platform instead. It would definitely be interesting to see a sort of top ten listing of who is perceived to be the most at risk of firing at any one time.",
