  "content": "Because the cryptocurrency market is constantly changing, it is your obligation to guard your digital assets by implementing necessary measures to protect your wallet from hacks. Learn about the most recent attack methods, safety precautions, and protective informations.The primary source of risk to your bitcoin is your bitcoin wallets. In addition to storing your bitcoin a bitcoin wallet includes a private key that gives you access to your wallet anytime. Anyone who obtains your private key, which serves as your digital identity, has the ability to illegally take your bitcoins.Cybercriminals utilize advanced methods to crack into BitCoin wallets to steal funds covertly outside the owner's awareness. Whenever it is about safeguarding your BitCoin against attack, wallet security is essential. BitCoin can be kept safe from cyberattacks in numerous ways, Here are some of the ways to safeguard your Bitcoin:1. Keep Private Keys Offline2. Don’t save your recovery seed digitally. 3. Use Dedicated Hardware4. Make Use of Hardware Wallet5. Avoid storing your BitCoin in exchanges1. Keep Private Keys Offline:  The passcode utilized in protecting your BitCoin wallet from unauthorized accessibility is the private key. Anyone who can be able to know your private key will have accessibility to your bitcoin and will be able to carry out unauthorized transactions from the wallet. Never let anyone have means to access your account especially when you don't want them to access it. Your private key must be securely stored offline in a place known to you alone. Because anything within the internet can be tracked and you wouldn't want your keys to end up in the wrong hands, so it's better to keep the private key offline, away from internet connections. The most safe, dependable, and secure way to keep your private keys is using a hardware wallet. You can also write your private key on a piece of paper, make duplicates of it, and store them in different places in case of emergencies like floods, earthquakes, or a fire outbreak. 2. Don’t save your recovery seed digitally: Keep your 12-word secret recovery phrase off any digital storage. Everything that is online as you may well know is  vulnerable to hackers. Hackers can access digital data and files but they can't access documents that are printed on paper. The 12-word secret recovery phrase is the master key created by your wallet so If your computer crashes or another incident prevents you from accessing your wallet on any device it is installed on, these words help you get your money back. Your secret recovery phrase must be kept secure like all of your other possessions and should not be stored electronically or digitally because anyone who discovers your secret word can steal from your wallet. Writing the recovery seed down on paper is a good way to keep it secure but because paper is fragile and can easily be damaged, it is best to stamp the recovery seed into metal, walls, or possibly the back of your wardrobe to protect it from water and fire damage. To avoid loss due to disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and fires, it is always a good idea to have multiple copies of your secret phrase stored in different locations.3. Use Dedicated Hardware: A reasonable precaution to reduce vulnerability to hacks is to dedicate a hardware or USB key for moving data or money from an online computer to an offline one. This can also be accomplished by purchasing a separate laptop, unplugging the networking cards, and installing the wallet software on this laptop, which must never be connected to the internet.4. Make Use of Hardware Wallet: The most secure way to store your Bitcoin is in a hardware wallet. It provides a considerably higher and thorough level of protection. A hardware wallet is a physical device that is not connected to a network that enables you to store your bitcoin offline. It uses an encrypted USB key that has an onboard computer running in its own unique operating system. There are various kinds of hardware wallets which are explained in the link below. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4578719.05. Avoid storing your Bitcoin in exchanges: It is not recommended to store your bitcoin on exchanges because you do not have complete control over your wallet and funds. Although many exchanges provide the impression of being safe and secure but not all of them actually are, instead they are prime targets for cyberattacks, and if those attacks are successful, cybercriminals will have access to large sums of money. It's also possible for exchange owners to defraud customers and flee with their assets, as I recently saw in the movie (TRUST NO ONE: THE HUNT FOR THE CRYPTO KING) which follows cryptocurrency investors who investigate the death of their exchange's founder and suspect that he faked his own demise in order to defraud all of the company's customers of all of their assets. Later, I discovered that it was based on a true story and if it has happened before, it could happen again. Exchanges are unpredictable and you do not want to lose your belongings so its better not to keep your crypto assets there.",

      "body": "I think number 2 and 5 are the most common mistakes people make when using bitcoin. How to secure one’s private key can be a dilemma. The simple method of writing the 12 phrase on a piece of paper doesn’t sit well with some people especially those who are drawn to the digital way of life. To them the safest place is the cloud, they store most of their important document there so why not this one? I have also read about engraving your keys in metal plates. To be honest, I prefer to go for the simple and less sophisticated method.",

Nobody wants to read that, and you will not get merit for it. Moreover, the length of your post and the quality of your English are only minor factors. In trying to write a quality post worthy of merit, you should offer new ideas, personal experiences, or perspectives that other forum users will actually find new and interesting.",

Trezor supports less coins than Ledger, but we are still talking about almost 2000 different coins and tokens. There are differences between Trezor One and Trezor T when it comes to crypto support. Ledger supports even more and there are no differences between the 3 currently available models (except the missing support for some assets in the new Nano S Plus). I would argue that if the coin you are holding has been around for a while but it's still not supported by either/both Trezor and Ledger, it's not an asset worth holding at all.",

As long as your seed/private key is safe, no one can attack your crypto assets. Hardware wallets will increase your security somewhat, but not make you absolutely safe, if you don't know how to store your private keys, so will any wallet.Storing assets on exchanges is not really a good idea, but since one is trading on them on a daily basis, storing assets on exchanges is inevitable, the best way is that you should only leave a part of your assets just enough for work, the rest should be in your personal wallet.",
