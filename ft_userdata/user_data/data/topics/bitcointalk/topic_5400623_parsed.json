Specifically, about practicality, although as far as I'm aware those coins mentioned are using EVM, some coins may offer better options than the others depending on the use case. But still, \"real usage\" is too wide to be specifically answered. Also, the target market you choose plays an essential part in order to decide which cryptocurrencies that suit your needs.",

In this case i think that only those blockchains with good scalability that can be used in our real life. People will be using coin to buy something and used it in their life. Remember that crypto was about the economic. This means the value of crypto is really helping for people to use it for some purposes.",

      "body": "Avalanche is funded by university donations and is really picking pace in the field. They do have amazing competition against ETH chain and I think runs over other chains too. Founded by professor it has favourable fees, faster transactions and yet being developed to go ahead of ETH. The donations or investments are nicely pulling towards it so that must be good enough to understand this chain could be helpful. Whether itâ€™s your real life usage or on chain usage the fact remains same in terms of its fees and faster transactions.",

      "body": "@mirek92, In my personal opinion, the blockchain network that is suitable for use in real life is a blockchain that has a high transaction speed (we know it as TPS), although the blockchain network is not completely decentralized, but as long as the transaction execution is fast, it is very suitable for use in real life. Just imagine if you use the Ethereum network? It will take a very long time to execute the transaction.\"Real life need scalability and speed, not decentralization.\"",

Etherium fee is high but still top Blockchain along with many top projects using this. Bnb is also safest Blockchain with low fee. All other Blockchain has not proved yet the real Usecase",

For these examples people would probably require fast transactions and negligible amount of fees. Is there anything else important for that?Sure things, most people won't spend extensive fees when they pay in-store especially if they are doing small transactions. Or waiting for the transaction gets confirmed or settled when they are done with it.Quote from: mirek92 on May 30, 2022, 03:08:45 PMIs there anything else important for that?Of course, it depends on the factor of the ecosystem adoption within the place. Surely you shouldn't use a cryptocurrency that lacks a userbase. We can argue that using ETH and BNB sounds like a probable option since both coins have better adoption compared to others, but if we include tx fees, Polygon or Ava also sounds nice.",

Blockchain is only beneficial for sending money. I see no actual use for the blockchain in our real life. The main thing is if the scalability is the most important thing in this case. Blockchain needs to have fast transaction to make it happen",
