  "content": "It is good to store your saving of bitcoin in an offline wallet for security from scammers and malware,while your daily spending bitcoin can be stored on a software (hotline) wallet for easy spending. There are two wallet needed for this transaction to be successful.1) Cold Storage _(offline)Wallet : This is a wallet that is never connected to the internet,in this wallet your bitcoin is kept offline. Example of cold storage wallet is ledger Nano X.2) Software (hotline) Wallet : This is a wallet that is connected to the internet (online), example is Electrum.How to generate your private and public key pairs of a cold storage wallet.1) Download the software (ledger Nano X),save the webpage that generates the keys,disconnect your internet. After this open and save the webpage on your desktop,in other for you to generate the keys. Your offline Bitcoin address will have both the private key and public key,after generating the public and private keys,these key pairs should not be exposed to the internet for security.2) Make an offline copy,by printing out the public key and private key in both alphanumeric form and QR form on a paper. Before printing ensure that your computer and printer is not connected to the internet. The paper wallet should be stored in a fire proof safe or you can also have as many duplicates to keep in different places for security.Note : The public key is your Bitcoin wallet address,this is used to send bitcoin to your wallet           The private key is the password to your bitcoin wallet,this is used to sign transactions if you spend the bitcoin in your wallet.                 Funding your offline walletIf you want to send bitcoin to your offline wallet,the paper wallet you printed out has a public address which is shown in both alphanumeric form and QR form,send the bitcoin to the address of your paper wallet.https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/setting-up-your-own-cold-storage-bitcoin-wallet/     To create transaction offline and broadcast them on your         software walletIf you want to make transaction from your offline wallet,you should import the private key of your paper wallet, to your software wallet by scanning your private key QR code into the text box provided for private keys on your software wallet that is connected to the internet,or you copy and paste your private keys in the box.  As long as your software wallet supports importing of private keys,all you need to do is to tap the import button to continue the procedure. If this is done successfully,then any bitcoin in your paper wallet can be spent by sending the bitcoin through your software wallet to the recipient bitcoin address.https://99bitcoins.com/know-more-send-from-paper-wallet/     In case the bitcoin which was sent to the software wallet is more than the bitcoin you are sending,you can send your leftovers bitcoin back to your paper wallet and delete the imported key from your software wallet. You can also generate a new paper wallet if you want to, in order to send  your leftover bitcoin to the  new paper wallet.   If you want to destroy your paper wallet,make sure you back it up manually to avoid losing all your bitcoin.    For verification of your transaction,you can verify from blockchain.info or blockr.io by copying and pasting your public key in the search field,this shows your blockchain.I will like your contribution on this thread,if there is a safer way to make transaction offline and broadcast them on your online wallet without a third party having access to your private key.",

You should generate your wallet on an air-gapped device. This means that you should use a device which has been always offline and will never get online.  Quote from: Frankolala on August 07, 2022, 09:38:10 PMThe public key is your Bitcoin wallet address,this is used to send bitcoin to your walletYour public key is different from your bitcoin address. Your bitcoin address is actually a hash of your public key.

You should create the unsigned transaction on the online device and sign it on the offline device.",

Quote2) Software (hotline) Wallet : This is a wallet that is connected to the internet (online), example is Electrum.Software wallet is software wallet. It is not hot or cold, what makes it hot/cold wallet is the way you use it. For example you can use Electrum as a cold storage if you run it on an air-gap system.Quote    For verification of your transaction,you can verify from blockchain.info or blockr.io by copying and pasting your public key in the search field,this shows your blockchain.blockr.io is no longer available.

You just connect your hardware device to your computer and sign the transaction created online with the device and broadcast it in place. You don't need offline device, you don't need to import keys, ...",

If they were created on a secure air-gapped computer, you'd better keep them offline even if you no longer need them. Ideally, all that concerns wallet information generation, financial relations, and usage of bitcoin as a medium of exchange, except maybe a transaction broadcasting, should be performed without a user being connected to the Internet. Ownership of bitcoin establishes through the original owner's knowledge of the randomly-generated keys that no one else is able to generate by chance. If you perform such important manipulation online, you can't be sure that you're the only person who can claim ownership or that your keys weren't exposed to the world because of vulnerabilities in communication channels.QuoteAs long as your software wallet supports importing of private keys,all you need to do is to tap the import button to continue the procedure. If this is done successfully,then any bitcoin in your paper wallet can be spent by sending the bitcoin through your software wallet to the recipient bitcoin address.This function is usually called \"Sweep private key\", but it's not the right tool for the job that involves a secure transfer of funds. Your software wallet needs to support importing unsigned transactions and signed transactions in order to correctly communicate with an air-gapped device that holds your sensitive data. With the software wallet, you can create unsigned transactions and broadcast the signed ones, but you never feed it a private key if your goal is to keep your sensitive information offline.",

Even when connected to Electrum, the Private key is not accessible.",
