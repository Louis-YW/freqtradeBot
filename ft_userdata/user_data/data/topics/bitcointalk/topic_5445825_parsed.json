We must speak against bad leaders instead of generalising it. It will discourage people about Government. We have good and respected leadersEverything that is good in truth builds people up in freedom and sufficiency for life. Everything that is evil tries to break the good down. Pure evil is 'destruction'... intendedly, the destruction of everything. Good is at the base of everything because there wouldn't be anything without 'good'.What does evil use to destroy things? It uses things that are good, things that were made to be used for goodness... and in so using, evil destroys not only the good, but the evil, as well. In other words, it will take the destruction of everything to destroy all the evil, even though the good will be destroyed at the same time.Some leaders are good by intent; some are evil by intent. That's why we need wise, good leaders... so that they know how to improve the good, and weaken the evil, especially in themselves.Trump and Biden are examples. Trump had/has evil in himself. If he didn't, there wouldn't be all those people who found some evil in him. But his intent seems to be to build up good. We can see it in the many ways he made America better and stronger.Biden has evil within himself. We can see it in how he is using American money to provoke WW3 by supplying Ukraine. We can see his destructive effects on America - inflation - and in the way he is supporting general morality breakdown in individual Americans. It would be nice if these evil things were not intentionally done. But it's difficult to see how Biden's intent is not evil.Same said every ruler, and, in fact, every man or woman.",

They are the government at the top and their decisions are final and can't be tempered with..That's my say though  The thing that shows that I am right is the banking system.- The banking system loans money to the people. This looks good, because this helps people to grow.- But, according to literally written law in the Uniform Commercial Code and elsewhere, the loans were prepaid before they were even given... paid by the loan paperwork, the promissory note. So, when people are forced to pay the loans again over the years, there is great criminal activity done against the people by the banks... stealing their money through deception.- What does government have to do with this? They won't change the banking system so that this doesn't happen to the people, even though they know that it is true. And if they don't know it is true, they intentionally ignore it, even though money is the foundation of almost every activity in a nation, and the world.- Why don't the 'good' people in government get the banking laws changed? Because government would lose too much power over the people.- Meanwhile, government continues to borrow more money into existence to use in wars (Ukraine, etc.). And it adversely affects the people through inflation... which is stealing. So, the people get hit twice: A) Paying the loans back two times (or more when you consider interest); B) Inflation.- And most of the people haven't even heard of this, and don't believe it when they are made to understand.So, I am WAY right, and the video in the OP is a BIG example of how it happens... even around the world with many governments.",

It is important to stay informed about the latest developments in the industry and to make informed decisions based on your own research and analysis",

What they like is just to sit there and have their paycheck secured because the government has huge funding for them.They even think that they're all powerful because they're in the place that people have elected them for. Think of it that I'm living in a democratic country but it seems that democracy is just for the people with money.And when problems should be addressed in their areas, they only act on it if they're talked to and only a few does the initiative for building a better place for their constituents.

Not possible for all 100% will be against the citizens. The reason for this statement is that the majority carry the vote, it is very difficult for 25% of good people to over come 75%.Almost 100% of government employees do what they are told by their government bosses. If they don't, they could be out of a job for insubordination. So, yes. Nearly 100% of government is against the citizenry.This is why when you go after a government person who is harming you, sue his top boss. Of course, ask the top person by letter to fix things first. Then sue him man/woman to man/woman. And remember, if you don't want to sue directly for the damages, invoice for damages. Then sue that they won't pay the invoice.The majority may carry the vote, but it doesn't really matter. It's all based on harm done. No matter who is in office, let them do what they want. They don't have authority over you. You are protected from them by the Amendments, especially the Bill of Rights. Invoice them for damages. If you are not in the USA, fix your Constitution so you have strength.The only legitimate reason for government is to care for the people. If government officials harm people, they are acting outside their government position. Sue them like you might sue your neighbor for breaking a window in your house. And invoice them for damages. They are simply people.",

We live in an evil world if they just focus on the delicious items that come into the office. For the sake of survival, the population continue to mix and idolize these leaders, who maintained them in abject poverty so that they would be easier to govern. But if citizens rise up and cast a large number of votes against them, things will rapidly change. We shouldn't anticipate change until then.",

Government has a plan to fleece the sheep. It's probably a better plan in general than the plan the \"godfathers, cabals and middle political elites\" have. So, why wouldn't government protect the people from these jokers? Government wants it all. Besides, farming the \"godfathers, cabals and middle political elites\" the right way, will get government some value off them, as well. They are simply more sheep to fleece.Quote from: 348Judah on April 06, 2023, 09:21:02 AMQuote from: BADecker on March 21, 2023, 05:24:34 PM2.

The US government was a test to see if it would work. Not all the of the founding fathers wanted to give the people freedom. Many of them wanted to organize a fleecing campaign as the new government. But here was the problem with that idea.The people had fled King George of England, and they were not ready to set up a new program to fleece them like King George was doing. They wanted freedom. But the 'fleecers' needed the people to help them fight King George just as much as the people wanted to be free from the King. How to do it?Give the people freedom. Use them to fight King George. Take their freedom away later. The founding fathers did such a good job of this, that it took 200 years for them to take back the power as much as King George had. There are about two basic things that keep the people in a fleecing program:1. The ignorance of the people. For example. There is a lawful way out of IRS taxes. I know because I have used it. But, it takes a bit of thinking to get yourself into the proper mindset and understanding to use it without getting hurt. Start here, \"Office of the Person\" https://redress4dummies.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/office-of-person1.pdf. Peruse these two websites: https://www.youtube.com/c/CraigLynch/videos and https://awarriorcalls.com/home/. Once a man/woman has learned this stuff, he/she will be able to opt out of taxes and a whole lot of other things.2. All law is contractual law. If a man/woman doesn't contract in, they aren't in. However, the 'fleecers; won't automatically recognize that a man/woman isn't under some contract with them. They must be told, and told the right way. By contract and agreement, people are under the 'fleecers' whether or not they like it.",
