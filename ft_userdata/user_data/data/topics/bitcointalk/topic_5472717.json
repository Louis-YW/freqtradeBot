Because I believe in the hype that  this forum is filled with knowledgeable people about cryptocurrency.DCA Indeed the best method to accumulate BTC over the period. And buying at dips can also be practiced while doing DCA you don't have to do one thing at a time. Before suggesting anything, you should know the difference between trading holding and the methods that suit best to achieve your aims or goals.If you are planning to hold btc for a longer period then DCA is good for you but other than DCA you can do a lump sum(buying all at once). In most cases, Lump Sum can make you a better profit than doing DCA. The choice between them also depends on your goals and capital.If you have a huge capital present at the moment, then you can do a lump sum and can take entries by doing a little but fragmentation (taking entries in parts) but in the long term (5+ years) these small entry parts don't make that much difference.Long story short, if you have a lot of money now you can go for a lump sum and if don't then you might want to go for DCA. But first, ask yourself what are your goals and yeah doing your own research is also necessary.  The best time to buy is when you think that now is the good point (for long term) for short term you have to do TA and FA.",

It is expected that cryptocurrencies like the bitcoin and some other coin still has the possibility to increase in the future so the bitcoin being a volatile asset can be invested on for better trading.",

In addition to knowing how much you know about investing, we also need to know whether you have enough money to invest. If a person does not know enough about investment and if he does not have the financial support to invest then it is better to refrain from investing because you should invest the amount of money you can lose and should not invest more than that. Investing a certain amount of money will have a direct impact on your lifestyle. If you have good idea about investment and if you have good financial support then you can start your investment now. If you start investing now you will surely get good from this investment in future because the market is quite positive now and the market will go better in future.",

However, If you can buy the most dip, that will be good for you. But we never if we are ever going to touch the 15K range or the 20K range. We are expecting a bull run after the halving event. At least most of us expect Bitcoin will be over 100K next year. We don't know if Bitcoin will ever go down to the lower level like the 15K range. So it's better to start accumulating every week so you don't have to wait for the dip. If you see the downtrend, you will be able to buy then. For now, DCA is best.",

Purchasing Bitcoin at any price point will surely give you return in the future if you will just hold since Bitcoin grows in parabolic pattern since the beginning.

But first, ask yourself what are your goals and yeah doing your own research is also necessary.  The best time to buy is when you think that now is the good point (for long term) for short term you have to do TA and FA. OP  seems to be new here, even though he had a lot of capital amount the Lumps-Sums cant be a better option for him because it requires some experience & good analysis skills to enter. TBH I won't recommend going for the DCA to any of the members if he's experienced.I know both come with some pros & cons, but DCA can be a good solution, the best all-rounder you can say for newbies & for the experienced ones they can modify DCA accordingly because it fixes the risk management & fud or FOMO-related physiologically strong issues. You can say it is a top-grade technique for effective risk management and profit/investment goals.Also, TA & FA are recommended for the short term they come in handy or assist whatever you get better when it comes to long-term or cyclical investments or you can consider a generation-to-generation accumulation as well. In short terms, the game revolves around the pattern of price action which revolves around the sentiments and sentiments around the latest market developments according to the zone. Hehe Long story short the short-term market momentum is always based on the developments.",

Because now is the last year before Bitcoin enters its halving cycle which usually occurs within 4 years. Then after the bitcoin halving arrives, usually after that there is always a bullish market that comes and at that time usually the price of bitcoin will soar high and can even reach a price that bitcoin has never experienced before (ATH). So in my personal opinion, if you are interested in the potential of Bitcoin and want to invest in it, now is a good time to buy it. However, I suggest you study bitcoin science first in more depth. So that when you start investing in Bitcoin you don't encounter any errors or problems. Because even though it is true, Bitcoin is an asset that has enormous potential to continue to experience price increases. However, if for example when you start investing in Bitcoin and your knowledge is still lacking, I personally think the possibility will be very dangerous for your Bitcoin investment. Therefore, first learn all the knowledge related to the field of bitcoin investment.Quote from: Barikui1 on November 03, 2023, 02:14:02 PM~SnipAs a newbie I feel the DCA method is the best base on my own perspective of looking at it on the long term,~SnipThe DCA method is indeed a very good technique and as far as I know is widely used by bitcoin investors. Because as far as I know, the DCA system is like saving or collecting cold money regularly to invest in bitcoin. So DCA is a very simple technique, therefore I also highly recommend this technique. Because I personally also use the DCA technique to continue increasing assets in Bitcoin. But don't forget to use cold money/capital to invest in bitcoin. Because if you invest in bitcoin and don't use cold money/capital, in the future this could mess up your bitcoin investment.",

Quote from: Barikui1 on November 03, 2023, 02:14:02 PMSo my question is when is the best time to buy Bitcoin?It all depends on whether you intend to hold for a short time or a long time. Everyone wants to invest at a low price so they may benefit. There are a few things to think about when investing in bitcoin for a short time. First, a thorough market analysis must be done, which can be costly and risky. However, for beginners and those who plan to hold their bitcoin for a long time, I also think the DCA strategy is the best because it eliminates the need to constantly monitor the market price or make precise timing decisions. Bad timing is avoided with the DCA method.",

Another better strategy than buy is to allow people pay you in bitcoin. This way you avoid the stress and hassle associated with buying from exchanges. If you have a good skill you can request to be paid in bitcoin assuming your client is okay with it.Another way of getting bitcoin is through trading. But this is for professionals. Just stick with the two methods above and you will be just fine. For the DCA, you could do it manually or set it up so that at a specific period you are reminded to do it.",

You have chosen the best platform to learn and get information. Best time to buy Bitcoin is bear season If you know about Bitcoin bull season and bear season then you can buy Bitcoin at right time. During the bear season, you have the chance to get more Bitcoin at a lower price, and when people are afraid to buy Bitcoin, that is the best time to buy Bitcoin.DCA is also a good method, because no one ever knows the absolute bottom, So the more Bitcoin falls, he keeps buying Bitcoin keeping a reasonable gap in price. However, I think the best time to buy is when the price of Bitcoin has dropped at least 60% from its all-time high, then is the best time to buy. If you want to buy with half of your capital, this can be a good decision. So that if the price falls further, you have capital and can buy further down.",

I just noticed that you're familiar with the DCA method, indicating that you've been involved with bitcoin for some time. The DCA approach is used by those who can't acquire a lot of bitcoin at once; it helps them balance their portfolio by buying at low and high prices. It is an excellent approach for individuals who do not have the funds to invest in bitcoin all at once.

Because I believe in the hype that  this forum is filled with knowledgeable people about cryptocurrency.There is no other option other than doing DCA if you want to hold your BTC for the long term, but you can do a lump sum too if you have funds in your hand right now. But most people go for DCA because they don't have enough money to do lump sums, so they use some of their monthly earnings or salary to invest in BTC on a weekly or monthly basis. But keep in mind that even if you are doing DCA or lump sums, you have to save some funds for emergencies.You can use those funds either to buy more when the market comes down or if you have some kind of emergency and need funds for that.I have learned this thing from my past experiences, and I highly suggest you save funds for emergencies and not invest all of your funds, even in DCA or lump sum. Because, let's say you have the capability to buy 1 BTC now for $35,000 and you buy one now by doing Lump Sum, and once the market goes up, like near-old ATH, your money will be doubled, which might not be doubled if you do DCA.",
