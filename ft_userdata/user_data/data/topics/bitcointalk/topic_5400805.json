  "content": "I personally am a very busy person in my daily life. Because my job has demands or time limits to be completed (dead line). But a friend introduced me to Cryptocurrency or rather bitcoin. At first I felt there was no time to study it. But lately I'm even more interested in Cryptocurrencies. And began to study it on the sidelines of the break and on vacation.Although many unfamiliar terms that I found. But finding foreign terms is also something I usually find in my profession. Because every day I am dealing with words, more precisely writing.So reading has become my habit.That's what I do now on my day off which is to study crypto. So, how about your holiday? What do you do on holidays?",

On my holidays I like to do stuff other than cryptocurrency because it takes up so much of my time normally I will take your advice about concentrating more on bitcoin. because I'm not really focused on bitcoin.you mean the opposite of me huh? because it looks like you spend more time in crypto. and when you are on vacation, you will definitely break away from crypto for a while. I'm interested in being like you. because I'm getting bored with my job now. but I have to think long because it turns out that the crypto world is much more risky and challenging.",

I was recently on vacation and this was the first one since the pandemic. I went to Greece and stayed at an Airbnb. It was a ton of fun and wasn’t that expensive at all. I checked out a lot of the smaller islands, went sailing, fished a bit and even checked out a few museums. On other trips, I usually like to do something physical like tennis or hiking. I think a good mix between relaxing by the beach, cultural activities and physical activity are my favorite holidays.",

Not long ago I started to study Relative Strength Index (RSI). The Relative Strength Index is another widely used indicator used by traders to evaluate market conditions and decide when the price movement becomes too extreme. There is a lot of information in the public domain that you can use, I visit this site very often to learn something new about cryptocurrency. Coincidentally, I am also in the process of studying the indicators commonly used in trading such as the RSI and so on. I am also interested in the crypto world and want to explore it more deeply.",

It is not necessary to be an expert in blockchain, because you can contact 4ire. It's a company that provides blockchain development services. These technologies are easily integrated into various platforms and sites, so there will be no difficulties with it.",

Everyone has their own way of spending and enjoying their free time. Because sometimes we experience a saturation point, namely boredom. and at times like that we sometimes need a vacation. But recently I became interested in cryptocurrencies so spending my free time learning about cryptocurrencies became a cure for my boredom.",
