They teach the technology rather than the value of the assets being learned, so we have to separate the two so as not to mix the two up without understanding what their purpose is.Some other universities also study it based on source in OP:QuoteOther universities now offering cryptocurrency courses include Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Oxford University, National University of Singapore, Cornell University, and University of California Berkeley.",

This one does appear to actually be an entire module on programming Bitcoin though (building library from scratch) so I see it as a breath of fresh air -- not that I don't think any of the other Bitcoin education focusing on financial aspects are bad.

Dedicating your time to ensuring that a school of young minds also get the opportunity to learn a thing or two about the Bitcoin protocol is something to be commended. I feel that with such doggedness, and if all goes well, it could help set the kids on a path to financial independence and boost their literacy. And it seems that Bitcoin has experienced a slow rate of acceptance in some parts of the world due to a lack of quality crypto literacy.",

It will hardly come in someones mind that better not to teach a surgeon and someone can become one by self educating. Bitcoin based economy will be different than fiat based so understanding that difference is one of important things for future economists why they should learn about bitcoin in universities. Possible problems with new computing should be solved in bitcoin core in advance so some future programmers should learn about bitcoin to be ready to solve the problems we can't even name nowadays. And there are much more things for which education of bitcoin in universities is a really good idea.",

Very bullish news for bitcoin. Not bullish in the short term, but slow adoption through education would be great for the future.- Jay -From the article, you are right, but they are two parties, and the both will affect the cryptocurrency market in future. One is the bitcoin development class and the other the bitcoin regulation class. QuoteAdjunct Professor Thomas Hook of the University of Boston Law School recently told Cointelegraph that the law school is now offering a “crypto regulation” course for studentsThese law students will be built to understand why and how to regulate the bitcoin market, which may not be a good suggestion for the cryptocurrency developer's class. As they'll be a coalition of the law students in future to try regulating the bitcoin market and they may achieve that, as they started early to study it alongside the crypto development students who may be sharing some information to them, how such things can be made possible.  However, it's a welcomed development and new ideas can be harvested from the students reactions in class.",

Glad to hear that, as people nowadays dont understand the idea of cryptocurrency, but all they see are dollar signs in eyes like Scrooge McDuck has. Also glad that bitcoin will be taught to college students, but not to schools kids that care only about video games and fun. Time and effort wont be wasted.",

It is really lack of literacy knowledge that is affecting the adoption of bitcoin and if citizens have this knowledge, then bitcoin will rule the world and US is making a fast move to make sure that it's citizens key into it.Unlike some countries that are adamant to changes and want to continue in their old fashion life style by criticism on bitcoin and put a ban on bitcoin in their country. As long as US is OK with bitcoin adoption, then I will say the world is OK with bitcoin too. My reason is that at the long run US will achieve great from bitcoin before this ignoramus will now realize their mistake of not adopting bitcoin earlier.",
