  "content": "What's going on Cryptocurrency Universe! I hope everybody's is doing good! In my crypto dungeon, I have planned out and I'm going to attempt to build the world's largest orange pi cluster supercomputer with 125 orange pi, that I'm aware of. This thing will have more than 1,000 CPU cores, 500 gigabytes of RAM and draw less than 1000 Watts amazingly at full blast. In theory it's not built yet we'll see what it does when it's actually done. For those of you who would like to build your own you can use any SPC like the Raspberry Pi, Rock Pi, Banana Pi, or the Orange Pi like I did, it's just a lot more powerful with eight cores then the Raspberry Pi 5.Let's build 125 Pi Cluster Supercomputerhttps://youtu.be/UQzPH9smOhQ?si=fHUg7T_Y2It_MC1RThis is definitely an exciting build and I hope you guys enjoy it as well!Let's build Pi Cluster Supercomputer with 125 Orange Pi | Part 2https://youtu.be/UDBS5NSIjFQ?si=Y7BXR3kTDPSZxCqt",

      "body": "Congrats on your design and good luck bringing it to fruition. I’ve always wanted to build a cool computer cluster of some kind but I’ve never really been sure what to do with it. Mining was something… Nowadays I guess the obvious would be using it for AI but the only ready built apps I’ve seen to be run off your own cluster are to generate images.",

      "body": "This is an interesting project. It's somethning I've thought about, whether a cluster of small efficient CPUs was viable as a mining platform.Your project convinced me to get serious about ARM support for cpuminer-opt.  I bought a RPI4b for development but I thing I'll upgradeto OPi, I like oranges more anyway.I'm nearing release of the first version of cpuminer-opt to support ARM CPUs, you may be interested. There's a lot of info about it on the githubwiki and the cpuminer-opt BCT thread, follow the links in my sig.In short it will initially support AES, SHA2 & NEON (equivalent of SSE2-SSE.4.2) on ARMv8. Longer term it willl include SHA3 and SVE. Keep up the good work.",
