You need to rebroadcast the tx with higher fees. Once you click the cancel button then it will tell you what to do. You don't need any technical knowledge for that.By the way, when a transaction with lower fees stay around 7 days then the pool automatically drops it. So this is a way to get your transaction disappears.",

To OP:Your tranaction hasn't been flagged as RBF and there is no way to bump the fee or cancel it (cancel=replace the transaction with a new one sending the fund to your own address.)You can submit your transaction to ViaBTC free accelerator. With doing so, your transaction will be likely confirmed in the next block mined by ViaBTC. They have around 9% of the total hash rate and mine a block around every 2 hours on average. Then OP have two options. One: Either use the acceleratorTwo: Wait for mempool to drop the transaction after around 7 days but looking at the fees set, I am sure it will be confirmed earlier than 7 days. May be in the next one or two days.",

Ugh That blockexplorer is buggy or incompetent, do not take the displayed data in face value. (it's not the \"Bitcoin blockchain\", BTW)If you click the \"JSON\" tab, you'll see that your transaction's input's nSequence value is \"4294967295\"or in HEX 0xffffffff which indicates that it's not opted-in for replacement; yet they're displaying it as yes...",
