It's obvious that this proposed bill was clearly introduced by someone or group of people with a zero knowledge. So just by not reusing my wallet address makes it mixing  , Then I think they will have a hard time digging out so many  dormant wallets that has only made a single transaction.This is clearly the problem here. Lacks of knowledge will make someone ignorant and tend to spit rubbish. Unfortunately, those without the knowledge happens to be the rulers.I think the part  were \"unhosted wallet providers\" are forced to collect user ID for task would be a tough fight between the law and the providers. All wallet providers understand the importance of privacy, and how the Bitcoin community value it. Everyone seems to be in a tight angle, as certain decisions must be taken. Though, it's still a proposed bill, but it's very funny and hilarious as none crypto users are now dictating.I came across details on single-use addresses : https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1795943072171172059?t=HmFA-lMjzMvIQHzl5huJLA&s=19",

(i) The term ‘‘CVC mixing’’ means the facilitation of CVC transactions in a manner that obfuscatesthe source, destination, or amount involved in one or more transactions,regardless of the type of protocol or service used, such as:(A) Pooling or aggregating CVC from multiple persons, wallets, addresses, or accounts;(B) Using programmatic or algorithmic code to coordinate, manage, or manipulate the structure of atransaction;(C) Splitting CVC for transmittal and transmitting the CVC through a series of independent transactions;(D) Creating and using single-use wallets, addresses, or accounts, and sending CVC through such wallets,addresses, or accounts through a series of independent transactions;(E) Exchanging between types of CVC or other digital assets; or(F) Facilitating user-initiated delays intransactional activity.In short, mixing is defined as doing  a, b ,c ,d e with the purpose of hiding the originating and final address.They don't plan on banning or punishing any of those actions, the define mixing with intent as a a cumulation of those actions!By this proposal mixing is defined as tuning single wallets to perform this action, IT DOESN'T define using single addresses as mixing!You know the whole thing of a bear is a mammal but not every mammal is are bears?Driving 90km/h in a city is a crime but driving 90km/h is not on its own alone!",
