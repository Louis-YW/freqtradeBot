  "content": "Why are some people buying low cap altcoins hoping that they will be rich by 2025? Someone texted me some altcoins she is buying for 2025 and it's full of gimmick projects, they hardly have any good volume on exchanges, all I can see is the range of 2000$ volume per day to 50,000$ per day .I asked her why these set of coins and tokens she said it's the only way to get rich in the next bull market.Do not buy coins because their value is cheap and market cap is low, this is plain stupidity, you are just throwing away your money because the next big altcoins by 2025 are probably not released yet, if you are doing this you need to stop. Out of fifty projects only one survives in such a plan, 99% of them will die and all your bags might not even contain the one that will survive. You end up wasting your money and time. Be smart.",

      "body": "Most of them is just buying in a chance to have massive return. It’s like betting on lottery with low chance of win rate. They knew how risky it is but the possible gains is massive once they landed a jackpot shitcoin.You can’t blame them since there’s a lot of shitcoin that show this kind of massive profit like Shiba and Doge which are both useless and cheap at the same time before yet it was pump hard with just a hype even though there no changes at all. I also don’t recommend investing on shitcoins especially using significant amount of money but tossing few bucks on shitcoins is not really bad if are just trying your luck. It’s just like gambling in different way.",

But there's nothing wrong with telling them why you don't recommend it, and you may need to give them an explanation.Quote from: Outhue on December 17, 2022, 01:22:48 PMOut of fifty projects only one survives in such a plan, 99% of them will die and all your bags might not even contain the one that will survive. You end up wasting your money and time. Be smart.It's true, 99% will fail because no real use cases can be expected. Most altcoin projects are pure speculation and manipulation, so it's best to avoid especially those that don't have high trading volume. Even the top 10 altcoin will not guarantee big profits.",

      "body": "The only mistake that you are making if you buy coins on erroneous plans is wasting your money and a huge chance of loss. Yes buying some coins on low prices does work, because it has the potential to provide high profits for you, but there are also extreme risks involved with this investment. There are thousands of different low cap coins out there, and it's almost certain that 99% of them will completely fail and become worthless. The other 1% could become valuable, but the problem is that you don't know which one will succeed and which one will fail. So when you invest in a low cap coin, there's a high chance that you'll lose all your money. If you want to make money in crypto, then you need to do your research and do some fundamental analysis on each project before investing.",

The trouble is picking the winning alt, if there will be any.24 months is a very long time in the world of altcoins, their success depends on their popularity,and they can be quickly replaced by a newer project which could gain favour and attract attentionaway from other projects.In the end of the day, everything bar a handful of alts are replaced.",

Such project won't have a hard time surviving through the bear market and it won't stop them from making 10x or 20x gains.",

Many people that buy those kind of shitcoins and tokens it all because it was suggested to them by some people who convinced them that it is only those type project that can make them rich and because they eager to make in short term, may be blinded those words. And again sometimes it all depend on the people that behind the project team to determine whether the project is good or not,but the best coin for investment is Bitcoin.Quote from: Outhue on December 17, 2022, 01:22:48 PMOut of fifty projects only one survives in such a plan, 99% of them will die and all your bags might not even contain the one that will survive.

It will be better for to invested in bitcoin and get whatever profit it brings than losing it all. There's a saying that says halve bread is better than none.
