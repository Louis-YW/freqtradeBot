  "content": "\"Bitcoin Is Not Crypto, The SEC Confirms\" was a heading from one of Forbes's recent articles, it's so unfortunate that similar interpretations are everywhere and some people have started believing the heresy.It's high time people stop naivety and start thinking with their brains. Those people holding the power in SEC or have the most powerful media houses are equipped with human beings like you, they are no gods that warrant people to be taking their words as binding. The media is awash with the heresy that Bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency, so suddenly? Common!!! Simply because SEC asked Coinbase to delist all cryptocurrency in their trading list except Bitcoin prior to court a suit. Should we now say that those who put their heads together to come up with the widely accepted name called Cryptocurrency are dummies?Well, to me, the reverse is the case, it's those who are now trying to change their name that is Dummies. Our brains should serve us right before we start running our mouths like water.Let me start by saying that SEC never withdrew cryptocurrency title from Bitcoin, it only tried to prove that Bitcoin and altcoins have too many dissimilarities to call them a single entity. But the media had their version of this that altered the initial conclusion. Is it that people are lame that they can't think for themselves even if the media says something, to the point that some people have started arguing with me offline on something that is so clear? And if you read the last Coindesk link posted above, you will realize that the SEC only made a \"Recommendation,\" and not binding according to the Chairman of SEC Gary Gensler has. He maintained that 4 commissioners have their different opinions on this and doesn't reflect the institution's position. It's only a fraction of these commissioners aligning with such a recommendation and they couldn't even give a satisfactory reason when further questions were asked.Should Bitcoin be stripped of the cryptocurrency title because of altcoins? That's ain't gonna happen, they should be the ones to excuse the name for Bitcoin.By looking at some of Satoshi's Bios and Bitcoin development on Wikipedia, I discovered that two of the little anyone could say of Satoshi is that he's a software and cryptography expert, and the article further shows that \"on 31 October 2008, he published a white paper on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com describing a digital cryptocurrency, titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\".Satoshi used his cryptography knowledge to build a decentralized blockchain digit asset called Bitcoin, which is where the \"Crypto\" name came from. And for the reason that the digital asset could also serve people in many ways just like fiat currencies in payments, trading and investment, hence the remaining term \"Currency.\"Crypto + Currency = ? (In case critics and heretics don't know, it's Cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin is the first to fit in for the name, and the only one that has preserved the true need for that name). The rest gradually relinquishes theirs for the latter reason through more scalability and other possible projects that deviate from the purpose. It's callous for the media to try to strip Bitcoin which is the pioneer and the most respected cryptocurrency of that famous name. I quite understand the position of the SEC, it's the media that went agog and misleading. But if at all, altcoins should be the ones relinquishing that name (cryptocurrency) for Bitcoin, not Bitcoin dropping the name for them.Bitcoin remains cryptocurrency as far as I'm concerned and will always be, damn anything the media and SEC pass across. They can name altcoins anything they want for all I care.Maybe they should call them cryptic coins...since they are not certain of what they are.",

Some do come with misleading title, which supposed not to be. But if you read further, you will understand where they are driving to, which is correct.https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2023/07/31/bitcoin-is-not-crypto-the-sec-confirms/amp/Quote from: https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2023/07/31/bitcoin-is-not-crypto-the-sec-confirms/amp/Talk to a bitcoin maximalist – someone who believes that bitcoin is the only digital asset with innate value – and, more likely than not, they’ll tell you the world’s oldest cryptocurrency is, in fact, ‘not crypto’ at all.The refrain can be confusing: clearly, bitcoin pioneered the use of cryptography – an ultra-secure type of encryption – with the aim of creating a digital currency. Bitcoin is the archetypal crypto.Quote from: https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2023/07/31/bitcoin-is-not-crypto-the-sec-confirms/amp/Even so, the SEC’s lawyers will surely have done their homework on the design and distribution of cryptos before going to court. And, for now at least, they seem to be arguing that bitcoin – and bitcoin alone – has attained the status of decentralized digital cash; an autonomous currency beyond the control of vested interests. Well done Satoshi. Maximalists rejoice.The title is very inaccurate, but where Forbes was driving at tells the correct story about to see bitcoin different from altcoins. But like on this forum, we refer bitcoin as bitcoin, while other cryptocurrencies as altcoins. But we do not dispute the fact that bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.",

It was a clickbait title, and I wouldn't be surprised if a marginal outlet did it, but I think that the top media like Forbes should be above that and strive for a more accurate representation of events. The article itself is okay, but that doesn't justify making an inaccurate title. It might be just the author's style, though, as his most recent article at Forbes is named \"Money Printer Go Brr\" and then some.",

It is common to see people say that 'all crypto are scams', in that case bitcoiners reply that crypto may be a scam, but BTC isn't.I don't think you read what I wrote well, if you did and also followed some media houses and social media posts, then you would clearly see propaganda and deviations from the truth.Also, the post has answered all that you wrote here already, the fact remains that Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, you can't deny that, it's obvious by creation except you just choose not to accept which will still not change the fact, even judging by Satoshi's early work, he defined it as such (See the Wiki article). People only tend to prove things otherwise in a situation like this, I will never join this naivety. The fact remains that the first coin that qualifies for the name (Bitcoin) can't ever relinquish it to altcoins. Those who are talking should find something else others should bear, that's the basis of my post in case you did not understand.QuoteNevertheless, people should not stop at the caption of an article, captions can usually be clickbait, but they have to read the content of the article, and there is nothing wrong with the content of the article in your post. BTC isn't a security, but most altcoins are, and for easy interpretation, you could put it that all cryptocurrencies are securities, but BTC isn't.First, the captions are unnecessary, it's a total deviation from the SEC's recommendation. It is also heretic that people are only capitalizing on the situation giving their different definitions just like you do now. As for the security you are talking about, don't let regulators and authors deceive you, Bitcoin and altcoins have more in common than what separates them whether you like it or not. SEC and regulators are only looking for a way they will disintegrate Bitcoin from altcoins that are more controllable before they will later pounce on it.It's so gross that people are following for the bait, you might remember these words later.",

It's just left for the readers to filter the information they have gotten and know if it's really correct or not. Perhaps should what the SEC of one country said affect all other citizens in other countries? Well, every investor who knows what they are dealing with will likely not believe all this false news.",
