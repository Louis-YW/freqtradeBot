  "content": "I'm going to enter the crypto market today. BTC only, for now.I wish I had stepped in sooner but it is what it is.I'm planning to transfer between 15k and 20k, in 2 deposits. The maximum deposit for most cards is 10k on bitvavo. I'm located in the EU.My bank denied my first attempt to transfer to Binance, about 6 months ago. Now I'm planning to make 2 deposits of 10k. Yesterday I informed my bank, that this transaction would happen and that it is normal. That it is a long term investment. I did not mention the words crypto or BTC, but they will know the receiver of course. The woman on the phone tried to sell me their own investment schemes with fiat money, which obviously does not interest me. I expect some counter attack. Banks hate to lose liquidity and I expect them to go after BTC the same way they went after gold in WWII.I expect to be flagged with tax agents and the government. I may be called a criminal as part of their war on crypto, which I expect to happen when more people abandon fiat currency.Is it bad to use Bitvavo in my case? Banks will know what I'm investing in. But I don't think there's a way around that.Shortly after purchasing I plan to store the coins in a hardware wallet. If/when tax agents come after me, I will donate these to a different account holder to avoid being robbed by my government.",

It's true the bank knows where money flows in and out of accounts.  Financial institutions have reporting duties in many countries - to combat money laundering and tax evasion.  Depending on your local laws.That said, for certain assets, privacy matters.  In cryptocurrency circles some seek to transact outside official channels and  meeting people face-to-face, trading cash for coin.  It adds hassle, sure, but data remains obscure.  Ultimately it's about personal choice.  What information are we comfortable sharing? Some care little others deem privacy paramount.  Neither outlook strikes me as right or wrong.  Rather it depends on one's unique situation and convictions. In areas where crypto is legal, peer-to-peer meetings happen.  Local communities connect people looking to exchange assets without official oversight.  Solutions exist for those valuing confidentiality.  Yet they involve trade-offs - namely time and effort.",

You don't want to mess with them.I'm from Belgium. I've recently opened a topic about our regulations.Basically the IRS (our equivalent of it) makes 3 categories. Amateurs, part time traders and professional traders.Amateurs don't pay any taxes. However, it is very vague how they categorize people. Hodlers are considered amateurs. And \"people who don't take risks\". Which makes no sense because everybody does. Also the portion of ones total net worth is a criterium. Some articles mention 2%. Others 25%. In reality it just shows that they don't know and they will tax the fuck out of everyone as soon as they can.For now it says that they will tax on realized profits. I assume that these have to be withdrawn to bank accounts before there can be any tax.However the article also says that the tax agent \"is looking at our crypto wallet in 2023 and later\". I read an article that said someone had to pay taxes on owning a 47000 euro asset, while the current value was 3x less. This implies that they tax the shit out of us regardless of withdrawals.It mentions that we have to prove that we are amateurs based on inactive transaction history. But this would require direct access of the tax agent to our crypto wallet, which goes against everything BTC stands for. I assume the article means that exchanges have to comply with tax regulations. But of course I will get my money off of the exchange and I wonder how they can know my portfolio then",

Banks will see this, but she is the real owner)- My father (I give him 5k later)When the money is paid, I make my mother in law (who lives outside of the EU and is almost 80 years old) go through KYC.We manage her account though. There was never a bank transfer (fiat to BTC) in her name, so banks in Brazil will not expect anything. There will only be a crypto transaction of our 3 accounts here, to hers. She doesn't live here so our government can not tax her. When the tax hawks come for me, I say that all BTC has been transfered to my non EU family member as a donation. Because BTC taxes in her country (Brazil) are much friendlier. I can also prove this with my transaction history. This is like someone trying to take my money at gunpoint, and then realizing that there is nothing to steal. I don't think they will contact the authorities in Brazil because there's nothing in it for themselves.However with my mother in law at 78 years old.. What happens if she passes away with 500k euros worth of BTC on her name? I wonder if it ever gets to a point where we actively need her fingerprint or live camera footage to transfer her BTC holdings in 2035, for example",

Exception of trading, if it were bitcoin investment or a payment method, OP should have just relied on p2p, to hodle and sale, and evade government interferences. In my country, the central bank placed ban on banks to facilitate crypto transactions, but this is not a problem for us, we rely on p2p and exchanges for our crypto transactions.

You are using a centralized platform to buy, so your privacy is already compromised there. Now if you add something that the government has control over, you will be in big trouble. The best option is to withdraw the money from your bank account and then use that for P2P trades. You will not be under the government's radar that way. Also, you can buy in small amounts so that no extra steps will be needed to transfer money related to crypto purchasing.

Neither is it illegal.There is only a tax for converting BTC profits to cash or other coins.I'm planning to transfer the BTC to an air gapped coldcard this weekend. If a tax agent ever inspects the transaction history on the exchange, he'll see that I did not realize profits and the coins are no longer on an exchange.I don't intend to ever sell the BTC. By the time that regulations change, my Satoshis will be out of reach from any centralized entity. I don't think a tax agent can ever get to my coldcard, or stop transactions with it.",
