  "content": "To start with this \"mini thesis\", nullius wrote a great piece on why bitcoin is an inflation hedge.TL;DR:Quote from: nullius on July 29, 2022, 08:37:13 PMQuote from: satoshi on July 06, 2010, 06:32:35 PMEscape the arbitrary inflation risk of centrally managed currencies! ¬†Bitcoin's total circulation is limited to 21 million coins.I am not citing Satoshi as an authority, but rather, to rebut the ridiculous misinformation that Bitcoin's anti-inflationary policy was \"an idea built by influencers and speculators in the last years.\" That is wrong in fact. Not a matter of opinion.By lately some people have been claiming that \"Bitcoin's power consumption is a central point of failure - someone can just switch off the electricity and all miners stop\". And in particular \"Bitcoin will not survive the coming winter\". Both of these are wrong.Being an inflation hedge implies being a store of value, since people will keep BTC for longer periods of time in the latter case.Miners getting their power cut depends entirely on which country their operating in, not all countries think the same. In particular, Siberian miners using Russian natural gas will not see any change or harassment of their operations (because Russia desperately needs foreign cash).Sure, mining will be unprofitable in places like Germany, but the high electricity prices argue that miners have moved their operations to more favorable places.The truth is, all miners will go to places with cheap electricity. Cheap electricity means the grids can sustain the miners and the rest of the population without overloading, making the much-trumpeted \"economic collapse\" non-existent.Local rules: See below, same rules apply here:Quote from: nullius on July 29, 2022, 08:38:30 PMLocal rules:  I will delete anything that I dislike.  But unlike in most of my thread, sigspammers are welcome to bump this so that the Satoshi quote can compete with the spam megathread with a factually incorrect ahistorical claim in OP.  Muahahaha!  :-)",

It's not like stopping all the miners is going to take a single(or a few) press of a button; it's going to require some sort of extensive global government collaboration to literally look for and stop every single miner(including miners that only run their operations at home). It's simply not realistically viable.",

Does that refer to the actual season (weather) or the metaphor used to describe grim bear markets? I'm assuming it would be more of the former, as Bitcoin has been through multiple market cycles, but would appreciate a bit of clarity.About someone switching off electricity and stopping mining, that's quite a ridiculous argument. For one, if there is a global electricity crisis, almost all industries would take a huge hit. And there's no someone that can switch off electricity and cut of miners.Also, why are presumed global crisis said to be a Bitcoin problem? People are always discussing the effect of quantum computers on the cryptography of Bitcoin, but if hypothetically it became a reality, this would be an issue for all global security outlets. Same with an electricity crisis.",

PoS costs decrease even further. thus PoS has little to no underlying bottom store of value. and majority of its price is built up not of an allotment of large store of value and then ontop some speculation premium.. but instead a very very small couple dollar store of value and then a very high speculation of pure desire/demand to buy. which is not healthy nor valuablelets use ethereum as a prime example using just electric prices of $0.04scenario A Eth PoW using efficient asic:Eth PoW hashrate ~850,000Ghasheth asic of 2.4ghash  at 1.92kwh per asic=354167 asics = 680000kwh = $27,200/hourthere are ~260 coins made an hour = $104.62 electric cost per coinscenario B Eth PoS solo stake:Eth PoS solo validator ~420,000Pc solo validators of 100w per pc= 42,000kwh = $1680/hourthere are ~260 coins made an hour = $6.46 electric cost per coinscenario C Eth PoS custodial stake:Eth PoS solo validator ~30 custodians= 3kwh = $0.12/hourthere are ~260 coins made an hour = $0.0046 electric cost per cointhus, the underlying cost of security/creating a coin drops with PoS and drops further the more popular a PoS becomes. (both cost and security)where by the difference between the underlying value. vs the market price is made up of pure speculation of human choice. rather than an underlying cost",

Riot curtailed a total of 11,717 megawatt hours in July, enough to power 13,121 average homes for one month. Curtailing the Company’s power consumption reduced BTC production by an estimated 21% in July, but also significantly reduced Riot’s power costs for the month. By providing power back into the ERCOT grid during periods of peak demand, the Company estimates that power credits and other benefits from curtailment activities totaled an estimated $9.5 million, significantly outweighing the reduction in BTC mined.Of course, it's voluntary but it's still about the money!If miners would be faced with 40cents per kWh like in Europe they would be shutting also voluntary but a different type.Quote from: NotATether on September 05, 2022, 10:49:00 AMSure, mining will be unprofitable in places like Germany, but the high electricity prices argue that miners have moved their operations to more favorable places.The truth is, all miners will go to places with cheap electricity.

The truth is that the current situation can hold only x amount of miners, that's it, there is no way for an infinite number, somewhere there is a stop and the cheap energy stops becoming cheap.",

The company heard the news from the facility owner yesterday afternoon, he said.Look where they think , it is safe to go , TEXAS, which at the moment has the highest power outages in the US.Look, many think this is all fud, but I assure you , this is the reality of where this world is headed, and it will be ~10 years before the energy situation can be repaired to a reliable power grid.The baseload power requirements have been ignored for over 20 years, in favor of green energy which can not support 24x7 baseload,and at the moment Nuclear or Tidal energy are the best solutions, and it will take ~10 years for enough new one to just keep our grids stable.Their are no 1st world countries anymore, starting this Winter, every country on the Planet is a 3rd world country unable to keep the power on 24x7 for it's citizens.",

The Genesis block tells us Satoshi's intention: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” The bailouts were due to large banks and mortgages failing.  These would be large accounts, ones where value would be stored, and the statement of \"bailout\"'s says that Satoshi was annoyed by a loss-of-value. \"The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.\"\"Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula.\"\"Bitcoin [is] more like a collectible or commodity.\"\"As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases.\"\" if you get larger amounts then you can upgrade to the actual bitcoin software.\"\"Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you’ve suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange... Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.\"\"Escape the arbitrary inflation risk of centrally managed currencies! Bitcoin’s total circulation is limited to 21 million coins.\"(lifted from http://sampatt.com/blog/2019/06/06/breakdown-of-all-satoshi-writings-proves-bitcoin-not-built-primarily-as-store-of-value#evidence-for-store-of-value)At the moment, Bitcoin is not a store-of-value. It's not stable enough for that. It is likely an increase-of-value after several years, but not always within a short yearly period. If you wanted to force people to transact, you would go for a different model. Inflation encourages spending, so to encourage transactions it would be better to have a schedule that starts with block halvings to encourage uptake, but after a few decades change to block doublings.Quote from: NotATether on September 05, 2022, 09:16:37 AMBy lately some people have been claiming that \"Bitcoin's power consumption is a central point of failure - someone can just switch off the electricity and all miners stop\". And in particular \"Bitcoin will not survive the coming winter\". Both of these are wrong.Bitcoin's value is determined on the difficulty of obtaining new Bitcoin. While that may be CPU/hash power, difficulty can also come in the form of legal restrictions. More legal restrictions increases difficulty, which would increase the cost of creating new Bitcoin, and push the price upwards. You may find that if Bitcoin becomes banned in some countries that miners will still continue in those countries because they find Bitcoin worth it. Hash rate is partially irrelevant since that automatically adjusts -- it's the \"difficulty\" that matters, and \"difficulty\" includes hash rate, technological progress, power generation and consumption -- but social reasons can also increase \"difficulty\".",

Lower power, low noise, perfect for home mining. Perhaps get back to the rack mount style like the antminer S2 / Spondoolies tech miners so people could place it in their equipment racks and nobody would know the difference.Yes, the governments could play whack-a-mole trying to find it all but it would never happen. Since BTC is for people to do with what they want, it can be a store of value, it can be a hedge against inflation, it can be an investment, it can be a cash replacement. It can be whatever you want it to be. And if someone does not agree, fine you don't have to agree it's what YOU want, not what THEY want.-DavePrecisely. People are forgetting about the difficult adjustments. If large-scale mining businesses would be ruled out, then it would be highly more viable for at-home miners. There's a reason it was designed this way — for Bitcoin to work regardless if there was a huge censorship campaign for large-scale miners.More people are forgetting that as energy rate keeps increasing,the cost of the energy to mine a bitcoin is exceeded by the energy purchased price.Meaning, every bitcoin mined costs more money than it brings in.How many home users do you think will go in the hole even $1k every month for 1 to 2 years to save btc.With Food and energy prices still increasing, odds are they won't be able to afford it, many normal business are already shutting down from just the normal energy they use.Giant mining firms can offset their loss in profit by going to the outside financial sector for capital investment.Home users can not get a major capital investment on a whim, because to be honest their operations will be too small to ever profit mining bitcoin.Bitcoin is only more profitable than the energy used for ~ 6 months every 4 years, the rest of the time , it is in the hole.* Due to the aging Baby Boomers, the capital investment is already in decline, so even the big boys are not going to be able to offset the costs anymore like in the past.*  And you are forgetting that if big players do drop out difficulty goes down, and as it does the home / small miners will if not make a profit will not incur a noticeable loss.You also do not seem to understand the amount of people who are mining with fixed infrastructure power costs. Or where there is unused power generation that can't go anyplace else.  https://decrypt.co/98424/bitcoin-firm-crusoe-energy-raises-505-million-grow-flare-gas-mining-businessOr the bottom of the mountain wind turbine miners in CA.Or overnight hydro mining, it's not like a river stops flowing when everyone goes to sleep at night and power use drops.....And so on.-DaveYou seem to be forgetting it takes 2 weeks for the BTC PoW difficulty to reset.As observed from other coins, that had a major drop off of miners, It could take six months for the difficulty to drop low enough for a home miner to actually mine a block.You think the public will wait patiently or the exchanges will just go , we wait no problem, I don't think so.You're kind of missing the reality that is heading toward you this winter.There is not going to be any excess power generation, the majority of hydro is about to shut down due to world wide droughts, no water no power no food. Time to wake up Dave.https://www.vox.com/23292669/drought-2022-power-energy-grid-lake-mead-climate-heat-hoover-damQuoteHow the Western drought is pushing the power grid to the brinkIf you have ignored the price of natural gas skyrocketing cost in Europe, you realize that those flaring gas, instead of selling it, are going to lose money instead of making it.The larger profit will be from selling natural gas, not burning it to lose money mining btc.In the world we are moving into, reality returns ,UNPROFITABLE VENTURES will be discarded for Profitable Ventures.If you think btc PoW mining will be profitable , knock yourself out, you'll find out the hard way soon enough.PoW fatal flaw, the PoW network fails when the cost of energy exceeds it network maintenance cost and their is no outside capital investment to keep it on life support.",

Not energy mismanagement, but panicking about electricity. Here we have a saying: \"Live one day at a time\".   Dude , you already live in a 3rd world country, if you got power only 12 hours per day.How many btc PoW miners are in your area?  Hmm? None, I imagine, because you can't keep the power on.I would doubt people are freezing to death at 10-15°C , however -15°C is another story.Hopefully your area does not get that cold naturally, however the US and Europe can easily hit that # and lower.Starvation to Africa will come from lack of fertilizers, and problems importing food to your country.  When the power is off 4 days, your food in the freezers are gone.Unless of course you are 3rd world enough to just go outside and slaughter a fresh goat when hungry.  https://www.theafricareport.com/123719/whats-behind-africas-skyrocketing-imports-yet-increased-production-growth/Quote “Africa imported about 85% of its food (2016-2018) from outside the continent,” amounting to $35bn and is expected to reach $110bn by 2025.Quote from: NotATether on September 05, 2022, 11:51:10 PMQuote from: LegendaryK on September 05, 2022, 05:33:20 PMPlus an early warning has already started for PoW, the prelude to the bans, Energy Utilities raising the energy rate so high, that the miners just shut down.There's no correlation. Miners shut down operations because of high power all the time. Why didn't you mention any EU meeting or something like that?  Your ability to ignore what is in front of you is amazing.Mining firm closes down in Georgia, because the energy prices doubled.Mining firm claims they are moving to Texas, Texas already has rolling blackouts. Energy prices there are also increasing.What this means is the miners moving to Texas will make the energy problems in Texas even worse.Also meaning that the Texas Grid comes 1 step closer to failure, and your precious miners having no where left to go.Think about it , if Texas grid goes to failure, the transformers will be down for 2 or 3 years before repair.No country in their right mind will allow PoW mining in their county after they see that happen.Quote from: NotATether on September 05, 2022, 11:51:10 PMQuoteTheir are no 1st world countries anymore, starting this Winter, every country on the Planet is a 3rd world country unable to keep the power on 24x7 for it's citizens.  Great! I'll assume you have made a contingency plan for what to do when your utility starts switching off your power for entire days at a time. /sarcasmYes, Generac whole house battery backup, with Gas powered Inverters to maintain the backup, with enough Gas stored for a year.Generac backup run you ~$30K USD, ~$1.5K for Gas power Inverter, your local gas prices ~$8700 for a years worth, suspect a increase soon. I assume you are keeping a herd of Boer goats in your front yard, eat the males, drink the milk from the females, and burn their shit for warmth. So we are both ready.  My vacation is now over, so I shall leave you to spread your nonsense. Good Luck in the Dark Winter, and the coming Hunger Games in 2023.",
