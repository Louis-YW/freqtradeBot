  "content": "I am not a supporter of creating a lot of topics (usually meaningless, as is not so rare on this forum), but if I have something to say or ask, then I do it. Today is just such a case, and it so happened, again, by a coincidence, that this is my 2500th post.Crypto community has been waiting for a long time for the bitcoin‚Äôs mass adoption and the introduction of BTC into the global financial system along with the dollar and the euro. People want to see btc at every turn in everyday life.You can't imagine my surprise when this happened to me and I saw the BTC logo on cookies in a candy store. Looking more closely, I saw other monetary symbols in the package. At that moment, my first thought was ‚ÄúThis is it! What all have been waiting for. Finally, Bitcoin was added to world currencies on an equal footing!‚ÄùLooks like a huge treasure, doesn't it? ¬† Cookies with white chocolate-like icing on one side and embossed currency logos on both sides.Disclaimer: This post is a joke and should not be taken seriously. It is acceptable only for BTC-cookies, which, by the way, turned out to be quite tasty.It's funny that someone thought to put the bitcoin logo on a cookie cutter in a candy factory. I don‚Äôt even know if this was done deliberately and consciously, or without a proper understanding of the value of bitcoin and accidentally. In any case, either btc mass adoption is already close to us, or the marketing departments have understood the prospects for such innovations. After all, I fell for their trick and bought cookies, right. It would be interesting to know what other food products you have seen the bitcoin logo on?",

Global mass adoption cannot be second guessed as you would experience it fully in your day to day activities. A smart employee probably suggested that they add it to their list of currencies.Quote from: m2017 on January 20, 2023, 11:04:08 AMIt would be interesting to know what other food products you have seen the bitcoin logo on?None in real life, but there were some good ones in the pizza contests that has been held on the forum.- Jay -",

During 2017, I was also thinking of printing some shirts and stickers with the bitcoin logo but in the end, I didn't do it because I want to remain private and not give people a clue that I am a bitcoin believer. The same thing happened last 2018, I was so tempted to put some bitcoin stickers on the cars and some stuff on my new house. But the same privacy issue always stopped me from doing it. It's funny that some of my bitcoin stickers, cards, and other collections remained hidden. I do not want them to be given too.",

Nicely done to whoever made that! The finished result looks amazing and I love seeing the Bitcoin business community so proactive! If one were to decide to sell or reward the cookies to the Bitcoin fans, I think that one could make a nice amount of money and/or become very well liked. I am not trying to turn this into some kind of a business extension or anything, I am just saying.",

This would be the case with the cookies. Not typically investing in cryptocurrency but, a way to create some more publicity and enable people to recognise it for the currency that it is, hevant featured amongst other cookie currencies.It's gradual but we are getting there!",

Good Luck on your business. It seems that you badly got inspired after seeing those BTC cookies and you want to help them spreading the word BTC .",
