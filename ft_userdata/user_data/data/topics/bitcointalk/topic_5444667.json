There's no rational connection between banks or other centralized services failing and Bitcoin being at risk, so people shouldn't spread their panic over traditional markets onto Bitcoin. That being said, Bitcoin is 8% up over the last 24 hours, so the uncertainty didn't last for long. As for inflation, Bitcoin did take a heavy hit for it, and it was completely uncalled for. Overall, well done. Nice words, short text, and a relevant important message.",

But when I read the OP, I noticed that Satoshi would not write that, I could not checked the Twitter link because I am not on Twitter. I can't login to my Twitter account for now. And from what I also discovered from the OP even though the original text is not from Satoshi, the message is clear that we should not in any way or day rush to sell our assets. Hodle it for a long period when all banks has crushed. But I don't think that is also possible.",

I honestly believe that Satoshi unfortunately passed away, if you know who he could be then you know why I said he passed away, it is obvious.However, even if he is alive and among us right now, I think he wouldn't turn now, and if we assume that he is alive and he makes a comeback, even if all those unlikely things happened, anyone who read him would know that \"motherfucker\" is not something he would say to anyone. This is not something he will do and yet a \"joke\" about it somehow gets this much attention, why? What's so funny or interesting about it to get this much attention?",

What I find crazy is that we've accepted the fact that one entity can decide how the economy will go-- as if they are Gods who know everything and don't do mistakes. And the tragic part is that they will never pay for any potential mistakes they make; fiat is fundamentally prone to failure, because there is no financial incentive to protect it from.",

He writes with two spaces after each punctuation mark yeah, and the fact that he owns less merits in the image than what he has in this forum should be dead giveaways for people who thought this was real. Although I'm a little curious as to what his reaction would be now that his \"prophecies\" as I put it is seemingly coming true. Bank runs executed against the biggest and arguably the most financial secure banks irl, collapse of economic power in the west among others, while bitcoin stays afloat with little to no signs of dropping in value. I bet he's laughing his ass off right now if he's still alive to see this.",

If Satoshi had appeared in such a long time of his absence, he would not have become so rude to the current participants in this market.The real Satoshi Nakamoto is unlikely to break his silence, if he is still alive at all. He very cleverly did everything so that he would not be identified in the future, which means he was not going to ever appear in public again.",
