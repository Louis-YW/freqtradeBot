  "content": "We are all aware of Bitcoin halving that is predicted to happen by next year 2024. The first halving in November 2012 moved the price of bitcoin from $12 to $200 in one year. The second halving which took place in July 9, 2016, pushed the price of Bitcoin to $19,700 in one year. In the last halving in May 2020, Bitcoin’s price surged from $8,787 to nearly $69,000 in November 2021. It is usual for the price of Bitcoin to fall immediately after each bull run but the price of Bitcoin has kept appreciating above past bull runs. During this events block rewards for miners get reduced by half as part of Bitcoin protocol design which happens every four years to manage the rate at which new Bitcoin are generated. As regards to this many predict a possible pump might accompany the next halving which is not a guarantee because the relationship between halving and price pump is really complicated.The general assumption for so many bitcoiners is that the bull run is a time to sell and make a profit. There is nothing wrong with selling and making a profit but it is also important to have an after-the-bull run plan. The bull run shouldn't be the end of your Bitcoin investment, so there is no need to sell all your holdings. The future of Bitcoin is far beyond next year's bull run,  so it is time to plan ahead of the season. I have observed that most people who make money from Bitcoin don't just have a four-year investment plan. Some of them have kept their coins for a decade which means they have a long-term plan. If you don't have an after-the-bull-run plan, you might not have the opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin that you have sold.If we pay close attention at the market moves we will notice a few principal factor have also contributed to how price have moved during this season:Market Sentiment: If we watch how investors perceive the market during this season and how the go about with their sentimental investment approach we see how much it significantly affect market price. While we anticipate for the next halving let's not forget The crypto market can be full of hypes and optimism, which may lead to one of two things negligence or increased buying activity and price appreciation.Historical Precedent: From past occurrences,  Bitcoin has experienced significant price rallies following previous halvings, which in itself is very logical. When the supply gets reduced more attention will be drawn to the asset which could load to higher prices but using past performance to predict future result might not be positive all the time. Market Speculation: During this seasons we see traders and investors try to take advantage of the price movement around Bitcoin halving. Since this often leads to high speculative activities their is always chances of price volatility occurrence.External Factors: We shouldn't also forget other external factors like regulatory development which has always been one of the key battle line for Bitcoin as well as global events, adoption trends and macroeconomic conditions.Conclusion :It is principal to note that in as much as Bitcoin halving has the potential of creating a very conducive market structure for price increase, It is never a guarantee. We all know the market is volatile and subject to speculative and rapid fluctuations. So a long-term plan in view could be one way to approach the market so that it don't take us unawares.Lastly in all investments and trading decisions ensure to conduct thorough research and pay more attention to the volatility of the market that could also serve as guide in what direction to take during the halving.",

Kudos for the remembrance and educating more and other beginners.Quote from: Pablo-wood on September 25, 2023, 04:45:30 PMConclusion :It is principal to note that in as much as Bitcoin halving has the potential of creating a very conducive market structure for price increase, It is never a guarantee. We all know the market is volatile and subject to speculative and rapid fluctuations. So a long-term plan in view could be one way to approach the market so that it don't take us unawares.In fact, holding bitcoin for a long time is the best because bitcoin is not something to invest in for a short time. That is why most people get used to this word when educating someone about bitcoin: \"Invest what you can afford to lose.\" This sentence means a lot in the sense that if you invest the money you can afford to lose, you can also be patient and keep that money as an investment for a long period of time. QuoteLastly in all investments and trading decisions ensure to conduct thorough research and pay more attention to the volatility of the market that could also serve as guide in what direction to take during the halving. Actually, a wise man says, “He who asks questions will never fail.” That means if you engage in research, you will always prosper and never be a victim of failure.",

Less and less new BTC is being printed, automatically making the supply in circulation limited - of course if BTC users increase and many people or institutions also make purchases and this hodl causes the BTC in circulation to also increase, while many people need it.Most of the time, if they have reached the target increase of either 3x or even 6x increase in value, individual or institutional hodlers will take action to sell to take profits or even get out.",

It is a little difficult to determine how big the increase will be after the halving later. But there will be many people who hold and release after exceeding the last ATH. 2 multiples of ATH are already very large and I hope the highest price at least is that. That I did before. I totally agree with you because of my principle of profit-seeking. Try to collect as many Bitcoins as possible.",

Although history has shown us that after halving bitcoin will almost certainly increase in price and create a new ATH, but I also do not rule out the possibility that history will not repeat itself and we will have a new cycle. In case history doesn't repeat itself, I will certainly be disappointed but that won't make me give up on bitcoin and leave the market. In the long term, the potential of this market is still huge, so if history does not repeat itself, I will consider it a change in the bullish cycle, not the end of the market.",

I think it is understandable why they don't do that because they're satisfied with how much they've made. And there's nothing wrong if they sell all that they have during the next bull run if it's the actual peak price that they'll sell it. They can use the profit they've made to anything they wish to. Like doing another investment of putting it into real estate and other assets outside Bitcoin so, they just decide to reinvest it somewhere else and that's not a wrong move either. But as holders that has longer game plan for Bitcoin, we understand why there's a need for us to be patient and have an after bull run plan. Honestly, my plan is just very simple. If the price goes up during the next bull run and it has met my set price, I'd sell but not all. I may re-buy or not but I still have a certain quantity of Bitcoin that will be good for the long term. It may not be a lot but that's like it's gonna to sit there for years.",

I think there's no single best advice here what to do with bull bear cycles, because everyone has a different investment style - some want to trade more often, some want to just hold for long term, perhaps even skipping the selling during bull markets altogether.",

I lose so many potential profits doing that. Sure, there is no way to exit at the perfect time, but making a plan to sell some of your cons when the bull run happens is better imo.

Especially if you don't have that much capital to begin with. With Bitcoin, if you missed chances to take profit in a market cycle, a bull run, you still can have chances next times with future market cycles. I agree with you that missing a bull run is not good but I also agree with hathepsut that holding and waiting for a next bull run is not too bad.With altcoins, if you lost chances to take profit, holding them can put your capital at risk of big losses or even completely losses of your initial capital. Altcoins are very risky because they are changing quickly with a market cycle, some months or years of bear market can kill altcoin projects. They are worse than Bitcoin in surviving through bear market.How many cryptocurrencies have failed?",

Holding onto something in hopes of a higher price is no different from being greedy. Yes, greed can often yield substantial gains, but the truth is it can't guarantee luck will always be on your side.Try setting targets, and we don't have to reach those targets in one go. It might take more time, and that's actually not a significant issue. After all, time is indeed money.",

After the bull run, it will be corrected, so that if it does happen, as much as possible, we have been prepared to anticipate what will happen.The main thing, of course, is to buy when the price has been corrected according to the current situation and hold until you are sure that you have made the profit you want.I am as sure as you that this repetition will continue to be carried out continuously because past experience has proven that ATH has occurred several times.Always be able to prepare yourself when there is an opportunity to make a profit.",

A new cyclical journey will start. Remember the end of the Bull run prefer profit Booking in a smart way as taking an exit from the market is not a good approach as far as with the BTC, currently, there are two sort of positions with long timeframe as 2 to 3 Halvings even more and for the very next Halving.
