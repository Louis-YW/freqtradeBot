  "content": "So, Ratimov, you want some drama again? You left me a neutral but that does not mean I am not going to speak out. You are still a newborn considering the amount of time I spent in the forum since 2015. I understand this new generation does not respect their elders but that does not mean you will have some unrealistic accusations against me.As far as I understand the reason of your neutral is the neutral I left on your profile long ago which was below:Quote 2022-03-19  Reference  An absolute merit whore. His famous, \"In this article I would like to touch upon such a theme\"Please double check before meriting him. That was over one and half years ago. If I remember correctly beginning of this year, one of my resolution was to unignore you and continue healthy interaction. But somehow in another thread you were having salty mouth [I am just too lazy to find your salty mouth post]  and indirectly reminding me this neutral feedback as it's like you thought I was going to remove it as a token of my intention of having healthy conversation with you. You indeed was a plagiarist but it was in a unique way. And in my consideration it was plagiarism. Whatever I said there, is still absolutely true.Let's get back to what you left for me just two days ago [I just noticed it as you are not in my trust list]Quote2023-07-06ReferenceTrust abuser. Writes false tags because of his grievances and thirst for revenge. Once I told him not to spread his flood in my topic, and after that he harbored a grudge against me and began to look for any reason to hook me somehow. In essence, a two-faced person who has double standards. What he condemns in others, he gladly does himself. On the forum, he showed himself as someone who does not know how to protect his digital property, so his account was hacked. He is also a plagiarist who managed to escape punishment because no one noticed him. Trust abuser: I think it's not something I will judge, others will see what I do.Writes false tags: Even if I did, your reasons were weak. Well, I will leave it to others.Once I told him not to spread his flood in my topic, and after that he harbored a grudge against me and began to look for any reason to hook me somehow: Is this a personal note for yourself?two-faced person who has double standards: I will leave it to others. Your heart and mouth is already salty to have a fair opinion.On the forum, he showed himself as someone who does not know how to protect his digital property, so his account was hacked: LOL, so this is another personal note for yourself. Is this can be even be something to add in a feedback?a plagiarist: Now, while I have no arguments with you with any of the above accusations you made against me because I understand it's coming from your salty heart, but this claim of me being a plagiarist? You really need to bring some reference in the next 24 hours. I have a long years with this forum, eight years. If my brain cells are properly storing memories and if I have not lost a little part of the storage then I can not remember, I even ever needed plagiarism. I was not or never needed to be merit whore because I never needed merit to rank up. If you fail to bring an evidence then know that your mother once was in my bed when I needed someone to suck my dick. She was outstanding in the job and made me so excited that I fucked her hard and made her pregnant. And you are that son of the bitch. What else I can expect when the whore only received $10",

Yes, I guess we all know how he started in the forum. At that time many members were agreeing that those were plagiarism until he fixed [updated the topics] with reference links. Before it was like he copied, translated, no credit given to the source. Even in one article he was making it such a way that others were easily taking it as his own creation. QuoteWhy would you think he's doing them for merit?He needed those merit whoring to rank up. And who have forgotten his topics about praising himself for every rank he achieved, every little milestones, anything that had a slight possibility to get some merits. The reputation board became boring to see he congratulating himself. At some point it was too much that I think I felt [others too] that we need a dedicated thread for celebrating achievements.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on March 26, 2022, 08:31:48 AMI think I had enough of these common topics like \"Finally a member/full member/hero/legendary\", \"xday/xmonth/xyear legendary\", \"x is finally a member/full member/hero/legendary now\", \"1k/2k/3k/..../nk merit club\", \"one/two/three/n milestones achieved\", \"I am now member/full member/hero/legendary\", \"From beginner to member/full member/hero/legendary in x days\", \"Got my 1st/2nd/3rd/.../nth badge\", \"celebrating 1year/2years/3years/.../n years\", \"My/his/their contribution to the forum\", \"x men forum guide list\" the list is way too long!QuoteI don't see how merit would have any value to him considering his account status.  Sig spammer would be a more logical accusation but he obviously puts a lot of effort into putting those long posts together, and they seem to add value to the forum - especially relative to others that attempt to make posts like his, and it seems like he sites all his sources.He does not need that now, I agree here. But that does not mean he was not a merit whore. He cited those sources after he was accused for plagiarism, not before that. QuoteMaybe I'm missing something, but it seems like you're the one out of line for attacking him as a \"merit whore\", and while he should of just ignored you, how about just cool it both of you?  This whole thing is stupid.I left the tag over one and half year or two years ago. Even I wanted to shake the hand in the new year by unignoring him but he kept his salty mouth. You can read details in the last post. If he was forgetting it and wanted to shake the hand then I don't think after all these months he would go and write a feedback on my trust page. I understand it is a neutral but he indeed accused me for a lot of things. So he re-started it if you think I started it by saying merit whole long ago.The goal of this topic is to find out where I plagiarized. I am still waiting for him to prove the accusation of plagiarism that I did. But it seems he is trying to skip it or by now we would see he was posting something that shows I plagiarized. This is proving that he is a LIAR too and it was a planned lie. A whore is a whore, no wonder he lied.I think the title of this post is perfect now.",

The last time I answered to one of Pytagoraz's posts, I urged him to avoid the reputation board because it is the wrong place for him to begin his journey.

The reputation board is the new PM; most users prefer to vent their frustrations here rather than in the PM. They would rather be noisy and invite everyone inside their business. I've been watching both of them for a long time, and I'm not sure any of them is ready to let go of their broken relationship. I'll say it again: neutral tags should never be used as a personal note, which is exactly what both of you are doing right now.

Microsoft Treasury experts will serve as advisors and initial test clients, establishing the first Microsoft Azure-powered blockchain transaction between a major corporate treasury and financial institution.“By working with Bank of America Merrill Lynch on cloud-based blockchain technology, we aim to increase efficiency and reduce risk in our own treasury operations,” said Amy Hood, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Microsoft. “Businesses across the globe – including Microsoft – are undergoing digital transformation to grow, compete, and be more agile, and we see significant potential for blockchain to drive this transformation.”Currently, underlying trade finance processes are highly manual, time-consuming and costly. With blockchain, processes can be digitized and automated, transaction settlement times shortened, and business logic applied to related data, creating a host of potential benefits for businesses and financial institutions including: more predictable working capital, reduced counterparty risk, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced audit transparency, among other benefits.“The potential benefits of blockchain will help drive meaningful supply chain efficiencies to the clients of both Microsoft and the bank. This project is another example of our continued commitment to introduce financial innovations for the betterment of global commerce,” said Ather Williams, head of Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  “We are excited to be working with Microsoft on this groundbreaking blockchain proof of concept that has the potential to help redefine, digitize, and improve how trade finance instruments are executed today,” said Percy Batliwalla, head of Global Trade and Supply Chain Finance at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Microsoft Azure Blockchain as a Service was first introduced in November 2015. The global scale, hybrid cloud capabilities, extensive compliance certification portfolio, and enterprise-proven security of Azure provide businesses with confidence and choice, especially in highly regulated industries like financial services, health care and government. More than 80 percent of the world’s largest banks are Azure customers. Furthermore, more than 75 percent of the global systemically important financial institutions are using Azure, representing the highest bar for legal, compliance, security and acquisitions teams.Development and testing of the initial application, built to optimize the standby letter of credit process, is currently in progress. The Microsoft and Bank of America Merrill Lynch teams will demonstrate the technology at Sibos in Geneva, Switzerland. Following the initial development and testing, the teams will work to refine the technology and evaluate applications to include more complex use cases and additional financial instruments.Original:https://news.microsoft.com/2016/09/27/microsoft-and-bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-collaborate-to-transform-trade-finance-transacting-with-azure-blockchain-as-a-service/Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on January 26, 2018, 05:49:09 PMRules, Terms Conditions:2: During this period you must make a minimum of 10 Posts per Week in order to be considered eligible.3: Only Posts that are useful and constructive will be eligible towards the 15 Post goal.

She was outstanding in the job and made me so excited that I fucked her hard and made her pregnant. And you are that son of the bitch. What else I can expect when the whore only received $10You're wrong, you don't have a dick, instead of a dick you have a big hairy cunt that you've been fucked in all your life. Go fuck yourself, you piece of cocksucker. The desire to fuck someone's moms indicates the patient has an oedipal complex. See a doctor, motherfucker. You are much better than this Ratimov, you do not need to resort to profanities. You have contributed immensely to the forum and your contributions are documented for all to see. The OP is a vindictive attention-seeker who does not deserve your time therefore add him to your ignore list. Only read his posts when others quote them and only if they catch your eye because that is what he deserves. Anyway you will not be missing much by not reading his posts. This forum does not need individuals such as the OP who base the majority of their tenure here on drama and politics and continue trying to make themselves relevant (as though they have some sort of authority when in reality they have none) but it does need quality contributors such as yourself. He uses every opportunity against me to either create threads or makes posts asking members to distrust me. I have received some disgusting words and attitude from the OP but I have never retaliated with profanities. He is on my ignore list where he belongs along with several others. He is someone who cannot contribute positively to the forum in literally any capacity, unfortunately that is the low calibre of person you are dealing with. Having said that, keeping in mind all that previous trolling and pathetic behaviour the OP conducted towards me (with his fellow trolls), I did not resort to profanities and you should not do that too.Ratimov, you are better than that therefore do not lower yourself to his level of being in the gutter. The OP can only dream of contributing to the forum in the positive and helpful ways that you have. Just ignore him and move forward in your forum journey.",

After that, just ignore each other.I think this will be the most optimal, reasonable and correct decision for everyone. Personally, all these conflicts and their discussion are not interesting to me at all.I'm waiting for a response from the OP regarding my proposal.Why don't you start by removing your tags off his profile, as you initiated the idea while waiting for the OP's opinion? I'm sure he'd like to put a stop to this drama as well. Both of you have contributed to the forum in some capacity, and neither of you is better than the other.",
