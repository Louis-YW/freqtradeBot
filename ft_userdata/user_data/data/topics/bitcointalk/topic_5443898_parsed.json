Project owners themselves approach these exchange platform, learn requirement to be listed on the platforms, fulfill the conditions for listings and then the listing will be set up and announced by the exchange and the project themselves. This is common when it comes to listing in centralized exchange platforms.2. If its a dex listing, it is common knowledge that project owners themselves add up LP to the dex to enable trading; example of decentralized exchanges are uniswap, pancakeswap, quickswap, apeswap etc3. The 3rd method is voluntary, free listing which is done by centralized exchange platforms; i experienced this when the likes of optimism, aptos, dydx, uni tokens were launched; multiple cex listed them freely.Theses are the methods i can remember off hand; remember that you first have to approach the exchange before you can find out what and what not to do to get listed",

But what is always needed before talking to them is money and possibly a lot of money if you want reputable exchanges.Also, you can refer to decentralized exchanges, as far as I know, they are entirely free, unlike centralized exchanges. In another case, if your project is good enough for them, they will even invest in it and prioritize listing on their exchange. Like the projects invested by Binance Labs, most will be listed on Binance.",

Some commons steps are like, fill out an application form that requests information about the token, such as its name, ticker symbol, total supply, circulating supply, market cap, and more. then to ensure liquidity for the new token/coins, exchanges may work with market makers to provide buy and sell orders for the token on the exchange.Crypto exchanges often charge a fee for listing new tokens, which can vary widely depending on the exchange and the token's popularity.There may be additional requirements or criteria that exchanges use to evaluate new token listings depends on the exchanges",

You may inquire about these exchanges to know what are factors to be considered aside just by paying the listing fee. I agree with ryza that those shitty exchanges don't really require a lot, as long as they're there to pay for the listing fee and they're good with it. There's no sense for those exchanges because they have no standard for those projects that wants to get into their market. And those exchanges usually have the shitiest tokens and coins ever listed on their platform, projects that are there won't take long to survive the market though.",

And for some reasons they rejected it, then obviously, you don't have to pay that huge amount.For other exchanges, like lower tier, it might be that they don't require any amount or at least not that huge amount to begin with.It's business after all, everyone need to make money out of this market.",

First of all some of the new upcoming projects have received investments from the exchanges itself f.e. from biance labs, kucoin labs or from coinbase for example. So with projects like that is almost certain that they will be listed on the exchange where they have received an investment from. I could imagine though that you have a really hard time to get listed on a big exchange if you are a new and small project without much volume.",

Well, some exchanges didn’t mind that much as long as you pay for the fees and that’s why many get listed easily, and as you can see those tokens who get listed at small exchanges don’t have much volume.",

But for clearer conditions, you can reach or approach their support related to the token listing.",

Getting listed is one of the basis of many investor for a successful project, though its too bad to see many still get delisted on exchanges but I guess that’s how the tough the competition is and this is also why many opted to get listed on DEX instead.",

If you will ask some exchanges they will provide you the complete details and requirements to get listed and I think there’s no free listing in CEX but i’m not sure with DEX since some can easily create a fake token in some DED. Listing is a big challenge to every new project, you should assess this first on where to list before making any decision, because this can be very expensive.",

You also need to indicate if your pertaining to centralized or decentralized exchange.
