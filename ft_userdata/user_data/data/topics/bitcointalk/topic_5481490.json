Bitcoin has come to revolutionize the finance industry, empowering everyone to assume full control of their assets and become their own bank.Quote from: Victorybit1 on January 13, 2024, 08:46:15 PM2: In bitcoin, you have full control of your financial assets. You have ownership to your private keys which is not always available in our normal banking.I think bank users also have private keys in the form of a short pin. In normal banking, we also have private pins used to access funds in our accounts, but we often entrust them to a third party during transactions. Examples include payment networks like PayPal and Visa, which act as third parties receiving the input of our private pin during transactions. But having full control of your asset is never guaranteed.Quote from: Victorybit1 on January 13, 2024, 08:46:15 PM5: When there is currency devaluation, one can use Bitcoin to protect their wealth even though there is risk of price volatility.Well, I don't think everyone would want to try this, knowing how volatile Bitcoin is. Certainly, we often experience currency devaluation in many countries, but that doesn't mean we should convert all our wealth to Bitcoin, which can be very risky.",

Ignorance shouldn't prevent you from investing in Bitcoin. Read, research, and gather all the knowledge you need to know about it here.Bitcoin investment is never too late, even if it seems late because of the current price. You can always find a way to invest in it, especially in holdings. You can do DCA, where you can buy a portion of bitcoin in a certain period of time, for example, every week, depending on the financial stability of the investors. I also enter a late year in bitcoin, in 2020. I am discouraged when I see the high price of bitcoin, but the thing is, I didn't stop investing. I kept on learning and finding a way to earn in bitcoin, and it didn't go wrong because I discovered a lot of ways to earn and it came out fine because until now I can earn on my own, I can earn through my knowledge and experience. So bitcoin investment will never be too late; you just have to find a way to earn it. It's up to you on how resourceful you are.",

The rest can be gotten from other investment or currency that ain't Bitcoin. Not only Bitcoin can give you the privilege of having borderless transaction and all digital currencies works with a smartphone or device just as Bitcoin does. What makes Bitcoin different and unique is that when you make investment in Bitcoin you aren't just investing in a currency but an asset that stores the value of your money. Investing in Bitcoin is taking a steps to protect your wealth against inflation. You're putting yourself incharge of your finances when you invest in Bitcoin and those are some benefits that should make you involve yourself in the industry.QuoteFor any individual who has not invested in Bitcoin, I would advise you to give it a try. Ignorance shouldn't prevent you from investing in Bitcoin. Read, research, and gather all the knowledge you need to know about it here.When you see a developing technology or investment and refuse to put yourself in a position to benefits from that new innovation, you aren't doing anybody but yourself. What could possibly go wrong when you invest in Bitcoin, let say the industry doesn't succeed the worst that can happen is that you lose the money that you have invested but what if the industry becomes bigger than what it is currently and you're not part of it. This makes you to miss out on a chance to change your financial story. You have nothing to lose when you invest in Bitcoin, just don't invest above your limit so you don't lose more than you can afford to lose if things were to go sideways which is so unlikely to happen.",

As, one can’t go ahead talking about benefits on some commodity that you don’t possess. Of course you might find them on some piece of material somewhere but, nothing talks about benefits more than when you’ve got that commodity in your possession and experience it first hand.Quote1: With just your smartphone you can carry out financial services.4: As a business owner or an entrepreneur one can accept payment in Bitcoin.  5: When there is currency devaluation, one can use Bitcoin to protect their wealth even though there is risk of price volatility.It’s important that you recognize the relations between volatility as to Bitcoin with regards to what inflation is to fiat so, if you know how to manage it, then you could as well know how to set your priorities.Eventually, options one and four aren’t exactly an exclusive benefit, they are things that are shared in common with fiat and that doesn’t make it anything special. Fiats can be accepted as means of exchange, digitally or even using CBDC and it all that could be done on a smart device as well.",

This is common in any other cryptocurrencies not just Bitcoin alone. even with fiat you can still carry out your financial services with just your smart phone depending the type of transaction you wish to carry out. so it is too in Bitcoin so it's a common feature now. Quote from: Victorybit1 on January 13, 2024, 08:46:15 PM3: As freelancer who works online, you can use bitcoin to facilitate some of your transactions.4: As a business owner or an entrepreneur one can accept payment in Bitcoin.   This common in every other cryptocurrencies, though was all brought in place through Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency. but it's no longer a special feature of Bitcoin because Altcoins (shitcoins) can do so even too. Quote from: Victorybit1 on January 13, 2024, 08:46:15 PM2: In bitcoin, you have full control of your financial assets. You have ownership to your private keys which is not always available in our normal banking.  This is one of the major aim Satoshi Nakamoto for creating bitcoin. For years we have been or are still under the control of some few people who calls themselves governments who practically controls every part of our life with the printing of fiats. hence Bitcoin was initiated to free us from central control of the government through some agencies like banks. Quote from: Victorybit1 on January 13, 2024, 08:46:15 PM5: When there is currency devaluation, one can use Bitcoin to protect their wealth even though there is risk of price volatility.  I'm very much delighted with this about Bitcoin, because the rate of inflation in good and services has lead to deflation in our fiat (local currencies) which is also caused by the countless printing of fiats(money). The risk which is posed by volatility is what most of us have exploit and it's not longer seen as a risk rather an investment opportunity in Bitcoin.",
