My first bet and first win was a game given to me in the dream. I never believed it so I had to play with small amount of money and got very outrageous winning in a jackpot. This was even what lured me into gambling.Although, psychic betting works but it also has its weak side because it is not always 100% accurate. Another thing is that our curiosity can give us false images that can be erroneously interpreted. Finally, I believe its a special gift... there are people whose their's work while there are those whose their's tale the opposite.",

If those predictions only occured once or twice then we can believe them to be just mere coincidence or they guessed correctly. But that's not the case here, these are multiple occurrences, we hear reports all the time about these psychic predictions and how they prove to be true, you can't just decide not to believe in those occurrences simply because you tell yourself not to believe in superstitions or maybe your religion speaks against such beliefs.Back when I was in College, around my second year, I also had a dream where I saw that a team called monchengladbach won their game against their opponents. I e never heard about the team before not until I woke up and looked them up and saw there was a team like that and they had a game the next day. That was more than just a coincidence, I've heard about people seeing predictions in their dreams, I felt thise was mine. Back then I had not even stated gambling. That was my first gamble ever. The next day I told a few friends about it and asked anyone who was interested to join me but they all disregarded it and didn't join me, only one of them secretly went to stake the game without telling anyone. I used my savings which was over $300 and to stake the game, although their odds of winning the game was very slim but it didn't scare me. I staked the game and they did actually win the match and I made over $1k that day and everyone who didn't join regretted, and they nicknamed me Joseph the dreamer. I can never forget that experience, so if you ask me if I believe in psychic predictions, yes I do believe and I've also experienced it too.",

At first these instances are just coincidence in my perspectibe but it is more likely has something to do with luck and is not something happening with our own likeness 'coz if it is possible to do so, then many people should be rich by now. It could also be driven by frustration if you happened to keep on losing for a long period of time. One thing is for sure; manipulation is more likely to happen than with gamblers being psychic with their bets.",

Do you take these Psychic predictions seriously?For lottery number combinations then i do heard off with some winners specially on those 3 digit lottery type that they do able to dream up those number combinations and this is why they do really make out some betting on what they had dreamt out. This is something a kind of approach where those bettors would really be definitely do on which on the time that they have dream on something specially on numbers then they would be giving out some meaning. I dont believe that someone could easily memorize the numbers on their own dreams considering that dreams arent something that you could able to remember on, on the time that you wake up. This is something that really that unbelievable on this part but if they do won up jackpots because of this then i might say it is really just that coincidence or really just that those wins is reallyjust that meant for him/her.Speaking about placing up sports bet or something those events that would happen in the future like those situations then it is something that could really be learnt upor something that we could be able to make some research. This is why i dont really believe much when it comes to those psychic betting or whatsoever.",

And if you bet without using a certain technique or method to win, then there will only be defeat.And indeed, in some areas, for example, if this betting doesn't use mystical things, it feels like something is missing. And sometimes there are myths about being able to win the lottery or sports betting, sometimes they don't make sense.Personally, when it comes to this, I believe or don't believe it. I don't believe it because a fortune teller, psychic and shaman very rarely watches football shows and how could he possibly predict the outcome of a match if he had never seen a match before. And what makes me believe it is, but how come even without doing a long analysis, how come the guess is in line with the final result? I don't know, I don't quite understand this either.",

So it's either you believed them or not, sort of a superstitious believed as more of us gamblers are very superstitious individuals.So for me, this could be just mere coincidence, I mean it's a 50/50 chance that the animals might predict the correct winner.
