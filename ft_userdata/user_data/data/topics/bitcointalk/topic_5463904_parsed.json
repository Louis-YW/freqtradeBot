If this scenario indeed unfolds, I'm curious to know whom you're supporting to win.

Similarly, Crawford is also 5′ 8″. Considering this, there's potential for a compelling matchup between the two if Crawford undergoes effective training to develop his physique. While financial gain is undoubtedly a top priority for renowned boxers nowadays, let's admit it, we also have a strong desire to witness a showdown between Canelo and Crawford before either of them considers retiring.Both contenders have achieved the status of undisputed champions, guaranteeing another highly anticipated and sold-out fight. It's quite possible that this clash could even surpass the magnitude of Crawford's match against Spence in terms of attention and excitement.",

I agree, if that fight between Canelo and Crawford happened instead 2 years from now, Crawford might already catch up with Canelo with weight. I don't know what's the reason for Crawford changing his mind as before he ruled out fighting at over 154 lbs as he knows it's risky for him.Anyways, the fight is just a speculation and we don't know what will happen next. What if Jermell won instead? There will be a change right away in the supposed roadmap of these boxers. For now, after being an undisputed champion, Crawford should think twice before risking another fight on his career.",

I remember Manny Pacquiao when he fought Antonio Margarito, he didn't need some warm-up fight and he just simply and successfully beat the big guy in his comfortable weight zone.",

Just like when Pacman moved up in weight and was doubted, he ended up dominating. So, in this fight, the same unpredictability applies. Based on interviews, Crawford appears very confident that he can win. What's interesting is that people's speculations are evenly split. It's understandable since both fighters are great and still in their prime. Their upcoming match in the ring is sure to be a fireworks show.The most exciting aspect is that both fighters stand to earn an immense amount of money, given that this fight is expected to be a blockbuster.",

I know he can still dominate that weight class but it's much too soon for him to make that climb because aside from that fact that it's risky, that road is still relatively unknown for him.",

So, let's give him a chance. Canelo is a strong boxer; he once moved up after winning the undisputed championship, but he lost to Bivol. This was probably because he wasn't able to carry his power and speed. The same thing could happen to Crawford. However, that's the downside. But we never know what's going to happen. One thing is sure: this fight is going to attract the interest of the boxing community.",

By the way, he's also right that Charlo is more likely to lose rather than the other way around mainly in this scenario that Canelo is not yet on the sunset of his career.",

But yes, jumping towards three weight classes is a different discussion and Crawford haven't even know what it's like to fight at 154, what more if he will got 168 directly where he's more likely vulnerable against a guy like Canelo who's been around that weight class and dominating it for a couple of years now.What Crawford is doing right now is trying to get under Canelo's skin to make him agree with a fight with him while also selling it to the people to make a hype.",
