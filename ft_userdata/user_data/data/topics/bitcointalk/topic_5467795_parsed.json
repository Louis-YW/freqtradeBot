      "body": "I feel like this topic should be in the gambling discussion section. I am not going to argue whether gambling is bad or good. But I think everything depends on yourself. If you cannot control yourself, you should not gamble. Gambling addicts often do bad things to manage their gambling funds. They sell goods, they spend their entire salary on it, which is obviously not good. As a family member, you are also responsible for trying to stop gambling. Many gamblers destroyed their life and their family just because they were addicted and couldn't manage to control themselves from gambling. Take a lesson from your own family, and don't be addicted to anything. Any kind of addiction is bad for life.",

I hope you got a ton for your stash this coming bull run.  Break the chain and stay away from gambling then. It's not mandatory to actually get involved in casinos when you are into investing in BTC or joining this forum. There is certainly more to that in the trading section of this forum, you will learn what others do for a strategy.",

It depends on you will use gambling. If you have a low self control and impatient then gambling is really not for you.Gambling is design as source of entertainment through having a quick scheme profit by just playing games. You will enjoy playing if you are a responsible gambler that knows how to limit yourself. We have different level of self control so I disagree that your suggestion should be generalized.Maybe avoid gambling if you have a weak heart?",

Op ask yourself why did I start gambling? Or why did my dad start gambling? At mine point or another most of us got into gambling because we wanted to have a bit of fun and at the same time make little profit if we’re lucky but eventually our desire to earn more money took over and all we could think of was “how to earn passively from gambling” and that led to gambling addiction…What I’m trying to say is, gambling for fun is not bad the only time gambling becomes bad is when you’re unable to control yourself and all you can think of once you have your account opened is how to make x200 of the amount you started with that’s when gambling becomes a poison that slowly kills you. If you’re disciplined you’ll be able to participate in gambling activities and still live your life to the fullest but if you let greed take over that will be a different talk entirely.",

My point is that every risk can hurt someone and if the person does not apply any strategy to reduce the risk and build enough self control to know how much money to spare, they will lose out.People have lost trading and investing in bitcoin cause they did not start for the right reasons (they FOMOed it when they saw others making profits), or they did not gain enough knowledge before going in.- Jay -",

Gambling responsibly. You can ruin your life if you gaming irresponsibly too as to play games, you have to buy many items for playing. It's enough to ruin your life.Not only gambling requires you to spend money, gaming requires it too. If you let yourself addicted to anything, it is not good and can harm you and your life.

If your dad has always gambled his fortune, it's never too late for him to restrain his step and move on with his life; he just turned out to be an addict without even realising it. It's something that one could have avoided or that you talked him out of before it became this bad, but no time is too late, provided that there is life and he has the opportunity to rephrase his steps. On the aspect of investing in bitcoin, one needs to have that plan out and then work towards making that plan come true. If some people gather all the money they have wasted on gambling from day one and start accumulating bitcoin bit by bit from then until now, they will be amazed at what they could have achieved. It's just like a side conversation I had with a smoker a few weeks ago, where he was making a rough estimate of all the money he had spent on cigarettes and wondered if it could have been put to good use. He could have been a shop owner.",

I saw many people who gamble and they lose all their wealth. In the start, they get reward then this became  addiction of them. To leave gamble is very difficult who gambles in something. I saw many people who invested in Bitcoin and get high profit, mostly of them were invested in long term, they made their Empire. Bitcoin invested is safe if one learn the market strategies of Bitcoin, he should know the history of Bitcoin, knowledge is power. Many people invested in Bitcoin a lot of times and got high profit, and most of them bought a car, apartment and now thry have millions of Dollars in their account because they choose right choice to incest in btc.",

Gambling can really destroy someone’s life. Gambling was initially developed for a source of recreation by the rich people. But when middle class people started Gambling, they find it as a life changing source of income, and hence from here the addiction begins. This can’t be listed as the demerits of Bitcoins, as fiat gambling has also destroyed many lives. What we can do is learn to gamble in limit, or if possible quit gamble and do something which will involve skill rather than luck.",

If you want to make money, do not think about making it from gambling, choose the harder parts because they are the best ways, gambling is like a short cut to success, but was programmed to ruin your bank account.

It's good that you are here on this forum, trying to make some money and staying away from gambling. Gambling is an addiction, and so does gaming. If you combine both these addictions, the results will be devastating. Yes, the earning opportunity is in gambling, but the chances of losing your money are higher, and you have experienced this by observing your dad. As it is an addiction, gamblers do anything for that little dopamine pump. People will take loans from others to get into gambling again and again. At the end of the day, he will be bankrupt. Do not try gambling for the sake of fun. It is better to stay away from gambling at any cost.",
