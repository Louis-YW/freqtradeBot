Or you want to create a website were all regarding decentralized consensus-ness will be discussed. I want to create a small community of people that can be referenced for potential security risks associated with alternative consensus methods. I am not attached to what medium this is done through more so just looking for people that may be interested. Ideally something formatted similar to discord allows for easy casual chatting but I am not sure how the community feels about it at the moment so currently I am open to anything.",
