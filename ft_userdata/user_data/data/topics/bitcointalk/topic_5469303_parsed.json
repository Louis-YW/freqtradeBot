  "content": "A lady cried seriously after losing her money in sports bet gambling. Navigate to the image for more info ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ Gambling is not for the weak minded ones but for those who can withstand with the bad motion/feeling when it occurs. Any gambler that thinking to win always is not well prepared for the gambling space. As a Gambler, you have to prepare your mind that the game you are playing might favour you or against you and if the game against you, then you have to wear a thick skin to over come the lose. Gambling is not for butter and bread but for the better and the worst. So any of the above come to your way as a gambler, you take. No man/woman should cry for gambling though it is painful but you don't have to cry. The casino company never cry when you win. She would have known that gambling is not her loss is another person win and her win is another person loss. Casinos want you to loss and you want casinos to loss and that is how gambling game is. Many people don't understand gambling and all what they want is to play and win. And I believed that she didn't read the Ts of the casino and probably she was excited for the game and placed her bet and loss.This is the first time I am seeing a lady playing gamble in the public domain. Though I have been hearing but not seen. Well she should take heart, the matter how she cried the money will not come back again. What do you say about the Lady? Did she do well in the public? As I said, gambling is not your mate, take precautions.",

      "body": "That only shows how immature she is, crying because she lost in gambling makes it look like she wasn't aware of the risks of losing. I mean, that shouldn't hurt her, as both outcomes are normal in gambling, and no gambler wins all the time. That's why it's important to gamble with what you can afford to lose, so if you lose, it will not significantly affect your life. Crying over a loss means it has affected her life, and there might be more problems related to that, such as not having enough money for survival, which is a big challenge.Gambling does not discriminate based on gender. As long as you are mature and responsible, you should be fine.",

Gamblers know it that it is risky between multiplier and losing what you have staked so it is not about terms. Every gambler has the innate orientation that you can lose the money or you can have more and that is why they are gambling.Quote from: Agbe on October 05, 2023, 01:49:09 PMThis is the first time I am seeing a lady playing gamble in the public domain. I have witnessed female gamblers alot but maybe not going on social media and crying. She probably would have another agenda in her mind, like to trend for the moment on social media or to get sympathy from the public for refund or part of it. All those are possible but also difficult to refund a gambler except she threatens to commit suicide.",

I just hope the lady has acted maturely than showing the world how immature she is. Probably she's one of those people who believe that gambling will make you profitable instantly, but in reality gambling will make you doomed especially if you don't know how to deal with its risk.",

Accepting that they play the game and the outcome is not depending on their gender, colour or any other bullshit parameter.I would take the above with a grain of salt, a lot of shit gets posted on social media, some are true some may not be. Of course gambling is bad if one is not clever enough to understand it, but crafty manipulators exist too.",

It's crazy how they need to post these things on social media instead of taking the loss on the chin and take accountability silently.Sorry to say but she's dumb, lacking the basic survival skills, never learned to face consequences of her actions. The same people have a child and then find out they don't have enough money to raise it, or drive drunk and suddenly have to face losing license and getting fined, then they start crying. I don't feel any remorse reading these stories. I'm not heartless, but it's one thing to have an accident, or lose money because you got drunk and got robbed. When you bet money you do it willingly and there's always a chance to lose it. If you don't understand it, you're unfit to live in the modern world, just like people who steal and cry when they have to go to jail for it.",

As I said, gambling is not your mate, take precautions.Gambling is for those who can afford losing money and are conscious about this possibility. About the lady, I think she is trying to sensibilize the audience to feel bad as well for her loss. I don't know if the post involves donation request from viewers, but that is not uncommon when people post videos and stories like that, especially when it comes with a sad background of needing the money for daily expenses, to feed children or to pay for health treatments or medicines.I can't say if she is right by posting it to the public, because maybe she felt she needed doing this in order to feel better and overcome the loss she faced. If that was good for her, who am I to blame this attitude? I just hope she has learned with the mistake and won't repeat it again futurely.",

Crying on the internet about your gambling problem doesn't fix the problem. She's just overwhelmed with guilt and pain. I know she'll be back to sports bet next day to recover her losses.",

The first rule of good gambling is to only bet money you can afford to lose. I usually bet between 0.01% and 0.05% of my monthly income and obviously those things don't happen to me. The point is not that gambling is not your mate, it's that you have to be aware of what it is and follow some basic rules so you don't end up like her or worse: the above mentioned, only bet what you can afford to lose, consider it as entertainment, never think that it will be a good way to win money, on the contrary, and things like that.

It is important for people before gambling to understand the risks, don't think that gambling can make us rich. that was a mistake",

Who will pay for the money you willingly bet on? Maybe he was not informed how risky the kind of bet he wanted to play.This lady is not different from the man I saw a video online, she is looking for sympathy just maybe online non government organizations will come to her aid for her own decision, if she has won that bet, people will not hear anything from her but not that the bet went hay, she is crying for sympathy.",
