  "content": "Hello community,does anyone know a Keyhunt-CUDA version that is able to read a file that has a hexkey per line and searches this list sequentially?Example:unordered.lst is a 500MB file and contains a private key per line in hexadecimal form. Now Keyhunt-Cuda should read this file instead of a range and process it sequentially, e.g:./KeyHunt-Cuda -t 0 -g -m address --keylist privkey.lst 123btcaddress...but it should also be possible to specify several wallet addresses using the \"-m addresses\" switch, e.g:./KeyHunt-Cuda -t 0 -g -m addresses --keylist privkey.lst walletaddress.lstDoes anyone know of such a modified KeyHunt-Cuda version that may already exist? Or is someone able to implement this modification in the latest KeyHunt-Cuda version? I look forward to constructive feedback and wish you all a nice weekend.",

So what has changed since? you are either a beggar or a hypocrite or both.But I do like to see improvements on brute force tools, so lets see who is willing to help here.üòâ",

Thank you.I hope 10^18 is just a number because even with a GPU turning 12M/sec it would take 26 years to complete the list. Wow!But I now know what you are after. I don‚Äôt think it exists, but would need some mod work with reading a file and mod work with the next key function.",

      "body": "Hello,I use keyhunt-cuda, but there is a problem with it that it cannot remember where it has reached and when reset or crashed it has to start from the beginning.I would like to divide, let's say, the 68th puzzle range into very small parts and have keyhunt-cuda take it one by one or randomly. I see that there are many pools with developed software, but I want to work for myself.So my question is: Does anyone know if there is a ready-made open source software for keyhunt cuda, which is used by hundreds of pools for shared search for keys for the puzzles. Or at least a python script.Thanks in advance.",
