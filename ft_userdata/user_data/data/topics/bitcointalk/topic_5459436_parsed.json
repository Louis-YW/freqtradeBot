Looking at this pie chart, even with perfect vision is difficult to visualise the correct label for each slice of the pie.As probably 8% of the population has some kind of colour blindness (8% of the total male population, hence the 8% of the forum population), that graph becomes absolutely unintelligible to them.The users will have to look on both sides to identify the merit stats along with this colour issue.Like in his chart he should have mentioned the user in the each piece with numbers outside instead of creating separate list with those mixed up colour stats.You represent monthly reports and make these charts regularly but yes members should be selective in colour combination while making these graphs to cater all the audience.",
