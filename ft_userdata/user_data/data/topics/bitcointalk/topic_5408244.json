I do not recall hearing anything about this before. I admit, I have never used BET365, but as far as I know, it is a very popular bookmaker.There's a lot of gamblers who talked about this site here, and there's no accusation yet about becoming a scam not unless you can provide proof with regards to this one. This is one of the good option for Chinese bookmakers, they have no KYC but if this rumors is true, better not to try anymore and just go for other option OP. Try also a crypto gambling site that allows Chinese gamblers since we all know, there's a current restriction in your country and you might experience a problem if you still try to avoid it.",

You can try 747bet.com (if it still works) since IIRC it has no KYC and no restrictions whatsoever. I'm also not sure whether they are a legitimate site (only recommended by a friend) so be extra careful when dealing with such bookies.",

Any form of gambling by Chinese citizens, including online-gambling, gambling overseas, opening casinos overseas to attract citizens of China as primary customers, is considered illegal.This basically means gambling in China is not legal. Also, crypto in China is illegal. If China is hostile to crypto and gambling, I do not think we should discuss anything related in favour of that.

Look at their ann thread[1], there are lot of complains regarding withdrawals. The OP/representative doesn't do much to at least reply the claims although he is right since he's just doing posting announcement on the ann thread. About the Chinese site, I guess it operates illegally, well, only against its country (i guess if they are accepting crypto payments). [1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5355326.200",

With all the reputable sites out there, I don't understand why people go to all this trouble. I guess maybe because he was looking for casinos without KYC.He could have checked here:Information of Crypto Casinos License and KYC requirementsMost reputable casinos have KYC requirements, but there are some on that list without KYC that he could have chosen. And of those that do have KYC requirements, some are above certain levels, so if he doesn't gamble a lot he could have played at those casinos without KYC.",
