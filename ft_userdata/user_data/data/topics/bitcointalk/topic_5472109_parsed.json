Just look at my history. You won't be sorry of buying it. Passport 2 has the solid case with the metal inner frame.  The plastic around this frame  is thick and doesn't look like the cheap stuff. The back lid which coves battery compartment is a tight-fitting cap hold by  small but strong  magnets. I like such design.Quote from: Charles-Tim on October 29, 2023, 06:11:46 PMIf you are a fan of signing your transaction with QR code, passport is the best option of hardware wallet that you can go for.

Sparrow has been a good alternative to Electum. It is better if it is used with Sparrow because to be inserting microSD card into computer and Passport hardware wallet device would be annoying, and I prefer QR code which is malware resistant. Probably the problem is from Electrum not supporting blockchain commons' UR1.0 or UR2.0 standard for splitting data into multiple QR codes. I saw a complaint about it which has been since 2021:https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport-firmware/issues/3",

Pairing and further communication via QR code is also my preference when working with Passport 2, however I don't think that QR generated, let's say Sparrow is  malware resistant. If Sparrow is compromised malware is capable to substitute genuine QR code by inserting , for instance, the false destination  address for payment. Thus it is always better to check twice the details of transaction you have to  sign with Passport device.",

A QR code is just a graphical representation (in the form of a code) of an address). If the address represented in the code is correct, so is the QR code.

If it's wrong, you would be scanning the wrong address. As satscraper mentioned, nothing beats checking and double-checking everything manually before confirming a transaction. QR code offers a better means of signing PBST (I mean unsigned transactions), which is far more secure. QR code is resistant to malware in the sense that you do not have to copy anything to clipboard to paste. Clipboard malware can change the address to a hackers address, but if nothing is copied to clipboard but displayed directly, no address will change to a hacker's address.If going for the most secure way, that does not mean someone should not still be careful. If I want to make bitcoin transaction, I check some first few characters, some middle characters and the last 5 characters. That is how I have been doing it.",

Clipboard malware can change the address to a hackers address, but if nothing is copied to clipboard but displayed directly, no address will change to a hacker's address. Perhaps new generation crypto-malware will have the capability to attack certain wallets directly and not replace an address in the clipboard. An infected wallet will show the wrong address in the software (addresses tab, new receiving addresses, etc.). Perhaps it's going to be a type of master public key replacer instead of a clipboard malware that replaces your zpub with another one. In that case, you would scan the wrong address and notice the difference on the hardware wallet screen if you check it.",

Perhaps it's going to be a type of master public key replacer instead of a clipboard malware that replaces your zpub with another one.Malware can affect the clipboard, it can monitor the screen, it can be a keylogger and the likes, but I do not think there would be a malware that can affect a wallet directly in this way unless the vulnerability is added to the wallet's code. If you download the right wallet after you verify the PGP key, I do not think this would be possible. But best to always avoid malware.If it is about Passport wallet, do not forget that the wallet on desktops is a watch-only wallet. If it is an unsigned transaction from the senders desktop wallet and it is still QR code, it can not be manipulated. What I think more about this is clipboard malware which is not possible if QR code is used.Quote from: Pmalek on October 31, 2023, 04:56:19 PMIn that case, you would scan the wrong address and notice the difference on the hardware wallet screen if you check it.It is true that the address should be rechecked.",
