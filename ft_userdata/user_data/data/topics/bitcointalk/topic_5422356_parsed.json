I’m just skeptical because they are converting the confiscated Ethereum into renBTC if they are just seizing all FTX asset. Why do they need to that while they are already holding the control to the funds. They should just convert it to fiat if they want to liquidate it immediately instead of converting the Eth to different tokens for whatever purposes. If this is really Bahamas government doing, I’m really confused on what they are trying to do here.",

If this is really Bahamas government doing, I’m really confused on what they are trying to do here.Yes I think a lot of us are confused by this. I assume since they have confirmed that it is not a hack and they are seizing the assets a explanation will be given on why they converted it to ETH 1st some people are discussing it in another topic but it is all speculation. It does not make sense but I am not from Bahamas so it might be for a reason that only people from the country would know. I doubt it is anything skeptical because the world is watching this happen and they have already claimed to be seizing the assets.",

Think people are already hedging on this outcome, regardless of who really is behind that bag.Definitely nice to think a state makes these calculations but the choice to not just sit on it suggests someone knowing what they are doing (or calculating a gamble).",

How is it possible that 1/3 was stolen and the rest went to the government? So the theft of funds happened at the same time as the hacker attack? I thought people stopped believing in hacking a long time ago. And one more point - why is the government exchanging these assets? I thought they had no right to exchange cryptocurrency.",

Meanwhile, FTX is also not an official token of the FTX exchange. I don't think FTX Bahamas is a coin from FTX, so it doesn't affect the price reduction of FTX or FTT. The official token of the FTX exchange is FTT.",

Quote from: Beparanf on November 20, 2022, 03:47:56 PMWill the hacker will hold or sold? As for these hackers, I think that he won't sell as soon as possible. Even if he successfully mixed and laundered the money, he'll wait until the noise isn't too loud anymore. But he can't be sure if the trackers of the stolen funds will ever stop monitoring him. For sure, there have been people working to track that already closely.Quote from: Beparanf on November 20, 2022, 03:47:56 PMWhat will be the implications for hacker putting all the eyes now on Bitcoin by bringing the dirty money?I expect that there will be those no coiners telling, \"there you go, bitcoin is money from hacked funds and it's from the dark net/market\".",

Users likely have a multi-year fight ahead of them to try and recover anything they thought they owned. I have a feeling that this saga will be just forgotten, there are a lot of personalities, names of famous people popping up as somewhat either a investor or directly to connected to the project itself. And SBF himself is very influential with his family background so I doubt that this will just end like that, on the contrary it will drag for years and I would say that it can have some effect on the market.As for the \"hack\", it was admitted that the Government of the Bahamas has involved themselves and somewhat forced SBF to hand them the remaining funds.So for me this is not a hack per se.",

But selling for Bitcoin...? looks a bit suspicious to me....Not that I'd mind to see a government have more trust in bitcoin than fiat. Initially my first thought. I thought those seized funds will remain in the form that they were seized, and afterwards be sold to an auction after everything is clear and the sale has a green light. Not sure why they need to convert into something else when the crypto they seized is already usable and valuable as it is. Also, the price movement patterns of ETH and BTC isn't really that different from one another so I don't know what the intention on converting these coins in the first place.",

Lol.  Whoever is in control of those coins is def laundering them.  Why convert to BTC?  That's because BTC is easier to launder than ETH after the Tornado Cash debacle.  We can't even be sure anymore if the news about the coins held by the Bahamian government and the coins held by the hacker are the same thing.  It could all be smoke and mirrors at this point as there are some groups out there who want to steal it for themselves.What they could do is convert to renBTC, then to real BTC, deposit to lower tier exchanges and convert to XMR.  From there it could go anywhere.",

Most likely they are taking trades on these movements and that’s how they plan on profiting. Not cashing out which is risky.",

The first of these transactions was the conversion of 4,000 ether to wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), another token representing Bitcoin, and subsequently to renBTC.But these all are user funds over FTX exchange and the actual loss if for people not the exchange so just another warning for all why not your keys not your coins is perfect in these cases.",
