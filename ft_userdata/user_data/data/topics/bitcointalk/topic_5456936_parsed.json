The government and the SEC want to control the flow of Bitcoin and this is the strategy that they came out with. Through these ETFs both these companies would try to wipe out exchanges from the US. As of now, the government is unable to track transactions happening between Exchanges and wallets. After the ETFS of both these companies is approved the government would compel its citizens to invest in Bitcoin through the ETF, for that they need to fill in all the details on a paper. Through those papers, they would be able to track Bitcoin and gain control over it. To support my theory that exchanges would shut shop in the US. I would like to ask why SEC is backing up the Prometheum exchange. I had never heard of this exchange in the past. I came across this name 4 days back when I read this article. Everything about this exchange looks suspicious is grows more when SEC is backing it.",

There is a rumor going around that Fidelity is trying to buy Greyscale to be able to go for the 4.8 trillion ETF proposal, the future looks great for Bitcoin but none of these will matter if everything stayed a rumor and nothing is approved.",

The futures ETF was launched in the middle of the bitcoin's bull run and many people say that the run was cut short exactly because of that launch. When you give big investors, who never wanted to buy bitcoin in the first place, a chance to short it you can expect they'll take this chance. Bitcoin went from 20 to 60k in a few months of 2021, so it was obvious an asset that made 3x is going to be shorted by traditional investors who don't care about tech and want to make a quick buck. The main difference between futures and spot is that to launch spot they need to own some bitcoin, so if blackrock gets the SEC to approve the price will pump. How much we can only guess, but I'm sure we'll go above this years high, to the high 30s, or higher.",

      "body": "I guess we should get ready for two more ETF rejections later this year lol.These are I suppose the two biggest names yet to try to file a Bitcoin ETF, but as long as Gensler is head of the SEC I don't see any ETFs getting approved. Gensler hates Bitcoin and Crypto and wants to shut down the entire industry in America, no way his SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF which would help Bitcoin grow in America.There is a bill getting started in Congress right now that would fire Gensler and redistribute power in the SEC a bit more so the head of the SEC wouldn't have so much control. I don't know if there is much chance of it getting passed (I very much doubt it), but kicking Gensler out is the only way an ETF is gonna be approved in the next few years (his term expires in 2026). So realistically it'll probably be at least 4 years until an ETF gets approved in the US. Quote from: avikz on June 20, 2023, 02:52:37 PMI guess BlackRock has already received the approval for their bitcoin ETF where Coinbase is going to become their custodian.

I understand and appreciate the fact that a lot of liquidity will flow into the crypto market due to such ETFs. But who will ensure that they do not start manipulating the market? No Blackrock has not received approval. And they will not. The SEC will not approve a Bitcoin ETF, at least not for a few more years, they have made this very clear over the past 5 years.The head of the SEC hates bitcoin and crypto and wants to destroy the industry in America. There is zero chance of either of these ETF proposals being approved.And no, even when ETFs do start to happen, perhaps at earliest late in this decade, they cannot manipulate the market. ETFs mean customers buy the ETF and the financial firm buys Bitcoin to hold on the customers behalf in the ETF. There is no manipulation of the market possible. It would simply be another avenue for more traditional finance people to get Bitcoin (granted they won't actually own Bitcoin, like as in be able to use it, ETF means they would simply own shares in the ETF and the financial firm would store the BTC for them purely as an investment asset, never to actually be used). The only effect of ETFs would be more Bitcoin gets locked away and off the market, which obviously would be have a bullish impact for Bitcoin's price.",

Recent crackdowns against crypto and exchanges, the government going ham against people and entities who use cryptocurrencies in general, SEC taking actions against Binance, now even throwing the 'money laundering\" card even though they don't really have verifiable evidence and Binance pragmatically operates on full without problem which would've been a good indicator that something was awry to begin with. In any case, conspiracy or not I don't see this buyout as a win for the industry or for decentralization. They're vying for control that's for sure, and a large company doing that isn't going to sound well for the common joe.",
