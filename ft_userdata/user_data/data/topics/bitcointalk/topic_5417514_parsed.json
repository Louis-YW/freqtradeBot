So as a gambler you should be prepare for revealing your personal identity or going through verifications processes.I don't really see any laws holding you not to pass the verification process or maybe you are not wanting to gamble, most gambling site I have came across with always source for kyc details.",

Where can one gamble with zero verification requirements? Is the gambling site centralized? Most successful crypto gambling sites are centralized. That means you have to register on the site, the gambling site will give you address to pay in, they control the private keys of the addresses given you. Even if they do not ask for KYC at first place during deposit, they may ask for KYC when you want to withdraw, which is common to gambling sites. Even if you are not asked to KYC during withdrawal, they might block your account and ask for KYC at anytime which would be disappointing if you are not expecting that. The reason for KYC is for AML, CTF and to reduce other online criminal activities.",

      "body": "There are a few reasons why, from money laundering to age verification to prevention of multiple accounts to other probable reasons. The most important one though as to why they need to implement KYC is the country in which they're registered since each country has a specific law or rule about casinos, KYC being one of them. It's also the reason why some countries can't access some casinos, it's simply part of their law. Afaik it also considers the law about gambling that the user is under in. Some casinos don't require KYC, but some do. Here's a thread with a big list of casinos that indicate whether they have KYC or nothttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5381143.0",

Where can one gamble with zero verification requirements? In crypto casinos (except the ones where KYC is mandatory) it's not so important if you don't gamble with huge capital. I play in several casinos for years without any verifications, you only need a mail and google authenticator, in some casinos you need it for withdrawing. Maybe there are crypto casinos with zero KYC tolerance, but I am not sure about that. In ToS you will always find \"Casino reserves the right to ask for additional info if they suspect you are involved in something shady\"! As a fair player, without some big deposits/withdrawals, not even one casino asked me for additional verification... I play in casinos you can find on this forum, these casinos have their ANN threads so you can check them by yourself.",

Where can one gamble with zero verification requirements? It is not just important but it is also essential for regulatory purposes. Due to the emergence of the popularity of online gambling websites, the government took the opportunity to tax it for revenue purposes and regulation. The most regulation that they can implement is to mandate these online gambling websites to provide KYC identification to its users.If possible, operating without KYC is the ideal situation since most users consider this as a \"make or break\" feature but these companies have no other choice but to comply with strict regulations imposed by the government.",

Where can one gamble with zero verification requirements? Maybe you will not be asked to do KYC for the first time you join a casino site. But after you win some money and want to withdraw the winning money, you will be asked to do KYC, especially if the winning money is big. So KYC verification seems to have become common for crypto casinos due to the government's desire to regulate all fiat and crypto casinos. So forget about that and if you don't want to lose a lot of money, you should control the use of your money in gambling.",

They can freely to ask you \"KYC\" anytime, that's why never trust a casino who offering you \"NO KYC\". Because 95% of casino will ask you \"KYC\" based on term & condition.If you want \"Zero KYC\" without being ask, you should gamble with on-chain gambling.

It's a rather common hoax, but in reality this has nothing to do with regulation otherwise they would require it for every customers like exchanges are doing, and casinos without KYC wouldn't exist. Actually it's just a scammy practice to avoid paying winnings to players who managed to make some profits and to prevent them from opening a new account when they've banned them or restricted their account. If you are a bad player constantly losing his deposits, they will never ask you anything.There is an incomplete list of casinos that don't require KYC in this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5381143 Some are missing like Nitro betting though.",

And if we want to sue a casino we have to do it in that place which is almost impossible for 99% of the gamblers.A license doesn't makes me feel protected by the law, i prefer to trust on a provably fair engine than a licensed gambling site who doesn't give a verify option on their games.",

It will a good way to control money laundering because casinos are protecting their reputation against scammers and launderers. We might doubt it since we're going to provide our personal details but it will help us have assurance when it comes to security. It could stop illegal activities as well. Don't tell BS here, in the gambling section please. How KYC could be an assurance for customers? I don't understand. In the scam accusation section and here we always hear about scams from casino requiring KYC, while we never hear about scams from casino not asking KYC. When I play on Freebitcoin for example I feel safe because I know I will be able to withdraw my winnings without any issue while when I play on a casino that can require KYC, I don't feel that way at all because I guess they will ask me KYC if I win too much and they will maybe refuse my documents to keep my funds like many people are reporting all over the web.",
