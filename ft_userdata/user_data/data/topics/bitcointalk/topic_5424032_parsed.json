  "content": "Dear ENEX community, Holders, Investors, we are proud to announce that the ENEX.SPACE release is coming to the finish line! The launch will take place in two stages: Community release and Space launch.Community release will take place on block #4,671,196 in the Enecuum network — approximately on 30th of November at 10:00 AM UTC+0.It will have the basic features of the DeFi platform but without the Bridge between Enecuum and Ethereum-like or EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine)-like networks.After a while, Space launch will take place — after that all functionality will be available for ENEX.SPACE users.Let’s take a closer look at what will be available.Community releaseAlong with this release, the Enecuum network will be upgraded with the largest update since its launch. The new smart contracts will be implemented in the Pulse network, which will allow it to serve all the necessary functionality for ENEX.SPACE. What sections will be available? Let’s figure it out!SwapSwap is a simple way to exchange digital assets on the platform.For each swap operation, ENEX.SPACE charges a fixed transaction fee of 0.35% that is broken down as follows:0.30% is returned to the liquidity pool as a reward for liquidity providers working with it;0.05% will be burned until the Space Launch stageRead more about the Swap.PoolA Pool is a mechanism to reward users for providing liquidity to the DEX. A Pool can be created by any user of ENEX.SPACE. Alternatively, you can add liquidity to an existing pool.As long as you have a stake in the pool, that is, you have deposited an amount of liquidity into the pool, you will receive a reward from each trade in the pool. This reward, taken from the fee for the trade, is proportional to your liquidity share in the pool. Liquidity Providers receive Liquidity Provider (LP) Tokens according to the amount of liquidity provided. Read more…Top PairTop Pairs lists all token exchange pairs on the ENEX.SPACE DeFi platform, arranged by the total amount of liquidity.ETMVia ETM (Enecuum Token Machine), you can easily issue custom tokens on the Enecuum blockchain. Read more about ETM.Harvest FarmsHarvest Farms is a yield farming mechanism. Analogous to a traditional bank deposit for LP Tokens. Rewards are paid out in tokens set by the farm creator. A user can stake in a farm for a preset duration (determined in blocks).Space DropsSpace Drops are similar to Harvest Farms. But they allow you to earn rewards in any token as you stake any token too. Which token to stake and which will be a reward token is set by the Drop creator. Space Drops — is a place where projects can be introduced to the community!After the Community release is complete, we will begin to prepare for Space launch.Space launchIt is difficult to overestimate the importance of this update, because it is after this update that the full potential of the ENEX.SPACE DeFi platform will be unlocked. The Space launch will give the green light for liquidity from the Ethereum network. And it will also bring ENX token to the Enecuum network — which in turn will remove the last limits from the Platform. Features that will be available with Space Launch:Space bridgeWith this functionality, ENEX.SPACE users will be able to quickly and securely transfer assets between Enecuum and EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine)-like blockchains. At the first stage of implementation it will be possible to transfer tokens in both directions only between the Ethereum network and Enecuum network. Other EVM blockchains will be added in the near future.ENX token in Enecuum networkAfter the Space Bridge is launched, the ENX token will be available in the Enecuum network, which, in turn, will make it possible to launch the entire ENEX.SPACE functionality at 100%.StationThe rationale behind the Station, much as with Harvest Farms.When a transaction is performed on ENEX.SPACE, 0.05% of the transaction fee, in LP tokens, goes to the Commander ENEX Treasury Fund. If a user has a stake in a liquidity pool that holds both LP tokens and ENX tokens, he can call Distribute to trade the LP tokens in the pool for ENX and distribute them to the stakeholders of the pool, in proportion to their stakes. Learn more about the Station.SwapThe fees distribution will undergo a slight change:0.05% goes to the Station stakers via ENX at LP token pools driven by Station Distribution smart contact. For LP tokens without pools with ENX the fees are burnt.Space DropsThe logic of the work will be slightly changed. You will need to stake only ENX tokens to take a part in Space Drops. All Drops which will be created before the launch — will continue to work up to the block specified about the setting up.",
