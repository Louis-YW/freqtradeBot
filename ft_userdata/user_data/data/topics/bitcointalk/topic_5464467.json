We should bare in mind.1. Bitcoin investment could really be done via buying satoshis, even $1 per sats then you could still able to buy on exchange platforms or even p2p. So there     wont really be that kind of restriction.2. Government wont really be coming into a point on making crypto or Bitcoin as their main thing and letting citizens on making use of it. Its something   that totally opposes with their interest and something that isnt shocking.3. To those who are still skeptical would really be that able to miss out that money making opportunity excluding that benefits and utility then the only time    that they would consider out on buying is on the time that the market is experiencing bull run or hype. Ended up on buying on peaks and ended up on holding for another market cycle which would really be leading into that regret in the end.",

This could be the best time if you are already knowledgeable about the market, but if you are still new into this market I can say that its better to focus first on your learnings instead of rushing to buy Bitcoin. As long as you are ready to buy and hold Bitcoin you can enter the market any time at any price level, although buying during bear market is a good idea, I just want to emphasize the importance of having a good foundation and knowledge about cryptocurrency before you fully invest.",

But come to think of it $50k?  It would be nice to see if it gets to that amount before the end of this year.",

See it's as if Satoshi Nakamoto's got everything considered and in the bag, with the only problem involving scalability being the lack of solutions for network congestions. At the end of the day, bitcoin's value rising to that amounts shouldn't be anyone's worry. As a matter of fact it should be celebrated as it is a spitting testament that bitcoin has come so far.",

But still, $50k USD for 1 satoshi would mean that 1 BTC is worth some astronomic amount of value, probably larger than the whole global wealth. And there's 21 million bitcoins. So it's highly unlikely that Bitcoin subunits will ever be too large for representing value. That's even without Lightning Network.",

First things first, you need to understand that there are no minimum amount so you can buy bitcoin, because bitcoin is sold by fractions not necessarily the whole 1 bitcoin. So, no matter how much 1 bitcoin would cost in the future, poor people can still afford a few fractions they can keep as an investment. Secondly, some governments are already taking advantage of the benefit that bitcoin could give them in the future. Not to mention, there are countries already. And lastly,  the perfect time to invest in bitcoin is when you fully understand what bitcoin is, how it works, and how to make a good entry point. So, there are no specific price to determine when is the \"perfect\" time to have your own bitcoin.",
