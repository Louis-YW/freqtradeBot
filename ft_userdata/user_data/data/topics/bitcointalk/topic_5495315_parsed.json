This looks like an adoption, but looking at it, I think PayPal users who would purchase Bitcoin are those who already know and uses the currency.

      "body": "I think most of the US based Paypal users won't be interested in buying cryptocurrencies with Paypal. In US there has been many actions taken against crypto exchanges and platforms, that's why most people still consider crypto as a Ponzi scheme. Those who think that crypto market is part of a huge Ponzi scheme would never consider purchasing crypto currencies. On the other hand the ones who're already crypto users will also think twice before purchasing Bitcoin with their Paypal accounts.Some of those may fear high taxes while others may fear that in future their crypto currencies may get seized by government if a new bill is pass. I know a group of people who're learning about crypto currencies many purchase cryptocurrencies with their Paypal accounts but the number of such users is going to be very low.",

So this service is different from ETF where buyers don't control or have custody of their investment. However, this kind of service will help spread crypto awareness which can make more people buy the currency. Many people will always want centralized intermediaries to be part of their business transactions before they trust the system. I am not a fan of centralization but I appreciate any move that can make more people know about Bitcoin.",

Now it will be possible to do that according to the announcements. It's a great news if american users are really able to buy Bitcoins on Paypal and to use them and not to just buy and sell them on the same service as CFD, like some banking apps are offering. But I hope Paypal will extend this service to other countries soon.It's sad they still don't accept Dogecoins though while Elon Musk is one of the founders of Paypal.",

      "body": "I remember a few years ago when I read the news about Paypal accepting cryptocurrencies, it was news that people were happy with and it was expected that Paypal would later expand this option to more countries in the world. but unfortunately paypal did not expand this option to all the countries in which it operates and this meant that people no longer had high expectations and no longer gave more importance to what paypal is doing. To think that making this option only for people in the US would greatly increase the adoption of bitcoin, it seems to me that it would be very misleading. I can't keep asking every person in every country if they buy bitcoin using a bank accountbut even so I believe that people outside the US have been buying a lot of bitcoin using bank accounts and if paypal had provided the option for people from all over the world to buy bitcoin then we would have seen more impact on adoption, because even I would use paypal to buy bitcoin with my bank card if paypal had such an option. I don't think there are many people in the US using PayPal to buy bitcoin, they could be using other services like Coinbase, if I'm not wrong, PayPal would be competing with companies that are much better in this cryptocurrency market in the US. I highly doubt that anyone in the US would switch from using Coinbase to using Paypal when buying Bitcoin",
