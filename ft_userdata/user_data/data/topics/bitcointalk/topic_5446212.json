  "content": "It's not a matter of being grateful, but it's a matter of self-development and dreams in my life's journey to achieve my dreams.Initially I worked as an employee with sober results. The consequence is that I am able to make ends meet but it is difficult to fulfill \"wants\".Then I went to sell services, the result was not bad. The consequence is always dealing with a problem and having to solve that problem, which is not my problem.Then I turned to the world of MLM. The results are mediocre, because so far the distribution of \"profits\" in the MLM world has not been fair. The consequence is that I have to maintain my prestige, no matter what the conditions are, prestige is number 1, to the point where I don't even realize that I can't even afford to buy milk for my child.Then I turned to real business, the results were also not bad, but this is where my debts accumulated and the debt figures were fantastic in my opinion. The consequence is that when you fail to pay interest on debt, your existing assets are confiscated. Not to mention being exposed to member fraud and corruption, as a result I went bankrupt due to a lack of experience in managing a real business.Then I switched to the world of HYIP and BO. The results were extraordinary, but that's where I felt the extraordinary and endless ups and downs, Just being rich for a while, being scammed.Just prospered for a while, had to restart. The consequence is that when friends, colleagues or relatives come who initially worship us like gods because of smooth profits, when a scam occurs, everyone curses it out.It feels like I'm about to give up. Now I am very grateful to know this community, because now I can generate bitcoin coffers and certainly a lot of knowledge and insight that I get here with the right trading knowledge. I really enjoy being in this community because with this community I can collect bitcoins and with bitcoins my life has completely changed from before because bitcoin also taught me to dare to dream.",

      "body": "If there is one thing I have learned in this life, it's \"Never give up.\" Giving up is never an option in every situation. The decision that you made in your darkest moment is what has brought you this far. Their are really difficult times that one experiences when trying to put life in perspective. Sometimes we really consider giving up because of the current situation at hand; we think we can never make it through those situations, but as long as we keep on pushing with the little hope left in us, we find ourselves passing that very temptation and seeing the next day.Your experience is what makes you stronger, and have taught you alot about life.  You derived you hope from know Bitcoin which awakens your dream to achieve more, if you continue building your knowledge in the coming days you can also use your current financial status as a reference, because your life won't ever be stable, you can learn alot from here, earn why also learning, their are really large opportunities in here which one can earn from. My advice, regarding your trading exercise, is to always mind what you trade and the kind of market you involve yourself in; don't trade like a gambling addict; know when to call it a stop; and count your losses before it becomes too late.",

If you want to earn a lot of bitcoin, you must also have a lot of money or work hard. Just like any other business or investment, bitcoin is just a tool for you to use to make money. It is not giving you any profit you are making a profit yourself by using bitcoins efficiently. You are denying your efforts. And you are blaming others when your business fails, remember that today's billionaires are all traditional entrepreneurs and investors. They don't even need bitcoin to do it. You make money from bitcoin, it's the result you make, not bitcoin or anyone else.",

I am guessing you are saying that your experience with Bitcoin has led you to take more risks and try different approaches to reach your dream? Well, bitcoin doesn't teach that. You should now that all risks aren't the same. There are risks involved when investing in Bitcoin and other crypto currencies, but it isn't ask risky as joining a HYIP program. Those schemes in the long run are going to scam you, where as bitcoin in the long run will likely give you some nice profits. Better you focus on learning more about crypto currencies and look for strategies to invest in those currencies so you can minimize your risks.",

This community opened me up to a new investment and medium of exchange which is bitcoin. Since last year I have kept learning about this prestigious currency and the community has also helped in building my patience to keep my investment until it becomes profitable. Every bitcoin holder desires to see the price of bitcoin increase to the level where they can make a profit and this is my expectation. I have also learned not to put all my trust in bitcoin because like every other investment there is a percentage of risk attached to it. Bitcoin can indeed make dreams come through but we must also be prepared for the unknown.Thank you @OP for teaching me that even if our dreams fail to come through, there are still greater opportunities to dream again.

As a newbie, I used to get into these types of investments, and I made a lot of profits initially, but because of ignorance and greed, I could not keep anything. In my opinion, BO is a form of gambling, not an investment, BO is an acronym for Binary Option, aka Binary Options Trading.",
