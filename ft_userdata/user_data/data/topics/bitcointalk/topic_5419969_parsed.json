  "content": "Interested in mining bitcoin at home, I know that isn´t profitable like some years ago, but it´s an experience that I would like to live during my bitcoin journey.What´s the process to mining bitcoin? Do I need an ASICs? Can I do it just with my computer? How this works, I need to go to some specific website to generate bitcoins?I'm new in bitcoin mining, so if someone can explain it to me or send me some tutorial will be great, because I have a lot of doubts and questions.",

      "body": "Well, 1st  start hereAs stated in that ^^, BTC mining requires using ASIC-based miners. Period.Be aware that most miners are very power hungry - as in several kw - and all of that power is transformed into a lot of heat and noise from the fans cooling them. Think a high power space heater.Because of the power needed you MUST have very low cost electric power, at least 210VAC and it must be stable.For much quieter/affordable/but slower miners there are the ComPac-F USB sticks from Sidehackand the faster Futurebit Apollo miner & Node hereAnother good place to start is the Beginners & Help section.",

You could mine with your CPU just to experiment.If you don't have access to cheap/free electricity and intend to run a little mining farm, just don't mine. Unfortunately circumstances would be not good for you. You would be burning more and more money every day and you will very unlikely help decentralization.Generally speaking, If you have the resources and access to brand new machines, then mining is always profitable. If mining is not profitable -> miners turn down machines -> difficulty go down -> mining is profitable again.However, as you can see, bitcoin hashrate is hitting new highs every day. Profitability today is reaching new and new lows every day. This is due to technological dissemination. Every day better machines are created. This is never ever stopping, which leads to small mining operations failing.If you live in a cold country, you could use bitcoin miners to heat your house. This way you'd be yield positive regardless of the hashrate evolution.",

It is loud, hot and sucks tons of power and isn't a fun thing to do at home for a long period of time unless you are serious and build another shed to house the equipment and pull extra power lines over.Always know that the cost of the equipment will depreciate and the \"break even\" goal post tends to shift with each Diff Adjustment or release of new (faster) ASIC miner.",

Because we all know that the price of Bitcoin is very low during this period, which means that the amount of profit is also very low. In general, by Bitcoin mining we mean a process of generating Bitcoins through some complex mathematical solutions. However, doing this type of work at home can often lead to various problems. Mining needs perfect place to work especially it has to do in a quiet environment. Otherwise there will be problem in mining.
