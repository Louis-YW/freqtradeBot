  "content": "Inspired by some merit sources i tried to figure out, how to highlight the most helpful posts and users without creating a bunch of rules but in an simple and organic way.I came out with an evaluation to concentrate on those posts and users which were found to be helpful and are likely to serve as a role model. Maybe this leaderboard can inspire others on how to create interesting content and push forward the community at all.If you are interested in evaluations for some other local boards you may have a look to the international Thread Homage the Bitcointalk Heroes - monthly spotlight to local quality posters, it will be updated soon.The evaluation was made by using @DdmrDdmr Merit Dashboard and @TryNinja Ninjastic.space.   First of all here is the Leaderboard of all users who have made at least 5 posts and received at least 5 merits in the nigerian local board during Oktober. The list was then ranked by Merit/Post-ratio. To everybody on the list with a high ratio, I owe you respect and appreciation.RankUsername|Merit/Postlocal Meritlocal Posts|(all Merits)________________|_____________________________|__________1.Orpichukwu|5,8295|(108)2.Chilwell|4,31256916|(71)3.Antotena|3,857720|(95)4.EarnOnVictor|2,1667136|(75)5.Baki202|2,0772713|(33)6.Belarge|22211|(25)7.Mate2237|1,83343318|(52)8.Igebotz|1,83342212|(36)9.Nwada001|1,7143127|(23)10.Jegileman|1,68752716|(36)11.Salahmu|1,61610|(33)12.SmartGold01|1,5913522|(49)13.Makus|1,563925|(49)14.Kelward|1,52393221|(50)15.Perfectbaby|1,596|(9)16.Nheer|1,38471813|(24)17.Abu-Naim|1,375118|(12)18.adultcrypto|1,20524739|(73)19.CryptopreneurBrainboss|1,01895453|(219)20.Amphenomenon|12626|(37)21.Youngkhngdiddy|11818|(28)22.Dzwaafu11|11111|(20)23.knowngunman|188|(12)24.Victorybit1|155|(5)25.Frankolala|0,92311213|(29)26.Stable090|0,88241517|(15)27.RockBell|0,85721214|(14)28.Sexylizzy2813|0,71431014|(32)29.DubemIfedigbo001|0,71123245|(45)30.Sim_card|0,68431319|(41)31.iBaba|0,681725|(18)32.Ever-young|0,666769|(10)33.Stepstowealth|0,666769|(8 )34.Roseline492|0,64452945|(51)35.Ruttoshi|0,6154813|(66)36.Davidvictorson|0,58831017|(10)37.Marykeller|0,521325|(15)38.Onyeeze|0,5714|(9)39.Agbamoni|0,46431328|(27)40.CryptSafe|0,44121534|(22)41.Franctoshi|0,4375716|(18)42.Odohu|0,43591739|(54)43.EluguHcman|0,42862456|(29)44.Majestic-milf|0,41845|(67)45.Lida93|0,41230|(25)46.Promocodeudo|0,4820|(12)47.Agbe|0,3889718|(21)48.Obari|0,381821|(12)49.Fivestar4everMVP|0,3104929|(29)50.Samlucky O|0,30272376|(24)51.Hewlet|0,2904931|(16)52.Mayor of ogba|0,2858621|(10)53.Spaceman1000$|0,2286835|(17)54.Obim34|0,2174523|(10)55.rachael9385|0,21631674|(50)56.Asiska02|0,2525|(20)57.Hatchy|0,2525|(12)58.Wiwo|0,1837949|(18)59.Miles2006|0,1622637|(7)60.Forever101|0,1225649|(8 )61.Y3shot|0,122541|(12)62.Charles-Tim|0,109112110|(108)63.Richbased|0,0708799|(8 )In addition to that I also want to highlight those local posts with particularly high quality.This is the leaderbord by received merits.

It is now up to other Nigerians to determine whether they want it or not. We vote on everything here, so you might add a poll to your discussion. For a long time, I considered adding the Merit/post ratio to my statistics thread, but I didn't want it to get any larger than it already is.",

Well tried OP, you have just made everything simplified and will be a great tool (thread) to follow up in the local board every month.",

No, I understand, but if you're going to do anything, we'd like it to be permanent and constant; if you're not sure you're willing to work with us long term, there's no point in starting in the first place. Also, how do you intend to run it? On a monthly or weekly basis.",
