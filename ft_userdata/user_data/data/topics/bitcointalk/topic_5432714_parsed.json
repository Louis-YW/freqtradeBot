Also trading signal exist because a user like you believes on it that it is working while it’s not in reality.Trading signal is just gimmick by some traders with knowledge on technical analysis to fool those user that doesn’t have knowledge on TA so that they will blindly follow all the signals they are posting for there own benefits.",

Leaving this no other signals whether those are paid or free never works. I would suggest that rather wasting money on signals, you should spend those to learn trading and it’s terms. At last if you are unable to do it, then go for free calls from twitter. Just follow 5-6 crypto veterans at Twitter, and when they talk about a specific coin just go for it. This works 70% of the time.",

It means there is money to be made in this market but it requires a lot of trial and error to be able to master how things work. There is no such thing as 100 percent but there is an over 90 percent working signal or strategy. It's either it came on our own or we availed it from someone else.This is the only downside here. Sometimes it needs money to make money. You are right that it's still better to work on our own so that we can be able to save more money in the process. It also gives us a confidence.
