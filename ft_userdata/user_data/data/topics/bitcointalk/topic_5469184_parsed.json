I have never seen he launched any project so it is a bit strange to see that topic but my feeling is it sounds impossible a trusted member over years, turn to spread malwares. I of course know that even forum VIP and donator members turned to scammers so I don't exclude that chance, just need more checking.Quote from: Rikafip on October 04, 2023, 02:02:17 PMRegarding Harizen, it looks like hacked account as I see no change of password and/or email and it doesn't make much sense to sell Legendary account with solid reputation and that is in a signature campaign. Then again, stranger things have happened here. Either way, hopefully he realizes soon what happened so he can get control of his account back.Get his account back is not enough and I believe his account will be either banned (by spreading malwares, against forum rules) or locked (by security reason).This case reminds me about kenzawak.kenzawak hacked (again)Account \"kenzawak\" compromised againQuote from: Cyrus on July 17, 2019, 01:13:01 PMAs Halab mentionef, the account is already locked.Follow the instructions here please: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5089777",

I see that person in question didn't really push too much to get his account unbanned (he ant afk day after appeal) and unfortunately that is needed sometimes but I guess he just coulnd't bother with that and decided to leave the forum without fight.Harizen finally realized realized that his account has been locked and created an appeal thread so hopefully he has more luck and persistence and gets his account back.",
