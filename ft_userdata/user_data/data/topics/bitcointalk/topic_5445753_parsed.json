There are other simple options as well like MyceliumGear[1] and OpenNode[2]. However, these are 3rd party websites that aren't privacy friendly.Also, I just checked your website and it looks like there are missing links on the markup since I cannot go back to the \"INSTRUCTIONS\" page when I am on the \"CART\" page. Just tested it using mobile and pc, and it's the same.[1] https://gear.mycelium.com/[2] https://www.opennode.com/",

So, if you're going to try others then you should do it first as that's what the most suggested payment gateway that I've seen.You may try also this Binance Pay to be applied to your business.(https://pay.binance.com/en)",

For all people with experience buying/selling using cryptocurrency, what is the best platform that is usually used in ecommerce websites? Thanks.This is a good development, but you must be certain of the ups and down of accepting crypto as a payment system. Based on what I experienced, please do not use a third-party actor, they will ruin your business by extorting your customers with high charges. Just this week, I was charged approximately $5 for paying $122.57 for a service, which is ridiculous and so discouraging. Therefore, you might use a popular exchange or wallet for the transaction, and many of your clients might be using it too, so the transaction will be direct, internal and free.You can afterwards move it to a more secure wallet if you want.",

There are many customers that will not be using the exchange that you are using. That is also not the direction to look towards, looking towards payment is better than thinking of using what is centralized. Customers can decide to make payment from a noncustodial wallet or from another exchange.Businesses are using payment processor like https://btcpayserver.org/ that Potato Chips mentions. There are many of them if you need alternatives which Maus0728 mentioned. I do not know the cost to setup a payment processor, but they are very important in businesses for customers to make payment. Your customers can use it to make transaction from any wallet or exchange of their choice and no charges on their side. They can even automatically be converting the crypto to fiat for you.",

Custodial wallets, whether an exchange or not often let you send coins for free within their network, which was what I pointed to in my reply. Maybe you did not read it to understand. And I added that such must be popular to increase the chance of OP's customers using the same to enable free transactions for some of them. I've used this on some custodial wallets and Binance (exchange) to third parties for free, so I know what I wrote.As for your suggestion on the payment processors, they are the most convenient, but maybe you don't use them, I do weekly, and I will always discourage a small/startup business to use them because they will not grow due to high charges. They extort customers because they set the price and fee which is beyond the control of the seller. This discourages buying and selling through cryptos as experience people will prefer fiat in such cases (if there is an option for it) to crypto in which they will pay more.I wrote based on my conclusion after weighing all options, and it remains that direct payment is best for retail businesses if they are fairer to their customer than the third-party actors (B2B).",

All I can see about this is how the people should depend more on centralized exchanges.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on March 24, 2023, 10:12:06 AMAs for your suggestion on the payment processors, they are the most convenient, but maybe you don't use them, I do weekly, and I will always discourage a small/startup business to use them because they will not grow due to high charges.

This discourages buying and selling through cryptos as experience people will prefer fiat in such cases (if there is an option for it) to crypto in which they will pay more.It is not about conveniences, when talking about payment and customers, it is about considering all means of payment, while Marchants are using noncustodial means to accept payment. Payment processor is not for people that are receiving small number of transactions, you can handle that yourself on your noncustodial wallet, but it is used for high number of daily transactions with different addresses generation and also able to process your coin to fiat transaction for you as easy. There are many organizations today that are making use of payment processes if they are receiving high transaction rate. As for exchanges, a coin can be tainted, the fault may not even be from your customers, while exchange may seize the coin. If taking about customers paying you, exchanges and anything custodial should not be talked about at all. Anything centralized may bring inconveniences, even up to withdrawal inconveniences.Exchanges should not be more than exchanging money. For payment, payment processors can handle that.",
