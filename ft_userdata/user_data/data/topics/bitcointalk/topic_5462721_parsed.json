What do we need a token for it's easy to create a forum like an SMF, people trust Bitcointalk more than any other forums I don't think you will need crowdfunding to launch a forum if this is the only features that you can come out with I don't think it will attract investors.",

After all, what utility can this project provide to the token holders? is the utility available only to developers who want their project to be heard by the crypto public?IMO, before you make a project, it's a good idea for you to do your due diligence first regarding whether this project will be useful to people, whether this project has strong competitors and so on. After all, for now we have a calendar for a much longer known crypto project like Coinmarketcal.",

One, if this forum is shitty, why do you bother asking for a fund raising here? And two, let's talk about the project itself. The forum already have and facilitate small crypto projects to be heard... as long as they're legit. How do you plan to be sure you're promoting the correct ones and not a scam projects?",
