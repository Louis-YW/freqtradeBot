  "content": "Hi everyone,I recently made the mistake of importing a BIP39 seed phrase from an online source, which I now believe was provided by a scammer. while importing it into Electrum, I received a warning that BIP39 seeds don’t meet Electrum's safety standards and that this feature is only meant to access funds from other wallets.\"Warning: BIP39 seeds can be imported in Electrum, so that users can access funds locked in other wallets. However, we do not generate BIP39 seeds, because they do not meet our safety standard. BIP39 seeds do not include a version number, which compromises compatibility with future software. We do not guarantee that BIP39 imports will always be supported in Electrum.\"I’m worried about the security of my other wallets.What should i do now ?Thanks",

Be cautious online, as phishing links can empty your wallet.It's likely OP received a spam message with a USDT filled wallet on some altcoin chain. The scammer gives away the seed phrase so that others will load the wallet with ETH or TRX to pay the transaction fee for spending the USDT. This allows the scammer to instantly sweep the ETH or TRX deposited by the victim while the USDT remains in the same place.",

When you have copy the seed you can import it to any wallet supported that kind of seed phrase just like electrum. But since electrum has its own standard way of generating seed, they can't guarantee you that it (BIP39) will be supported for few more years which means they will drop the support anytime soon.It doesn't mean that the hackers own that seed can penetrate your device by just you importing that seed to them, although there are some scam for that strategy for alts/tokens smart contract but it doesn't work for electrum.",

This is not like in Ethereum and some other coins where some malicious smart contracts might run upon creation or anything like that (and even that requires a compromised wallet software).",
