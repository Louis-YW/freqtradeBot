  "content": "I just completed 10 years of Bitcointalk, and in turn 10 years since I entered the world of bitcoin. This topic aims to thank all members of this community, which gave me the possibility to know and learn more about this fantastic technology.It is true that there were periods away from the forum, but in general I was never really away, just less active. In the last 2 years I've spent more time on the forum, and I've been trying to help with some aspects that I've learned over the years. I'm a very distracted person, and that's why I can sometimes not remember common things, which have even been said several times, but that doesn't bother me to participate based on what I know.If over this time, I did something that may have hurt or disappointed someone, I apologize in advance. I like to get along with everyone, even though I know this isn't always easy. English is not my strong point, so sometimes I may not be able to explain things in the best way, or I may be misunderstood. Thank you for your understanding.I'd like to be more active in other areas of the forum, but I don't have time for more.  I look forward to continuing to help the community in whatever way I can.And I can say first hand that I am preparing something that I believe you will like. In a few weeks, I hope to be able to make a presentation.Many thanks to everyone and to this fantastic BitcoinTalk community!",

This topic aims to thank all members of this community, which gave me the possibility to know and learn more about this fantastic technology.That's an impressive achievement. Registering an account for almost a decade won't be an achievement. But You have written almost 10K(9864) posts in ten years—986 Posts per year and 82 Posts per month on average. Your Contribution to the forum is remarkable. QuoteIf over this time, I did something that may have hurt or disappointed someone, I apologize in advance. I like to get along with everyone,  I can't remember if I was engaged with you on any other thread. But I have to say that I have never felt hurt or sad reading your posts so far. So it's all good. QuoteI'd like to be more active in other areas of the forum, but I don't have time for more. Everyone has a personal life outside this forum. It's not necessary to spend your valuable time here. The forum shouldn't be anyone's priority. It will affect your personal life if you take it too seriously. Be on the forum whenever you can.  Fun Fact: I noticed that you registered on April 11, 2013, at 06:35:49 PM (Forum Time).You published this post on April 11, 2023, at 06:50:28 PM (Forum time).

I saw that it was a day/time that I could schedule to do this, and so here it is.",

Given that it happens that some old members leave the forum for various personal reasons, it is good to see that we have members who have been active for such a long time and are still actively participating in the work of the forum.I don't want to speak in general, but with regard to AI chat-bots, it seems to me that lately we have more and more bot-members and that in 10 years (if the forum exists), there won't be too much human interaction on the forum.",

Of course I don't think that's bad because when there are more important things out there taking a break is a wise option to consider. But anyway, your last statement made it very clear that you have no intention of leaving the forum despite not being active in discussions for a long time.To celebrate, please accept congratulations for your loyalty over the past 10 years to bitcointalk forum.
