  "content": "Will sell singles. These are all in mint condition. Have always been capsulized and in climate controlled storage.  Right now taking offers. May end up doing auctions..we shall see. I don’t know all the names off hand or mintages. I know the guy faux btc/eth combo is pretty limited (100 maybe), the 1.337 Factom Coin is pretty limited as well. I’ll add more info as time permits. One day I’ll learn how to take decent photos.",

I have a slight obsession with hacktivists, and when I first learned about Anonymous Hacking SeaWorld (SeaWorld is a prison for animals, and I encourage everyone to never support captive cetaceans as it's beyond cruel. Honestly any zoo is unless it's accredited/sanctuary) I somehow came across bitcoin at the same time. I think it was mentioned in the article.  Then I found the anonymous mint and their coin that had both the anonymous mask and bitcoin on each side.  That was my first every physical bitcoin...as they say the rest is history. Thank you Seek3r and Steeley!!! FYI I have been slammed today..I will be returning DMs shortly.",
