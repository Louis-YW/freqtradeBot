I believe say something like that no go be bad thing but e go make sense say if we want do am make we use pigin take write am for our local board make e take show the nija vibs. I also think say if e go de necessary to create main thread when go house the topics when we go bring come from other board, e go make sense make the main thread still de in pigin English to take add value to those content for our local board.And I believe say this one go be good one for the board because e get some vital post when go de of benefit for we country people when fit de other board but as e be say them no use English take write am, we no go know about the information.",

Will you create a new thread about it or use this thread for it so that I can put this on notification.But also if someone create a new thread about it, if is very important, it is also not bad. Because a thread is existing on the English board, that does not mean it can not exist on local board. I have done this in the past but I am lazy to do it recently.Example of recently ones are:[WARNING] Another Electrum fake app on AppStore!!![SCAM] Fake transaction accelerator that requires typing your seed phrase!!! Avoid trading crypto in real person. You can see this now on Binance.I am definitely certain that some people did not see these important threads. If brought to local board, it would be good for more people to know about it and also discuss about it.Quote from: Hewlet on November 23, 2023, 01:07:46 PMI believe say something like that no go be bad thing but e go make sense say if we want do am make we use pigin take write am for our local board make e take show the nija vibs. Use any language that you want. The most important thing is for people to be able to see it and gain from it.EditThe languages I am referring to is either English or Pidgin English.",

Because those wey dey ignore am for the other boards fit ignore am here too..how you see am?For me ooo, the best idea na to just creat a self moderated topic and call am 'important update from other local boards in the forum'.people wey see such important topics in the other local boards can post it there. E no to too good say anybody wey see important post from other local boards go come create yin own thread. But the important thing go be say how we go come carry know those things wey go call important, as people get different ways of classifying things wey dey them important. I this this has to be properly spelt out by the person creating the thread.",

Doing this is as if you they carry every body along,  one thing I observe from this our local board is that we wey belong here we they feel so free to discuss. This thing na the thing other local board they do and the thing they benefit them a lot . If complicated thread are brought in here and explain in our own language the thing go make sense wella.",

Any topic wey dey general board wey go dey very beneficial for us here, e get need make we dey report dem for here. But my question be say, since na local board be dis, we need convert am to pidgin before bringing am come here or we go leave am as English, If na for general board we see am, since we dey understand English for here too and to save d stress of translating it into pidgin again? If not, dis idea na good one and I dey in support of am wella. Just bring idea on how you wan take achieve am, so dat oda members go put mouth inside am for you on how you go take run am.",

Because those wey dey ignore am for the other boards fit ignore am here too..how you see am?You are very much on point with your questions and that was why I had the contemplations of starting a poll to know what others think about having a self moderated thread for a he purpose of reporting only informative and necessary post to the local board.Me personally don already conclude say I go create new moderated thread for that purpose because a lot of us Dey forget or maybe no Dey see other important threads including when there is an open slot in a signature campaign thread and this very matter of letting other local board members know when there is an open a slot Dey happen for other boards and I think e Dey very beneficial.Quote from: Jegileman on November 23, 2023, 06:14:52 PMQuote from: Obari on November 23, 2023, 12:35:16 PMWhat do you guys think about this and is this very thread appropriate to report other important informations ?But my question be say, since na local board be dis, we need convert am to pidgin before bringing am come here or we go leave am as EnglishWell language no be wetin we suppose battle for here as we all know say this our country get major language barrier and as such, we already get one generally accept language wey be the pigin and since everybody Dey understand plain English, then I go agree with @charles-Tim say make we stick to just the pigin and plain English.Also note that, everyone is free to submit whatever thread from the general board that they feel or think is important to let the local board know but the major reason for making the thread a moderated one is to help filter whatever post that isn’t met to be in the list.",

Is a welcome idea because I believe that there are so many local board that has more experienced members who has been into the system number of years and not just on the forum but for so many things that could be of a beneficial to this local board, because just as you said there are other local board that always go through other countries local board to learn new things outside from what they already have, and also there are some persons on this forum who are only here to acquire new knowledge about different areas of Bitcoin, investment and other things. So OP you have done well with the information because even myself I have been really thinking about it but seeing that you also have the same observation or rather opinion makes me happy.",
