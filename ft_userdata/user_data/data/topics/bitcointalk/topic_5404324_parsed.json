Please drop me your configuration in hiveOS I am having a bad time with my OC settings, crashes and reboots in HiveOS after 1 minute or two, is  - minus better for Micron memory core clock or +?.You will find the answer in this Hive OS forum.If the video card reboots, then you may be using too high memory or core frequency settings.
