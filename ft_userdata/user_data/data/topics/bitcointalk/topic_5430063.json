Or board other?P2P is the only way and the boards were mentioned by jawhead. But sad to say that there's no exchange on it that it is listed.And that means that there's likely no one that would like to take that offer. I've seen the same post of people wanting to dump their mined pi coins on the marketplace(altcoins) and it seems that no one has taken those deals.Well, you can also try at least.",

It's starting to be known that pi is worthless. Sorry to say that but that's what I think it is when I've read a lot of negative things about it. Still, good luck.",

Or board other?I don't know who can exchange their currencies such as Bitcoin and currencies of high value with currencies that are not listed and have no value. Yes, there are boards here, so you can publish a topic about that, and I hope that you will find someone to help you in these transactions, although I doubt that there will be someone who will have the desire to obtain these shitcoins like Pi network. You can always deal with members with high rank, or you can use an Escrow service so that the safety rate is high, and stay away from scammers who ask you to send your coins first via private messages.",

Very disappointing !How can your brother invest in this project while you can easily mine it with phone and there's no exchange accept this shitcoin?Well, this coin have became trendy all of sudden and then there are left and right offers for those want to buy or sell the coin. I know you can mine it on your own but that can take a lot of time and as far as I know, it's also hard to withdraw your coins outside this pi mining app.You need to go through a rigorous process (different levels of KYC and other stuffs) but I won't recommend anyone to get involved on this one. I think this was all about the hypes and like any other shady projects, it's hyped are soon going to subside. There are still a lot of good cryptos out there that can give us a decent profit but with lesser risk, so why choose pi?",
