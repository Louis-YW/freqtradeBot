BITMAIN_LunnaYes absolutely !When I created a ticket with their online support, I was always pleasantly surprised by their responsiveness. They have a very bad reputation in terms of customer service, but I must say that they have always responded to me within 48 hours by email.However, I have to admit that some times I had to send two or three emails to get the actual answer to my question. I don't know if their support agents are overworked, but sometimes the responses consist of sending a simple FAQ link, when in the basic ticket you mention that you used the FAQ and it didn't solve the problem.I think it's like with all support, better to give all the info right from the start if you want the request to be handled correctly, and if it's not, don't hesitate to start a ticket from the beginning hoping to find another agent.",
