  "content": "Hello, I am creating an API that will connect to Bitcoin Core running on a server. The API would manage multiple wallets for a lot of users (up to 1000s)... Now I'm wondering how could I implement this to work as fast as possible. Is it possible to for example \"getbalance\" (\"http://USER:PASS@localhost:8332/wallet/WALLETNAME\") of a specific wallet without having it loaded? Because each loaded wallet takes about 10MB in memory.. And having 1000s of them loaded at the same time would take up a lot of ram and I am not sure how much stress it causes on the CPU for example, if anyone has any knowledge about this. Would it make sense for each API call to first load the wallet, execute the command and then unload the wallet? That would probably affect the performance. Any help is appreciated.",

Yes I have thought of this but I couldn't find any blockchain explorer for Bitcoin Core... How would I create one by myself? Copy the whole blockchain to a database and how would I update/modify it with each transaction/change in the blockchain",

Are there any public projects that could give me an idea how its meant to be done...Bitcoin core already stores all block/transaction data in a database. There are a number of block explorers that you can run on top of bitcoin core. Here is a list of some of them. Another important thing to point out is that you do not want the \"balance\" of any given address, you are most likely going to want to know the unspent outputs associated with each address.",

Either it will perform very poorly or it will consume more memory than you have.It is not possible to get a wallet's balance without loading it. Loading a wallet can take a lot of time, and constantly loading and unloading wallets will waste a lot of time. When a wallet is loaded, it is entirely loaded into memory and the entire wallet is iterated at least once.What are you trying to do that you think requires having a wallet for each user?",
