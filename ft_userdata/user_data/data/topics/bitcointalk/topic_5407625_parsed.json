  "content": "Keet launched by Bitfinex and Tether is a free video calling app that makes use of peer-to-peer technology to facilitate real-time audio/video calls, text chat and file sharing. This eliminates single point of failure and centralized data collection. It's has true web3 features.It's ironic that the shadiest centralized company in crypto will pursue a decentralized social media app. Will you trust its creator and use it?Source: https://watcher.guru/news/tether-bitfinex-hypercore-launch-p2p-app-with-bitcoin-ln-payments",

Tbf I also expected video calling on Skype to be peer to peer (where possible) but it might not be.If bitfinex charge for things on their calling service like using filters/background or other features then it'll probably seem more \"reasonable\" for them to offer it for free to users - either that or they're hoping to advertise themselves by providing this as a service showcasing the power of decentralisation and how it can be used effectively for one of the most data intensive things you can do.",

Paolo Ardoino claimed on Twitter that they'll be fully open-source in late 2022 once the software is ready for the masses (probably beta or post beta).",

      "body": "Just because something is called \"decentralized\" it doesn't mean it actually is decentralized though.Take thousands of altcoins that are centralized and claim otherwise. We have this situation all around us, for example the Binance Decentralized Exchange is a big centralized joke and yet they claim it is not centralized! For these companies it all comes down to money, if they can make money from it they will build it.They could even start user data mining and sell the data for extra profit. Considering the project and the company are both shady and closed the risks are high.",

People will prefer the free audio-video calls, no matter how centralized they are and how much data is stored about them. So I expect the new app will be very far from Skype, WhatsApp, Teams, Google meet or Zoom. And I'm sure my list is far from complete, only in picking the really big ones.And as the others said:* not the shadiest companies, by far* closed source, so they can claim anythingAnd my answer: most probably no, since the few people I do video call with already have their preferences (or requirement!)",
