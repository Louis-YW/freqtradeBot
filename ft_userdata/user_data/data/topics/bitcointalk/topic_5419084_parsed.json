  "content": "Gentlemen,first of all thanks for accepting me on the forum. I am writing because I saw that a member of CEX.IO has an account here and maybe he can solve the problem that has been affecting me for a few days.I signed up on CEX.IO after reading some positive reviews. I verified the account by providing all the required data and documents. I made a small Bitcoin deposit via VISA card and it was successful. Then I sent the Bitcoins to my FreeBitco.in address, and this is where the problems started. My first withdrawal was refused. I was asked to send two screenshots, one proving that the FreeBitcoin email was mine, the second proving that the Bitcoin address on FreeBitco.in matched the one used for the withdrawal. I provided these screenshots and retried the withdrawal. This was also rejected. I asked to the support for an explanation but got no answer. I thought maybe the problem was FreeBitco.in, so I retried the withdrawal using an address from my Coinbase account. Nothing to do: this withdrawal was also refused. Now I'm starting to get worried because there seems to be no way to withdraw these Bitcoins.Have any of you had the same problem?Right now I'm trying the withdrawal to FreeBitco.in again, but since this morning (many hours have passed) nothing has happened. If the member of CEX.IO support registered in the forum could give me a hand I would be grateful. Thank you.My user id: up156945328",

There is (was?) a hold time for purchases.Also, they have stated the their compliance team if they are reviewing the transactions and your KYC documentation will take a while:Quote from: CEX on January 05, 2022, 10:54:19 AMPlease be advised that the procedure on our platform is performed by our Compliance Officers and implies a thorough investigation of the information provided by the customer. We'd like to inform you that it is indeed not fast because the details are checked manually and with all due diligence.But, what is the most important, absolutely all the messages from you are being checked and AML/KYC cases are never left aside until completed. It means that you'll be contacted by the team once the information you've provided is checked. Once again, it's a time- and effort-consuming process.Moreover, the Compliance Team has regular working hours (not like the Support Team that is available 24/7). We highly appreciate your patience and understanding! Also, when making a scam accusation here use the proper format: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=260073.0You don't have to include everything but the more detail the better.-Dave",

If this is indeed the reason, it won't matter  which platform or wallet you will withdraw next, it will also get rejected.And what about your verification level? It appears they have limits on how much you can withdraw based on your verification level.",

You've opened an account with them, passed KYC, made a deposit.What does the withdrawal failure or rejection message say? Did you check your email for more explanation why your transaction was rejected?This might have nothing to do with the withdrawal address belonging to a gambling site as others have hinted because you did the same withdrawal attempt with a Coinbase address and it was also rejected. If it is about the hold time that DaveF mentioned, then they should've just pointed that out instead of asking for proofs that the address you're withdrawing funds to is the right one and indeed yours. This is the one that made me really curious. Normally, exchanges don't care whether the withdrawal address you're putting is the right or wrong one or whether that belongs to your or not. For as long as it's a valid address, the transaction would proceed.Anyway, PM CEX and I hope they will reply. Although it last posted in April, it was active until yesterday.
