If you have a BTC address and password for a brain wallet, then there are several ways to withdraw money. 1. You can use a wallet that supports importing brain wallets. Open such a wallet, select the option \"Import wallet\" or something similar, and enter your address and password. After that, you will be able to manage your funds and withdraw money.2. If you have a recovery phrase (seed phrase) for a brain wallet, then you can use it to restore a wallet in another wallet that supports recovery by seed phrase. Enter your recovery phrase and follow the instructions to access your funds.3. If none of the above is suitable, then it is better to contact the support service of the wallet that you used to create the brain wallet. They can help you with restoring access to funds.",

      "body": "You first have to figure out what tool you used to create this brainwallet because there has never been a universal standard for the algorithms used in brainwallets (since it is a terrible and insecure way of creating a key). Which means there are at least half a dozen different methods of generating one from a password. Bitaddress.org only provides one method. Warpwallet is another algorithm using scrypt as its \"hash\" function.https://github.com/keybase/warpwallet",
