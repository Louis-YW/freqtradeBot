  "content": "I hate to say this but war might be going bigger.USA Has not so many means anymore to defend either Europe or ukraine.USA need to be ready with fight with china.Now we get the point of btc and crypto during the war it's only safe place to hold your wealth.Too bad for real estate owners many of it can get destroyed during the war.Stock market or any related with country goverment system can not be working due the war power outages the local servers might be out of the connection and cyber attacks aswell.Btc and crypto is safest network to use so times like this lucky ones who knows about crypto.Very sad outlook for Europe becouse euro is falling allready energy inflation and If war going higher the inflation will run wild Even higher inflation for euro Will occure gold is good to hold but only thing is during the war it's difficult to move or hold.It seems to me that europe Will go full use of crypto soon becouse of problems in Europe the ECB cant control the inflation anymore.Spain,france,germany countries and off course switzerland might be doing better then other ones.Not doomster here but things Are not looking good at all.",

Having two of the largest economies within a war would destroy global shipping logistics and send the global economy down the gutter.

Remember how it collapsed to 4k at the covid outbreak?People turn their assets into cash or whatever at crisis times. When the economy goes down so does the value of everything related.",
