  "content": "Hi everyone,I need some advices from the experienced miners here running their own mining facility.I have the opportunity to get a warehouse with a surface of 90m².I got two windows on each side of this warehouse where I can create an airflow.Power available is 350KWI plan to run there approx 100 S19Yearly temperature variation lowest 0 up to 15 degrees maxDo you guys think 90m² is enough space for 100 S19? or is it too small?Also, regarding the mainboard, should I install a 16A breaker for each S19 or a 32A breaker for each 2? Many thanks guys,L",

      "body": "I've got an airflow sizing calculator up on this article https://altairtech.io/designing-a-bitcoin-mining-facility-airflow-management/It is complex, but as a rule of thumb about 1 sqft per s19 is a good estimate. So for 100 miners you'd need 100 sqft or 10 m2. If your windows do not have enough surface area, you can increase air intake area by creating awning based intakes (details in article). You have humid and cold air, so you'll have to allow for some backflow to prevent condensation. As far as filters go, here's a supplier we have used for a while https://www.hoodfilters.com/20-x-20-x-1-ez-kleen-mesh-supply-intake-filter-912.html",

Many thanks guys,LIn my opinion you should make space double cause more you have space and more you will be handling small incidents like rodents, electrical and other such incidents. And 100 Antminers are a big number and that's why you need more space. You should make your place more and more reliable on natural sources of electricity cause for this you need batteries also. And that's why you will be needing more space too. I think that you should buy a wharehouse than a  container. Container is a very less space for such huge miners.",
