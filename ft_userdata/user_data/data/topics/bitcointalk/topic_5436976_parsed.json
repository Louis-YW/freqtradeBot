Like you will list products related to sports like ball, bats, kits etc from Amazon and get commission if people buy from it. Read more about it here.This is just my understanding. Maybe OP meant something else. If it is something else OP should inform here and answer above questions.",

Thank you.You might as well post any details here. If you don't want to share url, then you could still post some basic info and stats, i.e. monthly traffic, average revenue, how much you expect to sell it for etc.It's hard for anyone to even say if they're interested if you only disclose the type of business.Just saying",

Is it organic or whether it was achieved through paid advertising?it would also be desirable if we knew the approximate price you expect for it.if you really want to sell, you have to be a little more serviceable. if we have to ask you for every piece of information, then the whole thing becomes much more complicated. I don't know how many buyers have the desire to trade in such a way.I would suggest you try platforms dedicated to online business sales, such as Flippa or Sedo. or at least look at them, and see how similar offers are presented.",

You can even drop the expected price you are looking for. Make it simple.",
