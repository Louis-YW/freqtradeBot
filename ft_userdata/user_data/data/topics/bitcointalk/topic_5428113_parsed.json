  "content": "Hi guys, small question on a hashboard s9 4.21, I replaced a chip, the clock is well at 0.9 but the RI at 0v, the LDO comes out well 1.8v and 2.5v bottom pin. All the small resistors are at the right ohm. After soldering the chip, I checked the resistors CLK30 CO30 RI30 BO30 RST30 are good in ohm. I conclude that the chip soldering is good?Any idea where it comes from? Thanks!",

      "body": "So I checked CLK (green line from 00 to 63) and RI (yellow line from 63 to chip 28 or I lose RI from here)The chip 28 is the one I replaced as said above. But the resistances taken at the terminals of this one are correct. (CLK 0.433 CO 0.396 Ri .397 BO 0.396 RST.0316)I have tested also core to core and I found 0,446v between each chip with next row https://ibb.co/tQPLJBp",
