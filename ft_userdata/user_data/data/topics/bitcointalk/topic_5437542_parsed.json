Where things CAN go wrong, KYC can be sprung on you and so on.I would *think* that if I was doing something like this I would want to do my own exchanges. But, that is just me. -Dave",

From what I've seen and understood there, this AnonPay is an app of Trocador, and this Trocador is an \"exchange aggregator\". So I guess that they earn from the exchanges they use (and what's sweeter than hassle free money?)Their API docs tell that the chosen exchange can be found/seen, but it looks like it can be seen only for trades already done (see GET method trade). I didn't find any way the caller can pick the desired exchange.",

      "body": "The service looks good considering that any altcoin can be converted into bitcoin and sent to a wallet without the need for centralized exchanges.But the problem remains in the presence of third-party services that are similar to exchanges in many disadvantages, for example, you can clearly see that the third-party provider can request KYC at any time and that some third-party services of type (D) can request KYC At any time they can also block the funds if refused.",

Swapuz and StealthEx (B-rated exchanges) always give me better rates for a BTC>XMR exchange on the official sites. I have been refreshing and trying for a few minutes now and not once did Trocador app offer more favorable rates. I am questioning their \"we charge no fees\" statement.",

That third party exchanger takes some issue with my payment, so freezes my payment and demands KYC, which I'm not going to provide. I'm now out of pocket and the merchant will refuse to hand over the goods, since my payment hasn't reached him. But I would still blame the merchant for this, for if I knew what was happening and that my coins being frozen were a possibility at all, I'd never have used said merchant in the first place. There have been more than a few scam accusations I have seen against such exchange aggregator sites because of exchangers they have listed freezing funds for arbitrary reasons, and usually the exchange aggregator is less than helpful in resolving them.The whole concept is a good idea, but the risks involved in the current implementation are too high.",

Why not just use a DEX for exchanging instead? I don't believe that DEX's can freeze any funds, and if trading volume is low, as a result preventing you from converting the coin, you can just send the original cryptocurrency back to the user's source address.",

I am by far an expert on the matter since I have zero interest in the vast majority of altcoins, but I was under the impression that there are decentralized exchanges which have trustless methods of automatically swapping one coin for another, via atomic swaps, smart contracts, and similar. If you employ one those, so that there is absolutely zero chance of the customer's coins being frozen and absolutely zero chance of KYC being demanded, then this would be a great service for a merchant.
