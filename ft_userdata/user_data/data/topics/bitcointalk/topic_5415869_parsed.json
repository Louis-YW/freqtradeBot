In the process I lost my home, my car, my marriage and most of my family and friends despise me now.I need a loan in btc for the rest of the amount so I can have a semblance of recovery.I can and will repay it in a year with interest.Plead help. I really don't have any other ideas on how to fix my issues at the moment, and the debt is racking up interest at a rate I am afraid I cannot cover in a timely manner.The only thing left to lose is my life.",

I really don't have any other ideas on how to fix my issues at the moment, and the debt is racking up interest at a rate I am afraid I cannot cover in a timely manner.The only thing left to lose is my life.You have to think on something else. Like getting a job.Or get one of the old business partners help you. Or get your friends to better sentiments, if they are indeed friends.Losing your life is the ultimately wrong move. With enough willingness and good health money can be recovered. Not easy, since it's a very big amount, still...However, asking for such a huge a donation from unknown people is not the way to go, no matter how desperate or dramatic you are.And, let's be honest, since you cannot provide any proper collateral, what you're asking is a donation, not a loan.",

Use that as a step to build, if the debt You owe is due before a year, take out a farther loan as you work to pay the most pressing one and prevent accumulating interests, while working on your plan.This is your best plan. No one is going to give you the amount you seek here, no matter how sympathetic your story is. If that was the case, everyone would have a sob story.- Jay -",

So your loan would not amount to $177k but to $354k. isn't that too much of a risk for someone in your position? you haven't written who exactly you owe, the bank, the state, business associates, or friends. if you promise here that you can pay it back in a year surely those to whom you owe will have the understanding to give you some air.",
