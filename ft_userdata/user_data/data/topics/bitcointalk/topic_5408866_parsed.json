I bought at 300$ and I have made half of the money already, I just feel like its the right time to start buying coins direct.This is a good market price. These video cards after mining are sold for an average of $ 220-250 per piece. After the completion of Ethereum mining, the price of this video card will decrease even more. Some miners buy these graphics cards, but I would prefer more powerful GPUs, such as 2060 super or 2070.",

I bought at 300$ and I have made half of the money already, I just feel like its the right time to start buying coins direct.Most likely is the right time to buy more efficient cards then buy coins directly.The best deals now come RTX 3060 12 GB at 49 Mhsh for just 350 dollars or a bit more and the RTX 3060 ti at 61 Mhsh for 400 dollars or a bit more.These cards perform really well in a lot of algorithms so even when Ethereum mining ends you still have a lot of possibilities to continue mining.To me your buy of 1660 it does not look a good deal but hey it depends on where you got it and what you made out of it.",

And there are no new coins for mining yet.",

However, if you are investing money to mine ETH, I will request you to exercise caution. Because since a long time, ETH algorithm change to POS is ongoing. It has not been scrapped yet. So you can expect it to happen by the end of this year. In that case, you will either have to move your hardware to mine aome other coin or you will have to join the group of people who are planning to fork away from ETH. So think before you spend.",
