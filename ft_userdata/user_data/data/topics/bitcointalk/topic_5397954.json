  "content": "Mentioned that i usually update my ledger live usually a few days or a week or more after a new ledger live update to see if there are bugs or issues like that before updating ledger live.Believe on average, i update the firmware of nano ledger twice a year since on average that seem to be how many times there is a firmware update... usually twice a year.  So each time that happens, i then check my apps installed and update those as well.  For example btc, bch and btg wallets when i check the apps installs, would show im running an older app.  So during the year when i use it few times, i rarely even check if any of my installed apps need updating and there doesn't seem to be issue sending or receiving btc even if im using an older version app of btc.  Anyone here like this or do all you people usually check every few weeks or so if your installed apps are up to date.  But when you do a firmware update, does it automatically update your installed apps or you have to still do it manually yourself?  Don't remember what happened last time when i did the firmware update.Now the thing is i do not connect my nano ledger s that much to my laptop unless i am planning to send or receive.  Now i recently connected my nano ledger s to my laptop because i wanted to request btc from a site.  Got a receiving address and then copied it to the site for them to send the btc to.  Then when i went to my apps installed... btc, bch, etc... notice im using an older version of all the apps.  That is not surprising as i know each app has an update every month or two correct?  Anyone know how often btc and bch app have new versions?  Now my question is... there is no issue of me updating all my install apps on my nano ledger right now correct?  Reason is because since i requested btc from a site to the btc receiving address i got from ledger live... and will be waiting for the btc to hit my wallet, this will take a while as that site is slow with withdraws... there is no issue with me updating my btc, bch apps now right?  Or should i wait until the btc hit my wallet first and then install updates for all my installed apps on nano ledger?",

I open LL more often to answer questions on the forum than to check for updates; if they're any, I usually do that though.Lately I do it more often because you keep asking (kinda same) questions  I don't remember 100% sure if firmware update also updates the apps, but I think it does, actually it might even remove and reinstall them. However, LL always tells big everything you need to know, so you cannot miss updates if you keep your eyes open. (And since you do firmware update, you're in LL)A bigger risk at firmware updates is that the updates take more and more space and you can easily end up with one of the coin apps removed/not reinstalled because of the lack of space there.Quote from: jerry0 on May 09, 2022, 11:19:58 PMNow my question is... there is no issue of me updating all my install apps on my nano ledger right now correct?  Reason is because since i requested btc from a site to the btc receiving address i got from ledger live... and will be waiting for the btc to hit my wallet, this will take a while as that site is slow with withdraws... there is no issue with me updating my btc, bch apps now right?  Or should i wait until the btc hit my wallet first and then install updates for all my installed apps on nano ledger?No, the HW will generate the same addresses from the same seed + same coin + same derivation path, no matter how the apps are updated. So unless something extremely fishy goes on you should be safe.It doesn't matter at all whether you receive the money before or after the update.It sounds scary and it's not the case, but: if something bad happens and an address is no longer recognized/generated, it doesn't even matter you got funds on it or will get funds on it.",

      "body": "Thanks for the response.  Well i know from previously... there are usually two firmware updates a year on average with the nano ledger.  i update ledger live usually a few days or week after there is an update as i don't want to do the update immediately in case of bug or issue etc.  But i rarely every look at my apps installed and see if there is an update.  So basically each time i get ready to do a firmware update twice a year... i then look at my apps installed and they always are few versions behind.  So i estimate btc, bch apps usually have an update every one or two months or so.  But i don't pay attention or even look at it until i have to do a firmware update.  Since any transactions i do with the older btc, bch app apps doesn't seem to have an issue.  So most people here don't update their apps or check it like with ledger live updates?Didn't think about firmware update taking more space where one of your coin apps get removed and not reinstalled because of lack of space.  Anyone had this happened?  Previous firmware updates has made many apps kb to be different correct from previous firmware?  So how much kb should you have left on your nano ledger s before you do an app update?  For example say you have around have 30 kb space remaining at the moment on your nano ledger s.  Would it be a bad idea in general to install enough apps where your nano ledger would show you have all the kb used up and 0 kb free?  Should you always leave say 2 kb free just in case?  Whether its in general or before a firmware update?  is it possible how some people say their nano ledger just suddenly reset... could this be a reason?  Do people here have their nano ledger completely full where there no kb space remaining at all?Before you do any installed apps updates,  it show the new app version number for those coin apps.  But it still tells you how much kb it will use right?  So you can make sure you have enough space?  So shows 2gb currently used for your bch app... the new bch app update shows also 2kb... then it is exactly that right?  Thus it isn't l ike say 2.1 kb where now you might not have enough space?Also when you do firmware update, does it tell you how much kb you need free on your nano ledger s before you do it?",

You're worrying too much, really.If something big has change or something is not OK, I will most probably find out from the forum or from my Electrum (which I use with my Nano S)Heck, if something is so big, I expect even LL will make a big notification about that.So yeah, starting LL now and then can be useful. But worrying this much, overdoing it.. is not hood for the health.

I have a feeling this is the usual way, but I won't spend time checking it.And it did happen to me once, at least to get bigger updates. For some the Fido U2S app was not installed. There was a discussion back then whether that happened because of the lack of space or Fido was not available for some hours. Or both.Interestingly, this was already discussed in one of your topics (see here).Quote from: jerry0 on May 10, 2022, 06:20:38 PMBefore you do any installed apps updates,  it show the new app version number for those coin apps.  But it still tells you how much kb it will use right?  So you can make sure you have enough space?  So shows 2gb currently used for your bch app... the new bch app update shows also 2kb... then it is exactly that right?  Thus it isn't l ike say 2.1 kb where now you might not have enough space?Please take a look in LL and stop asking questions only for the sake of it.Quote from: jerry0 on May 10, 2022, 06:20:38 PMAlso when you do firmware update, does it tell you how much kb you need free on your nano ledger s before you do it?I have to apologize for not remembering it well in the last post.I think that in beginning, before a firmware update, it was said to remove the apps. Now the apps are removed automatically before a firmware update (and probably reinstalled afterwards if there's space and no other surprises). So the update size doesn't matter, it will fit anyway (if we get to the point the firmware + one app cannot fit then the device will be discontinued). The question is whether all your apps will still fit, but if they won't you can just keep fewer on the device on the same time and uninstall/install the apps as you need them.",

Don't worry, you will be answering those questions 2 months from now as well. And on the first anniversary of your reply, he will ask you again. Usually he tells us that when he is not in the USA he doesn't have access to his Nano, but then he returns and <insert worry, fear, and confusion here>. And that's not all. He will also ask the same questions in his other threads (originally created to ask those questions) and he has started posting in Bitcoin Discussion where we can expect the exact same things.",
