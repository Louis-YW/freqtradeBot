So I rushed off and started participating in Bounty. Until a faithful day, I came across HENRI CARTIER post about Merit give away, I felt it was an opportunity to rank up and make more money, then I took part, this was the beginning of a bright future for me.As a result of my post, I'd encounter a lot of criticism from senior members of the community, but this word of encouragement from Henri https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5215727.msg53750802#msg53750802 changed my life, I took off all bounty related post and started learning. Today my life has completely changed, I have so much knowledge about Crypto in general now, and I'm worth some good thing as far as Bitcoin is concerned. I'm sharing this to inspire every bounty hunters out there, Start a life today is worth more than the penny you alway get from Bounty.Henri, I realized you've not been active for the past 2 years now. But I just want to say a very big thank you for encouraging me.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2357418Also I want to say a very big thank you to every high rank member of the platform, who have always been available, teaching and educating newbies, thanks you so much to you all.",

Well, he got your from the bounty section for sure but, he didn't do much in making you post more useful contents on the forum. 6 months is such a long time and looking at the way you've come since then, I think your way behind for 6 months.My advice for you now is that, you don't make your stay on the forum about hunting. Just a while ago you were bounty hunting and now, your hunting for merits. You'll hardly go too far with such habit. Try and see ways to self develop in terms of how you can impact on the forum.You fancy yourself an asset but I can say you ar hardly any just yet. Should a vote contest be held on the forum, your votes at the moment  don't count. Now that doesn't project you for the asset you fancy yourself to be does it.",

The best part of your post is the line that advise newbies to abstain from bounty threads. They're no harm in passing along the same message that changed you and improved your knowledge of cryptocurrency. But, you could have done more by elaborating the advice so that it'll be understandable by the newbies. Next time when you decide to create threads try to keep it simple and easy to understand. The topic and article doesn't match, I thought you had a detailed advice to share but it was more of an appreciation thread. Don't stop creating contents but stop if you can't keep it quality as it'll make no difference from your bounty days. Keep posting quality thread as an atonement to the spammy bounty threads you made in the past.",

If you're going to make some sort of \"diary\" about your life here in the forum, just make a self-moderated thread in Reputation section.

To be frankly speaking, coming to this forum for the sole purpose of bounty hunting was not an entire bad idea, but continueing even after knowing it'ss not worth the effect is where the big problem lies, because i once did bounty hunting and most big ranks today once did it at their early stages, which is normal, but we later came to realise that it was stressful and worthless in terms of value, and that was when we had a reshift to creating valuable contents which has taken us to the leavel we are today.

A merit he sent to you was to encourage you to make a valuable post and get involved in the forum than focusing more on bounties. You only have one merit and the one he sent to you, making it two.

Yes i believe many came here with different motives and mindset to either work and earn money or either from bounty promotion or rendering services to people around but that doesn't mean everyone must end the same, so put away every barrier and study hard to know the benefits of this forum, to tell you the truth from my end, since i discovered the educational benefits in this forum i never skip any day without visiting here or reading things around forum because i know too well that this forum carries more information i can think off. There are some information i found here but can't find them in google that is to say this platform is really loaded with bunches of information that takes you to study and learn about bitcoin, altcoin and blockchain at large.Running a bounty is like restricting yourself to a particular spot or not even devoting time to read and study other things because bounty is time consuming and you must meet up to rules otherwise no rewards for you at end of the week.",
