      "body": "That's a topic with potential, brings back some memories.I can't remember exactly which purchase was my first, but I think it was a mining contract at bit-miner.com. Of course, purchases of some altcoins were among the first as well. There was also a website (I can't recall its name) that was selling some sorts of shares in various projects, some of them would pay dividends etc. Obviously it was all unregulated with zero protection, all based on trust.As for physical items, if my memory is not failing me, I think it was some USB memory sticks, which I didn't really need, but just wanted to buy something with BTC and there was quite large computer equipment online store in the UK that just started accepting bitcoins.",

      "body": "I can't say how much joy it brought me for my first purchase. But I have a very good memory for my special event purchase, which was the one I got myself last year as a birthday gift. I cherish it because it's the first time I've gifted myself an asset as a birthday gift and not a liability.It's been a year now, and I'm still holding it strong. I don't actually have any plans of spending or selling it out any time soon, and I don't even have any Budget for it either for now.But maybe I could possibly have to spend it on a special occasion. That's when the Bitcoin price might have pumped to the point where I would no longer be greedy but would take profit and spend it on something that could be remarkable for me.",

If you hodl, will you ever spend your btc ?If I remember correctly, my first purchase using Bitcoin was when I bought a good laptop for work. The transaction went smoothly and I was really happy with my purchase because I needed that laptop desperately. At that time, I didn't have a job and I couldn't even afford it. It was one of the best investments I made because I needed the laptop for various tasks, both for work and for school related stuff.Quote from: Becassine on June 27, 2023, 08:22:00 PMIf you're a dreamer, what would be your dream ?I would say, My dream is to hold at least 21 bitcoins in my wallet. For me it's a lot of money, and I hope to achieve this goal before pursuing other objectives. I know that this sum may not be really a lot for wealthier members in this forum, but it would truly be an extraordinary accomplishment to have such a great amount of BTC in my wallet.Probably later, I'll just open my own business related to bitcoin and crypto in general.",

After that though, I buy some other things like gadgets, TV, and so on. The most impactful purchase is definitely my laptop. It allows me to work more efficiently, with lower electricity consumption and allows me to venture into content creation and stuff like that.
