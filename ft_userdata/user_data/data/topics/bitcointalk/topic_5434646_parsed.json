As we know, Bitcoin has moved in cycles and it likely to keeo doing so. People are aware about it and try to anticipate the next bull run. Since Bitcoin has started to get very bullish in 2023, many people are getting FOMO, probably.  In addition, Bitcoin is increasingly held by people planning to HODL Bitcoin for a long period. That's removing supply from the market causing BTC price to go up. As Hispo corrently mentioned it's also a result from several good news. Good news from USA, FED, Inflation, Economy and Investors taking more risks again. After all, Crypto is likely to be a great innovation. And finally, the next Bitcoin Block halving is just about 1 year from now.  Quote from: Stella Mese on January 14, 2023, 12:55:52 AMbut I want to ask is bitcoin going to a bull run, or is it just a trap,?Nobody knows because if we'd know, we could just take a credit and buy more Bitcoin, repay our credit later and keep our gains.",

I still suspect this is a trap created to manipulate market sentiment. When people wait for a new bottom of bitcoin, they will make bitcoin go up, people will be very impatient and maybe in the coming days bitcoin will continue to rise to hit people's greed make people buy bitcoin for fear of missing the train. So I still think this is more of a trap than a sign of the bull season.",

If you look at the price history over the past decade you can see many situations like this which can be described best as reverse bubbles and just like a regular bubble they pop too because the price is unrealistically low and to reach balance the market has to \"correct\" itself by going back up.The US CPI report may have had some psychological effects on this but it is not the main reason specially since it is well known that they changed the way they calculate inflation so that they can manipulate the numbers and pretend it has gone down while it is still high. After all this is more than 30% price rise. A simple fake news about inflation can not cause such a big rise specially ccould not break a strong resistance such as $20k.From reddit",

Usually it has to be retested the bottom even real bottom was touched and I think Bitcoin will retest its $16,000 bottom range again.Halving is still very far and with more than one year before a next halving, Bitcoin will have other crashes to retest weak hands, dump pressure from weak hands.
