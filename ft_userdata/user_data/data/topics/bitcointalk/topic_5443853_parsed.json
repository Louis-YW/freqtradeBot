  "content": "Currently Bitcointalk provide total number of views of each thread in any section. This feature is available without any extension and no need of any other third party help. I am thinking of total number of view of each reply. Is it possible to see how many times our reply has been seen by unique users?it will look like this. Below is imaginary look of post and total number of views counter has been added. First one is sample view counter----------------------------------------------------------------------If we want to see Users list who seen our post then it will look like below but i think it is against decentralization --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------USER will be shown in this way--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I checked all extension and websites provided by users but this feature not available anywhere. Now my question is; Is it possible to check view through any extension or Only Theymos can add this view feature in Bitcointalk?",

      "body": "How would you measure a view to a reply within a thread? The replies are all loaded at once, and as far as I know you wouldn't be able to differentiate between loading the page, and scrolling over a post. You could potentially get individual post counts for each page, but I don't see the benefit to that. At least, not with the current forum software, and the languages it uses. Possibly to add something like this with Javascript or React. However, it would drastically change how forum pages are loaded. It's a pretty huge undertaking, and affects things like ignored users too.Also, as for the suggestion of showing who's viewed your posts; some users probably prefer to have privacy of what they're viewing, and therefore not made public. Obviously, the forum likely logs what you're viewing, but for that information to be public? I imagine it'd cause more drama than being useful, especially when concerning scam accusations, and what not. It's a pretty insubstantial thing to add which probably wouldn't have too many uses, and those that did use it probably wouldn't use it beyond it being a gimmick, and would likely forget it even exists after the initial novelty factor has worn off. Also, displaying a ton of users would likely limit the usefulness of it anyhow, since thousands of users could be viewing your thread. Quote from: Rikafip on March 07, 2023, 08:53:37 AMYou misunderstood OP, he wants to see how many views each post had and not how many posts someone made in specific topic.Which, would take a whole lot of work to get that to display. How, would you even determine what counts as a view. Someone, opening a thread, and then exiting isn't exactly viewing all the posts to a thread. Quote from: rat03gopoh on March 07, 2023, 09:45:50 AMHow is 1 point added? 1 page contains 20 lines of posts and do you mean every person who viewed 1 post also adds 19 posts on that page 1 point each? And what about when displaying posts via profile history?Suppose the number of views is considered a new parameter for knowing how interested people are in a post, spammers will think their posts are constructive.Right, however even if you determined scrolling down, and the post being read by the user; programming that would be difficult, I'm not even sure there's much you can do for it unless you want to heavily impact the performance of the forum. Usually, the forums pages are loaded, and then that's it. There's no dynamic element to it, whereas this would require a dynamic page in order to look out for certain actions that would count as a view.

However, ultimately what matters to them is that sales are going up, since they've been advertising. However, signatures definitely work; I've gotten many personal messages asking for more information about what's in my signature. The same problem exists though, without drastically changing how the forum functions; this wouldn't be possible, since at the moment every page is loaded at the same time, and therefore every reply is loaded at the same time. You don't need to actually read/view a reply for it to count in the current implementation. Quote from: hosseinimr93 on March 07, 2023, 08:47:50 AMI think it not's possible to implement that at all. I don't think there is any way for the forum to know whether the user who visited the thread scrolled down to read your reply or not. It's only possible to know how many users visited the thread. Possible with Javascript, but not with php as far as I know. I think it goes without saying why we don't want to see Javascript being added to the forum just for the sake of a cosmetic feature. Most users here likely have Javascript disabled, which would technically render this feature useless anyhow.",

Plus, there usefulness is likely diminished past a few weeks anyhow.

However, I can't remember the default implementation of Simple Machines software. Although, that doesn't matter, as I pointed out the privacy page suggests that this sort of information is stored, albeit not for very long. While it's not specific, I suspect the two entries: Quote Log of all viewed topics  Quote Page-by-page access logs and most other detailed logging Suggests this information is stored, but not what the OP was requesting, i.e a view counter for each post made in a thread.
