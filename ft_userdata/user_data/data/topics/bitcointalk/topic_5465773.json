      "body": "My Honest MegaPariReviewUser ID: 681080073REGISTRATIONI would ¬†say that the Registration ¬†is a very quick and seamless one and it could be done in just few minutes if not seconds and I've been using the casino for some time now but had to create a new account for the sake of the review and I wanted using the phone number option but no code was sent to my phone after several attempts and had to switch to the email option and it went through successfully.BONUSThere was an option to use a promo code on registration which I did by using the promo code \"BITCOINTALK\" and since I was sensitive this time, I ensured to use the code rather than waiting to use it after registration.DEPOSITI wanted to try something different ¬†with deposit this time and since I've used cryptocurrency(bitcoin) for deposit in the previous time, I had to try the fiat and from my observation, ¬†you must have to link your phone number to the casino before making deposit through fiat but I like the deposit processes as it was very quick but it took some time to reflect on my account but I understand that it has to pass through some approvals unlike the cryptocurrency options.SPORTBOOKYou guys dis great with the sport book and it was easier for me to navigate through but I don't think it will be that easy for a first timer, hence some improvements should be made on the graphics.BETSLIPI also noticed that the betslip is really hidden and obvious or really visible and it should ¬†be made visible for people to easily access it.CASINO+ GAMES SECTIONWell I've always known that I'm not really lucky enough on casinos and that's why I don't ensure them because most times I feel is luck based over skills and I also tried playing ¬†the roulette and I lost everything to it ¬†but I think all games are fair and I don't play virtuals except for fun but you'll agree that there's no fun in losing money.WITHDRAWALSI'm still waiting withdrawal as my games are still pending but from my previous experience, ¬†I think the withdrawal is as quick as the deposit and I haven't experienced any issues with withdrawals so far.GENERALEXPERIENCEI would say that it was a great experience ¬†with MegaPari and the customer service were very prompt with their response and that's a big thumbs for me and your site is great and colorful but I think the colors were too much and almost not making it clear and you shoukd improve the graphics as well as make the betslip more visible.SUMMARYI had no single issue while using MegaPari but I think I should bring to your notice that the email sent to me for validation was received ¬†in my spam box and not inbox and that's ¬†not really nice.",

      "body": "MegaPari ReviewReviewer: DavidvictorsonMegaPari user ID: 680587257Date of registration: 10 September 2023Amount of Deposit: 10 USD using USDTWithdrawal Request Date: 11 September 2023Withdrawal Received: 11 September 2023Overview of the MegaPari InterfaceI like the MegaPari interface. The dark theme, the different games and categories, live chat and personal account are easy to find. Also, the about us, contact information, terms and conditions, payment methods and contact information can be found at the right side of the page. Registration and DepositThere were different options for registration. Before then, I noticed it already provided the country I am visiting from using my IP(I guess). It makes me wonder if people in countries where gambling is ban will be automatically blocked by the casino website. I registered using my email option for privacy reasons. I provided my email, created a password and entered the promo code which the review manager had provided on the thread. I verified my account through the link provided to me through email. I got the MegaPari user ID: 680587257 I proceeded to fill out the information on my personal profile page. It included, the security question, mobile phone number (I was link my phone number to my account as part of the verification process. A code was sent to my mobile number via sms.), full name date of birth, country, city, place of birth, permanent address.PROMO CODEWhen I entered the promo code BITCOINTALK in the field provided in the account setting section, I got an error message that the promocode is invalid. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do so I proceeded to just make a deposit. DEPOSITI used the cryptocurrency option for deposit even though there was a wide array of options including depositing in my local currency. I am a big crypto believer and I also didn‚Äôt want to encounter any issues making deposit in my local currency so I used USDT. I made a deposit of $12 in USDT and the deposit was visible in my account in about 5 minutes and message stating that the deposit and that I had received 100% First deposit bonus credited to my account.EXPEREINCE OF THE SPORTS BOOKSWhile I was logged in, I selected football which is the sport I wanted to bet on then I browsed the wide range of markets. I chose to bet on matches in the UEFA European Championship 2024. I placed multiple bets by selecting the odds I wanted to bet on and it was added to my bet slip which appeared on the right hand side. The bed slip loaded my selection and my stake at the bottom of the page which showed my returns.EXPERIENCE OF THE CASINOMegaPari, has an excellent variety of games from different game providers games and game providers can easily be found under the slots. I tried my luck with the Buccaneer, Hot Fruits on Fire, and other slot games.  WITHDRAWAL EXPERIENCE WITH MEGAPARIThe withdrawal was pretty straight forward. When I requested for a it, I got a pop up saying that I had an active bonus and to withdraw funds, I must either complete the bonus wagering requirements or reject it. I chose the option that best for me. I enter my USDT(TRC 20) wallet address and waited for the withdrawal. Surprisingly, it wasn't instant as I had to wait for some hours... I was getting worried so I sent a message to the live agent but it took more than 20 mins to get a response. I expected it because they had said already. EXPERIENCE ABOUT NAVIGATING IN DIFFERENT PAGES AND EXCLUSIVE SUMMARY OF YOUR JOURNEY WITH MEGAPARI1. No KYC on funds withdrawal. I like it but if they are going to ask for it sometime later, they could as well start from the beginning. The only KYC I submitted if it counts at all was my phone number.2. No BTC withdrawal or deposit option. Why? 3. Would be happy if withdrawal is as fast as deposits. Maybe there is a reason for this but this is my first time experiencing this delay and I got very worried.4. MegaPari website has a well-designed front page and easy navigation helpful and responsive live chat.5. I liked the wide array of games and game providers.6. My rating is an 8.",
