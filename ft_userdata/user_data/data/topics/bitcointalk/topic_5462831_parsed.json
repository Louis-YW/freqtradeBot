  "content": "This year's FPL is upon us, with the first game week starting in less than 24 hours.The likes of stake.com and sportsbet.io had offered it's customers these last few years the possibility to join their private mini league with some very generous prizes.Unfortunately this year we haven't received any news that there will be another private league from stake or SB.As a big fan of FPL I am in the hunt for similar private mini leagues.If someone is aware of such promotions, it would be great to share the information with the community.Looking forward to another exciting FPL season and best of luck to all managers.",

      "body": "If you haven't registered already, There's a mini league with a prize pool hosted by Trofo and ICOpress but there's a little caveat - an entry fee of 2mbtc. That and the Duelbits FPL promotion should be good to go for this season. There's still time before GW1 kickoff so we might still have some new promotion coming up here and there. Fingers crossed.",
