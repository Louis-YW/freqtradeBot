  "content": "Even though I've used BTC Achieved previously, I had yet to learn that BTC would reach such heights. But at the time, I was confident that BTC would improve. But could the query that emerged within truly get to it at a favorable angle? Then, after much research, I discovered that it would have a favorable position and be the only coin to outperform all the others. The price of Bitcoin was meager in 2013 when I purchased some.Key highlights of 2013:In 2013, the value of Bitcoin increased by +5,575%, peaking at $1,156 in December.Highest price: $1,156Lowest price: $13.30The price at the start of 2013 was $13.30Price at the end of 2013: $755This is when my bitcoin arrived. It would have been better if I had held that lovely moment. But I was unable to succeed. I stumbled but didn't break. It was unimaginable then that the price would increase by so much.I had yet to learn that I would get Bitcoin in this manner in 2024. However, I did what I thought I could. You'll be pleased to learn that I succeeded in this circular game by honing my cunning. Even though I had previously received Bitcoin, this time was different. Right now, my passion is fulfilled. I also own bitcoin. I hope, something extraordinary will come from this, and I hope for something lovely in 2024.I want to talk to people who received Bitcoin and hear their emotions.The most important thing to remember is that everything is achievable with the correct talent and hard work. I did as I knew I could.Because we had a long journey together, I shared my good times and good news with you.However, you'll accomplish something worthwhile later on. Greetings and best wishes to all.Ultimately, I am grateful that this forum helped me find and learn things I didn't know or needed to know when I needed to. Here, after posing questions, more experienced members gracefully express their opinions. I will always appreciate this forum.I also received three Bitcoins in small form from the 2013 giveaway. I find it surprising when I consider it. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=197242.msg2052534#msg2052534https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=259656.msg2928891#msg2928891Always keep your holding hidden Thank You",

Many things have changed since 2013, and Bitcoin has become more influential and well-known than the Silk Road. Dark activities have decreased, and its use in speculation and as a long-term investment has increased. Therefore, perhaps we will see stability starting in 2050, and then we will look to the past (2023) and say that Bitcoin has changed completely.",

I disagree that the illegal stuff has gone down, maybe in bitcoin but there's definitely more people that's using crypto for really nefarious stuff. I don't think stability will ever be a thing for bitcoin though, I still believe it's going to be volatile as ever, that's one thing I believe will never change.",

You're among the lucky ones and there are many such people who have got Bitcoin when it was cheaper and now holding it in hopes that it will reach $1M per coin. I hope that Bitcoin will surely amaze us when we see its price at $1M, and by then many holders will have financial freedom.",

      "body": "Knowing about Bitcoin early is not just important to me but the ability to believe in the coin and keep hodling it for a long time. Many people were lucky to acquire Bitcoin very cheaply but they ended up losing, wasting or even selling it before it became influential. So I have so much respect for people who kept their coin to date. I was not that lucky to be part of these old-timers but in a few years, many people will also call me a lucky person because of the extent Bitcoin might go. The message that we should keep holding looks insignificant but I think this is also the same message that was been spread a long time ago but many people failed to maximize their opportunity.

I don't think stability will ever be a thing for bitcoin though, I still believe it's going to be volatile as ever, that's one thing I believe will never change.Before now Bitcoin was generally perceived by the mainstream financial system as a currency that is mostly used to finance crime. But these views have gradually changed over time and we have seen Bitcoin become acceptable by the governments of some influential nations. Before now, nobody believed that the SEC would ever approve the spot Bitcoin ETF because Bitcoin was highly associated with crime. Therefore, people might still be using it for criminal activities but the perception that it is majorly used for finance crime has changed.",

      "body": "It's over a decade and it's true that HB said that many things have changed already. From that time, when there was no help of the mainstream media and financial institutions adopting it. If you'll think about how the community was like a peaceful community and living in the woods by that time and seems like a rural community that don't have modern things yet. But as time passes by, the adoption has grown, the mainstream has come and more people have been onboarded and these woods of the past became buildings and hello to the new and modern world of finance. During that time in the past, people talked about the massive adoption including these known fintech companies. And now that they're onboarded, many talks about what they're bringing on the table for centralizing and manipulating the market for holding more BTCs.",

The changes it went through since that 2013 have been pretty impressiveIndeed, there is a great change since 2013 till date, which is 11yrs. The market value and the rate of adoption and the technology too has improved. Now people prefer to see it as a commodity than currency, but one thing that hasn't changed, is the activities that they use bitcoin for.This is because humans are still humans and  haven't changed to something else. Dark activities is in the nature of human, but I believe that this time it is done in more civilized manner to avoid any traces, I mean in an upgraded way.OP, you are very lucky to have being in bitcoin since 2013, and from your testimony, you are happy that you took the bold step to invest in bitcoin very early.",

But boom, the market remains very positive that time as online casinos become the \"norm\" for gamblers, playing at home and Bitcoin became the top crypto for deposits.So there's a lot of impressive things, and yeah things have change, but it's for the betterment of Bitcoin and for what's it worth in 2024 and then moving forward in the next decade or so.",
