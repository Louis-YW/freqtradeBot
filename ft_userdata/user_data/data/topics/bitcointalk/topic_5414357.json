From my understanding, you want to withdraw coins from that platform. Only they can help you.2. Keep in mind that not all websites are legit and the fact a website shows some nice numbers it doesn't mean you own that money and you'll be able to withdraw.3. Also, as a warning: if they ask for money in order to process your withdrawal, it's the strongest sign they're trying to scam you.So, contact their support and be overly careful. Good luck!",

If the transaction is already verified, there's sadly nothing you can do to get your funds back and you should obviously not send more funds.Do you mind telling us how you came across this site though? It barely has any online presence.",

Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. It can be a case for the police, but they are not qualified for this and I don't think they'll bother.If you deposited through bank, see at the bank if they can do anything about it.---How on earth did you send money there without asking first? Why you don't just work with known and reputable exchanges?",

This is just the first time that I have tried to withdrawl from the account.If you actually deposited $25k to this website why you didn't research and ask first to many people if this website is legit or not?This is a big amount and I think it's impossible that you didn't research first and ask someone have knowledge about investing someone that you can trust. If I were you I do research first and ask someone that I could trust and knows about them before I deposit. Next time go here on the forum to ask if the website is legit or not before you deposit. I don't where you found this website but based on the backlinks checker(Ahrefs) it only has 2 backlinks with low DA which means it's not popular and not yet shared on blogs and social media accounts except on telegram there are many scammers on telegram be always careful if you receive a message to unknown people out there.",

MOTHERF&@$#RS!!!!!!I'm curious how you started your $25k to find this scam site. If you deposit fiat, it's possible that the fraudster's bank account can be traced with the help of legal authorities. But in reality, these are the types of international crimes that require special investigations and may cost more to have cases handled professionally. Furthermore, don't accept closed offers of help from random people.",

Many scammers are still around you who will try to scam you again. No one can help you except legal authority. You may file a case but it doesn't mean they will succeed.
