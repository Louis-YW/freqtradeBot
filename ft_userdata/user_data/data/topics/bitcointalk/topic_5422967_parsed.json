Over 90% of graduates are not employed because no job. They should first tackle unemployment, making businesses of their own and how private industries can grow and develop to bring up more private industries, instead has been their old fashion way of thinking that can never help the economy.Quote from: knowngunman on November 24, 2022, 11:03:18 AMwhat's your take on this? Can the new notes actually strengthen the economy as claimed by the CBN? Your views please! It is all lies, do not mind the government, they will print money like in the past and they do not have to print more money before they will reduce the value of naira. In the past, money printing are controlled as the CBN was pleased with so would be these new notes.Nigeria almost 75% export product is crude oil, still some are refined outside Nigeria and the oil are sold back to NigeriaNo car companyNo other automobile companyNot producing phone, computer or any other latest technologyShip are imported too, they lrodice noneAs trees are numerous in Nigeria, they import common matches from IndiaThey import generator, no company in Nigeria is manufacturing generatorThey import tiles and many other building materialsNot electricity supply to favour companies, all depending on generatorsWhy won't many Nigerians live below the poverty line Many people that are born in Nigeria as seen hell on earthIt is normal for a country to import, but if too much, it is not helping the economy and the cause of unemployment which Nigeria needs to tackle, but the leaders are not having the quality mindset and education to believe they can do it, but still always depends more than they should.Quote from: The Pharmacist on November 24, 2022, 11:41:15 AMUh....this thread is almost exactly like this one, and I think the discussion has already been had.  Unless new members chime in, you're probably going to get the exact same answers.You might want to consider just locking this thread up, OP.  Anyone please speak up if you disagree.I have written those before I saw your post, I think maybe this thread should be locked. But Nigerian government people like to deceive their citizens, see what the CBN said, that the new notes will help strengthen the economy which is contrary to what is on the thread on your link.",

My take on the matter is that one of the reasons why this will help bolster the economy is, it will first reduce the efficacy of counterfeit, it will checkmate horded and ill gotten cash stacked in hiding by those who can't speak of the means of how it was gotten, it will help close the gap between those who make genuine money vs those who do the opposite and lastly, it will create a euphoria of newness. People like new things, a new cash design is one new gift to the entire nation.",

Can the new notes actually strengthen the economy as claimed by the CBN? Your views please! The watermark looks different. To answer the question, we look to past history. Operation Bernhard of World War II fame was a nazi germany plot to flood, destabilize and destroy great britain's economy by flooding it with counterfeit bills that were indistinguishable from legitimate ones.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_BernhardYears ago back in 2016, millions of counterfeit US currency was seized by the government.Quote$30 Million in Counterfeit U.S. Currency Seized in Historical Secret Service Operation11-17-2016On Nov. 15, 2016, the Peruvian government, along with U.S. Secret Service Agents, executed pre-dawn search and arrest warrants in Lima, Peru. More than 1,500 Peruvian National Police officers were involved in the operation. A total of 54 search warrants were conducted and 48 people were arrested.Thirty million counterfeit U.S. dollars and 50,000 Euros were discovered during the operation. Additionally six counterfeit plants were suppressed, eight counterfeit manufacturing presses seized and over 1,600 printing plates and negatives of varying denominations were found.https://www.secretservice.gov/press/releases/2016/11/30-million-counterfeit-us-currency-seized-historical-secret-serviceIf nigeria's economy is likewise being flooded by fake counterfeit bills as america, europe and other economies of the world are.Then it could help protect their economy to switch up the printing process.Counterfeit bills could also be a significant source of inflation if they're printed and distributed in high volume.",

      "body": "First off, it really doesn't help the economy in a significant way. It doesn't increase the country's economic output in any way. It doesn't help push the GDP upward. It doesn't help in attracting foreign direct investment. It doesn't help increase the manufacturing and the production sector. This could go on.But it helps a little. For example, if the existing design is very prone to counterfeiting, then perhaps changing it could avoid more fake bills coming into the circulation. Or if the materials used are becoming hard to find and expensive or low quality, then a shift to better, cheaper, and more abundant materials could save the government a good amount. It could also mean the bills in use are long-lasting. That also means savings. However, just like in my country, it seems the changing of design is made for no other reason than merely changing its design. It often comes with a new set of leaders. It seems they only want to create their own design. This is completely absurd and is definitely bad for the economy for many reasons.",

I believe countries like Switzerland or USA are great examples of using their money wisely and effectively.",

From the reports I have read on this topic, the currency redesign is actually to boost the money in circulation, of which majority of it where unaccounted for. This means that the banks hold only a little of the nation's available cash, and out of those which are outside the bank, majority are hoarded, for different reasons, and are actually not circulating.This and many other reasons brought about the new for the currency change.To answer your topic title, it doesn't have much of an economic effect imo.",

The official image of how the new note would be has been made public and has been greeted with a frown by Nigerian.What is even funny is how some top directors of agencies in Nigeria feels that the new naira redesign would make the naira have value as to take its value which is at almost 800naira to a dollar to 200naira to a dollar. I think it’s still all about corruption because the figures they have stated as the cost for the design is very much outrageous.",

Considering the fact that it will replace all the currencies available in the country it will take time to replace entire circulation with the new notes. This means people will have to either wait for the long time until they can effectively use the new currency since as soon as new notes are implemented they are going to be valid while others would be invalid. This will dig out black money from the circulation and plus it will help reset the economy within the country if good amount of money is recovered and returned to the governments. However, it has to be done planned and in step by step manner otherwise it could create chaos and disturb the line of action.",

It depends what on underlying purpose that is driving the change really, it will have small effects but the government should definitely consider whether it is worth the cost of all the new banknotes printed out. If you look at counterfeiting for example, there are some highly professional criminals out there (and even countries like North Korea) doing this sort of forging on a large scale, so if your bank note security features are very weak then newer technological advantages could be very beneficial to preventing fraud. That seems to be the primary benefit you could get from a change, although you might get a sweep up of tax avoiders who have hoarded money in notes trying to cash in before the time is up.",

The intention was not to strengthen the economy but to eliminate the possibility of counterfeiting. Apart from preserving the currency as a national symbol other reason for the redesigning of the Nigerian currency can impact the economy positively. When fake currency circulates in an economy it affects the activities of both retailers and wholesaler because most of them might loose money when they are paid with counterfeits. It could also lead to the rejection of the countries currencies in the international market because of the fear of it being fake. The government also raised the concern of more money being in the hands of individuals more than what the bank has which also have some economic effect. There is also a report that the new Naira note is more durable than the former one which would help the government save more money from the cost of reprinting the currency periodically. Nigeria has been challenged recently by an increase in kidnapping for ransom. This criminal activities have led to poor economic activities in most parts of Nigeria. It has scared investors and even led to the closure of many businesses. The CBN stated that this new currency has some security features that would make it difficult for it to be used for ransom payment. There is nothing bad in redesigning the Naira since it is long overdo but Nigerians are concerned about the timing of this policy. Nigeria as well as other countries is going through so much economic challenges that has made her to depend on borrowing to finance even recurrent expenditure. People are suggesting that this policy should be dropped until when the economy recovers.",
