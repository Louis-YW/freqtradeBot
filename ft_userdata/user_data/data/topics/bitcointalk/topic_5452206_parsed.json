This is just to fix the bug; it will not affect the BRC-20 token holders since they already have nearly a billion dollars in market capitalization, according to the last statistics I saw online. But it's for the best; let the network be free, and stop this who whose transaction is to be recorded first on the block competition.Quote from: Outhue on May 10, 2023, 06:40:38 AMAlso is it advisable to start receiving Bitcoin payment straight to your exchange? What disadvantages comes with doing so? About the direct payment into an exchange wallet, not everyone likes paying to an exchange wallet; a lot of people are highly against centralized exchanges and, as such, don't want to engage in anything that will promote them in any way.Another thing is that once payment is received, not everyone will want to exchange their payment immediately, so sending them all to an exchange account is unwise. I might want to spend and reserve part of my payment on my private wallet, but sending it directly to an exchange account will kill that motive.",

      "body": "This ordinal has saturated the Bitcoin network and it should be regulated or even if it needs to be stopped because it is detrimental for people who want to transact Bitcoin but are subject to unreasonable fees. Even from the sources I read, Domo himself actually created this just for experimentation and people don't need to take this seriously. However, this seems to have stimulated many people to develop it, especially from a miner's point of view, with the existence of this ordinal, it has made them quite profitable as transactions and fees have skyrocketed. Some even claim that this ordinal effect has caused a \"civil war\" between BTC Core developers, miners, and ordinal holders.Quote from: Outhue on May 10, 2023, 06:40:38 AM-snip-Also is it advisable to start receiving Bitcoin payment straight to your exchange? What disadvantages comes with doing so? Actually it doesn't matter, but are you willing to exchange platform holding your money? are you sure that it will be safe on the exchange? are you ready to accept the risk that at any time the exchange will go bankrupt and your bitcoin assets will be lost? Of course there are many reasons why accepting payments directly on exchanges is not wise, although according to some people it is more efficient because they can directly exchange their bitcoins without sending them, but I personally prefer to hold them myself in my personal wallet.",

      "body": "That would be a great step taken by developers if they agree to cancel the ordinals because there isn't a need for such protocol in Bitcoin blockchain and it's just an extra burden on the blockchain. The useless tokens and NFT's have no place in the Bitcoin blockchain and developers should definitely take some actions to prevent those useless protocols. I believe that it's a great move if accomplished because it will reduce the burden on blockchain and the transaction fees will be fixed with the implementation. The ordinals are just a way to spam the blockchain with useless transactions and there is no need for such things in Bitcoin blockchain. Well, that depends on the preference of a users if someone is willing to receive Bitcoin payments straight to his/her exchange account then there isn't anything wrong in that approach. The disadvantage that I can currently think of is the withdrawals that the exchanges can put on. Without their permission the user can not withdraw the bitcoins and that's a huge drawback. Other than that I don't think that anything is wrong when someone takes payments directly into the exchange accounts.Even in some cases it is the preferable choice for the payments as it's very easy to exchange the bitcoins into stable coins through the exchanges. And, with p2p trading one can easily withdraw that money into their bank account without any worries. But, if someone is strongly against exchanges and don't want to be controlled by anyone then it's better to withdraw the funds in his/her personal wallet.",

As for using exchange to get paid,it is a good idea because when you think of the high fee that you will pay to transfer your coins from your private wallet to an exchange and the time taken. On the other hand,you should also know that these exchanges are centralized and can't be trust with your funds because we have seen so many crashes of some exchanges and even banks,so how are you sure that your bitcoin will be safe with them. Can you still remember that Binance is also passing through this ordinals attack and Binance wants to embrace Lightening Network for them to overcome this congestion in the mempool. It is only a better idea,if you want to withdraw all your weekly pay in your local currency. If you are the type that only accumulates your weekly pay,then it is a very bad idea.",

Developers were already having serious deliberations on this to either remove it or provide a solution to it, but what seems to be the majority choice is the total elimination becsu they don't want bitcoin to be associated with anything that has to do with NFT first, secondly they are also playing smart to avoid any chances that could prevent the bitcoin network attacked through this, so if we are going by the vote or individual support on this, almost everyone will kick against ordinals.Quote from: Outhue on May 10, 2023, 06:40:38 AMAlso is it advisable to start receiving Bitcoin payment straight to your exchange?

My personal opinion: I don't think receiving payment straight to your exchange is a wise decision. Exchanges are a place to exchange bitcoin, not a place to store bitcoin, whether it's a centralized or decentralized exchange. When you receive payment with fiat currency, it goes straight to your bank account, it should be that way with BTC. See your wallet as your own personal account that you own and control, it's also your responsibility to keep it safe, so all payments should go to your wallet first, then if you want to trade/exchange you can move them to the exchange you use.",

Then the Brc20 or ordinals are actually not applicable for Bitcoin.    they appear to be confusing to the concept of bitcoin, Bitcoin is not designed for that kind of thing, in my opinion even what was done by brc20 or ORC20 they are more applicable in ERC20. Then, that's why the bitcoin developers actually put a stop to that. That's good they'll do that in my opinion.",
