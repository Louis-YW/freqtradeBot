That's the word that I can say because many have failed with their predictions last year. Think of this year as a fresh start of the bear market and it's likely to be staying that long.Which means that I'm not expecting bitcoin and altcoins to be that up in the end of this year. We've got 2 months to go until this year ends but with that timeframe.It's likely that many things might still happen unexpectedly.",

It is very difficult to know which altcoin will be higher because it depends on how much support people have. Maybe we'll see the pump and dump that will happen to some altcoins, but we'd better wait. Or perhaps an altcoin that has a low price could be the one that will go higher later.",

But if you ask about my prediction, I think we are still in a red eye at the end of the year, the market will not rise or recover at the end of the year as long as the war persists or the inflation persists.It seems that it will be so considering that up to now the market conditions still look the same,we better be realistic so as not to be disappointed in the future,the important thing is to stay patient to wait for the bull market",

Investing in bitcoin, I think you should find long-term predictions that will be better than short and medium-term. Maybe bitcoin will not rise at the end of the year but if you want to invest long term then you can believe bitcoin will rise and hit new ATH in the future, maybe in 2024-2025 we will see that. If you want short term investment then you should make your own prediction and take responsibility for your decision as no one can tell you short term bitcoin price.",

But naturally the price could increase or decrease before the end of the year, it's something you and I can't control or predict so as holder what you should do is to invest in bitcoin maybe after bitcoin halving we can see another ATH which could also affect the altcoin price to surge as bitcoin price keeps increasing.",

Hence you are better off holding mid-cap alt coins in a strong bull market rather than bitcoin. However the opposite is true when we are in a bear market. You are better off holding bitcoin because altcoins can go to 99% losses.Same with sideways markets, bitcoin can stay the same price but altcoins can go down 99%.",

Don't be pressured with a time frame, The market may go up or come down further by the year's end which is the time you have given it. know that if there's barely nothing certain, one certain thing is that the prices will not remain the same.",

Don't just expect of what the other said or what you heard since they can't determine what would be the price by the end of the year or in the future there's no one who can predict the price. And expectations will lead to speculating prices that's somehow beneficial to the traders because they will take advantage of it.",

They will think twice if they buy and hodl longer but most likely many of them will continue selling.We can't accurately predict bitcoin on our own but we can use the factors around us as a guide to help us predict closer to what we are predicting. Long predictions for bitcoin are surely positive so if we are long term investor then it gives encouragement to stick with our plans. Short term are full of risk and discouragement so it's hard to be successful on it.",

Though this market is very unpredictable and the trend can change anytime, we can only rely to it’s previous trend but it’s hard to know the future. Bitcoin and altcoin market can take a different way to end the year, just continue to analyze and position on a good prices, you can still make money here whatever the trend is.",

In my personal opinion, Bitcoin price is possible to increase by around $23k - $25k at the end of this year. However, it can happen if there are good news that can trigger the price to increase. But if too many bad news, the price can drop again below $20k.",

Bitcoin and altcoins will but bitcoin will not increase a lot. Im thinking about possible price for bitcoin at the end of this year. 30k might be possible by seeing the current price of bitcoin which has been surpassing 21k. it doesn't need a lot of time for bitcoin to go back again to the 30k price. Altcoins will be doing even higher than bitcoin caused by altcoins have low marketcap with more possibility to increase even higher compared with bitcoin. Quote from: Bazzu on October 30, 2022, 07:14:40 AMand if there is an increase in the price of an altcoin, do you think which altcoin will rise higher?yes, i do and why not? Bitcoin's price increase gonna triggering the price of all crypto in the market. Even you can also expect shit tokens being affected by the recovery of bitcoin. Bitcoin is a key to pump whole of altcoins at the same time. The price of altcoins are actually rely with bitcoin at this moment. If bitcoin does it and then altcoins too.
