There have already been several cases of different smart contract hacks ( Polygon ,  BSC , and others) in which the hackers penetrated the system, minting some altcoins from nowhere and pushing them into the market. Like I said earlier in a similar post, anything that is being programmed is hackable; any little mistake from the developers can be used against them. For now, Bitcoin is the online Blockchain that I have not come across or read anything about being hacked before. I believe this is as a result of the developers, who are working very hard to upgrade and fix any bugs discovered in the system that could lead to it being hacked.",

If the code from which the blockchain is built, is weak and exploited by hackers, big problems can occur.I believe you are talking about 51% attacks, not back deeply into the blockchain code. With 51% attack, cost is high and you have small chance to maintain that high hashrate too long time. Miners, nodes when detect the issue will reconfig and switch their miners to other mining pools. Exchanges will quickly detect such attacks and halt all deposits and withdrawals so chance to succeed is not too big.",

If the mining hashrate is not significant enough and 50% more, no attack. If it is more 50% than the rest of the miners, there would be 51% attack. In the past, some blockchains are attacked this way. This has been the only attack that I have known in which blockchain was hacked.",

Because Coin has its own blockchain while token depend on others blockchain. which indicates, that only those blockchain will be hack that are made on other blockchain. TO understand this you must have the knowledge of different types of Blockchain and limitations of them.Because the Blockchain which is depending on other blockchain and could not exit independently. Such blockchain's developer are not giving any top level efforts to make them because such blockchains are made when the budget is low and you just have to launch a token which is new like a defi token maybe.And yes, blockchain cannot be hack take an example of BTC blockchain but the the features of Blockchain can be tampered using smart contracts and other stuff like insertion of data.",

But it is not possible, because you will have to capture fifty-one percent of the computers, and this is not possible. So bitcoin and ether cannot be hacked. They are time-tested. If we go back to the bad code, I remember that there was news that the Polygon was hacked like that. As an example. An excellent blockchain that allowed us all to publish NFT for a meager payment. But it turned out to be vulnerable to hackers.",

The Blockchain is not possible to hack but hacking the wallet is possible and that's why some people lose their crypto if they are not careful. Keeping the phrase or private key is not about the blockchain itself but what it used to connect to the blockchain so that you can do transactions. There are attacks to the blockchain like the 51% attack and 51% attack is not about private keys or seed phrase. You are giving wrong information mate.",

This is difficult, but it is just one point of failure.Banks can be robbed without going directly to the vault, because some of the money is kept in what you might call \"hot drawers\". In addition, the bank can be hacked in a way that you hack into their system and start emptying their clients' accounts - or you don't even have to do any of that, it is enough to collect information from bank cards and then with fake cards to withdraw cash at ATMs. When you take all this into account, it turns out that it is far easier to \"hack\" a bank, and very difficult to hack a serious system like Bitcoin blockchain.Of course people are confused and ask questions like OP, but blockchain is a general term, and the fact that some blockchains have been hacked just means that some people and their projects were nowhere near the level of security that Bitcoin has.",

It is neither decentralized nor centralized on its own. The cryptocurrency project using the blockchain can use it in a centralized way or a decentralized way and neither of these affects the ability to hack it or not.Of course when you say \"hack\" your definition is not clear, there are many different types of attacks. For example one of them is the 51% attack that was covered. Other attacks involve finding exploits in the protocol used in that cryptocurrency to do something you are not supposed to do like taking other people's money. This obviously depends on which cryptocurrency we are talking about. For example there has not been any such vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol to allow people to do something like that, however altcoins are filled with such vulnerabilities. The most popular one is Ethereum that has a smart contract protocol that can easily be exploited like what happened with DAO and many others that came after it.",
