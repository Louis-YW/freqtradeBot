As the name of the button says, when I click on it I see a list of topics where I posted before and where new posts were made by others. This way I am sure I am not missing anything from those threads. Some may call it old fashion, but I got used with getting updated in this way.In rest, I have a bunch of boards which I'm usually checking, although I may not make any post there. But I have this list of board in my head everyday so I'm checking them naturally, not by consulting a file and see which boards I checked already and which I have to still check. For example, I am going through Bitcoin Discussion, Romanian board, Meta, Beginners & Help, Reputation, Scam Accusation, Collectibles etc. So although I'm not always posting there there are my favorite boards and I'm always checking the activity on them.And, in rest, the button \"Show new replies to your posts\" helps me to see all the topics where I wrote before and which have new activity.",
