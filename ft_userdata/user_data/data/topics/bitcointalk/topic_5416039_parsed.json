  "content": "When i started gambling in 2014 the crypto casinos was divided by On-Chain and Off-Chain, and the difference was big:On-Chain:This was a betting engine where users place bets by sending bitcoin or other coins to the betting address, this kind of casinos didn't need users or accounts to let people gamble:*Your bet was placed with a transaction.*The profit was received on the betting address.*Users had to wait for 1 confirmation to avoid double spends.Off-Chain:This are the kind of casinos we see nowadays, where you make a deposit and you can withdraw, but you need an account.The On-Chain games are not longer available, and for the Off-Chain now the rules has changed. So, it would be nice to have a new ways to catalog the new casinos. Some ideas i have are:*High Rollers Casinos.Those casinos who allow users to make withdrawals bigger than 10BTC.*No License Casinos casinos.Those casinos that has been operating for years but without a license. *Traps casinos.This are those casinos who offer big deposit bonus but in their TOS they only allow small amounts on the withdrawals each month.which category would you add?",

      "body": "Onchain would been preferred most but it also has its own disadvantage, from your explanation your deposit address must be the withdrawal address and if it happened you don't want to send back your withdrawal to that same address, does it mean your withdrawal might declined?Then on offchain, we know these are account which might likely required kyc to withdraw a bigger amount and most users who gambles are afraid of releasing their personal information to such sites more especially those who wants to make deposit of BTC in large volume does not want to undergo lot of kyc process for security.Thought they all have their benefits and both are really essential in terms of comparism.",

You can go to the no KYC casinos and read their ToS to know what I am talking about. They will still indicate that they can require any of their users to to KYC at any time. Also no KYC casinos can just one day make KYC mandatory.",

True, this was the main problem for that kind of casinos, most of them allow users to place bets without confirmations, and that ended with a double spend attack making those sites loose tons of coins.In the end those sites didn't have more option than make users wait 1 confirmation for their bets, but the problem comes when users pay low fees and their transactions get stuck waiting for multiple blocks. i see some users waiting up to 6 hours and more for one bet. That wasn't cool at all.",

Sadly no one is launching this kind of casino. The secondstrade was the best that I have played in the past where we could instantly get the amount upon winning.With regulations, there is offchain. Off-chain is where the possibility that we can't withdraw our coins when a casino looks at your account.",

(That was with the original Bitcoin ... but I think it will work better with side-chains like the Lightning Network) I will suggest that you add a category for sites that have only Casino games and one with a added Sports betting side. That way, people do not have to signup for all the casinos, if they want Sports betting Crypto casinos too.",

I guess maybe the On chain was taken advantage of by individuals or maybe it wasn't so profitable for the casino's hence the change. Regardless, it is a good thing that the casino business is where it is today, and from your cataloging, even though I cannot really contribute to it, I would say it is worth the category a casino falls under before use.",

For now, the category most looking for by middle-lower gamblers is bonuses, the more bonuses and competition events etc, the more popular regardless of KYC or not.",
