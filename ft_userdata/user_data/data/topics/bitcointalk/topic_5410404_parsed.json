The fees that was being charged was also very small. i think that there was no problem with it. There are some coins that were offering zero fees transaction for that but since it was getting less accepted by merchant and what will you do? Force them to accept it? Using the application like binance pay is also very very useful as this is also supporting so many things with low fees. For me fees was not a problem as long as it's still affordable rather than only using specific coin to buy in online store but only a few that accept it",

You still need to convert crypto to fiat to be able to transact everywhere online. It's hard to use crypto to make directly payments, because the options are scarce, with or without paying fees.I believe what you are looking for will only become feasible once a big online shopping network adopts crypto for all the purchases inside the platform. Maybe creating their own native cryptocurrency as well.",

If your coin didn't get accepted by merchant and then how can you spend it? You must accept the fact that if you are looking for coin that has no fees but it will be rarely accepted by merchants like you have mentioned above. I think that if you must not also feel so bad with low fees that being implemented by 3rd party service.",

I know your frustrations, but we all know the crypto or the project itself needs some incentives to keep it going, miners, validators etc etc. So think about it that you are giving it back to them when you pay fees, (including the 3rd party provider).",

      "body": "One of the major factors that attract people to a crypto coin/token is the transaction costs. The ability to move the token/coin from one wallet to another helps in adopting and accepting the coin/token. for example, Binance Coin (BNB) has gained good acceptance due to its low fees when compared to Ehereum. The main target is to reduce the transaction fees as low as possible. Most wallets/Blockchain from time to time may require upgrading or maintenance, so some of the fees are charged so as to maintain some wallets, so transactions may not be entirely free, as they charge some fees for the blockchain/wallet. Likewise, some coins are mined and miners charge fees for the process, so the fees are not deliberate. However, coin like Nano is an exception. Nano is a cryptocurrency that charge zero transaction fees,",

Though the idea is really good because this is the real purpose of cryptocurrency to spend money anonymously but things are different now, some tokens just have a small fees a cents for every transaction and I think it can work if the businesses decide to accept it.",
