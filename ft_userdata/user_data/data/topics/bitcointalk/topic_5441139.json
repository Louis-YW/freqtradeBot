  "content": "Good day everyone. When a friend told me how he makes money from bounties, I joined Bitcointalk and have solely participated in bounties ever since. I've been in bounty for a while, and during that time I've heard and read some topics about how unproductive and time-wasting they are here. However, I stayed because I wanted to confirm and see it for myself, and from what I saw and experienced, I realized how unproductive and time-wasting they are.I ultimately made the decision to make amends and resolved to be more engaged with other forum sections to learn more about it and, ideally, discover Bitcoin. I'm hoping I still have time to start over and prove myself in this place. I need guidance",

However, there are plenty of good opportunities in this forum if you are willing to visit the Services Board,  where you can find some jobs and campaigns that pays with bitcoin. They pay good money some times.Anyway, you need to engage yourself in useful discussions so you can rank up your account and join those services.",

He can offer some marketing services as well that also require a good reputation and Skills. Anyway..Moving next to sir I think Bounties are a total waste of time, as sometimes bounties really offer good rewards I know plenty of good projects paid really well but the point is Bounties are time-consuming and Hard jobs to do. Rewards are less than efforts. There are some good managers offer good bounties but 80% are waste of time so Smart act is needed to join Bounties choose good have good.",

But you didn't lose something since you gain an experience and just be consistent about learnings since for sure you can earn with it in future. More knowledge to learn here and also skills so better keep more engagement on other section to learn more ideas from other people.",

      "body": "I have past experienced earning from bounties before I already sold my altcoins and tokens a long time ago they are legit except for a few coins that are still in my wallet that have never been sold because it's not listed. There are lots of bounties out there the problem is they become a scam(most of them are scam) and can't able to sell them because it is not listed yet on any exchanges. As suggested above joining a signature campaign requires a high rank since you are still a newbie you need to earn merit first but this is not an easy task without knowledge about Bitcoin and the forum you won't be able to earn merits. However, you can try your luck and follow some guides listed from this \"List Of How To Get Merit Guides Thread\"",

I tend to agree that's totally wasting of time and the reason I quit a long time ago.

Do not waste time on this; it is better to start studying bitcoin, participate in discussions, and read; over time, you will better realize how and where you can either earn or invest with the possibility of further profit.

I remember doing research about a project that launched a bounty campaign here and when I got to Twitter all I saw were so many twitter accounts making same post filled with same hashtags and I'm sure that does persons who knows nothing about bounty when they come across something like that they might think that the project is using some kind of a bot to make post on Twitter because all post were the same with no meaning to it. And again the reason why most hunters nowadays get little to no pay is because of the number of hunters that participate in a bounty campaign, imagine a campaign that's paying $2000 for a four weeks twitter campaign and more than a thousand hunters register for that campaign. What exactly do they expect to earn from such campaign? $2 for four weeks?",

You lost some time, but you still proved to yourself that what you were doing is not something you want to spend your time on, and sometimes first-hand experience is much more valuable than creating an opinion based on what others tell you.As for the forum, it's never too late to go in a different direction and all you need is to find what interests you and try to participate in the discussion. Of course, before that I suggest that you read the rules of the forum, and that you adhere to them, especially that you do not plagiarize other people's work and be original in your posts.",
