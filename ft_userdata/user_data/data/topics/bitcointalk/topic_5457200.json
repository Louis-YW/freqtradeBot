It went up to $31000 the first time, which we were expecting, but fall back to $25300 which was a big support price as it fall to around $25300 several times in days. This time, again it went up to almost $31000 and not going beyond that price. If bitcoin do not go up beyond this price within a week, it would be the resistant price and bitcoin may not go up further for now.If bitcoin do not go up further, we should be expecting downtrend and if it mistakenly go below $25000, we should expect $20000 again.",

      "body": "First of all, we should admit that we are happy to see this rise in the price. Yes, Bitcoins have already surprised us many times this year. At the start of the year, it suddenly jumped 10k USD and reached 28k USD. And after that, it got stuck in this price segment for a couple of months. Now it has again crossed 30k USD, generating good emotions in the minds of traders. Maybe this price rise is due to the increase in demand to buy the coins among traders. I am assuming we will touch 40k USD before August if this pace is carried out by the coins. Let’s hope for the best.",

SEC is now overwhelmed by ETF application since everyone is confident that Blackrock can get the long awaiting approval from SEC on spot ETF.This pump is organic and will continue to probably ATH until next year if the trend will not gonna stop until the Bitcoin Halving. Blackrock is monster on their filings so I’m positive that they got this and also US huge company is now teaming up to have their own massive crypto exchange that will bring crypto more closer to US residents since this company will be working closely to SEC.",

Well, for this month maybe it will continue to run at $ 30K as it looks right now in the market, but for next month also I don't think that Bitcoin will fall below $25k - $26k again. Because price resistance at a better level will probably continue as long as no bad news comes to Bitcoin in the next month. An increase like now is indeed very tempting, but I also don't think that it is a preemptive attempt to go down again in more depth.",

For me, we have seen the lowest low for this bear market, and I don't think that we can go below $20k. We have seen the support along $25k and it is strong and it will hold.",

And from what I've seen, it's because of the series of good news that happened today that the Bitcoin price suddenly pumped up, which also caused the rise of other cryptos that are in the top 50 in the market.",

For me, I am not in a hurry about the price going up because sooner or later the bulls will come, it is inevitable. So I will just want to focus on accumulating as many bitcoins as possible.",

Every quarter of the year is 3 months, and we are in June(6th month of the year) which makes it the last month of the second quarter of the year. This should be the second time we are seeing the price of bitcoin go above $30k in the second quarter of the year, the first one happened in April as you have already said. I don't think that bitcoin's current price surge will cause it to revert to its prior level of $25k to $28k and stay there for several more months as it did it before. I anticipate that the cost of bitcoin will at least reach $32k between this month's end and the start of the next month.",

Spot price is determined by trades on the biggest exchanges and 2 of them got sued by the SEC, which was a move to drag the price down and allow institutions to buy from you. They also wanted to introduce their own government backed exchange and force Binance out of the US, which worked.The price is now returning to its former level that was achieved naturally in q1 of this year. The drop was driven by the US government and if you panicked and sold to them, that's your loss. I think that we will continue to go up, especially when the blackrock ETF gets approved.",

Historical resistance levels do not always determine future price movements, and previous assumptions about key levels, such as the $50K figure, have been proven wrong in previous cycles. As you said, traders are better off focusing on the $30K resistance level not ignoring factors. other.Yes. the potential impact of a spot ETF approval. With so many companies offering ETFs, there is an expectation of increased demand for real spot bitcoins, which are already in short supply. This spike in demand can lead to a rapid Bitcoin price rally. although It is expected that the ETF application will be successful and not face resistance, as this will further contribute to positive market sentiment and potential price growth.",
