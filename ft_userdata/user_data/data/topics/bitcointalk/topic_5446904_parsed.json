  "content": "I am a beginner in this Forum and also in tech. One of my biggest stress was choosing a programming language to learn, most people will tell you start with HTML and Css,others will say start with python because they are more easier, But I will like you to ask yourself  what do I  want to do with that language am planning to learn .I was told to ask myself this question by a friend and it did help Me, before then I was learning html and css because that what I was told to learn and whereas that was not what I wanted to do, I wanted to be a software developer and not a Web developer.  Then after that, Choosing a language to start my software development career, I wanted to learn Java but some other guys told me to learn Python because it is easier, versatile and still works for software development but there was a flaw though it work for software development but it is slower while java is faster, Python is better in Automation.   There are other good languages in software development but the two main is Java and Kotlin, most will choose Kotlin because its easier to learn, works better than java in some ways but I prefer to Java aside from the fact that it is older and have larger community to get resources I still prefer Java to Kotlin because it will make me understand the structure of programming better and so switching to other language would be easier.     It doesn't matter how hard it is to Learn a thing, if you love it and need it then you would have to learn it because the professionals where once beginners. This is one reason I don't like taking advice from YouTube, they mainly speaks of beginners starting with python because it's easier but one thing is that as a beginner no matter the language you are learning you will still see some parts tasking to learn but it varies with the language. Every beginners face this so why choose something that doesn't suit what you want to become because of you are looking for a comfort zone,Just learn what you need because every beginner one time felt like giving up (Was told this by a full stack developer) and that the reason have not quit learning.Reason for the story When we want to start something, We often to speak to others about it and sometimes their advice may not be good though they may want the best but the best they talk are the easier things. Is just like you telling someone  I want to be a Science student , they will be like maths and physics is hard or there are too many calculations there , then later advice you to go for Art or social science because you where one time having issues with mathematics and so you that already move you a step away from your goals. Some may later benefit from it while may later regret listening to the advice.Some times the easiest way is not the best way out but most still don't know, they just continue to find easier things to do, All because they don't want stress while some listen because of who is speaking about it.This is the reason why it is always Advisable to do your on Research(DYOR) in anything you do, after all the advice you get you still need to do your own research. In this Forum they speak about it when you ask about any investment advice and this shows how important doing your own research is in investing. Choosing a Career is somehow like an investment, so you have to do your own research and see how it fits with your goals.Also stop making excuses because even those you inspire to be like started from somewhere",

      "body": "Op, your topic is quite confusing it's like the more you read the less you understand what you're reading. Just a little advice, you should have in your mind when creating a thread or any post that not everyone here is involved in programming and so using so many programming terms makes your post more difficult to understand next time try to add more layman terms. You said something like \"full stack developer\" most people don't even know what that means and so interpreting the content becomes extremely hard. I also have little knowledge when it comes to programming so don't think I'm trying to criticize you for your thread, all I'm trying to say is that next time when creating a thread make sure you create a thread that will take your audience along, because the main reason for your thread creation is to compel others to join you in that discussion, so when they're unable to relate with you then you won't be able to achieve the purpose of that thread creation.Btw, it's nice to see that you chose a language you have a passion for rather than a simpler language.",
