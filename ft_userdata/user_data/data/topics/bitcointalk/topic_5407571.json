I agree, all CURRENT algo stable coins should be avoided 100%I have found the \"holy grail\" of this magical algo stablecoin - an idea I too have hated for along time. But to discredit algo stablecoins is a dangerous idea ... and actually damages what makes bitcoin have value...Feel free to discredit regular stablecoins - they completely defeat the purpose of crypto and \"add to the energy bill\" ..",

So everybody staked their savings in it and then a horrible collapse happened. It took out lending platforms, and many capital funds and numerous amount of people lost their savings.",

That supposed to change your views about them but it seems that you are more encouraged to hold an algo based stable coin. Algo based stable coins are now depeging so it can't be that they can wiped out the traditional stable coins that we know like usdt, busd and usdc but they are the ones that will be wiped out first.

After btc, eth is also the one that come out next. Shitcoins only came out after the ico boom on 2017. For the 3rd one, I guess this was about the topic that you made here?",

Especially if you’re at the wrong end of the risk curve. Somehow, it seems to me that it will take a lot more scandals for people to understand what kind of risks are involved when it comes to stablecoins, and especially when it comes to these new algo stablecoins, which are complete nonsense from any angle you look at them. Such things would actually be doomed before they even took off, but the level of greed and ignorance of the average crypto investor is unfortunately at a very high level.",

I mean just because of the simple fact that unless it has more money in it then any one single person can conjure, or even a group of people, that means it can't survive.You need to have like 100+ billion dollars in it for a safety in case anything like UST happens, and it will not have that much money in it. Whatever you do, as long as it is going to be \"protected\" by a system that requires people to spend their money to recover it, that will not be working at all and it will cause it to go down. This is why people do not trust them right now and they will continue to not trust them at all for a long time as well.",
