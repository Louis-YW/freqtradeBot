Even the young people who initially missed the opportunity have grown interest in it and are using it to support themselves. With all of this taking place, I want to emphasize that purchasing and investing in bitcoin, which is undoubtedly the best cryptocurrency, does not guarantee that you will be completely sustained for the rest of your life. Consider it a reliable side business that you can use to supplement your primary income when it suffers delays or to supplement to cover up for your daily expenses.Some people have lost their lives as a result of completely depending on cryptocurrencies due to the unexpected market downturn. Some people even  committed suicide as a result of the last big decline in cryptocurrency’s price in the market. Whatever happens to you in this life, it doesn't justify ending it on your own.For beginners, it is advised before investing in cryptocurrencies to do your own research on the subject. Check the historical performance of those who have profited from it and those who have not, this will provide you with a forecast. With this, you can plan your investment and get a solid profit over the long term. Keep in mind that this is not a quick money-making scheme, conduct your own study and invest only after full understanding and knowledge.",

This is why anyone shouldn't invest on cryptocurrency aka shitcoins because if the token price decrease for 99% most people can't accept it and will stressed or depressed.IMO to reduce the risk of investment, it's need a diversify but don't diversify to shitcoins. A good example of diversify is gold, real estate, and stock.",

In \"Trading Discussion\" board, I read some darker stories wherein their friends took their own lives due to lots of losses. It is a really sensitive story/thread. I would never rely my life in crypto and stock trading/investment. Those successful stories surely has a lot of untold stories and not everything you read/see in social media is 100% of what happens behind the scenes.Quote from: Asiska02 on September 11, 2022, 02:26:14 PM~I mean even if I knew the risks and am willing to invest some portion of my savings to it, it's not going to make me rely on it.

      "body": "Yes, it is dangerous to rely only on Bitcoin or in your words cryptocurrency. One of the main reason is it in not being adopted locally and within the environment surrounding it. The main reason behind it is the economic stability or the instability of a country. We have seen and observed, when a country suddenly decided to adopt Bitcoin and then failed to gain the complete adoption. This is not because the the country democratically accepted Bitcoin but because it was forced to accept it as the government of that country wanted an escape route to restructure their economy.We as a community will come across such governments as we know they, as a government or a dictator or a party controlling the government are now helpless and they know in coming years they will lose control.  The only way to make Bitcoin or crypto in general is to  become a local currency. The first step would be to make the  locals understand it and then to make them realize what decentralisation means. It would take a long time but it will eventually happen. Therefore give it a time and and wait for the next step before coming into any conclusion.",

Today, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies available out there. Because this is such a young market, many of these coins might be undervalued and provide you with lots of good opportunities for profit. But with all of the positives and negatives surrounding cryptocurrencies, it is vital to first educate yourself to the best of your ability. Overall, investing in cryptocurrency can definitely be a profitable venture to take. However, there are still plenty of risks involved and ways for your investment to plummet. Be sure to fully understand what you are getting yourself into before putting any money down.",

Well if anyone what's to reply on. Crypto-currency for its financial services then you need to check out:#If crypto is ban or restricted in your country # what's the adoption and acceptance of crypto-currency like# proximity to internet connection But if you aim to rely on crypto-currency solely for your financial growth I won't totally suggest that. It's profitable learn how to trade in crypto-currency, how to buy and when not to and also sell cryptos but in addition to this you can learn other services you can offer, a skill you are very good in like graphic design, freelancing, web development, coding anyone you are good at and take your payment in Cryptos which you can save up as well",

Cryptocurrency is best use for investment purposes in long term because big project such as Bitcoin usually grow its price the longer you will wait because the demand on this kind of tokens increase the more the government screwing people on the fiat downside which is inflation.In conclusion. It’s not bad to invest a significant amount in crypto. Just make sure that the money you are using has no other purpose than investment because your investment plan will be screwed if you have other things planned on the money you put into crypto because you will think about it and worst is cut loss whenever there’s a price change.",

I mean even in your usual 9-5 job working in a private company, you should still at least find another source of income. Freelancing business is one of those business worth mentioning especially if you are equipped with a \"marketable skill\". Crypto investment is profitable, but we should not rely on it too much as primary source of income. It is even something that you would consider a \"passive income\" since you're not really doing so much of a work the whole day, maybe look at the graph and charts for an hour or two between days and call it there, just still ensure that you still have another \"reliable\" source of income that would be able to fulfill your basic needs then call Lambo for your \"passive income\" once the market just went all greens.",
