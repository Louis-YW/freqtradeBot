  "content": "If anyone is wondering how can an entity destroy the concept of their own products - in this case by exporting the seed phrase to outside entities, even if it is encrypted - then wait no more because Ledger will launch their new service, Ledger Recover[1]:QuoteLedger is preparing to launch a new service called Ledger Recover that splits a wallet recovery phrase—basically, a human-readable form of the private key—into three encrypted shards and distributes them to three custodians: Ledger, crypto custody firm Coincover, and code escrow company EscrowTech.  If somebody loses their recovery phrase, two of the three shards can be combined—pending an ID check—to regain access to the locked funds. Essentially, Ledger Recover is an additional safety net; for the price of $9.99 a month, it takes the jeopardy out of crypto’s version of stuffing dollars under the mattress. It’ll be available in the UK, EU, US, and Canada and come to other territories later in the year.(...)Ledger Recover is a service, he says, not a feature—one that provides all the niceties and safety mechanisms regular people are looking for. The fragments of the recovery phase are encrypted and stored by each custodian on specially secured servers, and the balance of the user’s wallet is covered up to a value of €50,000 ($55,000) if something goes awry, a little like deposit insurance at a bank. It’s also being designed with a less technical user in mind.I've tried to look upon any more news regarding this paid service, but so far I'm not able to find anything on Ledger website (release notes are currently on OS version 2.1.0). The only reference that I found was this[2] Reddit post where the concept appears in Ledger Nano X newest firmware update (2.2.1):I believe most Ledger customers will see this as a service to subscribe to since this will be seen as a \"safe heaven\" in order to avoid the loss of their funds, or even an alternative that holds their hand and makes them feel safe regarding their funds. Sadly they aren't aware of what is actually happening in the background, but I don't think most people will care as long as they have another option to access their funds...[1]https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ftx-crypto-investors-hardware-wallets[2]https://safereddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/13im3bc/wtf_ledger_this_is_a_disaster_waiting_to_happen/",

      "body": "So the very fact that this exists, even if you don't sign up for it, means that the next firmware update for Ledger devices will create a process by which your seed phrase is extracted from your hardware device, downloaded on to your computer, and then sent across the internet. That is a massive attack vector. It negates literally the entire point of a hardware wallet to keep your seed phrase and private keys isolated from computers and the internet. Not to mention this gives governments a very easy path to seizing all your assets, if they want, and allows all your coins to be stolen with some very basic social engineering. If you have completed KYC anywhere ever, then you've given away all an attacker needs to recover your seed phrase and empty your wallets.Remember when Trezor and Ledger were the two best hardware wallets out there, and every thread had people (me included!) recommending either/both of them. How the mighty have fallen! Both are complete and utter trash now, completely ruined by awful decisions such as this one. Seriously, do the management teams behind both wallets understand nothing about bitcoin?More and more I am glad that I have moved pretty much exclusively to airgapped, encrypted, cold storage for the bulk of my bitcoin. I know that my wallets will never suddenly pose a massive security and/or privacy risk out of the blue because of some absolutely moronic decision by a third party trying to squeeze more and more profits out of their customers.",

This two are enough not to use Ledger wallet again.

What I saw today is not surprising me, Ledger do not care before about how bitcoin should be, as it should be of no trust. Not taking care of users data and now they have promoted to a level where privacy will be no more. People should avoid Ledger wallets.",

I guess you are talking about Foundation Passport. Foundation is relatively new in this business, so you couldn't have recommended them 5 years ago, at a time while Trezor and Ledger were the best, because they weren't around at that time. Second thing, does Foundation use an open-source secure element? If Trezor is the first one that's planning to develop one, it means Foundation doesn't have one either.   Quote from: Sp0ke on May 16, 2023, 01:18:57 PMSo it's that subscription that is exposing the keys ?

Currently storing your bitcoins in a seed plate or an air-gapped device that you personally own is the best and most secure option. Trust in hardware wallets has become a concern after this, so it's better to keep peace in your mind and use something that you own to store your BTC.

This shift essentially turns it into a free hot wallet, which is scary since it involves transmitting your seed phrase and wallet information to third-party entities.

Has Ledger put out any official statement or something that says the seed phrase won't be sent anywhere unless we subscribe to their monthly plan? However, even if such confirmation exists, we should still question whether we have any means of independently verifying this claim or if we're simply relying on their word.
