Wait for the fee to drop and for the last few days its been crazy and I guess it will go on for a week or two like what happened earliers with ordinals. Also you can expect the fee to drop considerably at the weekend.",

You can try closing and starting the transaction process from scratch, then you can use the custom process and programme how much you want your fee to be instead of using the default shown by the wallet that you are using. You can increase the fee to at least 80 Sats and let it roll. Maybe before morning you will get your transaction confirmed. But then again, your transaction amount is really very low, so you should just consider leaving that transaction for now, as you will end up not going home with anything. You can increase the fee to at least 80 Sats and let it roll. Maybe before morning you will get your transaction confirmed.",

      "body": "Since you are doing CPFP and not RBF, I assume you are the receiver of an unconfirmed transaction. Am I right? In CPFP method, you spend the fund you received in the unconfirmed transaction in a new transaction with high fee, so miners include both transactions (the unconfirmed parent and the child) in the same block. The problem is now the value of unconfirmed output you are trying to spend is too low and that's not enough for paying the transaction fee. Quote from: Bitcoin Ben on November 08, 2023, 07:36:35 PMWhat should I do in this situation? You can send new fund to your wallet and use that for CPFP, but it seems that the value of the fund you have received is too low and it's not worth to do CPFP.",

It shouldn't be difficult to know whether you are the sender or the receiver. If the transaction is adding to your balance, you are the receiver and if it's deceasing your balance you are the sender.If you are the sender and your transaction has been flagged as RBF, you can bump the fee. If you are the receiver, you can use CPFP.If the size of your unconfirmed transaction is less than 500 bytes, its fee rate is at least 10 sat/byte and it doesn't have any unconfirmed parent, you can submit your transaction to ViaBTC free accelerator. If you do so, your transaction will be included in the next block mined by them. They have around 10% of the total hash rate and it's estimated that they mine 1 block in every 100 minutes. Can you share the transaction IDs? (Note that with doing so, you may harm your privacy. So, don't do that, if you worry about your privacy)",

Do you really want to do CPFP and pay fee for a transaction in which you receive only 546 satoshi? Do you know that it's worth less than $0.2?If you insist on doing so, you should make the CPFP transaction manually.  This means that you should spend the fund you have received in the unconfirmed transaction (along with another UTXO to cover the fee) in a new transaction with high fee.",

Be careful on that though, since the transaction that you're trying to bump with CPFP may also have an unconfirmed parent (or more) with even lower fee rate that'll make your child transaction useless.That's because your child transaction has to pay for those too to be able to bump the transaction that you're trying to bump.So check if its input(s) are all confirmed or if unconfirmed, should have good fee rate.",

Therefore, the fee required to be paid for the child transaction will be bigger than the value of that coin and OP would waste money on transaction fee. Also, with adding another coin to be used as input of the transaction, OP would increase the transaction size and transaction fee. Of course, this would act as consolidation of outputs, but it's not a good time for that as the network is so congested now.",
