  "content": "Is a good thing to see Jesus resurrect for our sake today. He die for our sins and redeem us from the cause of death. He loves you and me, he lay his life for me and you. If you've not reconcile with him, today is another good opportunity because his mercy never fails. His love endures forever. Easter is to share love, give someone a smile of gift today. God bless and keep safe. Happy Easter",
