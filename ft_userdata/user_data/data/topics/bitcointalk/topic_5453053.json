  "content": "It's 2023, a good time to be alive in good shape and health, hope you guys are doing so well, I have been into Bitcoin investment since December of 2016 and I feel good about myself to have make it this far, I want you new beginners to know that nothing is impossible, follow your dream and do not let any nonbelievers sway you away from your dreams. Also do not let your dreams stayed a dream, you need to bring them alive, so far I can confidently say that mine have come alive, it has been a tough fight all along..Imagine believing in something that very limited numbers of people believed in for years, it always look like it will fail, I had the fear of giving up but my father, he was just there all along, he gave me the guts over my fear and I lived through it, until 2021 when my dreams become a reality, sadly he is no more around to witness it all, I have been fighting this war since 2016, and today I am thankful.To all Bitcoin beginners on here, do not give up on Bitcoin.  When there is fear in the market, be bold enough to take a step, use the fear to your own advantage.In 2013, Micheal Saylor trashed Bitcoin, saying it's days are outnumbered that it will suffer the same fate as online gambling, and today, his company Microstrategy now owns 140 thousand Bitcoins. This is 10 years later.The funny part is, online gambling became even more successful in 2020 pandemic period. I don't see something like this when I was struggling to make things work through Bitcoin, you beginners now have real reasons to summon your courage and believe, it was cold and silent in 2016, the FUD on Bitcoin was so much that you can easily give up and believe Bitcoin won't work, today it's different. Yet some beginners still doubts, when I see beginners acting weak on Bitcoin, doubting its survival, I always ask them, what about those who invested in Bitcoin years ago when everything was so cold and hopeless? What gave people like that some courage at the time? Now big companies or well-known people are now adopting Bitcoin, that's your Courage there. You beginners have no excuses, it is safer to be in Bitcoin now than to be out of Bitcoin, just, Believe, you will lament to have 0.1BTC very soon, now is the time to believe in Bitcoin and HoDL.",

The US still haven't raised its debt ceiling and if they don't, the US will default on its debt. Can you imagine that? The world's most developed nation, AAAAA++++ credit ratings, the owner of the federal reserve is about to default on its debt... and if they don't, that's is an equally scary scenario because then the inflation will go boooooooom. Let's see how bitcoin will take these events.",

Experts make mistakes, and it's really hard to predict how well a starting industry would do in the future. Online gambling is clearly big, and so is Bitcoin. The price isn't as good as in 2016, of course, but still pretty good. That being said, I think that people who have fear over Bitcoin and doubts about its potential should not invest in it because investments should be made based on personal decisions, given that the responsibility and financial risk are personal as well.",

You can work, have salary & money, make your savings and use part of savings for your investment in Bitcoin.You have to do this gradually, accumulate bitcoin gradually but with money from your own pocket. Don't borrow money to buy bitcoin. Don't invest if you need that money  for something more important for your life.Investment is risky so you must afford to lose your capital before you start your investment journey with Bitcoin.Dollar Cost Averaging is helpful.https://dcabtc.com/",

What gave people like that some courage at the time? People who invested years ago had no idea how that time was or was going to turn out. They merely invested because they heard about it then, had doubts that they could overcome and had the means to finance it comfortably to be able to keep their bitcoin investment longer.Many invested with doubts in their hearts, but not many people can do such maybe because they are not financially strong enough to take such risk or they have more doubts and they are the kind that do not take action with doubts in their hearts, or for other reasons.",

Also tell them about the dangers, hackers, scammers and the need to be very security conscious.

I agree on your general sentiment and also regarding the idea that even 0.1 BTC could / would at some point in time be considered true wealth.However I want to warn a little bit to be too optimistic regarding the short-mid term. Yes, chances are we can see another end of ATH 2024 to mid 2025. But maybe not. The current geoeconomical situation is as unstable as never before. Things are as complex and interconnected as never before. It's extremely hard to make accurate predictions for almost any kind of market these days and nobody knows how exactly Bitcoin will react if indeed a hefty world-economic crises emerges. Yes, Bitcoin could/should be a good hedge, but there is always some unknown variables.Don't get me wrong, all I am saying is, never go all-in on anything, including Bitcoin.",

Let's remember davincij15, the one who so sincerely advised everyone to invest at least one dollar in Bitcoin. But how many of us have heard it?Now we regularly see people coming to Bitcoin who regret that one day they didn’t listen to our advice. People grow up in different ways, it does not depend on age.

You are right about possible panic from those that hold a large number of Bitcoin, and that's a bad thing, if panic comes it's going to be helpful, the more those that hold a large number of Bitcoin sell their bags the better it will become for Bitcoin, Bitcoin needs to be circulated instead of some whales holding large number of Bitcoin, so for the short term the panic will cause more dump but for the long term it's better. So What do you think? If everyone buy Bitcoin at 100$ per one, for how long do you think that the price will stay at 100$? For something that was created to have value as more people buy, this is impossible,  many people wont be able to buy for 100$ before it will move on to 110$, 120$, 200$, the more the adoption increases the higher the price will grow.",

Instead of saying things like you can't do it, they would really give you the push to believe in yourself and follow your guts. Worse part is when the time you succeeded they are gone it's like their mission to guide you is done.There's no easy beginning to everything, even a talented person without polish won't do enough for you to shine. You'll have to work hard, study and be consistent which can be apply in Bitcoin. If people think they are not good enough to invest in Bitcoin then they are free to learn first. Which is a good thing since risk without knowledge is useless. But in Bitcoin surely there's a lot of opportunities ahead when you invest still do your own research.",

I believe that when they have come to realize the potential of bitcoin,they will hate themselves for not taking advantage of bitcoin earlier,just like most of us that are new into bitcoin are regretting that we didn't adopt bitcoin since 2009.This is still the best time to invest in bitcoin as the price is dip,after this time we might see a hike in bitcoin price and at this time people with little amount of money will buy very expensive. Fear,is another key factor that is making people to assume that bitcoin might not last. Life is all about taking risk to be successful, when you take a risk and think positive towards your action,this will kill the fear in you and make you have a strong believe in your actions.
