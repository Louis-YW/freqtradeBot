Thanks for reading and be warned  Sorry about your loss mate, you complained earlier about a casino that scammed you of your hard earned resources and now again another scam accusation with no proof or evidence. Mate, if this continues and you keep posting complaints about scam without any factual evidence to hold unto, your complaints would not be taken serious anymore and you would be seen as a member who is likely good at tarnishing the reputation of others without any evidence. I would advise you to always put up evidence together with your complaints so members could have site of it before saying anything about it.Lastly, it is advised to seek the expertise  of an escrow for transparency and credibility so as not to fall victim of any circumstances.  How could you have made such a mistake by trusting some one you have no knowledge about neither have you come in contact with him before but however, we await your evidence so as not to misfire.",

An account seller can not be trusted. Seeing he have no history on the forum, you really needed to use a trusted escrow for the deal. It could cost a little fee but you would not need to lose that $400 which was a good amount of money for you.However, you need to provide some evidence so that everyone can justify your case and leave a negative feedback for the user. Right now it's just some words you left for the accuser and asking everyone to believe you.Sorry to hear your loss if that's indeed happened.",

      "body": "still no evidence update? this is why escrows are important, anyway, as BitcoinGirl.Club suggested I am assuming too that you are buying an account base on the history of the profile you shared. what and why are you even buying an account that is worth $400 and why aren't you using an escrow if you consider $400 a huge amount of money? just adding to what BitcoinGirl.Club suggested, aside from leaving negative feedback, you can also create a negative flag against the user.",

      "body": "I am sorry that you lost the money but doing any business with a newbie account that has no trade history could only end up this way. Even though you probably won't see your money or account that you tried to buy, can you make a proper scam accusation so we can check it out and eventually tag/glag that member? It won't help you, but maybe it will save another naive and inexperienced member like you.Here is the report format https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=260073.0",

Thanks for reading and be warned  First of all, I want to say it is your fault instead of saying sorry cause:1. You have traded with a newbie who has no loss if the user loses the account of bitcointalk2. You have made a deal while finding a conversation made on the telegram from where all chat can be deleted and also you may manipulate chat.3. You could do it with a reputed users as well as on an exchangeIn your offline life, you may not rely on this number of amounts from a stranger. As you can't do anything and the stranger has nothing to lose. So, why you will not do the same in online life?",

Thanks for reading and be warned  You made a big mistake, dude, you trusted someone who has no reputation in the forum or rank, and he has not yet been active in the forum since last month; centralized exchange platforms would have been safe for these P2P transactions, or if you don't like to submit your documents, here in the forum, there are many trusted members who provide an escrow service and will be mediators between you and the other person in order to guarantee your rights. You risked a fairly large amount that you could have tested with ten dollars or less at the beginning or dealt with small amounts. But let's not cry over spilled milk, lesson learned, and I hope you will repeat this blind trust again. Scammers are everywhere.",

This was not your good move by any means. And Telegram's chat history can be deleted and chats can be edited, so you won't get much benefit from it. So it was your mistake and sorry for your loss. This incident has come as an experience for you to avoid making such mistakes in the future, because in the future you will meet more different types of scammers in different places.",

I am sorry you lost your money. It is unfortunate that another member is victimized. You have been a member of bitcointalk since 2018, it is difficult for me to comprehend how you could trust a novice account with no value or reputation. In just a few minutes, low-ranked accounts with no value can be easily created. You probably already heard about escrows in bitcointalk. Some members may not be using escrow because of small deals, but $400, as you pointed out, is not a small sum.",
