A trust flag warning would be very helpful for any guest user or newbie who opens the thread.I understand that but he can still share that \"scan\" link of his for us to check. If he does that then we will have definitive proof but I don't think he will ever come back. In my experience, 100% of the people who have sent me these \"scan for AML\" bs links have been scammers.",
