There's sadly nothing you can do now that the transaction is confirmed but you can try and follow the transaction, and see if it ever landed in a centralized exchange's address (one that requires KYC) using walletexplorer.com if it does, contact law enforcement but unless the hacker is from the same country as you, I don't think that would help much.",

Sorry brother, you are not dealing in Bank or any financial institution. When a hacker hack you device and still your cryptocurrency, it's gone forever. There are no return back unless the person who taken it decides to favour you.I urge you to learn how Bitcoin works, what it means by decentralization things like that.Sorry for your loss.",

I’m curious how your passphrase is missing while you should put this on safe place?There’s no electrum support and confirmed transaction is irreversible. Even Satoshi can’t recover this. Reformat your PC and make sure to avoid installing and downloading files from untrustworthy source.",

As a result, my balance was reset to zero. What should I do? Can I do anything to return the money?(Program version 4.3.3 at the time of entry)I will start by telling that the bitcoins never stay in the wallet. The wallet only handles the keys.So there's an extremely good chance that somebody got access to your wallet seed, restored (basically obtained a copy of) your wallet and then spent your coins.Since bitcoin transactions are irreversible, if the transaction is confirmed you cannot get your money back.What you can do? Try to find out how did your seed got stolen - is your system compromised, or did you save the seed in mail, or cloud? (If system is compromised you may lose more than only the bitcoins). As the others said: learn how bitcoin works, learn to keep your money safer, consider buying a hardware wallet for your coins.",

Does Electrum have tech support to check this? How can I communicate them?Electrum is a self-custody wallet, meaning that you are the only one who possesses your private keys, and there is no third-party resource that could cause you to lose your coins. However, if you have saved your seed phrase to an external source, that was a major security failure on your part.",

The seed should be your main concern.The seed phrase should always be written in paper, which is unhackable. It is very likely that your computer is compromised and the hacker just got access to your seed. This may have happened in the time you just created the wallet and saw the seed for the first time or later on.",
