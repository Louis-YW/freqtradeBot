      "body": "I wonder to what extent we should take this seriously. The reporting seems to have been prepared very quickly and amateurishly. If you can't even spell the name of the casino correctly, then it doesn't seem to matter much to the player. Moreover, Bitsler has a stable reputation. I've been looking through the scam accusations and can't find anything about bitsler. They have also been active on the forum for a long time, it seems impossible that you have problems with a site like bitsler. Perhaps you should describe your problem in more detail.",

They have license ( atleast they saying that ) Yet my stupid country is restricted to play there and always was. But they took my ID for verification without any problem. Yeah i know, i should report them and then everything would be better. But im not a fucking rat so i didnt do it. Brother i was playing there really, really fucking a lot..Till they rigged my account. So keep ur fucking bullshit for someone who cares. They are fucking stealing garbage. Do you want to see my bet history? I had some good hits there. But suddendly, haha u want to tell me that suddendly im so fucking unlucky that i have 200 plus(sorry my stupid laptop keyboard cant do some signs haha) then after hitting few greens i have 150 plus more... Then i tested few more games ( Keno 10 numbers 30 or more hits without hitting 1 number. Plinko 8 lines hard ( the best hit is 30x multiplier) I had 5000 plus (keyboard, sorry)Â  Without hitting 30 multimplier? :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD yeah yeah they scam so fucking hard u cant even imagine. And then when i had after month and half not fucking playing there few bucks from bonus, they wouldnt even let me fucking cashout until i wrote to their fucking retarded support? think whatever u want, everyone can make his own picture of what the fuck is going in their shitty stealing casino. I wouldnt cry here, if it wasnt true. Yeah my english sucks and im little bit drunked, but this shit is nothing but true. So, yeah...",

I can give you my account and password and go play by yourself. Although u would have to deposit too, i wont deposit even stupid penny anymore. Since this happened its like 2 months almost and i by mistake made deposit few xrp there and i couldnt withdraw cause it was too small amount. Well i tried 6.14x dice payout and it was same shit again. Had more than 100 reds. Tell me its aint rigged. Go try by urself ill give you my account no problemChanged seed like 50 times if u wonder about that. Yeah, wasnt about seed.",

For you, i will even deposit few trx so u see what they did. Its ridiculous. Yeah after i laughed at them, they did withdraw me. I will make it into scam accusiation tommorow, not in mood right now. But please dude, go try play my account so u see it with ur own eyes.And about patience...u dont know what you are talking about. 5000 and more bets for 30x in plinko aint enough?

I was calmly asking them why they rigged my account, and if there is change so they undoit...yeah i was fucking calm. They was saying they have no idea what im talking about (haha perhaps they dont, only admins do) and when i was asking them to call the admins then, they stopped do any answer immediately for few days...that was when i stopped to play here. Its more than clear they know about it...These chances i played and i missed thousand times in a row - its like i would hit 500x in keno but fucking 10 times in a row. Just do your math. Its some nasty dirty awful garbage on their side, what they did to me. Im also muted in their chat, even on private messages which u can do only to admins or mod there. Yeah, i was asking publicly why they rigged my account or if these losses are normal. (they apparently didnt like it)",

AND I DIDNT HIT IT ONCE IN MORE THAN FUCKING 5000 BETS. Yeah bro Â am angry, but i dont care anymore, its just scam bullshit wannabe casino. I just dont want more ppl to give them money while they scamming this hard...thats all really. U r free to delete this any time. I really love how askgamblers.com, trustpilot and i honestly think even this one is paid off by those gambling sites writing their own reviews...its so pathetic. Whole internet is just scamm these days  But u must really be retarded. Show me i had some good hits after they rigged my account. Ive never said it here.

If you were solely saying that Bitsler rigged your games with the only proof you have is saying you lost continuously, some may believe it but it wouldn't really be a proper accusation imo since there's no solid proof (unfortunately). Chances are most would just attribute it to, well, gambling being gambling, that there's always a chance for you to lose.",
