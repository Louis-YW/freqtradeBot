      "body": "This is a good move you know. At first rendering such services free of charge would project your capabilities to the platform. This is a good form of self marketing and as such should be properly utilised to achieving success.I checked and I noticed you have been here for quite a long time with much activities but however, you would still need to do more work growing up. So I would ask you this question, how do you intend having a conversation with your prospective clients when we all know that this platform is a pseudo anonymous platform. Do you  plan holding a live video session with your client if they insist. Lastly, I see this is a new post and the rate at which you keep bumping is not normal. Allow for 24hours before bumping. If you want  to remain relevant keep on with your posts and engagement here and clients will come your way.",
