They do all such to support their CBDC in future but I still see some positive supports from Congress members, Senators latest months.I believe that the launch of CBDC and FedNow will not be completely negative for their citizens. I look at it with this view, those things will expose many people to digital transfers and after they are familiar with it, I hope some of them will look for alternatives, better than CBDC and FedNow. It will be times for them to look at Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as better alternatives for CBDC.",

But all of these regions who've been using SMS or QR code payments for over a decade now still find use for Bitcoin. Think bigger: sanctioned people and governments, individuals, businesses and states that the US and its allies have excluded from money/economy.Iranians have this instant payment system. But they still have a need for Bitcoin (US dollar sanctions). Argentinians have similar but still need Bitcoin (hyperinflation).Come on, OP, you can ask better questions.",

      "body": "Bitcoin has force countries to use cashless transaction which brought about the use of CBDC. But one thing I know is, the aims of these centralized cashless transaction platforms from the State Governments are different from bitcoin, they are not for the benefits of the people but for the State while bitcoin is for the people and not for the State but if the state decide to participate in bitcoin they are free. The launched of FedNow can not over shadow the uses of bitcoin in USA because the aims and goals are not the same. People will still use bitcoin there. I think Fiat Banks also use instant payment methods. If care is not taken, Fiat Banks payment is even faster than bitcoin, because I have seen and experienced instant transfer and received alert instantly from Fiat Banks. And op what you are saying is only for Nation (USA) and not to another country but remember, bitcoin transaction is to cross boarders.",

I just feel that Bitcoin is safe me from the government arbitrary action in economy. I am okay to use fiat money because I still need it for my daily life, but have some amount of bitcoin will make my life happier.",

I don’t think it has got any negative impact on the Bitcoin usage or crypto as whole. It’s just a payment system for their people, that is all. It will be limited to their own people, hardly think it will get out of USA. If it does then there is no difference between so called traditional banking and fednow system. India also has UPI for that matter, but it doesn’t mean people started using UPI and stopped Bitcoin. Both the ends are just opposite. I don’t know why it’s being compared with Bitcoin. The Bitcoin properties are unmatched by all means.",

If I could send money using this thing internationally to anyone why would I need bitcoin? Yes! It is very similar to the system used in India called UPI. The only difference here is that, US will use E-doller to make this system work. From what I understand, it will bring in revolution in the digital payments in US which wouldn't need intervention from your bank. Payments will become cheaper and faster. But along with all the facilities, Americans will loose another layer of financial privacy. Bitcoin is made for a different reason. It is made to keep your financial privacy intact. So the introduction of a faster payment system, has no impact on bitcoin.",

But still, this topic need no discussion but dear OP, your query do need some answers. Because this service is only available in USA not in other countries so this is the first reason for us to use BTC. Second reason is centralization and decentralization.There are plenty of topics made on how Banks and Cryptocurrency are two different financial pathways. Even recently, i wrote an article in which i tried to tell the potential of BTC over Banking sector. --> To Understand the Potential of BTC, What we Must Know?. Well, other than this there are plenty of differences in which BTC away the competition with Banks.But still if you think Fednow service will not be manipulated by government and will be dealt as decentralized (which will not). Then you must check the maximum limit they are offering according to the article link you aforementioned. QuoteAt the outset, FedNow will have a maximum payment limit of $500,000, but banks can choose to lower that cap if need be.And i hope you better now there is not limit in BTC transactions.",

Unlike Bitcoin, the primary purpose of this particular currency is not for transactions. Instead, if you choose to transact with it, be aware that your activities will be closely monitored, even across international borders. Additionally, the currency being traded lacks the ability to experience significant price fluctuations, and there are no returns on holding it.",

Just some observations.  i already understand FedNow is not for international transfers. But if it was then I really wouldn't see the use of bitcoin unless someone is just an investor like gold. Quote from: pooya87Do you seriously not understand the difference between centralized fiat (and its alternatives) and decentralized money that is bitcoin after 2 years of being in this forum? Or are you just joking around with this?So I guess that means you get paid in bitcoin while most people get paid in fiat. They don't care about how much bitcoin their paycheck is worth they care about what it can buy them at the grocery store or somewhere else.Having bitcoin is nice but let's be honest, it's not convenient to use. You can't even use it on ebay and why would you want to? I would use a credit card that has some type of cash back reward, not something that is going to COST me to use...The system lets Americans pay for groceries instantly, businesses pay their suppliers, or people pay each other. It will be available 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with full access to funds immediately.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-launches-new-payments-system-that-lets-you-send-money-in-seconds-140305052.htmlAs far as I'm concerned, this FedNow might be just another reason for people to not have to use bitcoin. For them to not use it. It's up to them though. Zelle was pretty convenient and fast but they're a company. No one wants to trust a single company...but if you can't trust your government then you're in a problem!Quote from: Faisal2202 on July 24, 2023, 05:13:34 AMYou shared a good piece of information but it's little bit rusty (old). But still, this topic need no discussion but dear OP, your query do need some answers. Because this service is only available in USA not in other countries so this is the first reason for us to use BTC. Second reason is centralization and decentralization.How does one come to the conclusion that they first had fiat which was centralized and can't be trusted but all the sudden they turned it into something called bitcoin that is not centralized and can be trusted? Did they suddenly break the bonds of the government just by sending their US dollars to Coinbase and clicking on the \"buy bitcoin\" button? I doubt it. If anything, they're going to be scrutinized and monitored even more than someone that just keeps their money in a good old bank account. How is something decentralized when you have to report every single transaction you did where you sold some bitcoin? It's not.If bitcoin wasn't encumbered so heavily by the IRS I might have a better feeling about it.",

There has been many platforms that I have seen bitcoin payment, at least I have even used it directly before for payment.",

Maybe if there's a way where they can demonstrate how it works and how to use it, so it becomes easily adopted by their people. What worries me though is that there's no transaction fee which means that they haven't found a way to make sure that banks continue using the system, I hope that the transaction fee system would come from the Federal Reserve and not be shouldered by banks which is going to make it complicated since different banks will definitely do different systems.",

Because me as a newbie think that i better understand why we needed BTC and why we don't need fednow service. One of the many reasons are:BTC is decentralized and not managed by some single entity or governments thus cannot be stopped by them while FedNow can be stopped by government. BTC provides you full ownership without showing your personal identity while on FedNow you have to fill forums and have to integrate with BanksBanks always manipulate your money whether you use their service FedNow to send from one place to another, the transaction could be used too, For bad purposes. But BTC transactions cannot be manipulated. You have a limit on sending and receiving money through FedNow while if you are going to send or receive money on BTC core wallet or any SPV wallet then you have no limits. I think these facts are enough to remind you why we need BTC and why we don't need some instant payment service.",
