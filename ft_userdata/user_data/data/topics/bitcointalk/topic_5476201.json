It's unlikely that you can get away with this everything about the word mixers is filtered out based on theymos announcement so you cannot mention the word mixer the admin can make it a banned word and if you are caught trying to manipulate the sentence like mentioning mixer to m-i-x-e-r you are likely to get a ban This is one example of the filtered word that will likely come out but it will still depend on the forum admin's choice of words I used my forum dashboard as an example.",

Maybe Mixero gave you the idea. Projects are many and with different intentions, but if yours is too risky, it will be flagged and you will mount risk on the people who use it, including yourself. Risk in the sense that authorities are not senseless, they know what is going on, and for your coin/token to be used for some high profile m*x*ng kind of deals like the North Korean stuff, terrorism, child trafficking and many more, that project will be a subject of controversy and will be easily flagged by the authority, of which exchanges that makes business around coins/token to make them boom would have to abide with the authorities.Imagine all exchanges in the world suddenly stopped transactions with your multiple billion-dollar project.

I believe the Bitmixer owner consultation with his lawyers and his deeply thinking before closing down that platform will be serious enough for other mixers' owners to think about their services.That's not an interview, that's just article.Bitmixer owner said that he contacted his pastor, not his lawyer but this is bullshit. He smelled that it was dangerous to continue to operate Bitmixer.io and when he saw that so many people got arrested in 2016-17, he decided to shut down his service. He is the one of the smartest guy out there who knows when to start and when to stop. Bitmixer was a real money making machine.Why do you all think that Bitmixer owner was stupid? Mixer over mixer is created every day with the same algorithm, no significant improvement. Blockchain analysis companies are getting better and better. If it was impossible to arrest someone 6 years ago, now it's possible to easily catch with the help of blockchain. Blockchain is not an unreadable book anymore. Bitmixer owner suggested everyone to move on Monero if you want privacy and full anonymity, everything is clear.Want privacy without being in panic all the time? Use Monero.Want doubtful privacy and being in panic all the time? Use mixers.Choice is yours!Mixers will find another way to advertise their platforms, bitcointalk was not their only platform. They might still be able to bypass restrictions because there doesn't exist any restriction without loopholes. What about only this text in signature without ahref link? Sinbadio platform for your coin safety. It's still an advertisement, just simple text but easy to understand what website to visit for those who know ABC in computer and internet.",
