Another great benefit is that it is possible to use an 120mm fan that you want since the miner is not responsible anymore for the fans.In the miner the setting was changed to immersion mode, which doesn’t require fans at all. It will simply shut of the miner at a specific temperature (I set 85 Celsius), that temperature will not be reached since my fans are going at a fixed speed that keeps the miner at around 60-70 Celsius.Also I asked in the official Brains OS support thread, if there is a software solution to stop the „fan test“ at the beginning but apparently there is none. So for 11 USD I think it is a quiete good and simple solution.In the end it looks like this:Quote from: BitMaxz on November 13, 2022, 10:59:53 PMWhat OS do you currently using?

It has been a while since I mined at home so I don't use the function anymore, but IIRC, the fan would spin at full speed for a very very short period of time, and then quickly drops, so my guess is the fans start at 100% as soon as they get power, and then immediately after the firmware boots and starts controlling the control board it will command the fans to spin at low speed, but generally, the whole process does sound really quiet since with the stock firmware the fans continue to spin at full speed for a very long time (until the miner starts hashing).",

The fans do that themselves, apply power and they go to 100% before the firmware is even loaded to tell them to slow down (You can remove the fourth blue wire, and see for yourselves, its their default behavior).It is totally possible that there is no \"test\", since the miner needs a few second to boot up and in this period of time it can obviously not control the fan speed. Anyway the result is the same and will make the fans run at 100%. If you log into the dashboard when the miner boots up you will even see that it shows fan speed of 100% for a few seconds even if I set constant speed of 1%, thats why to me it seemed like the miner controlled it.",

It was a feature I requested to be made for a friend of mine in Siberia who was using his miners to heat his house (very common as the power is almost free out there) and didn't want the fans to ramp up too quickly. So we start the fans at a low speed and increment in small steps until temp is within desired range. So don't say it is impossible or an urban myth it's been a feature since March 14th 2019 for the Asic.to or Vnish firmware version 3.9 for the S9. I am honestly surprised braiins didn't copy this feature from us like most of the other features   So an alternative is to just uninstall and try ours. But I would recommend if you have 2x S9's to do our Dual mod where you run 2x s9 off 1 control board 1 psu and only 2 fans to get 72w/t or lower if you are lucky! (It's a great quiet space heater)But to be honest set our core temp to 90c on an s9 and it will be very quiet and fans won't ramp to fast anyways.ps. Use quiet fan mode at your own risk as temps can spike too quickly and fans will ramp up very slow so don't use it for a large overclock.",

Until you replace cgminer you are pirating software, this is a true fact and you can say nothing against it, that is what you are selling.tehehehe Look at our change log then look at yours 6-24 months later kiddo. Innovation is not copying what a smaller company does and putting a fancy name on it. Also \"everything you tried sucked\" err I have a good number of people now that got banned from your chat after complaining about the software who have since left the dark side and switched over... Also who invented Auto-tune,Temp Switch, Warm up mode, etc etc... that's right now sit boy.You realize your your autotune is based off our presets logic right we invented the feature you guys brag about the most and also implement worse than even MSK LMFAO. Don't even get me started with you use every exploit we created for the antminers but I mean we don't blame you because it's the easiest ones we use on the public. Their is a reason behind the presets but you haven't yet figured it out granted it's a small advantage but we rather keep that internal. Also no it does not have better efficiency that using two s9's powered by 1 psu and 1 control board and 2 fans. This has been proven years ago. Explain how using more fans and powering a full control board for 3 boards vs 6 makes it use less power    Woah we don't threaten anyone! Stop spreading lies that is disrespectful of you to spread more FUD. We will not stoop to you level and make racist remarks like you have towards out developers in the past. I don't think anyone on our team even thinks of yous unless we get pinged or when I get on this forum. Exception is one of your employees posts some sexual and porn gif's in telegram and yeah obviously I take notice then but he makes me laugh and that is not important!What memory leak caused by ourselves? I mentioned their is a memory leak in the most recent version. We don't need to stop cgminer or reboot it? I think your talking about your firmware I was told it reboots dozens of times of day. Actually hold up I got a photo of it from one of your old customers for the s19 who switched off because it damaged one of their miners and he sent me a photo of what it was doing for the past 2 weeks. I was shook when I saw that.\"So its a patch over a patch over patch\" What does this even mean? We don't charge any money it is free to download we don't believe in fiat.I am sorry btw. I usually come on here to mess with Kano but you are so more hot headed and fun to get a reaction out of you because you make yourself look like an ass. I also think you be on the drugs because you just said I might be Vnish lol. You are a quiet a ways out of the loop if you think I am Vnish. But this just made my Night thank you cutie pie.",
