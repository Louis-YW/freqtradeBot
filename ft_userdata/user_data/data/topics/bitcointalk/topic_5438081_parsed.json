It may be dust for a lot of people in this forum, but when investing in BTC, it is your own pocket you should be looking at, and your own source of income. O.1 BTC is a lot of money right now in my humble opinion, and it would be more in the future, so it is okay for long term holding.",

There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins, and there are currently 8 billion humans, 5 billion of which are aged between 15 and 64, more than half of which don't live decently (with good healthcare, food, shelter etc.). So, about 2.5 billion people make the rules. About 2 percent of those are millionaires according to google. So, mathematically speaking, owning a bitcoin puts you in the 1 percent of the hierarchy. Practically speaking, owning one bitcoin is a shitload amount of money for the most people. That's of course if we assume that it'll be global reserve asset, in each millionaire's portfolio. So yeah, 0.1 BTC is a good chunk for the long term.",

At least, you have some, and you acquire them using the money that you are fine losing. I don't know what other people deem 'enough' for their bitcoin ownership, but to me, as long as I have some disposable income, I buy bitcoins regardless of the price. If you really wanted to invest more in bitcoin, then maybe upgrading your sidejob may do the trick. Mind you, this does not only improve your capability in buying bitcoin but it also allows you to save more since you are receiving more money now so overall it's a win-win for you.",

Not bad, right? I know that it looks like a small amount, but you still have great earning capabilities when the bull market comes. Don't get pressured into buying more Bitcoin than you can afford, and certainly don't change your life just to accumulate more.There's an ongoing trend pressuring Bitcoin acquisition, something I noticed in newer members way too often because there's the fear of missing out. Unfortunately, most of us didn't have the chance to purchase in the earliest days and missed that opportunity, and especially newer users are afraid that this is their only chance.",

What do you feel about this? 0.1 BTC good enough or not. In my opinion, there is no limitation of enough or not enough in investing in Bitcoin for long-term period. What we need to think is the money or funds to invest. As long as they are free money without any doubt and we can afford it, this is enough. And every time if we have free money again, why not add the amount to increase the Bitcoin accumulation for the next bullish era preparation? This is good enough moreover if we are using the DCA we may decrease the small missing of chance. However, once more, this will depend on your own target. Sometimes, people are having certain targets in investing in Bitcoin and they want also altcoin investment. that is why it will depend on your own strategy. The wisest thing is that never put your money into hype coins or shit altcoins although they promise you many things.",

If the best you can save up, in the long run, is an equivalent of ~$2,300, then your best bet would be to acquire some marketable skills and boost your earnings.
