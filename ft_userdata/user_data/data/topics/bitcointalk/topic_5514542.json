I gifted you with a red flag because you tried to impersonate someone I believe made a big change in how we thought in our financial institutions as in the banks. I would love to hear from the original guy who holds this alt account and is trying to act smart by confusing the newbies who might think this might be the original Satoshi. If you have any issues then contact me by replying to my reply as I want to decimate you and the reason being you are a fake. I would love to see a new topic created by you on the reputation board about me as it will help me in going deep in your past",
