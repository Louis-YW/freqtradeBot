Even if something catastrophic doesn't happen it could be instant \"sell the news\" -event where everyone has waited so long for the forked coins and possible price rising and when that happens, they dump the market. And even people not dumping will found out nothing special happens immediately they get bored and probably lot of them will sell.2. That's just being cautious. They are dealing with very high marketcap coin with insane volume. If something WOULD go wrong, without backrolling the chain the damage could be worth billions.3. What's happening now is a hard fork that prepares the chain for the merge. Â The merget itself is happening around 13-15th.",

Loads of profits will only go to the whales, if you can afford 1 ETH for 1500$ then you will earn 2.8% of that since the ETHPow value is way lesser than Eth itself, 1ETH: 1ETH Pow and that's like 30-40$ on 1500$ lol, if I have less than 1 ETH what will happen? ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ not going to worth it for many.",

We still don't know what would happen during the merge. One bad line of code would blow up everything. If that happens, they will do a roll back and everything happened during and after the merge will get erased. I am not saying it will happen but the chances will always be there no matter how slim they are. Better be safe than sorry.To be on the safest side, it is probably better to convert your holdings to some other good coin like for example, bitcoin. You can convert them back to eth later on.",

It is very difficult to predict further developments, but the best solution would be to borrow ETH before the merger, get ETH PoW after the fork and pay off the ETH debt.",

I am not that deep into all the coding stuff and therefore i am no expert in what that merge really will bring execpt from the fact that Ethereum will no longer be a proof of work coin but a proof of stake coin then. I do think though that many users may have exaggerated expectations to that merge and what it will mean in regards to transfer fees on the ETH chain.I can imagine that some people could sell off their ETH if they realise that the merge did not have the impact on the transfer fees that they would have expected.On the other hand ETH is so big now that i think it is almost impossible that it will lose relevance and that it won't be a top 5 coin in a few years anymore or something like that.",

But upgrading to POS of ethereum is really necessary as it has become very slow and old, scalability is not available, especially gas fees hinder eth development. Moving to POS, eth will be more eco-friendly as it reduces energy usage by up to 99% and token deflation will also make eth more scarce, thereby boosting the price of eth.",
