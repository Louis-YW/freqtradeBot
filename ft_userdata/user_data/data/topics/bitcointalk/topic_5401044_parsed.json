On each Earth, there are a trillion people. Each person has a trillion computers. Each computer generates a trillion keys a second. All these computers have been creating a trillion keys per second since the birth of the universe 13.7 billion years ago. 10^12 * 10^12 * 10^12 * 10^12 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 13.7 * 10^9 = 4.3*10^65. This means thay they would have so far generated approximately 0.0000000004% of all private keys.-Bitcoin is decentralized, any miners who mine Bitcoin and validate the transaction are proving anyone can take a part in Bitcoin network.-The failed to remember or lose the seeds/passphrase is the user fault, not Bitcoin.-In Bitcoin no one force you to buy it, it's on your own belief to trust Bitcoin or not. If you didn't understand and know the risk about Bitcoin, then just don't buy Bitcoin. Buy any asset without any knowledge is really dumb.-Blockchain is just a public ledger, where anyone can see any transactions. If you're referring to Bitcoin block, where it's mined and stored on the blockchain, then it's also secure since you can't add random block to the blockchain. You need to find and solve the right block, 51% attack is almost impossible when most of Bitcoin already being mined and the difficulty are increase a lot.

Crypto laymen might be enticed because of this magic word without knowing that it's just that, a word. Blockchain is another prostituted term in the crypto industry. What's the big deal with this new kind of database? Security? Not really. Just hours ago, a largely popular blockchain, Solana, shut down.

      "body": "Here is the letter:Quote from: https://concerned.tech/letter-congressional.pdfDear U.S. Congressional Leadership, Committee Chairs and Ranking Members,We are 26 computer scientists, software engineers, and technologists who have spent decades working in these fields producing innovative and effective products for a variety of applications in database technology, cryptography, open-source software, and financial technology applications.Today, we write to you urging the Committee to take a critical, skeptical approach toward industry claims that crypto-assets (sometimes called cryptocurrencies, crypto tokens, or web3) are an innovative technology that is unreservedly good. We urge you to resist pressure from digital asset industry financiers, lobbyists, and boosters to create a regulatory safe haven for these risky, flawed, and unproven digital financial instruments and to instead take an approach that protects the public interest and ensures technology is deployed in genuine service to the needs of ordinary citizens.We strongly disagree with the narrative—peddled by those with a financial stake in the crypto-asset industry—that these technologies represent a positive financial innovation and are in any way suited to solving the financial problems facing ordinary Americans.Not all innovation is unqualifiedly good; not everything that we can build should be built. The history of technology is full of dead ends, false starts, and wrong turns. Append-only digital ledgers are not a new innovation. They have been known and used since 1980 for rather limited functions.As software engineers and technologists with deep expertise in our fields, we dispute the claims made in recent years about the novelty and potential of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology cannot, and will not, have transaction reversal mechanisms because they are antithetical to its base design. Similarly, most public blockchain-based financial products are a disaster for financial privacy; the exceptions are a handful of emerging privacy-focused blockchain finance alternatives, and these are a gift to money-launderers. Financial technologies that serve the public must always have mechanisms for fraud mitigation and allow a human-in-the-loop to reverse transactions; blockchain permits neither.By its very design, blockchain technology, specifically so-called “public blockchains”, are poorly suited for just about every purpose currently touted as a present or potential source of public benefit. From its inception, this technology has been a solution in search of a problem and has now latched onto concepts such as financial inclusion and data transparency to justify its existence, despite far better solutions already in use. After more than thirteen years of development, it has severe limitations and design flaws that preclude almost all applications that deal with public customer data and regulated financial transactions and are not an improvement on existing non-blockchain solutions.Finally, blockchain technologies facilitate few, if any, real-economy uses. On the other hand, the underlying crypto-assets have been the vehicle for unsound and highly volatile speculative investment schemes that are being actively promoted to retail investors who may be unable to understand their nature and risk. Other significant externalities include threats to national security through money laundering and ransomware attacks, financial stability risks from high price volatility, speculation and susceptibility to run risk, massive climate emissions from the proof-of-work technology utilized by some of the most widely traded crypto-assets, and investor risk from large scale scams and other criminal financial activity.We ask you to take a truly responsible approach to technological innovation and ensure that individuals in the US and elsewhere are not left vulnerable to predatory finance, fraud, and systemic economic risks in the name of technological potential which does not exist.The risks and externalities related to blockchain technologies and crypto-asset investments are neither isolated nor are they the growing pains of a nascent technology. They are the inevitable outcomes of a technology that is not built for purpose and will remain forever unsuitable as a foundation for large-scale economic activity.Given these risks and externalities, together with the—at best still-ambiguous and at worst non-existent—uses of blockchain, we recommend that the Committee look beyond the hype and bluster of the crypto industry and understand not only its inherent flaws and extraordinary defects but also the litany of technological fallacies it is built upon.We need to act now to protect investors and the global financial marketplace from the severe risks posed by crypto-assets and must not be distracted by technical obfuscations which mask an abject lack of technological utility. We thank you for your leadership on financial technology and regulation and urge you to consider our objective and independent expert judgments to guide your legislative priorities, which we remain happy to discuss anytime.",

You can forget the whereabouts of your gold and lose it, does that mean gold is not safe?Quote from: KennyR on June 01, 2022, 11:40:41 PM“We urge you to resist pressure from digital asset industry financiers, lobbyists and boosters to create a regulatory safe haven for these risky, flawed and unproven digital financial instruments\"I don't understand the motive here.

And again, it is true that most investors don't have an idea of what they are doing. So, I pretty much agree with this.Quote from: KennyR on June 01, 2022, 11:40:41 PMThe computational power behind blockchain is the equivalent of what one could do in a centralized way with a $100 computer.If you want a centralized server you can have one for $100.

If he don't like crypto, he don't have to participate.Quote from: KennyR on June 01, 2022, 11:40:41 PMWhat about your view on these statements?He has some legit concerns but the rest of the world won't care and crypto will do its thing anyway.",

Peeps are so crazy about it they have started to integrate quantum computing to break the code with at-most failure in the same. Quote“We urge you to resist pressure from digital asset industry financiers, lobbyists and boosters to create a regulatory safe haven for these risky, flawed and unproven digital financial instruments\"There is no pressure at all. That's the beauty of crypto space. If you want to use it then use it. There is no documentation needed to transact on the blockchain, you are doing it at free will, so that statement is definitely contradictory. Quote\"Crypto-assets have been the vehicle for unsound and highly volatile speculative investment schemes that are being actively promoted to retail investors who may be unable to understand their nature and risk.”The volatility is since it's inception but slowly every trader using it to day trade effectively and earn their daily wagers. So I would care less about its volatility in the long term usage. QuoteThe computational power behind blockchain is the equivalent of what one could do in a centralized way with a $100 computer.Thats really misleading statement. There is no proof like that. If you have to create solid system which can not be hacked, and has data integrity at its best then you need to invest into technological advances. Let's not forget those miners do get paid for the same. Quote“We’re essentially wasting millions of dollars worth of equipment because we’ve decided that we don’t trust the banking system.”We are not, because its a system where energy is utilised, we pay bills, money keeps circulating in the system and life goes on smoothly in the crypto space.",

Meanwhile, fintechs are trying really hard to [among other things] bank the unbanked, with their own proprietrary systems. Nothing wrong with that, and hey - it's good that these guys can now do what banked people can do - but these initiatives are often limited to a single country.Bitcoin is the first global means of payment invented. Let that sink into your head. And let's forget about the bulk of the get-rich-quick coins for a second - They never served a useful purpose for the masses anyway.And to say, over everything else, that you don't believe a crypto is secured because you can lose the password to your wallet - that is the ultimate blasphemy. Because you can already get locked out of your social media and banks if you forget your password and lose your 2FA anyway [in the case of banks they probably ask for your ID or SSN to give you back access. Let's not forget though that Bitcoin is a technology for banking the unbanked who do not have this type of info.]So it's not a question about \"why don't we trust the system\", it's whether the current global community can afford to trust the system. You'll find that most of them will say no, because then they would have no money! Cash is out of the question, because it can inflate and lose its value over a year [especially in 3rd world countries].This leaves the only option left to the masses - cryptocurrency. And whosoever comes to this space just to invent a coin to dump it later, then damned be to them. This industry is for REAL users only.And anyone, who thinks, whether by writing a letter, or a legislation, that they can take this free technology away from the people, is mistaken. For crypto is the symbol of total financial freedom.",
