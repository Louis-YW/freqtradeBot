You can spend outputs regardless of the number of your addresses. It doesn't matter if they're of low value, as long as they aren't dust. Also, having different addresses doesn't have to do with this; spending from an address that's constantly reused only harms your privacy and comes with no benefits than generating a new one each time. For small amounts, utilize the Lightning Network.",

Each seed is has this potencial. And all those addresses have a mathematical relationship between them.Making a few dozens won't Hurt.From mastering bitcoin:QuoteThe HD wallet tree structure offers tremendous flexibility. Each parent extended key can have 4 billion children: 2 billion normal children and 2 billion hardened children. Each of those children can have another 4 billion children, and so on. The tree can be as deep as you want, with an infinite number of generations.https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch05.asciidoc#navigating-the-hd-wallet-tree-structure",

The number of possible Bitcoin addresses is practically in-exhaustable.In comparison, you have a very limited number of T-Shirts.

I can easily say that mathematically, the chances of it happening is 100% assuming that I replace urandom with a fixed entropy for every address generated within a single OS. Introducing and manipulating variables that would affect and skew the results wouldn't be very fair and is not what is supposed to happen under normal circumstances.Not really sure how is the first scenario relates to address collision?",

This is something wallets are also able to do, and it's usually done automatically.The takeaway from this is that you don't waste coins by leaving a tiny mount in one address, they can be spent along with other inputs as well.But I agree with above users that LN should be used for such small amounts anyway.",

However, they don't care about possible unintended bad consequences that may come with switching to a less wasteful consensus algorithm because they think bitcoin has no real value at all. Spending any amount of energy on something of no value may be considered a waste of energy. The same rule applies to \"waste of bitcoin addresses.\" If you don't see how non-reuse of addresses benefits your privacy and protects you from other external attacks, you automatically consider it a waste of resources.

Addresses exist to make things easier for us to read and understand. When you choose which coins to spend in a transaction, although you might pick an address, the protocol is looking at the previous transaction hash and output index. When you send coins to an address, the protocol is actually dealing with the locking script. Therefore, it makes no difference if you use the same address 1000 times or if you use 1000 different addresses.
