Would people be willing to have a nominally more secure hot wallet that is less private?Starting with: A wallet on your phone or PC is not secure, we all accept that. Would people want one that has some 2nd form of authentication that could probably be used to identify you, but in the event that the device was compromised not allow funds to be sent.Kind of like it only sends it's transactions through a certain set of servers, and after you create and transmit the transaction you have to then do a quick login and approve. Just talking about some things with some people the other day and the subject came up of more secure then hot, but don't want to deal with a hardware wallet / multisig / anything like that.-Dave",

And most people have some sort of locking mechanism on their phone. So for someone to access your wallet they must first bypass/crack/know your master phone security lock and then bypass/crack/know your wallet security lock as well. Which is why I made my point above - if someone can already do this to access the wallet app, then presumably they can also do it for any 2FA setup using the same device.Quote from: DaveF on September 19, 2022, 03:59:44 PMPersonally, I treat my hot wallet like cash.

As I've said many times before in various threads, the whole point of a 2FA set up is that it is a second factor that is required to authenticate you, your transaction, your account, whatever.

If both wallet and 2FA can be compromised by compromising a single device, then it isn't a second factor at all - it is the same factor.Compromising one factor doesn't necessarily lead to compromising the other factor, even if both factors rely on a single device. For example, you can duplicate fingerprints and access someone's mobile phone with installed bitcoin wallets, but that doesn't automatically mean that you can guess a password to an authentication application or that you can break the system and extract all sensitive information. Even if you succeeded in extracting this data, it still remains encrypted with the algorithm that will take years to break. Two-factor authentication is about different forms of identification, not necessarily about different types of devices: I can use my fingerprint as a first factor and a strong password as a second factor. Both these factors will be used to create a separate layer of security (specifically, encryption), which means both layers need to be broken for data compromise. Whether these layers are on a single device or on multiple devices doesn't really matter, because it always will depend on who you are trying to protect yourself from. Skilled hackers or intelligence agencies will find a way to hack all your devices, but not all people are being chased by those.",

So, if my device was compromised physically, I'd automatically assume that everything on it is compromised, even though in the majority of cases this wouldn't be the case. However, I like to have contingency plans so if this ever did happen, I'd be able to either wiping it from a distance, change the credentials or move the funds if it's Bitcoin. Physical security in my opinion is one of the easiest options anyhow. Fingerprints aren't secure absolutely aren't, there's just too many ways of obtaining fingerprints which you might not be aware of at the time. Even with a password plus a fingerprint, I feel like the fingerprint additional step is just trivial rather than adding any meaningful protection. Obviously, it would protect you from distance attacks, but for physical attacks or by someone who's in close proximity of you, it's rather trivial.",

For example, shared custody with a third party involves both yours and their risk, but shared. If you don't feel confident with this either, you can hand over your custody to that one third party. That's your best course if you consider yourself very clumsy and uncertain. Perhaps do some search for someone who's reputable enough to handle your funds; don't just pick randomly. You should also make sure both you and the third party acknowledge that it's likely for your device(s) to be compromised, and introduce more reputable third parties (such as email, SMS etc.) each time you make a transaction.  On the other hand, if you feel you can handle this yourself, and believe you're more capable of managing that money than anyone, then you need to behave securely in another manner. Namely, to take care of your system, verify what's about to be installed, use reputable open-source software, and the like.

With this definition, then any mobile wallet is already using 2FA, since you must first unlock the phone with one PIN/password, and then unlock the wallet app with a second PIN/password. I would not call this two factors, just as I don't call my encrypted wallet files stored on a hard disk which is also encrypted two factors, despite needing two different decryption keys to access the wallets.2FA isn't just two different passwords. In it's most basic form, it should be something you know (a password or login) and something you have (ideally a hardware key, but more usually a software key in the form of a TOTP from another electronic device, usually a phone). These must be separate or they aren't two factors; they are just a more complex single factor. Of course more passwords and more layers will add security, but it will never be two factors as long as all those layers are on the same device.If an attacker can both physically access your phone and has been able to hack/crack/steal/observe or otherwise gain knowledge of one password, then it is highly likely your second password is also at high risk of compromise. hence the reason the two factors must be separate or they aren't two factors at all.",

Whoever compromises my phone can access my Discord (assuming they already know my password), so it's 1 factor over all. That's poor security.2FA should be 2 factors that are not correlated with each other.

It's only recommendable to do your upmost when it comes to securing your funds, and therefore half arsing a two factor authentication (2FA) doesn't really cut it. Every security practice you can put into place has a downside, however it completely depends on your threat model what you deem acceptable risk, and what you don't deem acceptable risk. Personally, a lot of the traditional two factor authentications are half arsed, and wouldn't cut it for me. I'd say that weak 2FA is only acceptable if A) you know the risks, and accept them B) It's a temporary measure until you can implement better security. I'm a firm believer that security shouldn't be compromised on unless the drawbacks are much, much higher than the benefits. For example, security should only be compromised for convenience, however if you compromise too much, you no longer have security. If you don't have enough convenience it's likely to cause you problems, i.e having a key file stored 100 miles away from you, in a field is probably going to cause more harm than good if you need that to access funds.",

Like I said previously, compared to no 2FA at all, weak 2FA is technically an improvement. It will thwart certain types of attack that would previously have succeeded.I get the emotional argument that you should go all the way or not bother at all, but that's not a defensible position, IMO.

Keep in mind that when you use something frequently, it can be a headache to have to always check another device. Also, there may be emergency cases to use your wallet and you will be in trouble, so hot wallet is hot and cold is cold, hot isn't meant to be as protected as cold. Imagine, you are using an app and someone probably got your login/password details and tries to log in but you get the message on your smartphone as a second method of verification, more likely you are the only one who has access to it. So, it gets harder for the attacker to achieve the aim.2FA on a hot wallet, for me, means double security, not supreme security. If you take care of your device, visit only clean websites and know a thing about security, you can relax.Keep in mind that 2FA can't protect you if some criminal catches you and has control over you and your devices when the power and fear are in action.The only perfect thing that could protect you would be something that's able to analyze your face, eyes, voice and have a heart-rate scanner (I mean the way smartphones show your heart rate by putting a finger) but instead of putting a finger, it should analyze your fingerprint too. By analyzing, according to face, eyes, voice and heart rate, it should determine whether the owner feels scared, under pressure or relaxed.I know this sounds like science fiction but I think in the future, something like this will be developed for perfect security of bank accounts, crypto wallets, etc.",

I understand that Bitfinex contracted with a third party to act as a “2nd factor” when signing outgoing transactions, while Bitfinex also held a third key that was kept in cold storage. I understand that Bitfinex would craft and sign transactions, and would send the partially signed transactions to the third party via their api, and if the api key (credentials) was valid, the third party would provide the second signature for the transactions (the transactions were from 2 of 3 multi sig addresses). Based on the publicity available facts, it appears that the hacker was able to compromise the server that interacts with the third party, changed the settings to allow for the third party to sign a higher volume of transactions, along with the private keys that are intended to be “hot”. I don’t think it is possible for an app to prevent the user from automatically entering credentials, and even an on-screen keyboard can be compromised. I believe the above system was sold by the third party as being as good as cold storage, as it required multiple institutions to sign outgoing transactions. I think “2FA” systems would be sold as something as good as cold storage. I think that even if it wasn’t sold as such, users would implement it as such. I really don’t think the potential for improved security is not there. You can improve security by implementing multi sig. Security will only be improved if multiple devices are used to sign transactions. That’s the only way.",
