After reading this, probably half or more of your possible future questions will be answered already. BTC White Paper: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfBitcoin mining is not that simple. I myself wanted to mine before but my place's electricity rate is too expensive for BTC mining. Mining or the Proof-of-Work is also in the White Paper. After reading it and you are interested in mining then you can find a lot of helpful threads including guides, tips, and hardware in this section. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=14.0There are a lot of scammers in this world either in fiat or in crypto. You must be vigilant. And put it into your mind that everything you find here in crypto is a scam unless proven legit. Upon reading the White Paper you will find out that there is no such thing as referrals in order to earn Bitcoin.",

Mining a Bitcoin doesn't need an app to mine Bitcoin what you need is an ASIC unit that supports sha256 algo to mine Bitcoin. Since you are a newbie I suggest you search more about mining Bitcoin because you can only mine Bitcoin with ASIC machines and better learn more about this First time/Small miner reference for getting started.",

This is how new bitcoins are \"minted\" and introduced into the network.So in order to mine BTC, there is no such thing as mining app. Cloud mining can be done by some source (I have not verified it yet), But they are most likely going to ask you to deposit certain amount of \"X\" token to withdraw that bonus or \"mined\" BTC from that app. So just stay away from that.",

Maybe many of us know that Bitcoin mining requires a lot of electricity which is not possible for everyone. But let's take a look at how much electricity is required? According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, generating bitcoins consumes 94.2 terawatt-hours of electricity per year. A few other countries use even more. According to a statistics 2021, one Bitcoin can be mined with the amount of electricity a household will consume approximately 9 years.Here we get a general idea about electricity. Now let's see what kind of computer or hardware is needed for mining?Bitcoin mining requires what we call powerful computers. But what about that computer? Specific integrated circuits, or ASICs for Bitcoin mining can cost more then $10,000. So if we say that Bitcoin mining is easy with an app? Of course not. Moreover, some scammers recommend using various software or apps for Bitcoin mining which should never be installed. Rather, they can be called a means of stealing your personal information and secret numbers.",

This question arises in lots of people. We know that modern day smart phones work like computers. Which we can take as a computer in any case. And we can easily set up any computer to do Bitcoin Hash Competing. Whose only task will be to calculate the computing hash. When requested by the Bitcoin software, miners usually have to do the job correctly and seamlessly.Basically smartphones are not suitable for this task. We should use whatever we need. With smartphones you can do one of the many mining tasks that are not suitable or professional mining. Mining requires a powerful computer otherwise a suitable mining environment will not be created. We know that Bitcoin mining requires a lot of advanced technology with powerful computing power.In the early days of Bitcoin mining, you could mine Bitcoin with a computer or laptop. At that time you were occasionally rewarded by creating a block. There was not much competition in that mining. Currently miners compete to beat each other and they also work together in mining pools.The first ASICs emerged after 2013. which was prepared only for Bitcoin mining. It is designed for mining in single-use cases. As it is very powerful, it is able to provide fast exact solutions in Hash computations.",

We know that Bitcoin mining requires a lot of advanced technology with powerful computing power.This isn't very accurate, most \"powerful computers\" are not suitable for BTC mining, mining needs DEDICATED chips that do NOTHING but hash sha256, which is why they are called (application-specific integrated circuit miners), in fact, you could argue that those ASIC miners are not powerful computers by any means given that you have not defined what \"computing\" actually is, your smartphone is likely more powerful in general computing than the most recent miner in the market.QuoteIn the early days of Bitcoin mining, you could mine Bitcoin with a computer or laptop.

Currently miners compete to beat each other and they also work together in mining pools.The only reason why CPUs and GPUs can no longer mine Bitcoin is due to the increase in difficulty and not the increase of miners as people, the concept of miners competing against each other has been there from the get-go, however, the term \"compete against each other\" is somehow misleading, because they are not, miners compete against block target/difficulty, a hash with a nonce that's lucky enough to solve a block, even when there was only a Satoshi mining BTC he had to compete against difficulty to solve blocks if it's just competing against \"others\" then satoshi would have mined the 21m bitcoin's in no time.Furthermore, if everyone stops mining today and they leave just one miner, it doesn't mean he will the blocks which were supposed to the rest of the miners, the single miner will only get the blocks that he would have gotten with nobody leaving the network, of course, since he will need a very long time to finish the epoch, the difficulty will start to slowly adjust until him alone can mine a block every 10 mins, but that will only be possible because difficulty dropped not because \"competitors\" left.Quoteit is able to provide fast exact solutions in Hash computations.fast yes, exact, nop, ASICs produce fast-random-hashes and that's all about it.",

Considering the network difficulty there is a high chance you will utilize more power, time etc on your device before you could even earn something out of it. The only person/entity that benefits from this entire scam system is the one who built it. The referral programs are just another big loaded scam where you are actually helping the entity to bring collective hashing power and thus they end up earning some bucks in the background.
