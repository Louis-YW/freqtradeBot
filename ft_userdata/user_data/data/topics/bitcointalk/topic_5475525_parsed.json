      "body": "Will it work? Yes.But when using AC to cool miners keep in mind you are going to burning more power to run them so that cuts into profits.Also you have to have a spare or risk bad things potentially happening if loose your cooling and the farm keeps running. Miners *should* shutdown at overheat. But should and do are 2 different words. Also, how is the humidity where you are?-Dave",

Of course it can!But you haven't told us how much heat you're making there, you have 4 S9 or 30 S19 there, when you say summer is that 30C or 45C outside?The thing is that in extreme situations you might have to spend( depending on the electricity price) too much of a percentage on cooling, so maybe just doubling the air flow would be a cheaper and just as effective solution.And the machine numbers and their watts will also give a clue on the tent/room solution, I personally would always feel on edge knowing there are 25kw running in a 2 cubic meter oversized pot bag.",
