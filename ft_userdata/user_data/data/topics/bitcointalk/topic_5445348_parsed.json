This will depend on your jurisdiction, but it is another way to be the house with the slot machine. This option is much more feasible and I don't think it costs you any money up front.",

The only way to become slot boss or admin may be by owning your own slot machine and having it calibrated to favour the house, following some set rule but that way you are the sole operator.",

That way, you have full control over the casino and can have the benefits without sharing them with others.Or you can also look for job offers as a slot admin on many freelance sites with various payouts. We as gamblers, can only play gambling as usual and experience defeats and wins like other people. Beyond that, it is the casinos that continue to earn the most. And if players don't, they don't need to play gambling anymore but stop for good. Gambling does have opportunities to lose and win so people need to know about it.",

Is it someone who is working for a casino or working for the provider of the slots or someone else and what are the job desk of this admin? If there is a statement that slot admin is the only one who can win in slot, does it mean that this admin is someone who can control the result of the game or has a secret trick to win? In general meaning, admin who is working for a company/casino/provider will not be able to do it because he/she is working for the company to help the company, not to make profit/win from their own games by a special trick or by controlling the game.",

He probably would want to hire someone that is smart, knows the gambling basics and beyond but most importantly, he would want to hire someone he could trust. You need to show him that you are not going to fuck him over. It is every employer's dream to find a solid, reliable worker. Don't expect them to be impressed by your college degrees.",

Also, it seems to me that you should be proficient in HTML5, CSS3 programming languages, JavaScript knowledge, experience with at least game engines, well, they can probably tell you after you submit your resume to the game slots developer company. Or did you also mean the administrator of slot machines in an online casino? but there, in addition to everything else, you will need to have knowledge of the rules of online gambling and laws depending on the territories of presence, and of course the availability of appropriate technical and specific knowledge.",

Does anyone know how to become a slot admin?Admins? You presumably mean the owner of these casino sites which is quite different, they are the biggest winners because admin type roles will only be pulling a salary from being part of the casino staff. At the beginning of cryptocurrency the market was a lot easier to break into and that's how some early companies started on a very low budget. However nowadays you will need millions to get a casino to the point of being super successful and paying for itself. If for no other reason than the moment you are identified as earning a lot of money, you will become a target and have to pay a lot for security to fend off different types of attacks. You'll also need to pay out a lot in terms of welcome bonuses and advertising campaigns, otherwise it will take a painfully long time to become distinguished and in that time if you have found a unique selling point it will be copied.",

This is also the first time I heard about this kind of strategy since mostly people want to become the full owner of the casino and it's obvious that it costs alot. I haven't heard of someone become a co owner of slots through this, not unless you have someone close to you who happens to be an owner of that casino or slot machine.I do agree with them that it is not you agains't the machine, instead it is you against the house and you'll eventually lose so it is also a wise decision to be a co-owner and that's new for me.

Also for lots of competition to get this job you need some connections which can help you to get a high chance to get hired by the casino owners.But if you also think that admins have better chance to win on the casino well its still the same, there's no difference between casual gamblers to a person who work on a casino.",

People think I may get the extra benefit from being a casino staff. But, the truth is, If the casino uses provably fair technology, There is no way they can do a favor for a specific player or person. No matter who plays the games, they will get treated as same because the game doesn't know who you are. You invented a gun doesn't mean you won't die at a gunshot. I hope my explanation makes sense. There could be another side; Casinos may have something to do with the slots. But that game is not fair anymore.

If you are interested in playing slot games, doing so responsibly and within your means is essential.
