The first is to work on, the second doesn't have internet and now has 5 partition images:1. A fresh installation with VPN2. A fresh installation with VPN and BCH full client, synced up to 2010, and set to prune. And BCH's Electrum Fork.3. A fresh installation with VPN and BTG full client, synced up to 2010, and set to prune. And BTG's Electrum Fork (using wine).4. A fresh installation with VPN and BCD full client, synced up to 2010, and set to prune. And BCD's Electrum Fork.5. A fresh installation with VPN and eCash full client, synced up to 2010, and set to prune. And eCash'es Electrum Fork.The laptop doesn't have enough disk space to keep all full clients.This setup makes it much easier to handle Forkcoins: I restore the partition I need, boot into it, import the address/pubkey, and let it sync. When done, I take it offline, enter the private key, and create a raw transaction to transfer funds. After that, I boot into the second Linux distribution to overwrite the first partition. This makes offline signing relatively easy without ever risking the private key to untrusted software.All this fits on 160 GB",

      "body": "\"help the network\" is a broad spectrum. There is a bunch of things that a bitcoin node does. One of them is to send historical blocks to other peers, which a pruned node can not do.Other than that a pruned node does everything else:- It enforces the consensus rules by downloading and verifying everything and rejecting anything that is invalid (eg. an invalid tx sent to its mempool).- It can validate and relay transactions and help propagate then through the network- It can validate and relay new blocks and blocks in recent history (like past 1-2 days) depending on the dedicated disk size- It can show support about changes like soft forks we rarely have- And of course it helps keep Bitcoin network decentralized- They can even provide some services to light clients (I don't think they do though, they just can)",

      "body": "Yeah, to put it basically. Although, less than a full node. Unless you want to do it as a hobby, we probably would prefer full nodes to pruned nodes. Although, it's not like the network is in dire need, so while every node does count, it really depends on what your motivations are. You aren't going to earn from it, and you aren't going to be giving the full benefits to the network, however you will be providing more of a contribution by running a pruned node, than without running one at all. So, it depends on your situation, and whether or not you can justify the costs associated with running a pruned node, whether it's worth it or not.

I usually do it via Qubes OS so everything is isolated, and no need for a old computer, unless of course you want physical isolation, which is always going to be theoretically better than virtualisation.",

I doubt anyone has looked as this though. I imagine the differences aren't all that much in terms of energy consumption. Especially if you're running it on a cmd line based system, rather than a graphical interface. Might be something I'm interested in doing though. If anyone has any thoughts on the best way of going about measuring the consumption of both, I'd like to hear them.",

I have one of this devices you can plug in electric socket and measure how electricity is spent by any device, but I never tested this with laptop running bitcoin node.If someone wants to save on electric bills I would rather use Raspberry Pi, that spends much less than any laptop but downside is much slower cpu speed.Bigger older screens with higher resolution needs more power, but you don't really need screen all the time.",

That's 130 kWh/year. I've seen quotes of people paying $0.05 per kWh, but here new contracts go around â‚¬0.80 nowadays. So I guess it depends on where you are. Chances are a VPS is cheaper if you pay those very high rates.QuoteI think old laptops spend a lot of energy for screens and processors, but turning off screen can reduce consumption.Used RAM is cheap so I don't think that would be a problem, if it's not soldered and can be upgraded.With 160 GB, I think of an old 1 GB netbook. You may be able to upgrade, but it won't accept more than 2 GB.Quote from: Welsh on August 25, 2022, 11:19:29 AMMight be something I'm interested in doing though.

Hey, you've been doing it for a while so nothing wrong with your approach, I was just wondering, since I'm very cautious of unknown applications, even when running on Linux. Strictly downloading the software, isolating it, so that it doesn't compromise to machine or the network. Network is the weakest point in your process I'd assume, but if you aren't executing it on a internet connected device, then I suppose the risk is minimal anyway.

Raspberry Pi 400 works like that, there is no fan just one big metalic heatsink, and it's not spending more than 5w according to various tests, that is much less than any laptops.I don't know any modern laptop without fan (except some with ARM processors like Pinebook or MNT reform) and I think it wont last very long without fan cooler.35w or 45w is standard for processors but you can always tweak settings in BIOS and make it draw less power with underclocking.Quote from: LoyceV on August 25, 2022, 01:37:35 PMIf the CPU doesn't overheat without the fan, it can't draw that much power.

AFAIK you can't serve BIP 37/157 request with pruned node.I mainly had the initial syncing in mind considering that AFAIK pruned nodes store all block headers so they can still provide that to SPV clients that are syncing.Considering that pruned nodes store chainstate, the SPV clients should technically be able to ask a pruned node if a UTXO is still unspent or receive a set of UTXOs that belong to their address.
