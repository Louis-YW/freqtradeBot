      "body": "Do you mean getting a bonus round with only 150 spins?That would be tough since 150 spins are pretty low and the bonus round is randomly triggered. Sometimes you'll get no bonus rounds even after 500 spins.However, I'd suggest you search for medium-volatility, reasonable max-win, and multiple feature rounds games. A game like Tomb of Nefertiti (Nolimit) I think strikes all the requirements. It would be pretty unlucky if you get no:- Wild Raider- Curse of Nefertiti, or- Raider (Free) Spins; after 150 spins.",

      "body": "If you have some money to invest, I suggest playing a slot that includes a bonus buy feature. You avoid all the unnecessary spinning and searching for scatters by doing it that way. Online slots are completely based on luck and the RNG determines if and when you will win. There is no certainly you will be successful after 150 or 150.000 spins. On the other hand, you can also get lucky and trigger the bonus rounds after the first spin. No one knows.",

Their RTP’s is also high that is very good for bonus hunt since you will surely consume a lot of spin if you will hunt a bonus.I’m only doubtful about 150 spins for bonus hunt though. Most likely you will need low volatility slot games in able to achieve a bonus with just small amount of spin. Try Play’n Go and Pragmatic if you want to stick with that low spin count.",

I usually get free spin frequently on AvatarUX slot games but the return is very low if the bonus is hit using few spin.",

      "body": "Play N Go slots as swogerino say, gives you a bonus round at least after every 200 spins. It’s 50 short from what you normally do but honestly speaking dude if you’re hoping for a bonus round after a measly 150 spin yiu might as well ask for a goose that lays golden eggs cause that’s a much easier to achieve task than what you’re looking for. I myself spend as much as 500 spins every game without a consistent bonus round so what less would your chances be if you’d just stick with spending 150 spins. As far as I know this game provider’s the most generous out of every slot creator out there cause most of them are completely randomized (even play n go but I’m positive they had some pity system in there that makes it easier to get a bonus round compared to other games in here but whatever.)",

      "body": "It's funny that all people care about is bonuses, free spins, so if a new casino appears that offers games with lots of free spins and lots of bonuses, people will immediately create an account at the casino, they won't worry about things like casino security, reputation, whether or not it has kyc, what is the minimum withdrawal amount and what is the amount charged in the withdrawal fee, people will not worry about that, all they will be chasing is the bonus, but because of this greedy thinking and that scammers have been very successful in creating scam casinosscammers know that all they need is just to create a casino and they offer many bonuses that with that they will be able to deceive and rob many people. because people just don't get it into their heads that gambling is for fun and that with that they just play in old and reliable casinos, and forget about the high bonuses, high free spin and focus on playing where they won't be cheated and robbed. I hope they are not focused on the high bonuses and focus on the reputation of the casinos, old and reliable casinos tend not to offer high bonuses and high free spins. but they are reliable casinos and that's what matters most",
