      "body": "Any new altcoins bearing the idea of any religion should already be defined as a scam. The thirst for profit, which is exactly what overcomes the developers of these projects, already denies the principles of any religion.Many such coins have been created in history; can you check where they are now? Are there any successful examples? Gathering followers in one direction or another around you is a bad idea. And I don't think that believers can become investors in such crap. Although today's madness of the whole world with the denial of everything previously stable will find followers",

Once again, regardless of the purpose of the coin, I'm not sure that carrying a religious label will make them interested in investing. Because such a coin is only under the guise of gaining trust and as if applying a religious concept. But the fact is that it is really for the benefit of a handful of people, including those who manage the project. At this time, don't be easily provoked by labels in the name of race, religion, or certain groups because there have been many projects like this using masks for personal gain.",

It also has been proven.The possibility such tokens are created only to scam or extract money is very likely compared to a mere belief reason. Or simply only a cult-like follower would use such religious/political-backed tokens/coins. I'm certain such an altcoin will not provide any value or utility thus the only reason it could exist is a mere belief reason. So, there is no significant point an altcoin could thrive based on the things you mentioned.",

I am sure there's no motives behind the creation of this coin. Coin developers are slowly running out of subjects to name their coin so now they seems to be using religion to put an emotional angle to their marketing. But the market is even more intelligent and such coins will be doomed sooner than later.",

If someone inside is trying to incite such topics and using that to polarize users, they should not be given any more of your time. There are cunning users trying to use these angles to get investors into their pocket but that is just another scamming method which you all must understand.Previously I have seen coins like ADAB exchange which was also a shady project using religious sentiments and that project is nowhere to be found now.In either case, someone inciting an agenda is an immediate red flag. Trust bitcoin and stop spending your money on useless memecoins and shitcoins.",

A catholic person creating a nuclear weapon does not in any way at all make the weapon holy. I'd honestly just avoid any stuff like this, it's vaguer than altcoins being wishy washy about their project descriptions really since you can't exactly explain religious ideas in a systematic way. In addition, I don't think great investors relied on religion in the first place to grow where they are right now. They might have used it at some point, but definitely not in a symbolic way.",

Let's discuss!Do not give any attention to those coins, if a project is trying to use your personal identity, ethnicity, religious beliefs or political stance for you to support them then you know this project is a scam and there is no way around it, do not let yourself be manipulated by a topic you hold dear as they are hoping to confuse people and abuse their feelings so they feel obligated to use their coin, so this is a very obvious trap and you need to avoid falling into it.",
