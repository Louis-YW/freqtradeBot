  "content": "Like the Subject of the topic says. For you what time zone its the best for Sportsbetting?.For example i dont think european zone its the best, its one of the best but not the better of alls.For me to see the events, having a life and also betting in life without having to wake up in the early morning its......-3 or -4 time zone.For example you can have the whole european games trought the day, you can also see the NBA in the evening (you cant make this in Europe timezone,most of the games are like 3/4 am).One last thing, i know every country have your sports but im talking about the more bigger and common ones, not come and say... \"oh but you cant look the Eritrean league of football\" Or \"the armenian league of Teqball\".So in resume for me its:- Best -3 or -4- Really good 0/+1/+2.- Worst mayority of the pacific timezone +10.Obviusly this its really subjetive.",

      "body": "if you prefer to place live bets then you will have to worry about the time when the games take place but it is very difficult or impossible to bet live on all good games, because the premier league games, the bundesliga games, the games the serie A, the Portuguese league games, the Ligue 1 games take place on weekends and consciously at the same hours, so it is difficult for a person to watch 5 or 10 games at the same time, so it is useless to worry about the best time zone to bet since the games of the best leagues take place on weekends and at the same times, now for UFC games it has been quite problematic for me because there is a time when I am sleepingsoon it becomes very difficult for me to watch any UFC fights, also the boxing fights and another problem for me, they fight at the times when I am watching the games of the main leagues so I choose to watch soccer than watch boxi, another big problem that I have had and with the NBA games, which are all games that happen when I go to sleep, no matter how hard I try to watch the NBA games, it is very difficult for that to happen, that's why I prefer to place bets before the games start, preferably I bet two days before the games start, this prevents me from forgetting about the game because there are many games to place bets onfor me the time zone does not matter, I only need to place bets 2 days before the games, I think that the soccer games of the main leagues in Europe have the best schedule, in the case of boxing, UFC and NBA as they are events held in most times in the USA it has happened at the time when in my country it is already bedtime, something like 2 o'clock in the morning. I can't stay at 2 am to start watching an NBA game",

      "body": "You had the answer in the final sentence of your opening post. \"It's subjective.\" or it depends on where you are. I don't like the -3 or -4 timezone which means the games that would be betting on are in the Middle East. I don't know much about their sports there either than football. But I am not really a big fan of it unless it's the big leagues. But the issue here is the timezone and I don't mind waking up early, especially for USA leagues like NBA, NFL, and MLB. +12 hours, if they play late at night then I will just have to wake up early. If you really love the game you will bet for, you can definitely adjust to it and after some time you will be used to it and you won't even mind the sacrifice.IMO, there's no best timezone for it, it depends on the sport you like, and wherever the place they are playing you can still adjust to it.",

It's inconvenient for sure especially if you enjoy watching matches live.I don't particularly mind it tbh, I usually just watch replays if I can't watch the matches themselves, but if I were to pick a time then 7-9 pm at my local time zone. Calling it \"best\" for sports betting is kind of nothing though since it doesn't really affect both the match and my bet. It just affects us, who wants to watch it.",

Majority bet on soccer and most of those matches happen in Europe or South American countries. They both have different timezone. For someone betting on soccer matches, has to follow both the timezone. I don't follow soccer but I follow cricket and every game happens keeping in mind the timezone of South Asian countries, which is good for me as I reside in one of those countries.",

How can it be so difficult to understand?.For example if you live in Australia some games of European football are at 2/3/4AM of Australia, so you only can see and bet IN LIVE MARKETS if you are:1) a degenerate gambler with an addiction.2) No life and no job to wake up early in the morning.ITS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT.",
