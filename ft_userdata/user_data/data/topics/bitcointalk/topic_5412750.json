  "content": "During these days I am receiving several emails with a \"private keys\" for TRX and the message that inside there are some USDT. Code:There are already more than 5523 usdt on your Tronlink wallet/// your private key - [private key here]I guess this is a new scam that is trying to push someone to make a deposit in this address... Then the amount deposited will be just moved thank to a script / better fees in another address. I have seen something similar with bitcoin and ETH, this is the first time I seen with TRX and directly with email message. Any other suggestion or comment about this scam?General rule...Pay attention, no one will give 5523 USDT as \" a gift \"!editplease see thisQuote from: Charles-Tim on September 07, 2022, 03:50:11 PMRead more about the scam here: [Warning] Trust wallet tron multi signature scam.",

      "body": "Read more about the scam here: [Warning] Trust wallet tron multi signature scam.Bitcoin multisig wallet is different from how Tron multisig wallet works. The scammer is using Tron multisig wallet to elicit the scam because out of the two private key or seed phrase, there is only one (private key or seed phrase) that is able to access the wallet, that one remain known to the scammer. The other private key or seed phrase can only be used as watch-only, it can not be used to spend the coin, the scammer will give the second private key or seed phrase to the victim, which the victim can not spend from.The victim will think he can send Tron to the wallet to withdraw the USDT, but not knowing he has the private key or the seed phrase that is only used for the purpose of watch-only and can not be able to spend the coin.I do not like Tron for that, many people can fall being scammed because of how the Tron multisig wallet is.",

Whatever it is, it will not ask to expose others private key. It's basic.QuoteRead more about the scam here: [Warning] Trust wallet tron multi signature scam.This is s very creative idea and anyone even with having basic knowledge of Crypto will have chance to fall in the trap. I wonder how much money the scammer was able to collect so far.",

There's always a task to go with it. Even when exchanges run promotions, it's often something miserly. I've been in this industry for more than five years now and I haven't seen such gesture of supposed freebies end in songs. It's always sadness and sorrow. I ain't talking about OP. I know they already knew and are very preemptive. I'm talking to greedy fellows (especially newbies) who will think there's free money in cryptos. There's no free money or lunch online. There's always something that has to give. When an offer is given and you think it's free, search for what is hidden.",

I'm also glad I find this kind of trap, but so far I haven't received this kind of offer in my emails, if you're not the kind who always asks for something new like this one you'll fall into this kind of trap, people are used to getting free gifts or airdrops but this is not the kind of airdrop or gift worth claiming, people should moderate their greed and do extensive research we all want free but when then it's free there's always catch here in Cryptocurrency",
