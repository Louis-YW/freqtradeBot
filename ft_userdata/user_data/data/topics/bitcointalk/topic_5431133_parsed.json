  "content": "Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been released on bail after appearing in U.S. federal court in New York on Thursday. Bankman-Fried was told he can live with his parents on $250 million bail secured in part by their Palo Alto, California, house. His release also includes a long list of requirements for him to remain free while he faces charges. He's not allowed to make financial transactions of more than $1,000, can't open new lines of credit, can't leave the house except to exercise and must go through substance abuse and mental health treatment, according to the agreement.More @ https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/23/first-mover-americas-sec-scrutnizes-crypto-audits-sbf-gets-bail/",

But I don't think corporate/customer funds can be separated entirely. I don't think anyone would mind if corporate reserves are inter-mingled with customers' funds when some of the customers' funds get hacked and stolen.And for the proper financial audit to make sense, it'll have to cover ALL assets and liabilities, otherwise, an entity could be just moving funds around to appear solvent when it's not.",

If these are requirements for bail, might it mean Bankman-Fried's defence strategy is to prove that he, suffering from addiction and mental health issues, wasn't quite capable of recognizing his actions (regarding FTX) and thus isn't liable for criminal responsibility? IMO, that's the most interesting part in this news. I don't think such treatment is a standard bail requirement, so it might shed light on how the trial will play out.",

I don't think Sam will evade the trial, but I do feel that justice may somehow be favorable to him.  I think that this will be the time his effort of supporting influential people in the US will take effect.  But of course, they will do it slowly so that people won't take notice.It is really a biased world when the newspaper focus on the other issue and not to the fault SBF had done when reporting this kind of stuff just to divert people attention.  They can do it in a separate articles but intentionally combined the two to cover up wrong things SBF done.",

Hopefully the court is to still handle his case and have it be a swift ruling. The amount of damage these people have made not only to the people they scammed but more importantly the cryptocurrency market is something that we may carry for many years. I really hate the way media portrays him as well. Making him look as if he really isn't at fault with happened and as if he's being pinned the blame while the real perpetrators are getting away at the crime scot-free.

While SBF is the fraudster and should be punished, he merely picked up the money and put them in his pocket, but why was the money sent to him in the first place? An exchange is not a custodial solution, it's not a safe or a hardware wallet, it's what the name suggests: a place to make a transaction and leave, but people were ignoring all the red flags and calling this idiot \"the most generous billionaire\" when he never was a billionaire in the first place. He had billions in worthless shitcoins that, if dumped on the market, would generate something like 10 million each and crash the price. The king was naked from the beginning all the way to the end, but he had to be legit since Kevin O'Leary vouched for him, right?",
