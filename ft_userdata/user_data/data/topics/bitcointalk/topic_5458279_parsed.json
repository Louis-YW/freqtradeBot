We had this in the past.It was called Luna and the stablecoin was UST. And it’s worthless now. Why? Because it’s not a good idea for a volatile asset like Bitcoin to ever be pegged to an asset which is suppose to be stable. Hence why Luna crashed when the bear market started to get more and more intense.",

That being said, of course it is possible to create another stablecoin, that is pegged to something else too like gold or something like the total market cap of the whole crypto market. Everything is possible.I don't really know though what the benefit of a stablecoin that is pegged to bitcoin would really be. The value of this coin would never be stable because bitcoin is still doing pretty big price moves every day. So it would not be a smart move to have a lot of bitcoin-stables laying around for a longer time. Also i don't think it would be good for the bitcoin price too, if bitcoin itself would not be used anymore for purchases.",

Its quite hard to trust those stablecoin and we dont sure if they are really pegged to the currency itself. There are many cases like stablecoins have been depegged on theit value. If based on Bitcoin then its gonna be much harder I think.Any stable out there that close to what OP might suggesting?",

It will just create chaos like the fork coins that came out like mushrooms. But if only there's less competition in the market then it might work. But on today's date, you might want to think about it because there are tons of stablecoins in the market. BUSD, Tether, USDC, and more.
