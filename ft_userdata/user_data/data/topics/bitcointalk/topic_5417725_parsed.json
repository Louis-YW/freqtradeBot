I would like you and all impatient investors to have their wish come true, but expecting anything spectacular in 2022, which is already nearing its end, is somewhat childish and naive. You have to accept that we are in the middle of a bear market, and that the trigger for a big bull run has always been a halving that won't happen before 2024.This time is an excellent opportunity for all those who want to buy Bitcoin cheaply, and believe that they will profit from it in the future. For those who are impatient and indecisive, there is always a problem - when the price is low, they want it even lower, and when it is high, they complain that Bitcoin is too expensive.",

No thanks to procrastination on trying to prepare one's mind to buy. Speculation is still strong for more down but I think buying now won't do much of bad, next year is 2023 and halving will be around soon after.",

Accumulating these days is the best thing to do and if you trusted Bitcoin, hold it a long term and wait until the market becomes bullish. A lot of people now or even governments have the same interest in Bitcoin, they keep it and store value which affects the demand and supply quickly. But I'm afraid of these big companies that invested in Bitcoin will become a big whales in the future.

After all, everything is just a guess, so don't wait for a cheaper price. It's also a good time to buy bitcoin as it's 70% off ATH and the market could bounce back from here too, who knows?

I don't think we will go down to $3,236 per Bitcoin again this year or next year, let's hope so since the market is very unpredictable. The last all time high was around $68,000 per Bitcoin and we're really far behind right now, so I don't think it'll go deeper passed $10,000. It's just playing in $20,000 and $17,000. Many people are panicking but what's happening right now is completely normal.",

This could be assume that bitcoin will have a longer time of consolidation and not enough funds to break out on a time like now which is also in recession stage. Until the market recovers from inflations, we can always be on the turmoil state.Bitcoin also somehow follw trends and even stock right now is quite cheap. The only thing we can do for now is accumulate those cheap tokens and btc while it still low. Doing a dca could be more effective.",

However back in 2018 everybody was bullish in October 2018, right now 4 years later everybody is bearish.So I would not be surprised instead of breaking $17.5K and heading lower towards $10K, that we break out of this tight range and start to go to $30K or $40K. These days however its different due to the global markets being under fire. So its up to the economy. However there is a good chance that bitcoin might of bottomed already.",

I am definitely looking forward to watch out my portfolio during this season since once you miss it, you gonna wait for another 4 years to achieve the same level of down turn.
