      "body": "If you are interested in becoming a Bitcoin developer, the best place to start is by familiarizing yourself with the Bitcoin protocol and blockchain technology. You can begin by reading the original Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto[1], which outlines the technical details of the cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. The Bitcoin Developer website provides a comprehensive guide for developers looking to get started with Bitcoin development, including information on setting up a node and building Bitcoin-based applications.[2]Once you have a solid understanding of the technology and community, you can start contributing to Bitcoin development by working on the open-source Bitcoin project on GitHub. The Bitcoin.org website provides detailed instructions on how to contribute to the project, including guidelines for producing quality code and respecting established development processes. The Developer Guides section of the Bitcoin Developer website provides detailed information about the Bitcoin protocol and related specifications, including block chains, transactions, contracts, wallets, and payment processing.[1][3][4][5]References:1. https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper2. https://developer.bitcoin.org/3. https://blockgeeks.com/guides/bitcoin-developer/4. https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/5. https://bitcoin.org/en/development",

I have a basic knowledge of Python .Not sure about Youtube channels but you have \"Mastering Bitcoin\" book from Antonopoulos which seems to me a good start! Antonopoulos also has his youtube channel where he speaks out about Bitcoin, explains things, answers to subscribers questions and much more content!You also have @achow101 member of this forum that usually twitches when he's coding/reviewing code! Can also be a driver for you!",

Besides familiarizing yourself with Bitcoin Core (as the most maintained client), studying from development mailing lists and StackExchange posts, and start programming yourself a cryptocurrency from scratch as exercise, you will have to become professional at C++, examine pull requests, issues, code-- pretty much the entire repository. Maybe appear in some conferences as well, and talk with the rest of the developers to be taught directly.",

It is a long path and that is true, I cannot imagine how long it will take before you will become a successful developer.In addition to the said above that I quoted is that you must also stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the bitcoin ecosystem, which can be done by regularly checking development mailing lists, StackExchange posts, and examining pull requests as aid above. The basic information that you need to acquire first is to read gently the bitcoin white paper and understand it very well.",

I have a basic knowledge of Python .There are some useful videos on Youtube that you should watch to learn some concepts of the blockchain technology. I will share some links below, you can watch those videos and playlists to learn some concepts of that technology.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_fDiwCTJwchttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYuWiICCM0&list=PLsyeobzWxl7oY6tZmnZ5S7yTDxyu4zDW-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B_RzcYdUsE&list=PLCQ3cvOTrX6DlfYPigIw4QiNnE3wnoAxRI hope these videos will clear some basic concepts of Blockchain technology. You should follow others advice as well and devote your time to learn some programming before delving into Blockchain. This technology can not be learnt in few days, you should give 2-4 hours a day to start the learning process. With consistency and determination you will master the blockchain within a year.",
