  "content": "My wife was contacted from out of the blue. She is a Realtor. The person claims to be shopping for a 4 million dollar house. He later raises the amount to 6 million. My wife learns he earns his living trading bitcoin. He calls himself Mr Li. Over a few months the relationship continues but Mr Li lives in LA. We are in Scottsdale, AZ. He has spken by phone once and shares an email. He only wants to communicate by using snap chat. A month or so ago my wife got into a trade of say $500 and made profit. She did this a few times with Mr Li helping. He tells her the exact time to deposit or whatever they do to transact a deal. Weeks later he tells he she should increase the size of her investment. My wife has a bitcoin account. She tells me the process is to deposit US currency that converts to coin. Then trade. Then convert from coin to US currency. I guess Mr Li co-invests with her. The most recent time the initial investment was valued at $44K. Three trades were made on a specific date and time. Mr Li would send screen shots with markups from him as directions of what to do.It really does not matter how much of these details I remember (I can get them cleaned up later), it's the process I want to validate. Apparently this trade event was so successful that when the money was deposited into the account, it was help by the conversion company under suspicion of fraud because there was nearly $77K profit made above a smaller beginning amount. NEXT- The party holding the funds until verified says that Mr Li and my wife need to deposit another $22,200 into the account to equal 20% of the balance for 3 days, then all money will be restored to the original account for withdrawal. With this, I am telling her no way. Scam alert. So Mr li deposits all but the last $3500 with over $42K of his personal money investment at rsik for loss by today. Original deadline was 6 days ago. Do any of these proceedures make sense? Wife claims all is done by her alone as far as creating proper crypto accounts, Tether accounts. The emails from the holding company are not grammatically correct and without a signature or contact line. Advice to my innocent but well meaning wife would be?.....",

This is not the first time a case like this have been presented to the community(sorry for being to lazy to search for old thread). Your post is a bit confusing to understand but  let me guess,  all the profit your wife has made with Mr Li has been in the site he introduced to her right? You’ve never withdrawn from it before, and now that you want to make withdrawal you’re being asked to deposit more before it can be processed right?The whole idea of this scam is to make you believe that you’re really making profits from your small investment and after they’ve successfully convinced you that they are not a scam, then they’ll ask you to make withdrawal but that’s where the real scam starts from. Before you’ll be allowed to withdraw you’ll need to deposit more… and since your initial investment was just a few bucks compared to your current balance which should be up to some thousands of dollars when asked to make deposit you won’t be hesitant because of what you’re expecting from them but as soon as you make more deposits that’s the end of your more they’ll cut off all form of communication with you and eventually block your account or they might even leave it for you to see.",

They are all working together and your wife is their victim, if she pays any money, it is also gone. And I must tell you that those money that you wife put into the trade and made profit, if she hasn't withdraw all the money and it is still in their custody, the money is gone. This was why Mr Li was telling her to increase the money that she wants to trade with so that gradually, she will get committed to them before they strike. This money that they asked for is the striking time, she will not seen any of those funds anymore as it is gone. It is better that she forget about the whole thing and never to trust strangers online. Most people giving trading signals and advice are scammers.",

I ask you to consider the following and a quick word if it changes anything: - The trading platform is crypto.com.- The money has been transferred from my crypto.com account that I originated personally to my crypto.com DIFI account(security account).She went thru a screening process in order get an approved crypto account to begin with.- She purchased Tether type of coin.- He guided her thru several trades within 2 hours and each trade made money. This was a teaching opportunity with small investment example. The investment was $44K. The final number was $111KWith such a large profit in a short time, the DIFI people held the funds. They tell her they need a risk factor of 20% ($22K) because of the large sum that was made on her trades in one day. They will release all in 48 hours. She created all of her own accounts. Nobody directed her to any of them. I think crypto.com, Tether, and DIFI are known in the industry, right?She believes that due to the above, the situation is legit. Does any of this change thoughts? I hope experienced people that know the mechanics of trading have more to say either way. Thank you for the support.",

Did you mean DeFi or it's actually spelled like that--DIFI? because crypto.com has an app called DeFi wallet, it could be a phishing/fake app made and controlled by the scammers.I don't think the additional information you provided changes anything, op mainly because what happened to your wife follows the formula of a well known scam.

They will do anything to appear trusted and convincing, with various evidence and also deposits that they may make. However, there is no guarantee that they will actually do it, or that they will definitely do tricks with the money. Currently, there are many types of scams. Don't easily trust anyone who suddenly contacts you and offers cooperation with extraordinary profits suddenly. There are no such good people in this world, especially those who have just met and offered themselves. Watch out for this scam scheme!",

I can’t even imagine how they are going to pull this scam off. Let me ask again how sure are you that your wife never used any link (it could look exactly like the legit site, with just one thing that differentiates them) that was sent to her by Mr li? The fact that a site has the same name and design with the original site does not make it legit, if you don’t mind, can you copy one of the URLs your wife used to access her account let’s see if there’s any difference. Quote from: kw012 on December 16, 2023, 02:35:14 AMTo Potato ChipsYes, the funds are sitting in a crypto.com defi wallet. She showed it to me.It’s just like I predicted. There is something fishy about this exchange that you’re using, I doubt it’s the original one… please just do what I said above and paste of the URLs here let’s see… go to your wife’s browser history and copy the URL from there.",
