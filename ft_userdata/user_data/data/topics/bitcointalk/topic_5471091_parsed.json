He has no merit in the last 120 days and he has no campaign. Thank you for this. Some of them can put on signature and avatar of a campaign to deceive, but I expected loaners will first look at the spreadsheet of the campaign before borrowing anyone loan.The only reason a loaner can borrow him the money is if he has collateral like altcoins. People can easily convert altcoins now and not likely what would happen.",

It is good that the loan application was rejected because it will certainly cause a lot of problems when repaying, of course, if the loan is repaid in the first place.The loan service is full of problems. Although the members who provide these services have great experience, unfortunately they are exposed to a lot of problems because some people lack honesty, so they have to be very careful when approving any loan application.",

I wouldn't blame this guy if he ever got the loan, I would rather blame the loaner.Although the forum is an informal place where people don't have to know each other personally or with IDs before transacting, still, there are limits to what should be wisely accepted. And as you iterated above, the account is such that is not in a campaign or has any merit in the last 120 days, I wonder who would take such a joker seriously.",

After all we don't know what his main motive was - I mean I'm not sure he wanted to ruin his reputation by make a loan request that actually had very little chance of being approved.shasan - is it possible to assume that the user mentioned above wants to get your positive feedback by applying loan from you?I think some users do it for that reason - but I hope that's not true, although I suspect some users do.",
