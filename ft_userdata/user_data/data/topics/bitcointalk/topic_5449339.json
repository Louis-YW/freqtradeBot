      "body": "The funds that were recovered from him by the Fed, what will they do with them since they must have known the sources of those funds where he moved them from, and will it not be wise enough for them to return it back to the victims? All they will do is withhold it all, all in the name of evidence and whatever else they might tag it as, which on later days they will sell it off at auction since that's what they do?And linking Coinbase to the incident, will the government again open an investigation against Coinbase, allowing a stolen fund to be deposited and traded on their exchange? Just my questions out of curiosity",

      "body": "This is a very interesting case, because James Zhong stole bitcoins from Silkroad and now he is being charged with criminal offenses, because he stole from a site that was involved in crime.   A lot of these guys make the same mistakes by drawing too much attention to themselves, when they start flashing the proceeds of their crime. He also kept the stolen stash close to home, so they just raided his property and found all the coins that he stole.... so all the evidence are centered in one place.",

He also kept the stolen stash close to home, so they just raided his property and found all the coins that he stole.... so all the evidence are centered in one place.  There was no way he could lounder a huge amount like $3 billions, especially when he's autistic with no social calibration. Per article, he cashed out $700k just to have a pile of cash \"like in movies\". He was doomed to fail.Funnily enough, he was involved in Bitcoin since early days, so if he just bought some (with the money he was spending on coke and booze) and hold, he could be rich and his wealth would be legit.Anyhow, since this story is pretty interesting and Press board is not really meant for discussions, here's the topic on the main board: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5449502.0",
