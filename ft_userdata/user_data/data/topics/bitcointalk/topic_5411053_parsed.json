  "content": "We all know the crypto market is very competitive and volatile. But the industry is fast-growing, and many crypto projects succeeded in 2021, and some failed to maintain their position in 2022 with recent the crypto winter. CRO was one of the well-performed coins which grabbed traders' attention and investors are bullish on the token.Â  The CRO price prediction ranges from $0.22 to $0.67. Moreover, the Cronos price showed a bullish trend. However, If CRO continues the bullish trend, the price may reach $0.7 in 2022. On the other hand, if the Cronos price turns out to be bearish, the price might plummet to almost $0.09 in 2022. If the bullish trend continues, CRO has the potential to reach $0.9 in the first half of 2023. ConclusionCRO is renowned as one of the top currencies that have the potential to boom. Cronos might reach $0.7 in 2022 and $20 by 2030 if investors have decided that Cronos is a good investment.",

That's possible for this year and so on and saying $20 by 2030, the total market cap should be around $500B which is just $3B for now. I'm not saying that it's impossible but there's a tremendous multiply that shall before it reaches that price. Well, it's an exchange token and it could give more attraction so investors will buy more cro.",

      "body": "I am getting some Cronos on the BC.games wheel! The current price is $0.13. To be honest I am not so familiar with this coin, except I am getting them on the wheel as some free coins and gamble with CRO from time to time I never tried to learn more about Cronos! I like the optimism and maybe Cronos can make some progress, after reading this I will try to make more CRO and I will not exchange it for other coins! If I manage to make more and the price really hits $0.9 next year it will be like hitting a double jackpot!",
