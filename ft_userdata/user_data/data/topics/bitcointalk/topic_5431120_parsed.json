      "body": "There is a context missing in regard to why Mazars have a public concern about their proof of reserve reports to those companies. It is explained as follows:Quote from: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/19/why-auditors-arent-working-with-most-crypto-exchanges/Binance and many other crypto firms are privately held, meaning they don’t regularly – if ever – release financial data. So the short-lived proof-of-reserves information was welcomed by the industry.The now-withdrawn reports published by Binance and Crypto.com were often misunderstood as actual audits, that is unbiased examinations and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization. But they’re really just a matching exercise that involves mapping customer assets as recorded in an exchange’s internal database to entries in a public blockchain, according to Francine McKenna, a lecturer in financial accounting at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.“proof of reserves mean very little without proof of liabilities,”As noted above, the reported Proof of Reserve is not a big picture, in fact, it can't be counted as a variable if someone wants to prove solvency. Quote from: ChillyMatthew on December 23, 2022, 02:10:01 PMWho is to say that funds cannot be shifted at any time, like SBF did from FTX to Alameda?Any reports cannot guarantee that. It is the wrong thing to rely on. Unfortunately, in a cryptocurrency world, handing over one possession to centralized entities is a sure way to make the funds can be shifted without their concern. Not your keys, not your coins. The problem in regard to the current FOMO of exchanges published their proof of reserve is that kind of framework is not enough to attest solvency of exchanges, as already noted above.",

Who is to say that funds cannot be shifted at any time, like SBF did from FTX to Alameda?Central exchanges (CEXs) can demonstrate their solvency by showing that they have enough assets to cover their liabilities. There are many ways to accomplish this, including:. 1. Regular financial audits: CEXs can hire independent accounting companies to perform periodic financial audits and provide a report on the exchange's financial health. The assets, liabilities, and any potential risks of the exchange should all be disclosed in this report. 2. Keeping enough reserves: CEXs can keep enough reserves in the form of cash or highly liquid assets, like government bonds, to make sure they have the money to pay their debts. 3. Adequate risk management procedures can be put in place by CEXs, such as the use of stop-loss orders or margin limits, to reduce the risk of financial losses. 4. Keeping transparency: CEXs can keep the public and regulatory bodies informed about their assets and liabilities, as well as the state of their finances and business operations. For CEXs to establish trust with their users and prove their solvency, it is critical that they be accountable and transparent.",

There’s no assurance though that they will not use our money to other things, there’s no other way to stop them from doing this aside from the government intervention.",

Who is to say that funds cannot be shifted at any time, like SBF did from FTX to Alameda?Take, for example, the Kraken platform, as it provides complete evidence of solvency, and in my opinion, there is no excuse or reason for any CEX not to provide this proof of solvency, If the CEX platforms want to restore the confidence of investors and major companies. after the recent collapse of the FTX platform, which affected the confidence of investors in this industry, so the proof of solvency will undoubtedly be the new standard that must be taken by the CEX platforms, as it is proof that CEX is trustworthy and able to save the money of its deposited users, as they can withdraw it at any time without happening like what happened to FTX, We can know the tests that will show the solvency of the central exchange platforms through a complete guide that is presented through them or through reliable companies that are the third party that conducts these audits.",
