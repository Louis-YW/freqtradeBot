  "content": "Hi,I am trying LND and following Raspibolt's instructions (https://raspibolt.org/guide/lightning/lightning-client.html). I tried created the LND wallet with lncli, by entering an existing 24-word mnemonic (option 'y').After I entered the seed words, chose to use no passphrase, and the default look-ahead option, I got the error: \"[/lnrpc.WalletUnlocker/InitWallet]: wrong seed version\"What is this about exactly?Thanks!",

I did not know about aezeed. So it uses only 16 bytes max of entropy vs 32 bytes for BIP39?",

Yes I understand that aezeed has advantages. It would be great if it supported 32 bytes of entropy with extra bytes/words to add the extra features.",
