Share numbers as well like the APY, the fees, etc. Please share your experience regardless of where you're staking, whether it is on a centralized platform or on a liquid or non-liquid staking pool.

AFAIK you can see, the APY and some estimates about it about what you are going to stake. Primary considerations are probably.LiquiditySlashingAside from that, that's going to be one of the things that you can consider before deciding.",

That's why instead of sending it to those, I'll just go holding it even having no interest.Yeah, one of it is Lido as suggested by the website I'm about to suggest which is this: https://www.stakingrewards.com/ or with other details on https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/ethereum-2-0/And if you're going to put it on nexo, I'm sure you're aware that it's a centralized platform where you don't hold its keys.",

But what have you mentioned like Lido is good platform for staking eth, while nexo Im not sure as they have issues before and Im not gonna let them handle my precious eth. I think using the eth on other protocol might be more valuable. Like use it foe defi activities that could gain you eligibility on airdrops or good offer on lending. Anyway different choices to make out there.",

In my opinion the amount you can earn from staking isn’t enough to risk handing your coins over to the control of another entity. Too many horror stories over the years but I hope things work out well for you.",

Staking is worth it but we all know what happened to blockfi and Celsius before. Back then, people were also trusting these two so much that even companies handling retirement funds send money to them.When you stake, it also means you are willing to hold the token for as long as you mean it.  You wanna trust more to tokens that you can stake on your own in a wallet you have the private key than sending it to a company. After the ETH2 upgrade afaik, we can already stake on Binance. Still risky but to me, Binance is more trustworthy than the 2 above.",

I staked those two tokens for a relative long time on their sites and was compounding them at each expiration until what everyone who stakes dread happened. The site shut down. Till date all my tokens on that site disappeared. As someone who encouraged others to go into staking (it was actually exciting when I started and could withdraw and restake), I'm now very skeptical and scared of staking. OP, my simple advice to you is to do your research very well before sending your coins to be staked on any site.",

Anyway different choices to make out there. Lido is indeed on the top of the list. But even with it offering probably one of the highest APR, it is indeed still small. Yes, not appealing. And that is even if you get into compounding, lending, etc. I guess the APR will remain to be less than 10% or perhaps 10% at most? Not to mention that there will still be deductions. Protocol fee is already at 10%.",

I wouldn't recommend staking with a third-party, especially when there have been issues with exchanges in the past. FTX collapsed last year, leaving many empty-handed in an instant. Imagine if this happened to an exchange providing staking services (such as Coinbase and Binance). It would be complete disaster! Thus, it's best to hold custody of your ETH by staking in the most decentralized way possible. Many people can't afford 32 ETH to stake on their own, so your best bet would be to stake on a decentralized staking platform such as Lido.Fi or Rocket Pool. I cannot say which is the best, since each has its own advantages/disadvantages. As long as you don't put all of your life savings into ETH, you should have nothing to worry about. Just my thoughts",
