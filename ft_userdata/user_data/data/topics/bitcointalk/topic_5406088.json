  "content": "First we have to know wgat is priority in the world.The bankers markets and derivates.If russia want to win over usa then russia must deploy markets system instead of usa.Right now the usa control the markets money flow is under the fed and wall st control.Also the repo markets china not russia not even uk have no control over this system.If russia or china want to be taken seriously then first they should deploy REPO funds system like its in usa now from fed second CMEGROUP headquaters needs to move to china or russia.So people dont know things belive all nonsense country who does not control markets like fed and cmegroup does it its joke and have no power.Sure russia can nuke usa together with china but then what  They cant just set up repo system and new CMEGROUP kind of system overnight they have to set up first but as we see they have not made any moves.We live in the world where derivates options futures conyrol the world and finnciences not the kings or queens but the markets and the markets system with money country who does not have influence over this system cant be taken seriously.Thats how we know things until we dont see repo funds market control like fed does been set up in large in other country then usa we cant even take seriously any other country then its usa now.So putin if you want be taken seriously show us you can set up REPO market and connect whole markets and derivates....same goes to china xi ping...or how ever they call him...its easy to make plastic toys and ship them its dont take be genius but show us you can connect ur currency REPO with markets then people take you seriously.Also BLACKROCK larry fink is the world ruler i want to see who has guts to push this guy away ?? Not even putin and this guy controls all the world china is joke for himToo much nonsense going on in the world like joke people need to understood how the real life is.",

Putin said that they only need 3 days to finish this war, but it has been more than 100 days of war and there is no significant progress from the war. I think that Russia just wants to show their strength and tell the west or NATO that they are not a country to be underestimated.",

Ukarine is at war while people inside Russia are not having any kind of war. Ukarine people may look for immigration to usa or other country not Russian.",

There will be no clear-cut winners or losers, just a torn wasteland from years of ongoing conflict with no clear goal reached (and maybe none intended to be reached).Secondly, we also need to consider that Russia is not in this to take over the US market position. It's first and foremost a show of strength, a miscalculation on their part, but also a grab of territory rich with resources and the securing of the infrastructure that once moved gas from Russia to Europe. Now, at this point, some of those goals seem like they have been miscalculated and will not work in the future, but that's still up for future historians.",

I don't see any sign of the war ending soon because the both parties are not ready for any negotiation of any other. This war has been in the minds of the US and NATO, as well. For years the US has been goading Russia towards this war. But they have been doing it carefully, so that people don't easily know that the US is behind the war, even though Russia may have used the weapons first in some instances.But the Ukraine has had several puppet governments over the last decade. And these governments were operated by the US, and pushed guerilla warfare into Russia, and onto Ukrainians who were in favor of Russia.So, it is the US that is the problem.Besides, Russia has already won. They have the new giant submarine, the Belgorod, which can destroy the US and most of Western Europe with its 100 megaton nuclear torpedoes.

Man, this is not a gambling section, you should put more efforts and sense in your posts. Or go shitpost somewhere else. Maybe I'm a little bit offensive, but really, your text to common.  About OP - you're also wrong. Russia unable to win not because of bonds, rather because it has shitty army and low morale of it's own troops. Also, it highly dependent on westerns part for it's own military production.",
