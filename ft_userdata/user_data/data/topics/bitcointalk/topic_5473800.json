      "body": "First thing I deduce from your post is that you are looking for privacy or total anonymity, VPN or TOR could provide a temporary solution but the best thing is to actually run your own node so you don’t get to connect to just any public serve which are some what untrusted. Electrum is an SPV wallet and you are connected to public server although you can choose to have your own electrum server. The issue of hack is another matter that’s different from privacy, no wallet is tamper proof against hack it is just how you decide to run that wallet. That is why the best thing is always to have a self custodian wallet which is also open source and always offline. Hardware wallets fits into the category of an offline wallet but not all are open source. So you can make your own offline wallet by using electrum on airgapped devices and storing the keys of seed phrase offline. The 2FA wallet still adds another layer of security but in term of security breach it seems almost the same if the wallet used is an online wallet or the 2FA authenticator is stored one the same device as the wallet software. Electrum. If the hacker gets hold of the seed phrase they can still get access to the funds on the wallet without the 2FA code. Another layer of security you can to your seed phrase is a passphrase which without it you can’t recover that wallet",

Electrum is open-source, the code has been reviewed by many people and no vulnerability has been discovered, but note that any online device is always prone to hacking. Electrum 2FA wallet is actually a 2 of 3 multi-signature wallet. One of the master private keys is owned by trustedcoin and you have to pay extra fee, so that they sign your transaction.In electrum 2FA wallet, you have a seed phrase which can generate 2 of master private keys and all three master public keys. Note that any one who has access to the seed phrase has all required keys for making a transaction. So, it's required that the seed phrase is kept offline and you use a secure device for generating your wallet. If your device has been compromised and you use that for generating your 2FA wallet, you don't increase your security.",

If you are concerned about your privacy and do not want to be known electrum is best for you because electrum wallet does not ask you for yours personal information. If you use Electrum your information and your privacy will not be changed and people will not know about yours and on the other hand, hacking is somewhat different from privacy. In privacy, you keep your info and no one will find out but in hacking everything will be in front of a hacker and they can easily find it. your seed through your wallet or PC.
