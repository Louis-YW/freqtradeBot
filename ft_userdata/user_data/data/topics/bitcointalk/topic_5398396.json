They are only care with their pocket but not with your money. It's better to avoid to follow these garbage youtubers and try to follow your own decision by doing some analyzation towards the market.",

This is relevant for me. It has been very much advised in the past not to rely on other people's words when it comes to any investment and trading as they will only say what they know, whereas we only do what we are capable of and know well, so it is always better to rely on ourselves rather than the words of others, because every step we make ourselves there is always a consideration for the risk and safety.",

This is relevant for me. It was a very good decision to convert all your altcoins to BTC and ETH as well as SOL and I think it will be profitable in the future.Yes, the Youtubers out there who advise you to buy one or more altcoins know nothing about them.They don't even know if the altcoin will increase in height or will disappear.They do that because they want to attract investors to the altcoin project and they will get paid from the project for helping promote the project.So be careful if you get advice from other people you don't know.",

Problem with YouTubers is, they have different level of energy within them. They will always show you something that will make you worried about the market so what you do next? You keep watching their videos, subscribe them and try to analyse what that guy has to say more. That’s called as negative marketing impression. Make you feel worried and tangle in it. Happened with me many times. Better to skip them and only use YouTube to entertain yourself with vlogs and shit",

This is relevant for me. Decide wisely for yourself. The KOLs I know all accept money to promote projects ranging from shitcoin to the top and to lead our minds with bogus trends. And when everything is exposed, those knowledgeable enough will get out of the way and those who are still stuck with the loss will receive comforting words like blame yourself for not knowing enough and just listen to them",

This is relevant for me. That's the best decision that you've done. There's a craze now with the pump and dump altcoins but you will never know until that craze will stay. But if you've put your money into bitcoin and ethereum, that's the best idea to make. It's actually relevant and in the long run, you're one of the winners in the market because that's how it works. And the patience that you'll have for up to a few years before and after the halving, you'll see the worth of it and others will admire what you did.",
