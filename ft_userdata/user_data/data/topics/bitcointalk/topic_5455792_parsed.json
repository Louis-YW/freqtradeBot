  "content": "I'm at the end of my wits here, so help a guy out if you got the time.. Here goes.I want to build a simple calculator to know what's the ACTUAL realistic achievable price for any of our coins based on their previous ATH compared to today, but getting all the information I need is nearly impossible.. For a given date, I need: >market cap>closing price>circulating supply I need this data so I can compare it to today's data. My reason being, compared to '21, a bunch of these tokens would need triple the cash they had in them back then to reach their ATH. Just as an example, there's no real math here, but take Fantom(FTM). By the time it reaches $1 it's gonna gave the marketcap it had when it was at it's ATH at $3+.I'm not looking to build something that gives perfect information, I just wanted to build a calculator that gives us at least a real notion as to what to expect from these assets, but every single API is gated behind a paywall, and historical circulating supply is missing from the big sites. I'm just a junior dev, I'm not really experienced with any of this, but it seemed like a worthy project to pursue. If anyone would like to work with me on this I'd love it, and I'm sure this would be a be a great tool to share with the community. I can't be the only one who is seeing the pitfall of waiting for ATH prices again for everything.",
