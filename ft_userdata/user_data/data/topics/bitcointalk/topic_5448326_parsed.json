You can choose non KYC platforms and if you want to protect your privacy, always use Tor connection on the Internet. Some locations don't allow you to use Tor and you have to use bridge.Check https://kycnot.me/ with two tabs: Exchanges and Services.With Services tab, you will have some like VPN services; Domain, Hosting a& VPS; Phone numbers & SMS; Giftcards & Goods; Various tools; Anonimization; Cloud storage; Other services.Check https://www.privacytools.io/ too.",

I watched several tips, but they always said that once you have used your data in one exchange, it's recorded there on the database.But it's possible to make a wallet anonymous by depositing coins that go through many layers. This I think is more important. I'm not an expert though.",

A bit stupid to think that the government would just let you do your thing just because you're following their guidelines, that's a naive thinking because I know that almost every governing body out there wants to control their population to the point where they can move them to do what they think is best for the state. Regarding anonymity, I don't think that OP understands how the Internet works, there's no such thing as complete anonymity, more like pseudonymity. Maybe you can avoid tracking for awhile but if you plan to stay on this forum, it's going to be a difficult thing to do.",

In life, you try to control what you can and do all you can to minimize the effect of what you cannot control. In my country, you cannot be anonymous unless you don't buy anything or do any financial transactions. Or you decide not to own a phone which is not possible for now. But there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of remaining unknown. One of the ways is to stay away from social media. Some persons are so addicted to these platforms that they can write their autobiographies through detail on their social media platforms. They are in the market, bank, or home on the street, it will be uploaded to their social media account. Another way is that instead of keeping your money in banks or exchanges, become your bank through a centralized wallet. Exchanges and bankers will always want to know more things about you. They will keep asking for more information until they know virtually everything about you.",

Total anonymity would have been possible in those days when there was no society or publicly provided amenities that required an identity. These days staying completely anonymous is not possible unless you decide to move to a secluded place and choose to stay without the internet, only eating what you grow or kill. Rather than wanting to stay completely anonymous which is possible, some people who want to stay away from the eyes of the government have taking up other identity (the identity of other people) and have all documents in the names of these other identities too. It may work for sometime, if you are careful enough not to raise any suspicion.For bitcoin to increase your anonymity, use a mixer or mixing service.",

As soon as you buy from a KYC exchange or get your identity linked in any other way with your BTC, you are more transparent than ever before.With the right measures, like the ones you mentioned above, this can be turned,.

      "body": "And yet another user who could vastly benefit from the vast amount of knowledge that would be compiled and discuss if the forum were to house a Cybersecurity & Privacy board. Achieving anonymity and privacy with peace of mind that you're doing it right requires a lot of research. It's a personal experience and it varies from person to person based on their threat model (who are you protecting yourself from?) and their knowledge-base (what practices you know of, what you can comprehend and what you are capable of employing). Discussion helps to learn more about both of these topics, which is why I am hoping the aforementioned board is added.To answer your post, two basic rules:1. Never share your personal information online unless you absolutely need to. If you do absolutely need to, do so in a secure environment that is away from where you'd like to remain anonymous.2. Never upload sensitive files to third party services unless you are okay with the potential for eyes other than your own viewing these files. Some privacy-enhancing technologies include:- Linux: While there are a vast amount of linux distributions out there, varying in their security/privacy hardening out-of-the-box, almost all popular Linux distributions beat Windows and Mac OS when it comes to privacy.- VPN: Even a VPN is not enough in some circumstances these days, however a VPN can help to hide your day to day internet usage from your ISP and protect your IP from services online by passing traffic through their servers. Look for a non-logging VPN with a reputation for privacy-first. A bad VPN would make using one redundant.- Tor: If you need another layer of security, using Tor over VPN is a good way to enhance your anonymity.- Firefox: Firefox is great because you can learn to harden it further than just in the settings page. There are also some browsers which have forked Firefox and have hardened them so that they're more privacy friendly out of the box. Privacy from tracking is dependent on your browser!Avoid google and services using big tech to preserve your data and privacy further. It's a hit to convenience though there are almost always just-as-good solutions to google services that are much better for your privacy.",
