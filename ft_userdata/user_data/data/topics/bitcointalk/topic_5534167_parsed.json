Bitcoin need money to start even if the government want to go into mining, they still need capital to building the mining farm and other infrastructures. Buying and holding equally need money which poor nations cannot afford especially when they are unable to meet their basic needs. Some may think that a nation can borrow to make investment in Bitcoin but that is not advisable because you don't know if the investment will be able to generate enough profits to settle the loan before the tenure. Therefore, poor nations have more things to worry about than investing in Bitcoin.",

Productivity drives growth through satisfaction of people's want, both local and international, because after meeting local demands, you can export and bring in foreign exchange.",

They are just not ready to take risks and thus remain poor entire life. But that does not mean that role of government can be ignored. Just one powerful and honest person on an important role or position can do wonders. You can see it yourself. Every country has some politicians who have worked hard for the people of the country entire life. If majority in government is like this, no one ccan stop a country from progressing.",

Chasing after instant profit doesn't always end well; the moment you see altcoin as a means to escape poverty, your chance of also ending up poor is very high.You can also invest in Bitcoin for those who already have a fortune and make a profit from it after holding it for a long period of time, but you still won't be able to take yourself from the poverty status up to the rich people's standard. You invest in hundreds; your profit will come out in hundreds if you hold for circles, same with other figures.",

Opposite thing happens when there is a dump.As of now, El Salvador is the only country to add bitcoin to its national reserves. The remaining countries such as the United States, Brazil...are only considering this idea, but no country has made a final decision yet. Honestly, adding bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to the national reserves would be a huge benefit to the crypto industry as it would boost its price and popularity. But I don't think that will facilitate and boost their economy and that may be why they are not in a hurry to add bitcoin to their national reserves. Many investors support this idea because it benefits them but to be fair, crypto assets including bitcoin are too volatile and this is not considered an advantage or will have a positive impact on the national economy.",
