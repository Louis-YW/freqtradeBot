      "body": "Yes, we will have to be careful with this. The scams in most cases are based on taking advantage of a mistake and/or large numbers: they are tried with many people and statistically in the end some of them fall. If we add to this this technological advance I think it can give a boost to scammers by the appearance of reality until a time comes when the general population is aware of this and is alert. And the bad thing is that this is only one of the aspects in which AI can help scammers, I guess there will be more. But I also wonder if AI could not help us to defend ourselves from this kind of scams, detecting them or in some other way.",

The easy solution is to reverse reach out anytime anyone asks for money / tells you to send money somewhere to check for impersonations. If the scammers use AI to impersonate the other person this can be also to a degree dealt with by asking a question from the past only the real counterpart would answer.",

Those who have knowledge about AI voice can easily understand these voices that someone is trying to scam using this voice.

And before we can only see this in the movies, like Mission Impossible wherein Tom Cruise can not just mimic the face, but the voice itself. So it's really very dangerous world that we live it because we don't know if we are going to be the next victim of this type of scams.

I have this feeling we are going on a Matrix or The Terminator scenario where we all depends on machine and AI this is because engineers are so genius they want businesses and industries to make and create things in the easiest possible way.Going back to these AI voice-replicating scams they could scam a lot of people because the ears are one of the parts of our senses that is easily deceived.People should be aware of this they can do this by advising their loved ones how to verify the call or what happened, we have a modern phone now they can request to do a video call to verify.",
