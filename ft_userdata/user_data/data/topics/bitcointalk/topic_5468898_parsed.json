      "body": "Minor point but it's not Bitcoin being hacked it's BUSINESSES that deal with Bitcoin being hacked.When T-Mobile got hacked there was no talk of the cellular network being hacked.When Capital One was hacked there was no talk of the US Dollar getting hacked.And so on.It's Bitcoin related businesses getting hacked. And it's going to keep happening until they cannot get investors to back them and regulators to accept their operation unless they can prove certain security safeguards are in place.It's really not that much of a double edged sword since we have seen time and time again that people keep putting funds into places that are obviously scams / frauds so having places get hacked is just another thing that people (users) are going to keep ignoring when it happens. Sad that nobody cares, but outside of the people here on the forums and a few other technical discussions nobody seems to care that it keeps happening.-Dave",

If one has a pretty good mind he can easily understand what are the weaknesses that success the scam.Â  Many people are in companies or exchange when they are scammed they goes into depression some want to take their own life and some are mads because they lost a big amount but no one can think about why they were hacked and what the thing that facilitated the hackers or scammers. If they donâ€™t fix this weakness then maybe in the future there is a chance of hacking it again. So for better security, it is necessary to look at the things that you mentioned in your post so that in the future they will be saved and millions of bitcoins will be protected from stolen or from wastage.",

Since when banks lost their credibility at holding our funds safe? If anyone wants to give his bitcoins to strangers on the world wide web, better quit bitcoin and go back to the old ways, at least they won't lose their money individually, instead central banks make more money with their funds and then would fund military budgets to make more weapons and kill us in bulk, that way we all go down together, not individually.",

There has been no hack on the Bitcoin network since the first year it was launched, what happens is people store there bitcoins in different platforms, closed source wallets, exchanges, etc and this gets hacked causing loss of the bitcoins. This is not a problem in the Bitcoin network.You as the user just has to keep your Bitcoin in your custody and make your security your own priority.",

But SBF did file a Motion to Dismiss the Prosecution's Charges.The three charges excluded from this motion were 1. commodity fraud, 2. conspiracy to commit securities fraud, 3. and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Already guilty but still denies committing fraud. Another example is also like the local Turkish Exchange, Thodex, which cannot be accessed because its CEO, Faruk Fatih Ozer, took away around $2 Billion of user money.In addition to cases of developers running away with user funds, there are also exchanges that are closed because they no longer have benefits if they continue to operate such as locakbitcoin, Nova Exchange, Coinexchange, and many more.But in the end what about user data that has done KYC, will it be safe? Because it is clear that even though the exchange is closed they still hold the KYC data of all users and can be sold to get more profit.",

They won't see any silver lining in the fact that a security weakness got exposed.If I wanted to see a bright side, I would say that hacks showcase the weakness of centralized systems and should push the community towards full decentralization of not just Bitcoin but its whole ecosystem too.",

If we're talking about security, some businesses also practice terrible security outside of crypto. Not saying we should compare them and say which one is better though, since both of them are wrong. I guess we can say that with crypto business abuse is easier compared to traditional business since the owner can own multiple keys. Then again it can be prevented if the company is smart. At the end of the day, it depends on the intent of the owner itself whether they want to run an honest business or just a scam, plus whether they can provide transparency or not. I do believe that the market will eventually become mature and customers become smart enough to manage their risk properly.",

By exposing flaws, they force developers to step up their game. Â \"What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger,\" really applies. Despite their discomfort, many attacks have improved system security. However, I agree that humans often cause problems. When you give someone too much power and trust, things might go wrong.Bitcoin and crypto enterprises can benefit from tried-and-true business practises, especially in checks and balances. Well, why not? A practise that has worked for decades for traditional businesses may work for crypto enterprises. However, what if these traditional practises stifle crypto's decentralisation and essence?",
