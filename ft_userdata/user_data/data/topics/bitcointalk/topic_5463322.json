Or is there platform one can buy and sell easily without passing rigorous payment system? Please shareIt's true that some people find the transaction process for buying Bitcoin to be cumbersome. Simplifying the process through local banks or direct transfers could indeed make it more accessible. There are platforms that aim to streamline the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies, offering easier payment options and smoother withdrawal processes. You might want to explore exchanges that prioritize user experience and convenience to find a more straightforward way to invest and trade cryptocurrencies.",

It is the problems inherited from the centralized payment system and fiat that bring regulations and KYC which makes the process of converting your fiat to bitcoin a complicated one. In other words this is not \"transaction process\" this is \"conversion process\" that has gotten complicated.However, bitcoin is a currency and if you treat it as such you won't face as many problems.

Please shareThe problem you are discussing is what the government created by a way of banning bitcoin or regulating the operations of cryptocurrency in different countries. There are some countries that bitcoin is not banned but banks are not permitted to make any cryptocurrency related transactions. This has automatically made the people in that area to resort to the p2p introduced by the CEXs.The p2p proposed by Satoshi in the white paper can only be accomplished I a decentralized way. But centralization has eaten deep in the people. So, the problem you are seeing is not created by bitcoin but external bodies. It is either you follow the hard way to buy bitcoin or you follow the easy way and sacrifice privacy.",

Please shareLocal Peer to peer is available on almost every exchange until someone from your local place is providing the p2p services like if you are trying to sell some BTC but no other local person wants to buy that BTC then no exchange could help you there. I hope you are getting my point here.For example, if you use Binance exchange you have to send or lock you BTC into Exchange as exchange is middleman during the p2p trade only and once you will receive funds in your desired platform like some local platform instead of banks if you fo not prefer banks. Maybe some other finance apps which allows you to receive money but the condition is that finance app must be listed on Binance. Such as PayPal, etc. idk if PayPal is listed on Binance just saying it as an example.",

I'd even go as far as saying that this is not even a problem about Bitcoin conversion. Even AgoraDesk's volume alone suffices the amount that any ordinary person wants to convert. Conversion is easy. I can only speak of my local situation, though. The big problem, however-- and I agree with you-- is when you make a withdrawal. Withdrawing money is indeed a tough one. If it's a meetup with cold cash on hand, it's not a problem. But when it involves the banks or remittance centers, you'd have to be careful not to deal with amounts large enough to trigger AML policies. When somebody withdraws $20,000 here, for example, you better spread it across two different bank accounts at least. This has nothing to do with Bitcoin. This has everything to do with the fiat system. The moment they ask you where this money comes from, problems will begin to arise.",
