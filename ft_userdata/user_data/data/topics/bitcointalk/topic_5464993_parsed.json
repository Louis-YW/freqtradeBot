      "body": "Many people have become great in the world only by politics politics can make a country move forward and backward because it requires four organs to run a state which statesmen fail to do.And statesman comes from politics Abraham Lincoln Judge Washington Barack Obama Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Mahatma Gandhi. I am Arafat Nelson Mandela and many others have all come through politics. Politics always teaches bad things. Not through proper education. Good intentions and honest and hard work if one conducts politics.Then it will surely be good and good for all. Politics is necessary to run a state and lead the country Currently the good side of politics is not being used only the bad side is being used Leaders are only leaders to corrupt and abuse power and those who have power are using this policy.A fair politics helps the country to develop beautifullyPolitics will prevent you from leading your life properly, money, time and property will be a waste if you all don't help and if good leadership and quality can lead politics eg.Like Abraham Lincoln Sheikh Mujibur Rahman if you can do politics then you don't have to use money or anything but people's love and you will move forward.I am not a student of political science but still I say politics is very important for the country but that would be healthy normal politics sick politics is not useful or desirable for the country It is normal that the number of enemies will increase but more than that ten times the number of your friends will increase who will respect you and respect you a lot and respect you which will bring you a lot of peace.And it will also arouse the interest to do good work Many people say that elections cost a lot of money and do bad things to collect it. Actually we force them to do bad things. We don't have money in the name of votes and we try to take money from them in different ways.As a result, it is natural that they try to withdraw money after passing And currently those who are running the country, whether the secretary or the foreign cadre or others who are managing them, who are the politicians, politics is very necessary to manage the development of the country.Finally, I can say that the country cannot run without politics. How will the country's foreign policy run? What benefits will the citizens of the country get? Who will take the responsibility to protect the country?Roads, business infrastructure, health care, transport, communication, information technology, everything requires political power and people are bound to accept it and question it fairly.Politics alone can be extremely important for every state.",

For if it is necessary that there are politicians, I say yes because if there are no politicians, there will not be leaders to lead and control things, and if there is no political system in a country, anybody who forces their way into power can do as they really like and stay as long as they want. Politics is good and necessary; it has just only been majorly corrupted by bad individuals who take advantage of the position to do things in their favor or in the favor of a few sets of people to the disadvantage of the majority.",

In all these countries murders, fights, thefts, robberies have increased because they are doing these bad activities using political power.Actually, you are right. Many countries are using political power to get money by all means, whether in a good way or bad, after winning elections and forgetting people voted them in to office, and that is why most of these people cannot do what they suppose, and you know there is something again when someone leaves the office and spoils many things definitively. It will be hard for the new administration before they get everything back settled even if they wish to, and that is why you can see spoiling the new people's administration by all these negative things you mention.QuoteDisadvantages of politics:1. The number of your enemies will increaseThe increasing number of enemies will be based on how you treat people when you are still in power or office. If you do good, people who love you will remember what you have done for them. Even though leadership has that one thing that no matter what you have done, a few people will still hate you, but that doesn't mean if you do good, your name will remain there as someone who tried for his or her citizens, so don't consider that one as a leader thinking that your name will increase. No matter what you do, people will still say you didn't try.Quote2. It will be a waste of money.3. Your time will be wasted.Let me give an example with gambling: if you win, you get your money back, even more than what you staked. The same thing applies to politics: you are the one who chooses to contest, so if you win, you will definitely get your money, no doubt about it. However, for the time you said, politics is not a waste of time in my opinion because it is just like work; if you do it, you will get money. When you don’t win, you will say you wasted your time in politics, but after you emerge the winner, what remains?",

Even tribes in the middle of nowhere have their own version of politics.

It is easy to blame politics on many things, but without it our current way of life would not be possible.

Politics is good if it is practiced without bribery, corruption, and violence. It is not bad to choose your leaders freely without intimidation or any form of inducement. It is only in places where politics is expensive and seen as a do-or-die affair that you see most of these evils. It is mostly in Africa and some developing nations that politics is seen as war because of the gains from stealing public funds. Politics is not a waste of time or money because every society needs leaders who will control its affairs.

It is unlikely that anyone will argue about the importance and necessity of dentistry - although dentistry is often unpleasant, sometimes painful and almost always expensive. The main problem with politics (apart from corrupt incompetent non-professionals) is that it tries to extend its importance to all spheres of human life. It is as absurd as if someone started to claim that everything in the world depends on dentistry.",

What sort of government system would work without politics? Didcatorship or total anarchy? Politics are essential for any sort of governance of area if we want to debate on different ideas/parties. Otherwise it's just dictatorship. If in your country it involves murders, it's not because of politics but because of corruption. Which ironically can only solved with political decisions.I suggest you educate yourself on this subject as you don't seem to understand politics.
