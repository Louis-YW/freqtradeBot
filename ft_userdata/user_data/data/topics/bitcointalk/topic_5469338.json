Well, you can go through the different boards in the forum and read the pinned messages to get accustomed to rules and regulations. That would take a lot of your time therefore you can go through the below list and hopefully you will gain the information you are seeking here. Another piece of advice from me to you would be to stay active and ask questions whenever you need an answer. Bitcoin Resources - Consolidate List (India Specific)Merit & new rank requirementsUnofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQA short introduction to the Trust SystemBeginners & Help Encyclopedia",
