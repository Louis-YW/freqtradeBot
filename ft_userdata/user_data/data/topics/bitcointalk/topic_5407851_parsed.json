Supposing that Satoshi is a \"he\" first of all, No one has been able to place the correct gender of satoshi or even if it's a group. Not that his current activities should be of any concern to us, but certainly Satoshi is not idol, to think of it, Satoshi may still very much be in observation of bitcoins from a distance, it is difficult, i think impossible to create something as innovative as bitcoins and just abandon it without keeping watch or checking on it once in a while.",

I'm not really sure about your theory though, he has left and hide from the public's eye for so many years that I doubt that he will comeback in this forum or even have alt account (who even thought that this is possible during that time?)Anyhow, perhaps he might be active in other endeavors, maybe he has families to feed and needed another job to bring food in the table.",

But what I don't agree with is that Satoshi, assuming he/she is an individual person, is just chilling on the beach, drinking his/her favorite cocktail, doing nothing.My impression is that Satoshi is a passionate and a natural busy man/woman. And a busy person can't survive doing nothing. Although of course he/she could afford to while away hours, even days, once in a while, I don't think he/she could survive years just relaxing. Vacation is everybody's need but to be on a vacation every single day for the rest of the kind of life Satoshi seems to have, I don't think it is possible. My guess is that Satoshi is mainly enjoying reading or studying something, experimenting, trying things out, and the likes.",

The truth is that we do not have any idea about it, satoshi was incredibly explicit when it came to bitcoin and what he wanted for bitcoin to achieve, but when it came to the person behind his legendary username he was very secretive, while I would like to imagine satoshi not doing much and just having fun while watching the world deal with the invention he released, the only honest answer we can give is that he could be doing anything at the moment.",
