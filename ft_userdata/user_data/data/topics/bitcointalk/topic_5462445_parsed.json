The ICC (International Criminal Court) is a separate entity from the ICA (International Court of Arbitration) and primarily deals with cases related to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Its jurisdiction is limited to individual criminal responsibility and does not extend to resolving territorial disputes or intervening in ongoing conflicts between nations.Regarding the South China Sea territorial disputes, the International Court of Arbitration (ICA) ruled in favor of the Philippines, stating that China's claims to historic rights within the \"nine-dash line\" were inconsistent with international law. However, the ICA does not have the power to enforce its rulings, and China has rejected the court's decision, continuing its activities in the disputed sea.Concerning the situation between Russia and Ukraine, it falls under the realm of international relations and geopolitics. The ICC's jurisdiction does not extend to resolving conflicts between states or awarding territories.",
