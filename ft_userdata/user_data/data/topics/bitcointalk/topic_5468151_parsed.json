The question is if you find a cash out voucher resting on the machine itself or on the seat, can you legally use it?I think legally not as there is cash in there,however I have seen people leaving only dust amounts like 0.10 to 0.20 dollars which they got mad and left the game not giving a damn about such low amount in such cases other people have put money of their own and kept playing,the person who left did not turn back so nothing wrong here.However personally I would never do that as I have seen when I was working in a casino in the 2000-2005 years that some people that played with max bet left money intentionally in there and told the casino people to not let anyone to play that slot as they were going home to get money and coming back again,no one touched such slot machines.",

The question is if you find a cash out voucher resting on the machine itself or on the seat, can you legally use it?Very good question.I will give you one example, this is my personal experienced wit this kind of scenario. I honestly didn't know that there was money on that particular slot machine an so I put some money on it because I wanted to play that game. However, I realized that there are still little money left on it, so I was taken aback because as a general rule, you shouldn't do that.And then so the owner comes back, the lady said that she still has some money on it and I acknowledged that yeah it was my mistake and I didn't know that. And so I said that I will withdraw it and give it back to her. But for some strange reasons, she didn't want to and she argue with me. So I said, WTF, here just it it all, you piece of s**t, it's just a small amount for you. Clearly, I was pissed off and leave that area.As a general rule, yes, you can't take that credit. You may call the assistance of casino employee and they are the one who's going to withdraw it, just to be safe.For my case, not sure if the lady is willing to leave the money or just put it a trap to someone like me.",

The question is if you find a cash out voucher resting on the machine itself or on the seat, can you legally use it?The credits has no infringed ownership itself which is why you can use it if the the real owner abandoned it already. It’s like a dollar on the floor which no one pick up. There’s no ownership for credits unless once it was left behind. Besides, you can always refund it once the owner claim it and prove ownership using the cctv footage but I doubt anyone is willing to go on that extent just for the penny credits.Easy answer is yes! You can use it especially if the machine is already free. But make sure that the previous player is long gone before you so that you will have no problem once you use it already.",

I heard stories that if you do that, I mean getting the credit and play, that you might be ban on that casino if they found out that you did it.That is just a story though that I heard from a friend of mine who works on the casino. And there is also that one gambler a friend of mine who says that same. Specially if the person that left the credit will complain that you play the money even if it is just a penny.",

You may come across problems with trying to explain to the person who used the machine prior to you though since, well, people are irrational, more noticeably so in casinos imo. I mean if cases like this can be legally attacked, I reckon arcades and the like would've been rather profitable for scammers. So to avoid any major issues, you can simply wait, maybe call the attention of some staff and make sure they know you're playing on a machine with prior credits in it, making sure that there's no player out there who was playing on it for at least maybe 10 minutes? If there was, you can wait or maybe just straight up ask the staff to reset the credits itself so that the responsibility doesn't lie on you but on the casino themselves instead.",

We don't know maybe those players only took the bathroom, have taken a break, or something. I know there are also greedy people who can notice it and lie that it was theirs.In order to be sure we can ask the owners to check their CCTV's ( I'm sure they have it ). That was still a fine penalty if we are only going to pay the exact amount of the credits or the cash-out vouchers but I heard that some penalties are times 10 of the amount. Imagine that? But whatever, we must still avoid stealing as it's also morally wrong. We can get a lot of bad karmas other than the fines if we insist to.",

If the amount involved is big then it would really be just that right that you should really be that stopping on making use of it,if ever you had continued it and someone do make out some complaints then it would really be definitely be starting up some serious argumentation or complaints basing up on what you have done and this is somethingthat we dont really like to happen right?",

I personally might avoid using someone elses credit on a machine, but would not necessarily look down on someone who would do it. If a machine is clearly vacant, as in - no drinks or anything left around it, then it is fair game to play on it and you should not expect it to be reserved in any way. Most casinos would not look too kindly on any person leaving a machine unavailable for play like that anyway. I don't consider it any different than $10 that someone might find on the floor with no identifiable owner in sight, sometimes you lose that $10 and sometimes you find what others have lost.",

In the first place, we can't blame the one who picked it up. As you said, it's a general rule of thumb not to leave those winnings.When you are in a physical casino, expect that there are lots of people around sneaking for players who might leave an unclaimed winning. But at some casinos, if casino staff caught those persons who intentionally scouting several machines for an unclaimed voucher, they might be subject to a request to leave the casino.",

If everyone thought that would be a way to go, no one could even play that machine with their own coins before those left in coins are used. And in reality there's no one in the world going to make you pay back those coins. It's just a minor morality issue where's no right answer. I myself have played those coins multiple times, because no one leaves even $5 in. It's always in cents.And if you are feeling guilty, you can always leave that amount of credits in after you stop playing.",

It's just that if these vouchers are ignored, other stalkers will likely take advantage therefore just go with the flow and have that to ourselves. Some staff are serious about looking at these attempters but there are staff that just allow those stalkers to look for those vouchers as long as they are not creating a serious problem inside the casino.If no one is looking, someone can take that voucher, and used it like nothing happened lol.",

I have never ever gone through a position like this before. Most seats that I took were either zero or just a bit left. From reading your experience, I also had the same conclusion that it's like a trap or maybe a scam attempt by someone, in your case the lady who wants something better in return. Then, I came into one imagination about the \"What if's?\"What if you hit a big win? What if you hit the jackpot? Will that lady take all the profits saying it was her balance that was used on the machine? Or will she just want a part of that winnings? I think that's the reason why we should not be using another person's left-out balance because who knows, the real owner of the left-out balance could be watching in the shadows and just waiting for you to win the game and then they will argue about it. It will be a big problem, especially with cameras all over the casino. Yes, it's better to call some assistance first to withdraw it before starting the game. I learned a good lesson here.",
