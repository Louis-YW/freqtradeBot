  "content": "If the Innosilicon T2 series miner cannot run normally, you can check from the following aspects：1. Check for missing hash board or no hash board. Putty can be used to test, if a fault is detected, the hash board needs to be repaired; if the test is OK, the hash board is not faulty. If the power supply or data cable is replaced and the fault still exists, the control board may be faulty, and the control board needs to be repaired or the damaged control board needs to be replaced.2. Miner restarts repeatedly. If the three hash boards test without failure, you can try to replace the power supply or fan; if it still exists, reset the control board to factory settings, or clear the data and re-upgrade the firmware. If the fault persists after replacing the power supply and upgrading the firmware, the control board may need to be replaced.3. After connecting to the mining pool, if there is a network abnormality, you can observe whether the network port light of the miner is on. If it does not light up, you need to check whether there is foreign matter or dust in the network port, and whether the network interface is well connected. If the network is still abnormal after cleaning, you need to check whether the control boardis abnormal; if the light is on, you can try to restore the factory settings by long pressing the IP reset button for 8 seconds, and then search for the IP connection again.4. The power supply cannot supply normal power to the miner. Try another power supply, if it works, replace the power supply; if it still doesn't work, you need to check the control board or hash board for a short circuit.5. The miner temperature is too high. First of all, you need to check whether the ambient temperature is too high. If the ambient temperature is too high, the miner will not work properly. Then check whether the fan speed of the miner is normal. If the fan stops working or the speed is too low or too high, there will be no good ventilation,  or causing the temperature to be too high and the miner to stop working.The above is what I have compiled and adjusted based on the existing information on the zeusbtc website. If there is any wrong content, please tell me, I will be very grateful.",
