  "content": "Is it a real risk, or an exaggeration?It seems to me like a bit of both … The company Wallet Guard has issued a warning on a vulnerability they’ve detected in MS Word named \"follina\". Wallet Guard has classified the vulnerability as critical (0-day vulnerability), although Microsoft seems to downplay the scale, and does not award it the same classification by their standards.The exploit seems to allow a hacker to take full control of your windows environment, simply by downloading a malicious .doc, .docx or .rtf file onto your environment. You don’t even need to open the document itself for the exploit to be set in motion. Apparently, a said malicious document can exploit MS Word template features, and execute external html or java code.But the added danger seems to reside in yet another vulnerability tied to MSDT (Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool), which theoretically allows MS to gain remote control of your environment to perform support (something we shouldn’t even want in our system per se). MSDT requires that you enter a password to grant remote access, but apparently, a vulnerability can be exploited to bypass the password requirement, thus allowing a hacker to access your system.This is, according to Microsoft, the way you can disable MSDT URL protocol:Quote1.   Run Command Prompt as Administrator.2.   To back up the registry key, execute the command “reg export HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ms-msdt filename“3.   Execute the command “reg delete HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ms-msdt /f”.The above caught my attention whilst reading an article on the Spanish Media, that literally stated that a Microsoft vulnerability could allow your bitcoins to be stolen. The possibility of course stands, if someone gains remote control to your environment, and you’ve got critical information lying around in files (i.e. seeds), although this is not something that specifically targets crypto, but that opens a potential door to multiple forms of wrongdoing.On the other hand, there don’t seem to be any reports of this exploit been used by hackers to date, either because the case is too fresh, or not that easy to become acquainted with and exploit.All in all, just in case, I’ve disabled the MSDT URL protocol…See: https://twitter.com/wallet_guard/status/1531848479911432192https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/05/30/guidance-for-cve-2022-30190-microsoft-support-diagnostic-tool-vulnerability/",

The MS article in the OP indicates how to re-enable it if necessary for whatever reason. I expect the MS blog entry to be updated on behalf on Microsoft with any novelties related to this exploit, so it may be worth checking it every now and then.There’s an example video here of the first part of the combined set of vulnerabilities, showing how downloading a word file can lead to the file launching \"whatever\" without even opening the file. The trick though may be that it requires the file to be at least previewed to some degree on the file explorer, but simply browsing a directory with preview set can lead to that.See: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-shares-mitigation-for-office-zero-day-exploited-in-attacks/https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1531259406624620544 (quite a bit of additional info on this Twitter thread).Note: This twitter thread is also interesting to read through, as a complementary read to create awareness. It’s a couple of months old, and bears a different set of attack vectors, but also pivots around exploiting Word (albeit in a different way):https://twitter.com/wallet_guard/status/1509196531202932736",

But same goes, for example, to Excel files too. The malicious file is a cleverly altered Word document, but I don't see why the same thing would not work with any (zip) Office file.But, as you can see at 7:39 there ( https://youtu.be/3ytqP1QvhUc?t=459 ), the hearth of everything isCode:<script>location.href = msdt:where the hacker gives all sort of parameters to msdt exe, which runs them all without questioning (including, sooner or later, cab file/installer, they say).For now I've removed that entry from my registry, but I fear that this is such a wide opportunity they'll very fast find other \"servicing\" programs they can run in a similar way.",
