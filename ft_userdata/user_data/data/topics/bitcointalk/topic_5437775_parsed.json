I want to hear an explanation from you?Because every altcoin that has potential has been rising this whole year. Fantom isn't an exception. It has as much potential to rise more in the bull market then most of the top coins rising right now.If FTM and other alts continue to rise, no one can say for sure, but i am guessing FTM won't be rising alone if there's a shakedown and other coins fall.That crash would be reasons we don't know. Many would point to their technical analysis and how their prediction was right, that's for sure.For now, just enjoy the ride. As later on all this movement was just a tiny blip on the chart.",

I want to hear an explanation from you? to be honest i've been watching this project since 2021 wherein that time i used to daily trade and FTM really following the path of the biggest coins in the market especially top altcoins. So i wouldn't be surprised if up to now it still kicking since it has a good team behind as well.Â  Try to check the highest time frame surely you will see its progress every month or year.",

So it seems to me that a new high will not be reached any time soon. Most likely there is a local bounce now, though no one can say for sure. Looking at the growth of Aptos, the same thing could happen to any coin now.",

There's sell The news event. 2: people will soon realize that while this is unique, it isn't that impressive or important. People can hype anything but when it comes to using a feature, it's just nyt as attractive for the price",

Although the FTM coin's meteoric ascent is undoubtedly thrilling, it's crucial to keep in mind that cryptocurrency values may be unpredictable and there is no assurance they will keep rising.But let's focus on the positive. There is a lot of room for expansion and new chances since the cryptocurrency industry is always changing and new initiatives are constantly emerging. Fantom may be a wise investment for you if you think highly of its potential and the underlying technology.However, I always advise doing your own research before making any cryptocurrency investments. Look at their whitepapers, alliances, and development plans while keeping an eye out for any possible concerns. After all, the cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy, so it's crucial to proceed with prudence.",

This keeps many people stuck at high prices due to a lack of information about these coins.
