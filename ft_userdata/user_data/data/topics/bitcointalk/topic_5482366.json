Worked great. Thanks everyone for the advice! just be cautiouswhen using a promoted CEX but its not a regulated CEX, . regulated CEX/analysis services know of known unregulated crypto services reserve /hot/cold wallet addresses and would tag your withdrawal from their wallet as suspicious so you might be on a watchlistthough general users cant tie you to a particular earlier deposit. there are monitoring/analysis services that do rate utxo's/withdrawals based on where funds came from.so you may have changed the taint from your previous use, you may now have a different taint suspicion rating for different reasonthe very best way is to swap coins privately with a fresh mined coin",

Though mixers aren’t allowed to operate on the forum, they remain a service in the cryptospace and you could such that out on other forums or even by using google search engine, get acquainted with the patterns to usage and enhance privacy on your Bitcoin.",
