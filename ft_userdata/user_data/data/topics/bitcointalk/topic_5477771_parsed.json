If that's what is referred to here, I'd argue that they will likely adopt and accept stablecoin as a form of payment. I doubt businesses would ditch payment systems and build their own payment processor just because stablecoin makes it easier for customers to ditch cash.In my area, digital payment has definitely become the norm, although it brings another form of inconvenience when the infrastructure doesn't fully support them. Slow internet access, poor back-end code that makes payment fail to be processed, etc. It will definitely get ironed out if stablecoin or a similar form of payment becomes popular.",

I actually think what zasad is saying can happen. They may not say it but the stablecoin could be the real CBDC, we are not yet aware of it but since this is supported by the government and I mean they can freeze it right? And then the USDC seems to be catching up with the USDT which USDC is governed by a popular organization that you could link to the government. The stablecoins are the preferred payment even the ecommerce sites today are accepting stablecoins and PayPal is out.",

However it comes with its own benefits and a lot of people who are actively trying to avoid banking rout for borderless payments, are adopting cryptocurrencies, and more specifically stable coins. But when the question comes whether the stable coins can eradicate the need of banking or not, I think differently than many other fellow members. Banking system has a very strong foundation within the society. The usage of banking is more psychological than anything else. Otherwise when we already have a robust system available why people are not using it? Banking can never be eradicated. But we will see a growth in cryptocurrency payment settlements. Both will coexist.",
