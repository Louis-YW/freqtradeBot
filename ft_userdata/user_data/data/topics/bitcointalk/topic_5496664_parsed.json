I'm not sure if either can generate a paper wallet for print.Except you have to write down the seed phrase manually with pen and paper then you can laminate it or if eventually Electrum generates a paper wallet for printing then the printer must be an offline printer that doesn't connect to internet.",

BIP39 or whatever Electrum uses?Also if using BIP39 which Derivation Path is best to use in terms of future compatability?There aren't any known research to answer that accurately but since Electrum is just one client while BIP39 is supported by the majority, then it's BIP39.Plus you can restore BIP39 mnemonic to Electrum by enabling an option.For future compatibility, Bitcoin is known to preserve compatibility of its old script types so I don't think that there'll be any issue whether you use legacy or TapRoot.That's unless there's a major bug to be discovered in the future which is unpredictable.I you would ask me personally, I'd use Native SegWit in that paper wallet gift.For the derivation path, use the standard \"BIP84\" for that script and add a note about it on your paper wallet.",

You would have dozens of QR-codes, addresses and private keys, it wouldn't be usable neither useful. It's better to make yourself a nice paper decorated with the seed instead. You can use an AI tool to make the drawings before writing the seed for example.",

Electrum uses a fixed derivation path when deriving addresses from a seed phrase that has been generated by itself.Even if you have a BIP39 seed phrase, most wallets use standard derivation paths and you sill don't need to write down the derivation path.You need to write the derivation path, if your seed phrase is BIP39 and your wallet uses an uncommon derivation path for generating addresses.",
