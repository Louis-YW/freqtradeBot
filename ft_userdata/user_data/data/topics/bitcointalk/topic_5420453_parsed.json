PM it me please what kind of price are you expecting?Don’t worry mate, not the first account I’ve sold. I am not dumb. I have mixed up all of the details so that my account is not standing out.Tried to PM you, doesn’t work.My TG is @KindSoul111(Also using a different telegram)We can discuss price and I can prove everything, I’m here to get some money for my account rather than it just get closed for nothing. I wasted a lot of time and money building it up and the perks are amazing if a consistent player purchases it.",

Even if there is a way to change the email (which I cant find it), the risk of losing money is on the buyer side. It is even worst when you say that you have sold many accounts, means that you have breached other terms of stake related to multi accounts. It will make the risk for buyer bigger.",

You are not saying that OP is one of the hacked accounts but there's a near coincidence which anyone should check out for.Another thing is that OP said wife asked him to quit gambling that is why he is selling the accounts. He also said that he has sold such accounts before, which means it's his business not necessarily because of his wife",

And regarding the accounts offered for purchase, I would also not recommend someone to purchase them, this may lead to a double loss of your funds from this dubious deal.",

      "body": "the problem with buying an account is that the casino will eventually ask you to do KYC and at that moment they will check what you put in your birth date when you created an account and will compare it with the birth date of the document you are deliveringand after seeing that they are different dates they will close your account, honestly i don't see any advantage in that, of course people never listen so it is more likely that they ignore what i posted and buy account, but at least they are aware that it has high risk of being blocked and losing money that will be in the account and the money they spent buying the account",
