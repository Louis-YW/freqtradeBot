  "content": "After reading n0nce's Steel Washer Backup jig (customisable), Securing Your Seed Phrase with Washers, Stainless steel Bitcoin Recovery Seed Plate, m2017's post and ColorSEED Or how to simply hide your seed phrase, I think it's time to post an idea I've had for a while. I came up with a combination that doesn't require a 3D-printer or laser engraving. Just a normal printer is enough.For security:Quote from: LoyceV on April 06, 2022, 06:10:36 AMI prefer to have 2 different backup systems in place for the same data. I do of course test both systems independently, to see if I can recover them (before funding).Printing on paper and transparent sheetsYou may need to adjust the printer setting. There are 2 types of transparent sheets, either for laser printers or for ink jets.TemplateTape the paper sheet on a metal plate, get your center punch, and hammer the first 4 characters of each seed word with one dot per character. Then hammer 4 more dots in the red \"oo\" for alignment.Remove and burn the paper sheet.The size isn't perfect, it might be too small, but I don't want 24 seed words to take up a very large sheet of metal either. Maybe someone with better graphics skills than me can improve this.Using exact 5 mm squares should make it possible to decipher the dots using only a ruler and a pencil, without printing on a transparent sheet. But that would make the required metal sheet size at least 13x24 cm for just 12 words. With accurate measuring, it should still be possible to decipher the dots without printing again.100 dotsFor 24 seed words, you'll end up with exactly 100 dots.50 dotsFor 12 seed words, use only \"o\" instead of \"oo\" just because 52 dots sounds less nice DecipheringTape the transparent sheet at the right location, and read back the seed words.With accurate measuring, it should be possible to decipher the dots without transparent sheet.Hiding in plain sightWho's going to suspect a metal plate with \"random\" holes to hold your money?Do I dare use it?I haven't tested this yet (due to the lack of clean sheet metal), and wouldn't use it as the only backup for real funds.No spamSelf-moderated against spam.

Now every man after your post will try to see the plate with dotes. How do you plan to store this piece of metal? Hide or fit into interior and decorative elements, furniture or other elements in the house or garage?In my opinion, it is best to put it somewhere where it will not stand out, but will blend in with the surrounding objects. For example, a box on a desktop or cabinet in the garage along with other pieces of metal, blanks and other metal junk. I hope I haven't revealed anyone's storage secret.  Just don’t throw it away by accident like James Howells (or your relative or husband / wife), so you don’t have to tinker with the landfill.Quote from: LoyceV on September 12, 2023, 10:47:37 AMDo I dare use it?I haven't tested this yet (due to the lack of clean sheet metal), and wouldn't use it as the only backup for real funds.You can experiment with a test amount of money to tickle your nerves (when money is at stake, this experiment will be the closest to real conditions).  Create the 100 dots backup and place it in a place where it will not be intrusively visible. See how others (friends and random guests) will react to this and how quickly the money will disappear from this wallet  how successfully the process of restoring access will go using the 100 dots backup. I think we should try it to identify possible bugs.When a dilemma arises: to be or not to be to try or not to try, then it is better to choose the second. Until you try, you won't know.",

Use one to stamp your seed phrase. Then use all 20 in a building project, such as to join two pieces of wood together, with the seed phrase obviously pointing inwards so it appears no different to any of the others. Or go in to your roof/cellar/foundations/crawl space/floorboards/whatever and just screw it (face down) on to some beam/joist/rafter/truss/whatever.

In my view,  it can be even advanced and instead of applying  punches to relevant places one could drill the small holes there. Then, at decoding, one can illumine the face site of the plate and get the optical   signals from reverse side, head those signals to CCD matrix and get the restored SEED.
