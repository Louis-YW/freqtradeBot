In March 2020, Bitcoin had a crash when people thought bottom was confirmed already.About cryptocurrency market, generally it has a mini bull run like 2019 because Bitcoin has lifting up with its rally.

The market is not already in a bullish state, we have these pumps because of a sudden increase in demand but it looks natural. The uprising momentum of Bitcoin isn't strong enough to carry the market to another level. Whether we like it or not, or even though we are hoping for a fast recovery but it was very unfortunate that it never looks like that. The market remain in the bear season probably until the end of this year.",

A short term bull run because the price keeps increasing for more than a week without any sign of setback. But there's still a chance that we can go down below 15K since there's a lot of potential bad news that can affect this abnormal growth of Bitcoin like feds meeting, genesis bankruptcy chain effect on other crypto project and a possibility for a new attack on Binance credibility since US is not yet finished on their attack against Binance. For now we can safely assume that we are really on bull run but there's no definite time on when it will end or for how long it will continue because this run is not backed by a credible positive news. Only hype is what driving this rally to continue. I believe a major whale like institutional investors is behind on this price rally.",

And also, a rollback of the cost is generally possible, but it is unlikely that it will go to 15.5k. Bitcoin didn't fall to this mark even with a lot of negative news last year (and even the very beginning of this year). In short, according to tradition, the bull run begins after the halving, which has not yet occurred. Therefore, what is happening now, I consider a short-term jump, which has nothing to do with the bullrun. Be patient, it will start later.",

However who bought altcoins at tops still have big loss except some few best altcoins like Ethereum or BNB.With bitcoin's current momentum, those who have DCA in 2022 can make a bit of a profit. The rest, even if you bought bitcoin in 2021, you still lose big, not just altcoin holders lose. But unfortunately for those who bought shitcoins, the chances of recovering those losses are almost zero.",

We can’t consider this a bull run already because we haven’t even it half the ATH yet. The great thing about this period is that bitcoin shows stability at the 16k price mark and I don’t see it coming down below that no matter what except maybe a huge saga comes up. Bull run could come during the end of this year though",

The increase this time seems normal as the price is starting to increase to a higher price, but if this time, the price can immediately increase to $50k or $60k, that's just a real bull run, and it's only a matter of time until the price can exceed the last ATH. But that looks unlikely to happen as the bitcoin price is still underwhelming, and there is more than $47k left to be at $69k.",

While I do find this minor bull run intriguing, and it is fascinating to see your money increasing in value, I was used to the constant downward movement of the market and was taking full advantage of it by receiving considerably larger amounts of Bitcoin from my signature campaign. Personally, I don't believe that the upward movement will continue for long; it's a minor bull run, but this certainly isn't the end of the bear market. I'm hoping that we'll have a few more opportunities to accumulate some more Bitcoin and BNB.",

Now entities are going bankrupt left and right and whoever wants to survive needs to scoop up BTC that their clients think they own. This is causing a return to the norm.
