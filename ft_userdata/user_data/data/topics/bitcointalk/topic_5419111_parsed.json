I'm also not sure if your idea is a good one to consider considering that merit source is basically a free job that can actually be turned down when you get an offer.Edit:So far, merit source is getting good returns from the community which has made their reputation on this forum very good and the community is proud of. It might be good to suggest this idea to icopress in particular to add new category of best merit sources on the year to the Bitcointalk Community awards thread.",

Don't understand me wrong, giving BTC rewards for merit sources isn't something fundamnetally wrong, but I just don't think that this stuff should be about money.As @decodx, efforts of people who fight with spam isn't smaller, why not to reward them? Or someone who expose scams? Yeah, I know that scams isn't moderated, but merit system isn't moderated too.",

NO!  point 1I'm not against merit sourceship , neither I'm I against meritocracy itself but, that'll incure an expenses -- to a magnitude that the forum managements would have to squeeze out to get funds, just to get 'em paid -- these will definitely happen after the forum's run bankrupt already. It'll make the admins loose-up to some risk -- risk that'll involve cash at the end, that was evaded, prolly in past due to some unforseen mishaps or sometimes, decipherable disruption, Sorta like real bugs, controlled by human just to make with the site (something I guess, had happened earlier on), IT MIGHT TEMPT 'em admins -- since they'll need to pay up a hundred merit sources -- to adhere on some nefarious deals(might be unknown to em, as it usually is, until whenever) that'll finally get us all FUCKED. point 2: you just wanna make the sourceship a nice piece of cake; so you'd have alot of peeps scrambling and vying, day and night, bringing up testimonies and making references to what they did, just to keep getting many peeps on the affirmative. It's not even a paid position but, alot of peeps are flunting the meta board to get recognized, how much more when it is?? Huh?? We Gon find this board unreadable. I dunno why you don't reason out the intricacies of taking certain actions before planning 'em.It'll be nice if they're awarded, annually? That'll make much requal-sense.Sandra ðŸ’‡",

If there's a prize I think you must include them all but IMO, if you contributed a lot here you will earn benefits via an established member on the forum which is joining a high-paid signature campaign that isn't tough for you.

Even the fact they've became merit sources means they are very active, hence recognized.Those who care about the money do participate in well paying signature campaigns.So, again, it should never become a rule or something that looks mandatory. But I am sure that a tip like surprise would bring some smiles here and there.However, let's try not to break something that already works well, OK, please?",

It is unfortunate to see that some people completely misunderstand how the forum works and that they think that every function on the forum should be monetized in one way or another. It is true that some members applied to be merit sources, but there are those who were selected without asking for it - but all of them have no obligation to award even one merit they receive, it is all a matter of their good will. Their real reward is that they help all members below the Legendary rank to progress towards that rank, and if someone wants to donate anonymously to someone who is a merit source, they can do so at any time.Quote from: decodx on November 01, 2022, 09:49:34 PMAnd what about the individuals who fight against spam?
