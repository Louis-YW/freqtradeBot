      "body": "Why are you so against BRICS countries? It is about time that these countries start being independent of first world countries like USA and Europe. Their resources has been exploited for years by these countries and they got very little in return. The BRICS countries should adopt Bitcoin and break all ties to the US Dollar, because it is just pulling them down. They should start to expand the Chinese factories to their countries, so that they can also get educated and skilled like the first world countries. (Elon Musk came from South Africa, so you can see what he became, given the right circumstances)",

BRICs catching up (and in some areas overtaking) was long overdue and has benefitted millions or even billions of people.Some of that success, especially in regards to India and China is based on huge sacrificies for freedom and human rights in general. Ofc it’s a concerning topic, but at the same time western „democratic“ countries struggle with similar isssues, so I would be very careful to look at these things via a simplifying-lense. It’s tempting, because it seemingly explains the world situation in an esier to grasp way, but ultimately fails to describe reality. Last note, BRICs do already impact crypto, yes, but a lot is still subject to change.",

That the world will stay under the dominance of Americans? Bullshit! The world needs balance of power and right now it is not the case. When one country becomes too powerful, shit happens! We are already seeing this in middle East and what kind of massacre American forces have done to it. The new world orders needs to become a reality sooner than later for the interest of global peace. BRICS countries have rightfully decided to use their own currencies for the international trade. That's a great news! How on earth crypto will be impacted?",

But BRICS is solely an economic alliance geared toward national economic prosperity, hence the political influence of these powerful nations on others might be minimal. It is the responsibility of every responsible government to protect and guide its territorial integrity jealously. Turkey and Hungary are members of NATO but the US and other top members hardly influence their decisions. The US and Europe need competition and BRICS is a formidable one. It is time for nations, especially developing ones to weigh the consequences of their economic alliance and choose the best option between the US and its partners and the BRICS alliance. The competition will be very stiff, only time will tell who will become dominant.

Although the members of BRICS are rumored to be nurturing the idea of having its currency, currently it is just an economic alliance and doesn't have any currency. BRIC is made up of five nations Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa and their names were used as the acronym BRICS. The next BRICS summit will be in South Africa in August, maybe a new common currency might be introduced.",

Unfortunately the mistake these countries are making with their cooperation with China is adoption of RMB. It's like dropping one cancer in trade of another.The US government has no one to blame but itself for making the dollar a toxic asset for half the world. The misuse of economic sanctions by the United States has made dollar settlements too risky in many trades. A natural reaction to the unacceptable risk of freezing funds is to switch to settlements in local currencies. And since China is the \"factory of the world\", the share of the yuan in international settlements began to grow rapidly. I think none of the BRICS countries are happy with the prospect of getting rid of one addiction and falling into another, so some solution will be found, but in any case, the trend towards abandoning the dollar in international settlements is obvious and will increase.",

There are still many things they have to solve so they can become more efficient in achieving mutual economic objectives. This is what I'm saying. It shows that many don't like the reigning of the US dollar for how many years and its supremacy. And when this news came out, many thought to be optimistic about BRICS.But, it's still in its early stage despite that many have heard of it years ago but it just come to pass on its reality this year. I agree that there's still a lot for them to solve but then, we will have to wait how both of these superpowers will react to each other as US isn't alone, it's got its subordinates as well.",
