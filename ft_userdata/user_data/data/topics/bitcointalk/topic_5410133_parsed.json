  "content": "Poland’s  Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on Tuesday said France and Germany were running the European Union like a “de facto oligarchy where power is held by the strongest. He called the  EU  an “imperial power,” suggesting that France and Germany effectively monopolize the bloc’s decision-making. He criticized Germany and its partners for ignoring Poland’s warnings and opinions because they are not one of the strongest in the bloc. Morawiecki further asserted that Political practice has shown that the voice of Germany and France counts above all.",

      "body": "This is natural for the largest economies to control the union's major decisions, since it is also one of its biggest supporters. I mean, I do not imagine that the contribution that Greece pays to the union is equal to the value of what France or Germany pays. This policy was clear from the beginning, and all the countries that joined or that wanted to join (Ukraine and Turkey, for example) know the balance of power between the countries of the Union and that this balance determines the major policies of Europe.Britain was also one of the influential, but it chose to leave so that its policies would not be controlled by countries that were considered in the recent past as its enemies (Germany).",

Prior to the attack of Russia to Ukraine, they warned the EU to not be so dependent on the Russian oil but I guess their worries were not taking into consideration.  Even though Germany and France look to be one of the strong member states due to their thriving economy and the rest, Poland also has a lot to offer and the EU should not just be Democratic in name only, but also make the other members of the Bloc feel they are a part of them.",
