From 2013 until now, every now and then I hear that we are going to have another crisis like 2008, and there hasn't been one, there have been small crises and then there was the exceptional case of the coronavirus that caused a crisis that we got out of quickly thanks to mass printing, but so far, nothing remotely similar to 2008.Could it happen again? Yes, but this already sounds like the wolf's tale to me. The only advice I can give you is to manage your finances well and accumulate bitcoin, then the crisis will affect you less or you can even take advantage of it. There were a lot of people who got rich in 2008 because they were able to buy cheap. That's what rich people do.",

And I do understand your worries as I have also given up some things due to the shifts in the market and my move to adapt to it (by sacrificing some things in order to ensure that I will financially survive). However, right now what we can do is to ensure that we have sources of income to depend on when things change and always be informed of what is happening (economically, socially, and politically) so we can be prepared to take an action and make decisions.",

It's a reminder of why I believe in Bitcoin. Some might not fully grasp it, but our past experiences give us a unique perspective. I mentioned to a friend recently that something significant seems to be brewing. Let's stay vigilant, and as always, keep an eye on our financials. Accumulating Bitcoin might just be the safeguard we need.",

After the great depression that ended in 1939, it took 69 years before the financial crisis of 2008. I'm saying this because, after the great depression, there are people who must have kept hammering it that another crisis was coming but no one listened, the same way no one is paying attention now. They went on making the same mistakes that were made before. No one knows when it will happen, but if the financial system continues on this part it may be inevitable. The major difference is countries with big economies are looking for ways to minimize the effect when it happens, it's the third-world countries that'll suffer it the most. The situation is worse in developing countries. Maybe their government has a way of gaslighting the situation of things on the ground but if you look deeper you'll see how poor people are and that poverty is spreading throughout the region. Only a few rich people keep getting richer. The middle class has almost been eliminated. Now, it's either you're rich or you're poor, there's no in-between. The worst part is, that things can get worse than it already is.",

Could we be on the verge of some crazy market crashes like in 2008?I will respond to your question which is located in the last sentence, namely about the market crash which you consider crazy. Actually, it is difficult to give a very precise answer to this, but if it is only about crashes, it seems that everyone will never find a market crash at the same level as 2008 in any market now and also for the future. Because every year there are always changes in several sectors, so things that have changed can also influence the level of market collapse, although the level of recovery will not be easier to occur. However, believe me that a market crash at the same level that you have seen before will not happen in the near future, even if it does happen I think the level will also be very different from what happened in 2008.",

The 2008 financial crisis was caused by a combination of factors including the subprime mortgage crisis, the collapse of Lehman Brothers & the failure of other financial institutions. There are some similarities between the current economic climate and 2008, there are also big differences. The global economy has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic & central banks have taken measures to mitigate the impact. Always keep an eye on market trends & be prepared for any eventuality.",

So, if you can elaborate more about your feeling, and maybe provide some data, then maybe we could have a real discussion here.",

A market crash like 2008 might happen again to reset what has happened so that the world's economic situation might improve.And before that happens, we already have Bitcoin, which will probably be the only way out of that predicament. While everything is still fine, we should use this time to own more Bitcoin. Just anticipating bad things that might happen will not make us difficult, especially if it concerns our lives and our families.And if you feel that the situation is very similar to what we have experienced, maybe it could happen at any time. Still, the situation now is different because we already have Bitcoin. We hope to survive difficult situations later and welcome a new life.",

More people are embracing the financial freedom and hodling their money in bitcoin and transacting likewise, so how do you think the experience is the same thing or would be the same, no it won't. The economy is crashing and probably the wise investors are even innocently contributing to that with DCA and investment in cryptocurrency therefore taking out fiat in circulation. This is possible to also be a reason for such crash, meaning the preparedness is already their and the circumstances won't be the same and the result different also.",

I understand that you have difficult memories from 2008, but what happened then is far from the worst thing that can happen. Markets are cyclical and this has been known for a long time. So, there is a theory that approximately every 10 years there are falls in the market, and every 100 years, very, very strong falls. The last time this happened was during the Great American Depression. About 100 years have already passed and some people predict that this could happen again. Nothing is new in this world.By the way, \"big short\" is a wonderful and entertaining film that helped me, who at that time still understood absolutely nothing about markets, take a little look behind the scenes of the world of securities. Perhaps will need to reconsider this.",

Please tell me, OP, that hard times are the times when someone learns something most important, and in your own words, you said that's why you are so optimistic about BTC. Because you knew how it could save you from the situations that occurred in 2008. But why are you so skeptical about the current market situation? Why do you think another market crash is coming?The days of bankruptcy were 2 to 3 months ago. Even though I have not seen any new recessions,  why are you thinking that something is brewing, and why do you think the market will come back to the same condition as it was in 2008? I said it because, back in 2008, there was no BTC to back ourselves up, but now we have the facility of BTC where we can store our money to save its value, but of course, we cannot save our houses.",
