But it's nice idea to buy a Copper membership.Checking your profile you're already here for three years, you know the drill here if you're offering a service buying copper is not only a nice idea it's a great idea because you can post images with a copper account but you already have enough activity to rank up you only need one merit with the majority of your post on bounty, you will struggle to get one.It is better to formalize your thread like all the other reputable campaign managers here to attract clients.",

I think any forum member or crypto projects will only think to ask help from someone who has contributed in the forum and have a good track record of working with others.Copper membership may help to showcase your previous work but you still need a good rank and reputation.",
