      "body": "please use one of your existing topics about 2009... and remember we have already told you that no one cared to invest in 2009. it was not even considered a currency in 2009 it was a tester coin to bugfix any issues as the main mindset of 2009. in 2010 people thought of it as a currency and later years as an investment assetyou seem to be trying to be lazy about research, you can easily get all answer by using google in a 10 second search.. yet you keep creating new topics to ask the same questionso please put your questions about your dreamed up scenario of 2009 in one of your existing topics about 2009 scenarioas for your lack of knowledge of the meaning of OTC. it simply means a private direct trade outside of a public exchange platformso please use google to ask your question first, then use one of your existing topics to ask these silly dream scenario questions about made up trades happening in 2009everything was peer to peer in bitcoin thats how transactions happen. as for the communications to make the deal(talk about the terms) well that was mainly this forum and IRCyou are starting to become very obvious that you are lazy and just wanting people to fill in the gaps of buzzwords you want to use in some dream scenario. which is starting to sound like you want to create some mythical story that you are some early adopter that has billions of $$ of coin right now from a 2009 event you want to pretend to be involved in, that you want to sell to someone.. by the way you are not the first person to act this way and end up being a scammer telling a story based on the silly questions he asked to gain the right verb-age to use to con someone.. your persistence in your myth, fantasy, thoughts of a 2009 transaction occuring is blatantly obvious",
