  "content": "Seeing there's a nice raffle for an Arculus wallet, I've done a tiny bit of research on what this wallet is.. and I have more questions than answers So maybe somebody who has seen this wallet can tell more / enlighten me.I've seen on youtube that this wallet is basically a plastic card with NFC chip. It works with their proprietary wallet software. You have to have the NFC and the wallet software connected in order to work for the important operation. The wallet software creates the 12 words seed the user has to write down for backup. ... And here my questions come.Since this is meant to be secure... I'm lost.Is the Arculus card a hardware wallet and that's the one generating the seed? Or it only provides some sort of 13th word?Will the 12 word seed work also with Electrum without Arculus card (as it should)? Then I find it incredibly unsafe to show the seed on the smartphone app (am I mistaking?)Will the 12 word seed work only with Arculus card and their software? Then the user is tied to their proprietary software and hardware and may be a problem if the company disappears.Thoughts?",

Not that I care about trying it or buying this hardware wallet, but the app might be tricked into believing you are in the US with a quality US VPN. Unless, of course, you also have to undergo KYC before you can use it.  Sounds bad anyway you put it.",

But then, with the US limitation and closed source too (clearly, these two go together).. I don't see any usefulness of this device.Thanks though for the answer.My dilemma was cleared, thank you all for the answers, I'll lock the topic now.",
