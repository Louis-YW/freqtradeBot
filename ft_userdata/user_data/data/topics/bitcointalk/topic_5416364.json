Yes, some mayor announcement will influence the price, but these smaller announcements hardly make an impact. There are BTC Whales and large mine owners that are manipulating the BTC price, so these small announcements will simply be swept over with some small sell and or buy orders.     In any way..... a lot of the statistics are not an actual indication of what is happening in many countries.. because that is manipulated too...",

Also, the inflation rate is going to be updated on October 13. Usually, with decrease in unemployment rate, inflation rate increases and that's not a good sign for the markets.",

Continuation of monetary policy and the rise in interest equations that will make the expansion of the economy discouraging.Energy problems and the temptation of high interest.Decline in the unemployment rate should be an indicator globally and in several countries to indicate the end of the recession.What I can confirm is that there is no direct correlation between the bitcoin price and macroeconomic indicators.",

It would affect the market positively if we see numbers like 1-2% or less for that matter. We are talking about unemployment here so definitely the least it is the better it is for the nation. There is whole cycle that contributes here for example, salaries, with salaries goes TDS, professional taxes, we shop, pay, the taxes are levied and much more. Obviously this is gonna affect everything on the long run. However, current market going down because of other situation in the world. Which we already discussed ever since.",

Let is watch and see if more jobs are getting created and how it impacts the economy.Dont try to link every news to market movements, the second has a mind of its own. The effect or negative news is defenitely there but currently there are a lot more things happening out there such that a positive news can have a correctional effect.",

Yes, it has a good impact on the US economy but it has nothing to do with the price of Bitcoin. It could only affect a single country's economy but not the global situation. There are still huge occurrences that affect the blockvhain market which we cannot control which includes the continuous rise of inflation.",

Moreover, don't blindly believe any informations from the government because they are prone to be manipulated for political reasons.As I see jobs' rates aren't increasing, while purchasing power is fastly decreasing with the economical politics adopted by governments in US and Europe which increase interest rates in a desperate and useless attempt to control inflation.",

Not only that, I'm not sure if bitcoin correlates strongly with anything except maybe the stock market--and I haven't seen any data on that.  Stocks fell pretty hard yesterday, and I'm pretty sure the big players on Wall Street don't put a huge amount of weight on a small change in unemployment numbers, which were good to begin with.Bitcoin has been trading sideways for a while now, in the $18-21k range and it looks like it's just waiting to break out in one direction or another.  I'm sure a lot of us have seen that happen a few times before, and if my memory serves me correctly the last time BTC broke out of a sideways state it shot up to its ATH.  I'm hoping whenever we do see some price action it isn't going to be in a downward trajectory--that would be really bad, because it'd take a long time to get back to $63k (I think that's the ATH).  Keeping my fingers crossed.",

That's scary because usually when people lose their jobs, they have to sell their assets. That means the market should be up ahead of December, but that's not happening too much anymore.Will robots take over? This is not a bad thing if we think about it, However, there is no denying that some jobs are being threatened. At least at this time instead of replacing jobs due to outsourcing.",

It feels like we're at the point where everything is just running on fumes and is very shortly about to fall off a cliff. The economy has been doing all kinds of crazy things but was severely upset after Russia invaded Ukraine - damaging the prospects of both countries. Ukraine exported very many raw materials and Russia was a large supply of oil & gas. This jacked up prices and has been hard to balance back out in the short term.",

A lower unemployment rate indicates higher inflation and means that employment is not impacted. So, the Federal Reserve is more likely to continue raising interest rates.A rising interest rate ...1. reduces demand for non-income-producing assets.2. lowers the net present value of an asset.3. causes a stronger dollar and lowers the value of assets when measured in dollars.These three effects of rising interest rates cause the price of a bitcoin to fall.",

Usually companies will only reduce their staff if they want immediate relief of operating cost. It allows them to retain their employees till the last the minute, despite what the GDP report says. So, it's economic recession, then a rise in unemployment. The market can react independent of these factors, but will generally use these factors in their assessment. It's not a rule.Unemployment rate fell modestly for now, but the next 6 months would be the data that I would look for if I want to make inferences about the U.S. economy's state. Clearly the market thinks that we're in for a tumultuous time so they know something the stats don't tell us.",
