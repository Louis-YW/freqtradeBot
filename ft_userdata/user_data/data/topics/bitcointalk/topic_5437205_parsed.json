In my opinion, corrupt people are always covered in anxiety, for fear of being found out by their superiors. But do you think when someone becomes corrupt, will he be happy or miserable in the future?What I see in my country is corrupt people never feel regret or pain, instead, they are very happy, living a life many people dream of. There were also corrupt people arrested but they did not regret having brought wealth to their families, they are willing to go to jail as long as their families are well off. Quote from: Hispo on January 30, 2023, 01:02:03 AMRegardless how they feel internally, all of them should be put in jail, as law usually states.  But the most corrupt are the most powerful, so imprisoning them is what we want, but it won't happen. Nowadays, corruption has become a culture, it is rampant, and we hate corrupt people because we are not like them. Honestly, I believe that if we have the opportunity to be corrupt, we are no different from them.",

But do you think when someone becomes corrupt, will he be happy or miserable in the future?Corruption doesn't only happen in government because it is prevalent in every area of the society. There is even corruption in religious institution that is generally percieved as clean or free from corruption. There is also corruption in the educational sector because students cheat in examination, while teachers collect bribe to give student undeserved grades. There is corruption is sports where match fixing and bribery is popular. We even heard the news of corruption in FIFA.  But corruption in government is the most popular because elections are won via corrupt means and this would lead to the institutionalization of corruption.These days the government protect corrupt officials from prosecution, that is why most of them are not scared or afraid. But the truth is that you cannot cheat nature. Whatever you sow in life you must also reap. Some of these corrupt individuals end up miserable maybe because of sickness or other misfortune. Some of them give birth to wayward children that engage in criminal activities or become addicts to either drugs, women or gambling.",

No body will be miserable in the future for being corrupt. Just that it's against mankind, funds that's made for public use are being convert to private use.

People get away with it until the end of time, despite their religious beliefs. Corruption is not solely the fault of government leaders or rulers; it is a disease that has already infected the minds of many people today. People are corrupt from a young age because they are exposed to a corrupt environment and cannot escape it even when they reach adulthood, and this pattern continues. I don't believe that corruption can be eliminated entirely, but it can be reduced to a manageable level.",

But do you think when someone becomes corrupt, will he be happy or miserable in the future?This is a very interesting topic to talk about, Corruption is always going to destroy the future of our children. When someone is corrupt means they are just thinking about just how to make their self-happy at that particular point in time without thinking about the negativity that it will cause in time to come, they just put their happiness first without thinking of the damages that it will cause in the future. Most people realized the damages they have caused with their action later in future but by then, it is already too late because there is nothing that they can do to change what has already been done.",

People who are corrupt might be safe and live comfortable because they are in high positions or have superiors that backs them up,but I know that deep down in their heart,they feel guilty because sometimes,they are been hunt by their evil deeds.Most of them end up living a miserable life,they there is a change in government,and the new government spotted them out,there will be no option but to put them in jail. The bible tells us that, 'there will be no peace for the wicked' and the word of God must come to pass. There is a man in my country,when he was in power,he looted the country's fund without doing anything. After he left,he was trying to fix things up in the country to stop corruption,but it was all in vain because when he was able to change the system,instead he saw it as a smart idea to loot.",

But do you think when someone becomes corrupt, will he be happy or miserable in the future?I also think it's important to evaluate the consequences of corruption. When someone is corrupt, they injure not only themselves, but also others. They take advantage of others who are less powerful, or they divert resources that could have been utilized to aid others. So they are not only destroying their own mental health and inner life, but they are also endangering the lives of others. I believe it is apparent that corruption does not lead to real pleasure, either for the individual or society as a whole. So, even if a corrupt person is able to earn worldly wealth, they would still lack these key values. As a result, their lives would be unsatisfactory and unhappy.",
