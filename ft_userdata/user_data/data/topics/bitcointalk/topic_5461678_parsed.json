  "content": "You know how good ublock origin is? It is a good ads blocker, but only for desktop. On my phone, I have only been using the ads blocker on my browsers which are helpful, but I want to know if there is any ad blocker that is very common on phone, free and effective to block ads too. Is there any trustworthy mobile ads blocker?Although I like my browser ads blocker, some sites with ads do not allow me to visit their site unless I turn off my browser ads blocker. I do not think two times to leave sites like that.",
