Price? Availability?",

      "body": "It's not just a Bitcoin node. It's a whole digital solution for all your data, messaging apps, and connections. It supposedly works as a smart home assistant as well judging by the website. The site says the device comes with 2 SSD drives but doesn't mention the sizes. There is also a battery that helps power the box in case of power outages. It would be interesting to know how much juice the battery can provide.  They have a GitHub repository, so I guess everything is based on open-source technology, but they don't mention that anywhere on their website. They claim to have been connected to the Cypherpunk movement, and describe themselves as privacy advocates.",

But i wonder how small is their demographic target since people who wish to buy expensive computer probably would just buy custom PC, Apple device or device from other popular brand.I don't get why they don't just use much cheaper ARM chipsets, that can deliver the same power as an x86 processor from 5 years ago. If they're being used everywhere in Android phones, it shouldn't be too hard to obtain a batch from some manufacturer.",
