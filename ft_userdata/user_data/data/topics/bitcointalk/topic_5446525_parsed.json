I hope you are not looking for the scam mining software programs that lie that one can easily mine coins using their browsers or an app on a mobile phone, and yet they are just malware programs.You asked a similar question in the Bitcoin mining board.The forum is rich with necessary information. You just have to use the forum such button or tools like ninjastic.space to search up the information you want.",

Asic has a web interface where you set up the desired pool, coin and run asics. There is ASIC array management software to manage hundreds or thousands of ASICs with a single command, but I think this is not your case.For graphics cards, I prefer HiveOS and RaveOS. For Windows for beginners, NiceHash is suitable, although I recommend learning Linux systems right away.You do not need to download new miners and risk downloading viruses. Developers check all new versions of miners and constantly update their software.",
