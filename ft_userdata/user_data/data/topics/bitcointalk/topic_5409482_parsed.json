  "content": "Hello, everyone! I have looked out for good security advice for coins recently and Bitcointalk appeared often, when I searched about it, where useful advice was given, so I registered here now because it was very helpful for me. Last year, I got some coins for free from different DeFi (decentralized finance) applications and I did some research about Alt Coins, wrote a few summary about my research on Altcoins Talks and Crypto Talk, but did not have much time for Crypto since it was very low in value, what I received for free. I have already sent all my coins recently to a paper wallet because hot wallets are risky, it has been said and it makes sense. Exchange can be hacked because of hot wallets and when it’s an offline wallet, it can't be hacked because it's offline. Hacker will not be possible to get your private key.All my private key is noted offline and safe. My owned coins are not much but I don’t want to be hacked. For more understanding of Blockchain, I signed up here because I was reading more about Blockchain Technology recently and it is very interesting. Ofcourse, I'm not a coder but I'm interested to learn more about it and get more knowledge of Bitcoin and Blockchain. Bitcoin is a very technical issue and it needs some time to read it completely, from good sources. From what I was reading, Bitcoin has a unique feature called Halving every 4 years or after some defined amount of issued blocks. It makes Bitcoin different from Alt Coin. Halving was, when I really learned why Bitcoin will be huge. Bitcoin is highly valuable and when more people realize it, it will be huge. I like new tech very much and education about it is important. So, it is my text here, I might ask some questions later and also share my findings here from recently and last year. Education about crypto is very important. Greetings from BangkokPhu",

That's good that you've gone with a paper wallet, instead of something that you don't have the private key too, and is online. However, paper wallets aren't a guaranteed way of keeping your coins safe by default. It's how you handle the generation, and the storage of it. While, you definitely do keep your attack vectors less limited than a online wallet, there's still security considerations you should be giving time too. For example, are you storing it securely enough from physical threats, and that's not just thieves, but fire/water hazards. Out of curiosity how did you generate your private key? Was it with Electrum or Bitcoin Core, or did you go with another method? The reason I ask is there's plenty of pitfalls for newcomers to fall into if they don't quite understand the security implications of using non open source software or using a online generator to generate their private key.",

The reason I ask is there's plenty of pitfalls for newcomers to fall into if they don't quite understand the security implications of using non open source software or using a online generator to generate their private key. From my coins, it is not Bitcoin unfortunately because I got all my coins for free and my value is very low of 70$ currently, which is not much for most first country ppl but here it is quite some value and exchanging it would mean some losses at such a low amount but I’m really trying to get Bitcoin one day. Bitcoin is very hard to get but also very valuable. Electrum seems to be a very established wallet for Bitcoin. When I get some Bitcoin, i will use Electrum for transfers. I’ve read about Bitcoin Core, too but it’s a full node wallet and requires better tech? My current private keys are generated on my old laptop by MEW, which is always offline ofcourse because some known coders have made a detailed GitHub review how to do it and more experts have agreed on it. A big advantage of MEW is it can be used also for Altcoins like Binance Coin or Avalanche Coin because of same technology. Right now, I have only 70$ but MEW offline seemed to be a good sulution.  Software was open source from official MEW GitHub.",

Your security advice is very important because of hackers, I'm always trying to avoid hackers. About Altcoin you are veeery right. I have done a detailed research about bad Altcoins like Tron, Ripple or Binance coin, which don't have a very good technology and many flaws. Last year, I have written a detailed text about it how to spot and avoid such centralized Alt Coins. Technology behind a coin is very important, where Bitcoin is strongest from what experts have said.",

I have read your linked articles now and some are really good for education. Let me make a few comments on it: Becoming a Blockchain Developerhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5390254.msg59560949#msg59560949It is a very technical topic and because it's targeting coder's education and I’m not a coder, it is above my understanding here, Sir. Ppl need a special education in coding to understand code, especially Blockchain code because Blockchain needs a very good code to prevent abuse. [Infographics] What is Blockchain and How does it work?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5144421.0A very good and graphic explanation of Blockchain basics like hash, blocks and block connection. Understanding Blockchain - A Guide for Beginnershttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4382304.0It is a really good essay about Blockchain in general and a very good read. Important parts why Blockchain is innovative and how Blockchain is achieving it are presented and outlined. Blockchain is really bringing innovation and progress and many coins are building on it.  But it seems to be just a copy paste text? Blockchain related education resourceshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4881231.0It is mostly a link collection from coder sources and from academic research, when people are going to study computer scientist? So, most of it is not possible to understand for normal people. Overally, I can see many good content is presented here and we can pick, what is important for us, when we need research.",

It is true that myetherwallet wallet is used mostly for storing tokens or erc20 tokens that uses Ethereum network and also for coin like Ethereum which is a coin. So you might want to know that it is not just for coin as cryptoaddictchie said that myetherwallet is designed for altcoins. I also use myetherwallet when I was participating in ICO on 2018. Though myetherwallet shows the balance of your tokens or coin but it is not what it seems to be unless you put it in an exchange.",

It is true that myetherwallet wallet is used mostly for storing tokens or erc20 tokens that uses Ethereum network and also for coin like Ethereum which is a coin.I agree, Ethereum is also good coin. It’s number 2 behind Bitcoin. Quote from: Munir575 on August 27, 2022, 06:09:02 PMThis is the right place to learn about bitcoin, this forum will provide you with the all necessary guidance about bitcoin and blockchain technology. I think bitcoin is the only crypto coin worth investing in because it has the potential to be bigger in the coming years. You can ask questions wherever you are not clear. You are right, experts are very positive about Bitcoin because Bitcoin’s developers are really good coders. Compared to Altcoins, Bitcoin has also a limited number of Bitcoins, while many Altcoins have inflation and not a limited number of coins. Quote from: The Cryptovator on August 27, 2022, 07:15:32 PMIf you are concerned about your funds then a hardware wallet is preferable. It's more secure than a paper wallet or host wallet. Yea, the forum is the right place to learn about crypto and its security. A lot of things here to learn. I believe you will be a good contributor to the forum.Yes, I have read about it and luckily not bought one because of Hardware wallet Ledger’s hack. Many people were affected and one more reason to avoid centralized companies.  And Bitcointalk is a very big forum. I believe, we can find many helpful information for different topics. I have also done some research. Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on August 27, 2022, 07:53:26 PMWelcome to the forum phu, I do hope you enjoy every bit of the forum and all it offers.Hello, Sir! People were already very nice and helpful and I’m looking forward to more contributions. In opposite to Altcoinstalk, where I have written a few posts last year from DeFi reviews, people are much more educated here. For example, some Tron an Binance Coin shills were active on Altcointalks, talking nonsense. Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on August 27, 2022, 07:53:26 PMThis forum is where Bitcoin started, and as such, it houses every single information, educational content, anything at all that has to do with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.I have seen Satoshis contributions but most of it is too technical because I’m not a coder. Some people have already linked important topics, where research was done and I will copy it into my Word document, Sir. Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on August 27, 2022, 07:53:26 PMI have this personal belief that every user on this forum is in bitcoins history, as bitcointalk is not just another cryptocurrency forum, but a very very important part of Bitcoin's history, when discussing the history of bitcoin, that discussion is never complete without a mention of bitcointalk.Bitcoin’s history is an important point for Bitcoin. And it is amazing to see how Satoshi Nakamoto has coded a very good coin, a coin of good competition. Bitcoin has many features, where Satoshi was very good and looking forward. Like Bitcoin’s limited supply of 21000000 coins. Satoshi knew, people will like it to own a scarce asset. It is really impressive and still today Bitcoin is leading and likely to stay leading because many Altcoins have flaws and Altcoin developers could not weed out such flaws.

I will use a safe paper wallet and follow coders advice for now because I’m not a coder myself, for example, I’m not active on GitHub. Some people have also recommended coldkeys, which is a nice collectible I have heard from but it’s not available here. I have also heard to stay away from KYC because it is very dangerous, similar to Ledger’s hack. I have already done some research which Exchanges have no KYC and I would support such Exchanges. Because Uniswap is a very good Exchange but it’s only allow Ethereum Coin to Ethereum Tokens or Ethereum Tokens to Ethereum Coins or Ethereum Tokens to different Ehereum Tokens. So it is only Ethereum based. Maybe bear market now is a good chance to find some more coins anywhere. Do you have any free and profitable giveaways on Bitcointalk?",
