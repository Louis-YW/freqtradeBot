I have money in crypto but right now I cant convert it into fiat.Can anyone help me to buy those softwares in fiat? I can pay in crypto with 25 dollars extra. Dealing with trusted members only and I can pay first. You can create a login id and password and do the payment with fiat and can erase all card or paypal details and hand over the account details to me. After that I will change the password of the account. If anyone is willing to help me , please message me.",

I will suggest you mention the cost of those items, so that any prospective helper will beforehand know how much is to be spent and see if they can afford it ~ rather than them having to pm you first to know.And secondly,  also state categorically which coin you are going to be paying in, are you going to be paying in Bitcoin? I guess so since this service board is reserved for only Bitcoin paying services ~but still make it categorically clear.The above suggestions, I believe will help you find people that are will to help faster ~ this is if what you are asking for is possible anyway.",

Op wants to convert that into fiat but I think (which op wanted to say) has not available payment method. I think the site where the payment should be sent accept something like credit card/paypal which op has not.",
