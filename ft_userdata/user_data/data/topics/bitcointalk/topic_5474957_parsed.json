I do not like sport generally again too because the odds are low but some bettors prefer it saying they can analyze it more than casinos games but I prefer casinos now because of the better odds to chances of winning or losing.",

When you watch how Messi dribbles, how can you not love this sport? When you watch how CB gives ball to DMF, then DMF to AMF, then AMF to Right Forward, then throws to Left Forward, then there is the goal, it's amazing. I just love it because it's amazing to watch how these top players do magic on the field.Quote from: yahoo62278 on November 21, 2023, 07:20:13 PMWhich football are you referring to?

We Europeans call football to football and not soccer, that's an American term. Football also describes game football in other languages too, in German it's Fußball, in French it's le football, in Spanish it's de fútbol. Only Americans call soccer to football. American football is more like rugby than real football.Sorry, I just can't agree with you on that word.",

Casual fans or people who aren't interested in the game may not be able to provide an accurate answer. I believe that the best way to get a clear answer to this question is to speak to someone who truly enjoys the game and has a deep understanding of it. Everyone has a desire sport game that they consider their favourite and dislike the others, and only that person who loves it or dislikes it can give a direct reason for that. Sometimes there is really no reason, but it's just something of a passion. For example, I like football games more than other forms of sport, and my hatred for restyling and boxing can't even be linked to anything else. If you ask me why I like watching football, I still can't pinpoint the exact reason. It's just something that I find entertaining and enjoyable. Some people may say that they like watching football because of the rivalry between fans and anti-fans of certain clubs, but that's not my primary motivation. It's just something I enjoy watching.",

So there are quite some points here .https://www.besoccer.com/new/amp/football-popularity-why-is-football-crucial-today-1270235IMO football has lifted so many families out of poverty and including countries. For example hosting football tournament boost some country's economy because of the monies that will be generated from different sources to the economy and to individuals. It creates jobs.Winning the world cup is such a big financial reward. Countries like Brazil that has won the FIFA world cup 5 times have had such inflow generated to their economy.Regards to bringing individuals out of poverty, I believe football has direct positive impact to families who have produced players playing the round leather game. And in fact this is a great love showers to football and families who don't have children playing the game have also tried to have a member of their family playing the game because of the love and money that is generated from it.It has such a great value because amongst other reasons, it is accessible to all.",

If we are in the same page and we are talking about soccer football then I think this is the reason. In 90 minutes of game, one goal can decide the whole game. And that's what so interesting about it. You know every player, even all of their moves you know their current status and performance and yet anything can happen in the game. A great example can be the recent world cup and the winning team Argentina. They were performing so good before entering the world cup with the record of 36 wins. And after joining the world cup they lost to Saudi Arabia. And even with this, they have won the final. Isn't that fascinating. I'm a big fan of soccer maybe that's why I'm saying all this. It's not the same for everyone. So this is how I feel.",

In my opinion, football with a good knowledge about a particular league you have interest in it's easy to analyze and from an indepth analysis you can have a bigger chance of winning your bets than casino games that re purely luck based. Another personal opinion is about how the game of football doesn't require many instruments to have the play started, what you just need is the ball and players just go on having their fun playing it on an open space. Unlike other sports that requires as a necessity some instruments to be available before the play can kick off, example is hockey, table tennis ND the rest.",

Many people have had clubs in their neighborhood that they support since small children. So there really is no wonder that football is the most famed sport, at least in Europe. But as you know, each region has its own favorite sport. For some countries it's cricket, for others its rugby, for the USA it balances between Basketball and NFL or sometimes baseball.But really in Europe Football reigns supreme most of the time. It really ties back to how most people grew up, with it being the most accessible sport nearby them, and getting to love their local association.",

Because the audience can see the excitement of a football game, such as when they see players passing each other to the euphoria of a goal which causes quite loud cheers. Moreover, if you watch football while betting, the sensation and challenge will increase. But remember when we make that bet, we have to be prepared to lose money and be willing to accept defeat. And also when placing a bet, never act carelessly by guessing carelessly, because when placing a sports bet you must go through a thorough analysis first.",

More people watch football than any other sport in the world.Nothing else comes close to the appeal that football has.  Super Bowl Pales in Comparison to the Biggest Game in SoccerWhile Americans are getting ready for what they consider the biggest sporting event of the year, the 57th Super Bowl, the rest of the world couldn’t care less. Well that may be a bit harsh, but from an American perspective it’s easy to overestimate the global appeal of the biggest game in (American) football.Speaking of football, soccer, i.e. the proper kind of football from a European perspective, far exceeds the Super Bowl in terms of global interest. The FIFA World Cup Final, played every four years to culminate a month-long tournament of 32 nations, really is the biggest game in the world, regularly reaching more than a billion people across the globe.According to FIFA, the 2018 World Cup final between France and Croatia reached an average live audience of 517 million viewers, with more than than 1.1 billion people tuning in over its 90 minutes. The Qatar 2022 final reached almost 1.5 billion people according to preliminary figures, while the average live audience of Argentina's spectacular win over France has yet to be determined. The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world.https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/16875/super-bowl-viewership-vs-world-cup-final/",

In basketball, the game is predominantly littered with Americans who claim they are \"the world champions\" when they only won national competitions. Prejudice against certain races are also prevalent in this sport. With Chess, there's a certain air of elitism that prevents the average people from appreciating the sport and the competition, not to mention the fact that the game's so tense that if you didn't pick up Chess from when you're a kid, you literally stand no chance against the current state of the game. Football on the other hand, is for everyone, literally. You got countries setting up their own leagues, and then international tournaments that are indiscriminate of any race and are supportive of whoever wins. We got loyal fans that are both degenerate in fanaticism, and while the sport's got its downsides, the ups make up for it so much that the whole football community's willing to overlook these.",
