Both of your low-value, no-effort threads are still there. They are in the Altcoin Discussion board.You seem to lack knowledge of how some of the forum features work like the \"See replies to your posts\" feature. But apparently, the admins are at fault for that as well. After being proven wrong, can you admit you made a mistake by shooting at the admins and asking them questions later? Or is this a quiet admission of guilt?",

It would also cast the moderators in bad light. That would simply mean that someone is trying hard to stifle free speech here. People have a right to air their views and be expectedly heard. The only nag in this is that OP was hasty in their conclusion as it brought them to the wrong action of falsely accusing mods. As has been explained to the OP that their thread wasn't deleted but moved to the appropriate section of the forum, it would be expected now that this thread be locked as it has served its usefulness to the fullest.OP, kindly lock this thread or ask the mods to do so.",
