  "content": "Out of every 10 people in El Salvador who got the government's special bitcoin wallet called Chivo, only 4 people still use it after getting $30 worth of bitcoin as a reward from President Nayib Bukele's government. This info comes from a report by a group in the U.S. who look at economics.The report says, \"Most people who used Chivo after they got the $30 bonus don't keep using the app a lot.\" They talked to 1,800 grown-ups in El Salvador in February to find out.The report also mentions that 6 out of 10 people stopped using the Chivo wallet after getting the bitcoin reward. If you want to know more, you can watch a video to see what Salvadorans think about bitcoin being legal money.In the EDIT part, the person suggests that instead of just giving $30 when someone signs up for the wallet, the money should be given after someone finishes a task, like learning something on the app. This way, people can learn and get money.If a government intends to make cryptocurrency an accepted form of money, how do you believe they should encourage and motivate the public to use it regularly?",
