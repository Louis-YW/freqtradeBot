So for now it is associated with creating completely useless shittokens and scamming people using the shitplatform known as ethereum!!! I don't see anything changing as long as token creating platforms aren't being developed seriously in a truly decentralized way.BTW this is not the first over-hyped mechanism they've used to revive ETH price though. They keep changing the name of the scamming method and continue their ways: ICO, IDO, IBO, IEO, ITO, STO, DeFi, NFT are the existing ones, each deader than the other.",

Comparing Defi with ICO is like comparing a high-speed train with a horse carriage. When one is getting more innovative day by day other one just fades away for not being so innovative. While having a bank account from opening till using it can take several days, your grandma can use a defi application without any hassle. You can do everything that a bank can do with less energy and time consumption, less fees. It's not like the use case has been shifted towards something more innovative. After so many Defi hack, exploit, and rugg pull we are still here and people are using it. That means there are still so many uses in defi and people find it convenient for them to use it. It is not going to fade away at least if there isn't anything more secure and user-friendly than the current Defi application and services.",

So whatever how good the technology is but if the scamming is rampant due to greedy devs take advantage of the hype then all of it will became nothing since people might avoid if they notice that there's no good things they can get from investing since scamming is always happening just like the ICO's happened before.",

DeFi is a mess because it has a model that promises you profit, APYs that are usually good in their White papers.If you have good basic knowledge about finance, you will realize a hidden fact. They only can give you APYs if the balance between cash inflow and cash outflow, capital in and capital out of their DeFi platform is positive. When the balance is negative, APYs will vanish in the air.With DeFi, you will have risk of impermanent loss as well.[DeFi Tutorial] What is Impermanent Loss?",

Op welcome to the Bitcoin Forum...Coming to the point brother it is very strange to me that you are directly linking the DeFi with the so-called defi project and their shit coins, buddy I want to let you know that DeFi is known for its services, availability, and decentralization not by their utility tokens and shit schemes. Be careful while taking it into account, DeFi is in my view one of the best dimensions of the crypto space.It is noting cover from anyone how helpful defi can be in any sort of situation, let's take an example of simple loan service, here from the bank if you want any sort of small loan as well, you need to do a lot of paper working not you have to provide the statement and blah blah other requirements.",
