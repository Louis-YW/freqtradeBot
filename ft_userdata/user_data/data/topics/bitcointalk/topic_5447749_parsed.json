This will affect a lot of Indians who have used it as an alternative to a local exchange. There are still other platforms like hodlhodl, Agoradesk, and localcoinswap that can be used as an alternative to Paxful.",

Still, Paxful is allowing its users to withdraw funds whereas LocalBitcoin stopped allowing that too after sometime.

If he needs his money then he will need to pass KYC. You can ask  or you can yourself raise a Exit scam topic on Paxful, on the same board. It won't help him but it will create an awareness among members who still have blind faith on exchanges. There have been so many cases like the one your friend is facing in the past.

The dashboard of Noones is same as Paxful. I wonder if they have the same owner or not. I belive yes! I will try this one as they also have KYC verification and I will make sure not to trade with a non-verified user. Let's see if I get success there. I will share my experience here. Another option I see is Binance p2p but I assume they have partnered with WazirX in India so all transactions are going to be reported. Can anyone confirm this?Binance p2p actually has good offers and obviously the KYC verification process but not sure if they are going to report the transactions or not. Any guidance will be appreciated.",
