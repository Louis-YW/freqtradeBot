To be honest, I myself am not interested and have an interest in investing in NFTs.It seems that the trend of NFTs has recently disappeared and the demand for them is decreasing. Even if there are investors who hold NFTs, maybe it's because they haven't been able to sell them and have already experienced an automatic price drop, inevitably investors have to keep them.Actually there are many new NFT projects that can be entered but I'm not really following them now.",

I would love to see and look into them. If you're still into NFTs, my tip is that just go with those establishments-based NFTs that have been generated by them and not just by random kiddo on the web that has generated millions of it already.At least with a company-backed NFT, you may not know the future of it but they might have some plans on it like an actual use case of having it as a basis for their discounts and stuff.",

If you are still interesting you can check them out as @Adbitco mentioned in CMC. Gaming NFT might be huge if popular gaming companies implement them, right now i do not see any.",

Which means that there is a chance it may not end up being as high as it used to be and that's what I believe will happen.I believe that the best thing to do right now would be making sure that it's going well and in order to do that you could keep the NFT's you have and not buy any more new ones. If you hold the ones you have that means it's going to end up with a good profit when the bull comes, but not going to risk anything in the long future.",

      "body": "I'm currently interested in NFT on Solana. Despite what you may have heard, Solana still has a thriving NFT community. Most of the NFTs I collect have no utility, they're just JPEGs so I'm not gonna mention that  If you're interested in projects with some utility, I can point you to a few of the top projects:ABC. This collection is set to receive $HADES, the governance token for Hadeswap (the biggest NFT AMM in Solana).Famous Fox Federation. FFF is one of the NFT collections made for famousfoxes.com. The website offers various utility services such as a token market, NFT raffle, and token distributor. FFF holders indirectly benefit from the fees generated by these services through weekly missions and monthly holder raffles.Sharx. Sharx is the utility NFT for sharky.fi, an NFT lending platform. There are no details yet, but I believe Sharx holders will receive a share of the fees generated from the lending platform.@OP, which blockchain are you currently using actively for NFT, and what collections do you have? I would also like to hear about it.",
