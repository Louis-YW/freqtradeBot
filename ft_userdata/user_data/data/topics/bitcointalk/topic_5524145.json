The Trump-Russia link that's been speculated - does this prove it or is this just some variant causality at work?What about countries that don't want btc? I know some of them still mark all kinds of crypto as illegalDoes that mean oil will now be tagged to BTC like 0.0004 BTC to the Barrel to generate more revenue as the coin goes up?",

The interest of entire countries in bitcoin as a way to bypass sanctions and make cross-border payments between countries means only one thing: if bitcoin is used at such a high level, then at a lower level (ordinary citizens) bitcoin will not be allowed to be used. This will inevitably lead to bans and criminal prosecution for using bitcoin by ordinary citizens. The use of bitcoin in foreign trade will undoubtedly lead to an increase in cost, but also, in the long term, will lead to a decrease in the \"freedom\" of bitcoin as a means of p2p payments. In a country in which, for centuries, there is a \"good old\" tradition of 1st taking everything from private property, and then \"evenly\" distributing it among the top bosses, one can hardly expect a different fate for bitcoin. Outside this country, the use of bitcoin in foreign trade will be a positive factor, but inside it will be negative.",

Many nations are fearful that they will be treated badly when Trump returns to the White House and even with future Presidents of the USA. BRICS sounds promising but its potentiality to succeed is unknown or even vague and some nations don't want to hope too high with BRICS' currency and de-dollarization. Two biggest examples are India and Saudi Arabia, they are like two-faced in policies but if they smell that BRICS won't succeed, they will quickly turn over to US. dollar again.It's easier and more beneficial for them to turn back to US. dollar, no harm with them by leaving this ambitious project that has unknow chance of success.",

This just proves that sanctions can now effectively be circumvented and there are little repercussions for countries or entities to be engaging in crimes against humanity. I think this is a good time to rethink how we can better approach the global issues since sanctions are obviously not as helpful as it seems.I'm not condoning censorship, but I find it difficult to imagine that it is a positive news since the whole idea about Bitcoin being censorship-free hasn't really been the top priority of most people.",

The benefits are enormous and many countries are going to be benefitted out of it. Most importantly, it will further devalue USD by allowing the countries to ditch the usual USD route and trade freely without the fear of any sanctions from US. It's lovely to hear! The world needs balance and Bitcoin can surely bring in that balance by not allowing one big country to dominate others. The balance of financial power is needed in today's world.

That means BRICS members using bitcoin to avoid sanctions or reduce their dependence on the USD will not avoid sanctions from the United States either. Not to mention, Russia is the only country that accepts bitcoin, while China has even completely banned bitcoin in the country. So that really begs the big question?Many people are excited about this news and believe that this will help bitcoin become more popular but I am not so sure about that. To me, the US is still a superpower and they can do more than we think, and countries like Russia using bitcoin to confront them is not a good thing.",
