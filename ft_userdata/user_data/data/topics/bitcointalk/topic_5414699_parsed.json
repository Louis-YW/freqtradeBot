Greed? See I made my biggest gains from tokens that are shit projects, today they have less than 10,000$ volume available, almost dead and some people are still caught in the trap, why? Are people getting married to their altcoin bags?",

And for those projects that have been hyped by influencers, people should be double careful with them. Because these influencers are paid to advertise those projects without even looking if it's legitimate or not to their audience.",

And maybe could have bite that hype from crypto influencers and they but it pushed the price to that huge numbers. But I'm shaking my heads on how much people lose here and on the other hand, those who took advantage of it, bank it early and never look back.

Calling it as a hidden gem is quite strange for me. What will you do with it? did you wanna bet on it? I meant it's not any dumped token will be pretty much the same like luna. Luna was different case but any tokens that were dumping to the zero value can be considered as a dead token for sure. In my opinion if you must aware about this too.",

It's a horse racing \"game\" where you can earn $VIS. It was really hyped on my country late January-February because you can earn almost $20 per day and that is more than the minimum wage here. It's NFT's peak price reached more than 2000$ and VIS token 0.25$. But now you can buy it's NFT horse for less than 1$ and its token is just 0.00011$ now.",

Â Add beyond protocol to that list, I can't believe how that project fall from ath to -100%. I lost the opportunity to join the bounty when it was launched here in the forum months back, I even had to put it on my watch list of potential project to invest on, am just glad I didn't before the ship got wrecked. Terra ust same thing, I had plans to convert some of my assets to ust and stake to take advantage of that 20% they offer but mehn was I glad I hesitate a bit.Hidden gems indeed",

Of course there are always exceptions like the one that happened with Terra that you already mentioned but that was also something very extraordinary and that event did not only bring Terra down but also the whole crypto market with it.At the top of my head i don't know any project that has experience such a sharp drop like that metaverse project that you have mentioned, but i am pretty sure that 99% from all those thousands of meme-coins (shit-coins) that came out in the last few months have gone down in value just as much.",

The bull run is a season in the crypto-currency world where coins move up fast, a lot can influence this FOMO, and even FUD. But for a coin to be considered a gem it has to also show itself approved during the Bull market. You buy coin because it did well in the bull run you may only end up like the many that are trapped in Luna and yes not only Luna many other coins that hit their all time high also fell into the mud.",

This is like a person who has a lot of gold and is thrown to the bottom of the sea.

Of course there is. Because the Luna project is not the first to do things like that. Many previous projects also did scammers. Only the way they do it is different.",
