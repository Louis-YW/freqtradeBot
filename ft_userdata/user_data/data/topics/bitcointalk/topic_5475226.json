I don't see any reserve bitcoin for such, and beside, it's a decentralised system we are talking about here, and the referral system is mostly active on a centralised platform where the owners have control over things that's happening around them.",

Bitcoin is solid and no one is in charge of controlling the whole system which makes it impossible and if I may ask who will be giving out the bonus and how. Mate buy your bitcoin through p2p and that's all. Exchanges and online financial institutions are the ones that does this because it is own by someone and they can collapse one day. Bitcoin has spoken for itself since the past 14 years because everyday the adoption increases and it is gaining more popularity.",

But there are things you have missed:* There are plenty of businesses of all kinds around bitcoin and many of them advertise themselves or sometimes, even bitcoin itself. Some as referral revenue, some by ads or posts on social media.* Every bitcoin holder (and they aren't few) knows that the more people they attract to get interested into bitcoin and become holders, the more the price will grow (not immediately, but still...) hence their investment becomes more profitable. They will advertise bitcoin \"for free\". And as example, just look at M. Saylor's posts and apparitions.* Bitcoin price has a cycle of ups and downs. When the price goes up, Bitcoin fills the newspaper pages, bringing a new wave of investors. Some will FOMO and maybe even sell cheap some years later, some will use their brains and do better, some will remain holders and will enrich the ecosystem and may advertise bitcoin themselves.Imho we are past the days we need every bit of advertising. Bitcoin is already known my media, investors, financial institutions.So no, imho it doesn't worth going on that path, not for bitcoin itself. For a new bitcoin related business, .. that's a different story.",

Exchanges are private owned companies aimed at making profits. Their referral programs is just a way of promoting their company, it has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

I’m going to rephrase your question, “Will Bitcoin adoption come faster if we had a referral system in place?” I think we would have more people interested in bitcoin but the downside of such systems is that there will be a lot of misinformation in order to get people to invest in bitcoin. As it is, there is already lots of myths and fake theories about bitcoin, we would not want to encourage any more.",

Bottom line - Bitcoin doesnt need such form of advertisements.  It's a protocol, not a product.",

Bitcoin has high value with its concept so that without promotion Bitcoin continues to grow. What bitcoin needs is time, bitcoin's lifespan is still short, the longer it lasts, the more popular it will be and the price will be more expensive. We just need to wait until it happensQuote from: Cryptomultiplier on November 23, 2023, 05:39:47 PMIs it even worth it to focus on earning by sharing referral codes?Your thoughts are welcomed!Referral codes are a business strategy so that people want to promote their business without needing to be paid up front, they will be paid if their work is successful in getting customers and the company will give a presentation on deposits made on its platform. If we are a great marketer, then sharing referral codes is a promising business because we can get sustainable income if we are able to get lots of new customers for the platform we promote through referral codes.So, technologically and popularly, bitcoin does not require a reference code because bitcoin is not a business. Those that need a referral code to increase customers are companies that use bitcoin as money or assets, such as exchanges and gambling companies. This is necessary not to promote bitcoin but to promote their platform and get more new users",

Referral codes are only for business, obviously, Bitcoin is not business as it was designed to be a payment scheme. You can argue that right now it is a assets to make money, but still though, it's very far to have that kind of referral codes just to keep it going.In the last 10 years, it has continue to market, and if you are not yet here during the last bull run, it goes as high as $69k without those \"referral codes\" that you somewhat incentives others to look for more bitcoin investors.",
