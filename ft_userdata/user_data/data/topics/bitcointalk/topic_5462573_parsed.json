If I know that I will not read the topic content, I prefer not to reply. Sometimes people also easily know what the content would be. I did not read the topic content but in 15 seconds of looking through it, I have concluded that it is about electricity issue in Nigeria and how you will prefer to use a device that will last long after full charge which makes you buy Vivo Y16. But still I prefer to read the whole post to make sure that my post is not off-topic.",

It pays to read, I mean there is benefits when we do read a thread to know what is saying about than just to summarized the whole content with just the title of the message which it doesn't show any acts of seriousness in life.",

We all know that reading is not a lazy man job and na why lazy student dey fail exam for school. When the topic no dey interesting some people no go even open am and if the content con long again without meaningful ingredients inside e go make am worse. The truth be say plenty of post for the forum no dey align with the topic at all or sometimes with little correlation between the topic and the content.Best thing is to summarize your post to make am look short and informative with attention catching topic if you are making a post. If na comment you want to make, read the topic first and you go derive ideas (assume na you want to write on that topic) read the content for more information and if possible read few comments under the post if there's any and then make your own opinion. E no dey possible to read everything but the little you read should be able to help you add something to the conversation.And again, Forum na where sentiment and agenda gather dey   you go learn to tolerate and overlook plenty things wey no add value. Some people comment na troll and discouragement full am while some na criticism and of course some na commendation too. You go train yourself to adapt. If you get the energy, you go return any similar things given to you but I go advice you to stay out of troll as someone coming up. Gradually we go all continue to grow.",

We need to forget dat saying wey be say \"don't judge a book by its cover\" because for here you can easily sight a quality or spam thread from the introduction to the thread which is the topic. Nobody owe you to read through your whole thread as discussion can be gotten from any part of the thread. No be person wey write plenty na him dey make sense, quality isn't judge from quantity. Sometime self wetin me dey use judge quality post na post wey dey bring about quality discussion from all the paragraphs of the thread. Like people fit read your title know wetin you dey write about and give him opinion, him fit still read first paragraph or your conclusion and have something to contribute. When the whole topic is filled up of quality, discussion can be gotten from everywhere. This forum no be lecture room, it's a forum used during leisure hours so no expect anybody to dey wast him precious time to read everything wey you dey write, life hard already no add to am.",
