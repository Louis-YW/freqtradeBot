The successful completion of the merge upgrade scheduled for June 2, 2022, will be key to the journey of Ethereum's transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.\"Full article HERE",

Anybody thinking of buying eth now thinking long term then look back on march 2018, we had a super pump too from 400 usd to 800 usd then manipulators dumped eth to 80 usd. So I see the same thing repeating again. The question is how low eth will go now, 3000 / 10 = 300 usd around november - january 2023? possible.",

So I see the same thing repeating again. The question is how low eth will go now, 3000 / 10 = 300 usd around november - january 2023? possible.If the tests succeed, ETH will probably hit 2500+ USD, I agree (obvious, BTC can't deep dive to - 28k)The opinions are diverging, we miners here are thinking about a huge dump mainly because ETH unlocking, but if you see on twitter and other medias, ETH users are pretty confident price will skyrocket.I'll be honest, I'm still mining, and I have some ETH to sell, but I don't know the exact price, maybe I'll push the trigger soon than I planed beforeBefore - 4,5k USD or more Now - 2,5k USDMaybe save 10% to a possible pump scenario, more than 3,5k USDQuote from: badbart on May 31, 2022, 07:03:27 PMI'm tired of the eth drama, I hope it blows up.  I think all of us are tired, I just want to know what's going to happen to make a decision to mine or not, and to stop this drama of VB and ETH",

I used to hate the Bitcoin maximalists, but now I understand where they come from. Miners have a larger say in the Bitcoin ecosystem compared to ETH. Even though I've been a GPU miner for 9 years, starting with my little Radeon HD 7850 card that did 300 Mh/s on BTC and earned $1/day, I won't feel bad about leaving ETH behind.",

But ETH 2.0 with the transit from PoW to PoS is agreeable among ETH holders and devs unless you're from the miner camp. This time is definitely different and the chance of the testnet PoS merging with the mainnet is higher than ever before so you shouldn't cite the old setback and apply it this time. Give it a few months after August would be very likely where the PoS official kick in. I already accumulate a few ETH and I think there might be another chance to accumulate ETH in the future especially if close to that day but progress is behind or some delay. FUD coming and the ETH price will drop.",

I remember a day or two before a hard fork, there was a big discovered and they had to delay it, so there was a small dump But nothing severe.Pretty sure nothing will come of this.",
