  "content": "A friend who is an upcoming crypto influencers have exposed the main goal of many crypto influencers.I am not ready to disclose him real youtube identity, for safety purposes, and please don't ask, he is a very close friend.He swore that many new projects have tried to pay him to talk about some shit coins on his YouTube, which he always turned down, he also said he plan to quit this influencers thing for twitch streaming instead( gaming online ) because crypto influencer is all about feeding people lies upon lies, and he doesn't feel good about it.He Said...Crypto influencers are always the first to get involved in shit projects and they talk about the project to their followers so that the followers can pump their bags, and they take profits without telling you a thing, poor people, they keep holding to the project for the long term. They are paid over 600$ per tweet on their Twitter accounts by those developers that have shit coins built up in seconds, the criteria of the influencer is loads of followers like 50k to 100k and more. The fastest way they make money is talking about shitcoins, things that many followers want to hear from the YouTubers, so that everybody is happy and their followers will keep increasing. Crypto Influencers end goals1. They make fast money in short term and still invest the money back into Bitcoin and Ethereum, do not be surprised, they used you using shitcoins to get the bests, (BTC and ETH), my friend said he PMed a popular crypto influencer and he claimed that BTC and ETH are still his best, and he his shilling shitcoins on his Youtube channel to all his followers. 2. The numbers of their follows and viewers makes them even more money and the fastest way to grow is telling people want they want to hear, like Shiba will do 30x in 2025, this increases the number of their followers faster. 3. Promoting shit projects also brings in loads of followers on their Twitter accounts, making them looking for attractive for new projects and they are been approached by the new projects to shill their shit projects for them, paying them in return.Honestly, crypto influences makes more money than anyone in a bear market, and that set them up for life even without a bull market, people are been used and they don't even have a clue about what these people are doing. Know what you are doing, gain knowledge yourself and make your own decisions, if you fail it's even better, you will be able to adjust yourself than following someone blindly.",

      "body": "An Average person in Crypto for at least five years should know how it works. It's an open secret that crypto influencers work for those developers and get paid. If people believe that those crypto influencers are suggesting the right coin which will do 100x in the next few weeks or months, that's the mistake. Not too long ago, I tended to follow a youtube channel named Fomotion. He is a Dutch guy, and every time he comes up with his videos, he used to say this is hidden gems, and he is bringing them up. He used to give away, and many people trusted him because he also invested in those projects. What people don't know is those are not real money. The developers gave them a few bucks to make the contest for his viewers, and that's it. I remember I bought some shit coins even though I knew those would be zero in no time. Being a crypto influencer is more like telling a lie in people's faces and making money by telling a lie. People with a good hearts will eventually exit from doing such things.",

But sadly, the number of good influencers is not that many and most influencers want to make a lot of money from what they post, no matter if it's a shitcoin, as you say.If your friend doesn't want to do it anymore, he can just turn down such offers and prefer to provide information about the true things about crypto. And we also can't deny that that's what's happening on many social media. Where there are influencers who provide info, that's where the money is, but it also depends on the audience because they will choose it for themselves.Be careful when you watch influencers on social media, filter what you watch, and look for more information that might be useful to you. And if you want to become an influencer, try to be a good influencer and provide the right information.",

To many crypto influencers are like this and their main intention is to gain money and they doesn't care about what are the consequences of what they do. This reminds to anyone that before believing on what people say either they are famous or not check always the back ground so that we can see their intentions and why they exert so much effort on promoting those projects or products.",

Crypto promotion can actually be very tempting most times, especially for those crypto projects whose main purpose is to attract potential investors who will invest in their shitproject, which will create room for them to rug pull and leave the buyers in the gutter.Most of the time, most of them actually sign a deal with the project owners that will make them part of the benefactor, so they can actually share part of the profit made from their channel. Since most people who are following them on their channel believe in them, most of the time they just do whatever their channel tells them to do.If people who are exploring online could be able to do their own research and not rely on these influencers, then some sort of scam and rug pull will be reduced, and we will have fewer victims complaining about being scammed.",

However, once they got big and have bigger reach, this practice becomes less. Perhaps they are afraid of getting arrested and stuff. Product endorsement is nothing new on youtube with all these techtubers, even power tools, and kitchen gadgets have their own shills  The problem here is that altcoins are mostly junk without any merit other than pump and dump. They also violate the law that states endorsement must be explicit so that we know which is genuine and which is a paid advertisement.For me, instead of demanding Youtube to take action, which is slow and inconvenient, the do your own research (DYOR) mantra is a must. Also, people need to know that making money via flipping coins / investing in altcoins and penny stocks is extremely high risk. Basically, you're playing with fire.",

It's just that your friend is not worth the money, and people will be able to find a replacement for him. Everything has its price. People on YouTube are people who make money from views. Why ask a YouTuber to promote a crypto project? The answer is self-imposed: money. Therefore, all crypto-influencers for this or that money will do what they are told.

I won't say that even some ordinary mortal earns something in all this, but they pick up only crumbs, although the majority lose everything they invest - because their loss actually generates a big profit for all those I have already mentioned.

You can make bad decision to accept an offer from a shitcoin project that can be just a shit coin but can become a rug pull later. You don't know how that project will end with whether a rug pull but a shitcoin is what you know at beginning. With your experience to build up a channel that is big enough to receiver offers from projects, you should have enough ability to differentiate shitcoins.Quote from: Lucius on May 29, 2023, 12:46:28 PMMaybe it's all new and strange to you, but the whole shitcoins industry works by first ensuring adequate advertising, and then listing on as many exchanges as possible.

At the end, if people spend money to a shitcoin and blame that they do it only because of influencer, they have no valid reason to blame their losses on anyone else.

So investment decisions are for matured people, not kids and we are fully responsible for what we do with our capital.",

I believe that, as an influencer, you should have as much knowledge as possible about the coin you want to promote and how reliable it is by conducting thorough research on the project. However, if influencers promote shitcoins, some of them solely rely on the money that will be paid to them, which is why some didn't bother to do the necessary thing. However, without doing any research on the quality of the project, which is problematic in my opinion because if you promote it, get investors, and then the project doesn't materialize, the entire attention will be on you, which will damage your reputation for future projects,",
