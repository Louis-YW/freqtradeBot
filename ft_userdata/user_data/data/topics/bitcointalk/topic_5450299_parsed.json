  "content": "Nations with fat development pictures and structures always operates as capitalist to other Minorities countries, the G5, P5, F5 and E5 countries like US, Germany, China, England, Russian and Europes this countries creates revolution in many under developed or developing within the shore Western continents and Africa. The powerful controls the resources directly or indirectly of this suffering countries in the name of helping them or empowering them. No good image josterpost by developed countries towards this people. But mostly non of this communist or capitalist countries will rendered free AIDS to others without derivative sense of eluding their fairware resources.After all they call them borrowed nations, poor nations, indebted nations because the lender always have the way of keeping you as a slave. Countries should not help each other because of wars, economic crisis, epidemics, pandemics, earthquake, plaques and IDPs. There should be a unified cordial Juggernaut relationship that is characters on the frontier of development in wider pictures, as such creative scenes will boost visiting tourism to the athletes, games, recreational, tourism, business and education which everyone will love to see other nations.",

So it is left for those who are behind to think smarter in order to at least remain relevant or try to take over to be in the first position. If developing countries became fully developed like them, then what is their pride? I think that this should be a challenge for developing countries to try and learn this technologies that makes the developed countries what they are, instead of being stagnant and relying on aid from the world powers. I've seen countries in Asia, that were in the developing countries category but today they are now classified as world power. There is no free lunch, underdeveloped countries must embrace technological development.",

      "body": "It's understandable why people in developing countries may feel frustrated or resentful about this dynamic. They may feel like they are being exploited and held back from true progress and prosperity. It's not fair that some countries have so much while others struggle just to survive.However, I don't think that the solution is to abandon the idea of countries helping each other. In fact, I think that a more unified and mutually beneficial relationship between countries could be incredibly powerful. If we could find ways to work together, share resources, and support each other in times of crisis, we could achieve so much more than we ever could alone.Of course, this would require a lot of trust and cooperation, which is easier said than done. But I believe that it's worth striving for, because it could create a better future for all of us. It could also lead to more tourism and cultural exchange, which would be a wonderful way to celebrate the diversity and richness of different nations and peoples.",

No doubt these developed nations want Africa to remain a source of their human and material resources but Africans are the reason why Africa is underdeveloped. Yes, the West will always want Africa to be a buying continent instead of a producing one but they cannot achieve it without the support of Africans. My country is the highest importer of electric generators from China, I am sure China will always join forces with our people to sabotage all our effort to get a constant power supply. European banks accept looted funds from African leaders and keep them safe but it was Africans that gave it to them. Our leaders buy some of the expensive houses in these developed nations and the sellers are aware that this money was stolen, out of greed they accept this blood money. Developed nations might not want Africa to develop but they can achieve it if Africans assist them.",

      "body": "Many Africans claimed they have their Independence from colonial Master or powerful country, but this situation of the Africans or known as under developing countries have nothing to show for their growth and development and they claim again to be matured from the colonial Master. But the level of the Africans country are still poor, economically, socially, and still low in reasoning. We can see the Africans high corrupted nature so high and have no better plans for the citizens and country at large.The western country see how low and helpless citizens were dying everyday and the high increase in poverty, insecurity, lack of food, poor social amenities, starvation, incapable government and leaders, this makes the developed countries to tender help and assistance to the poor dying insecure Africans, they intervain in their numerous unable problems to solve. If truly the Africans were experiencing growth and development, it will not call for western intervention.",
