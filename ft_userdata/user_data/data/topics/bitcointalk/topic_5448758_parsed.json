  "content": "Looking for someone to help me get some BTC in exchange for cashapp funds. I am only looking to do $50 but cashapp keeps denying my verification for BTC transactions to send out. I have attempted half a dozen times. If anyone can help please let me know. I can show I am owner of funds loaded to cash app and bank records to prove if wanted. Hoping for a smooth quick transaction with someone trusted because I will send first.",
