  "content": "Hi guys,I need help figuring out something which I've been searching about but haven't arrived at a sure answer.I want to set up my own validating node on Renec Blockchain, Renec blockchain is a new Blockchain launched October last year and after accessing them for a while, the project seems interesting and very promising.Since it's just about 6 or 7 persons running a validating node on the network, I feel going into it now would be profitable.I've gone through the hardware requirements which can be found on  https://docs.renec.foundation/running-validator.I am working towards buying the required hardwares, but since this is something I've never done before, I found alot of things confusing, I am a complete noob to computer gaming, so I don't know much about computers aside my normal laptop and desktop computers.At first, I thought running my own validator node was possible on my desktop computer, but I discovered it can't, even if it could, my desktop does not meet the CPU, RAM and DISK requirements, I thought I could just upgrade my CPU with a higher RAM and DISK sizes, but it seems I'm still getting the whole thing wrong.In the requirements, Renec Foundation recommended AND ZEN 3 series stating that it is popular among the validating community,After searching this online, I discovered that the AMD zen 3 is a chip like hardware that can be installed into a CPU or should I say motherboard.Now my question is, what or which CPUs out there can I purchase that supports the installation of this chip(AMD zen 3 or Higher), and I would also appreciate it if I could get a picture of what this CPUs look like and how much they could cost to purchase..Thank you, and every comment is greatly appreciated.",

Do more research.Thank you friend for your response, I greatly appreciate it...When you say \"there're also Intel CPUs and that I should make sure it's a desktop CPU..\"Do you mean CPUs like the one in the shot below can also be used to validate transactions on blockchains like Solana? (Renec blockchain is a fork of Solana, so I assume that whatever works on Solana blockchain should work on Renec Blockchain as Well.Or must it be something like in the below shot? Which appear to the way more expensive to purchase, than the one above..",

So this means that if I own a CPU that has up to 32 gig of ram, core i7, 4th generation and an SSD of up to 300 gigabyte, there is no need going for the AMD Ryzen, whether big or small? except on my own, i decide to upgrade to that?Really appreciate the help guys, cant explain how happy i am gaining insight from you guys.Quote from: philipma1957 on January 16, 2023, 06:00:07 PMthey said you need a beast of a pc.128gb ram12/24 thread cputwo ssds.that you need to compile and run linux software.no special gpu.translation moneyand more than basic pc skills.I have a used threadripper more than enough cores and threads.and it has low end gpu along with a good psu and 128gb ramYour thread peaked my interest, i think i will spend a few hours time trying to set it up on the threadripper.if i can get it to run i will let you all know.Would be waiting for the feedback mate.. Indeed, the requirements translates to money  , i tried checking what it would cost to get the exact hardware as listed on the requirements, i discovered i could be spending up to 5 million or more( in my local currency), that's about $7000 based current exchange rate, that's a hell lot of money, and i dont even have up to 1/3 of that amount in my saving currently, Bitcoin wil have to pump back to $70,000 or more before i could even see half of $7000   .",
