As a result, many couples get divorced due to the greed of money.  Recently, this happened in the case of Achraf Hakimi, who played in the left-back position of PSG. After a long marriage, Achraf Hakimi's wife complained against him that he beat his wife a lot. According to the source, Achraf Hakimi's wife decided to divorce and according to that decision, the court said. When this order was made to give half of Achraf Hakimi's assets to his wife, the court observed that Achraf Hakimi had no money in his account and all the money was in his mother's account. As per divorce rules, since there is no money in his account, no matter how much money is in his mother's account, his wife will not get any money due to divorce.  But today I heard through you about converting your account money to Bitcoin due to divorce. This incident is really interesting to me and those who are about to get divorced if they read this news they will see that they are also adopting this method.",

Maybe it was his mother who asked him to buy and leave for storage.  And then, by what right can this woman claim this money.There is another point: undisclosed wallet was not found, which means that there is no evidence of hiding these 12 BTC. No wallet - there will be no division in half.The husband can also return this wallet to his mother - the rightful owner of these bitcoins, which again leaves the greedy wife with nothing.",

It should be split in divorce case.Morally that husband made a bad thing as he wanted to hide and steal that money from his wife. I don't support it and I feel happy that the wife detected it by herself. If that man stored his bitcoin not too good, safely and secretly enough, his coins can be detected by his wife as we knew but can be found by other people in his family too.Quote from: xSkylarx on July 23, 2022, 07:59:49 AMYesterday, my mom did a general cleaning on my room and when she's done, I saw the recovery phrase of my Trezor hardware wallet on the garbage can which I placed on my computer table",

She's now asking that the Bitcoin be splitted into two.I wouldn't blame the man here for doing such and i wouldn't also want to interfere to the matter that arises for the separation of them both, but in dealing with bitcoin, we can see that it's a currency that is decentralized which means only the person owing bitcoin can have access to his asset without any third party knowing about it, if he thinks he trust and love his wife or children, he may decided to share his keys with them or let them know that he's having a bitcoin investment.As long as he's not using a centralized exchange, they can't apprehend him or know about his bitcoin investment except he once told his wife or she already knew he is into bitcoin, if the court knows he has an asset in bitcoin, they can't do anything to force the man share it into two because they have no evidence that he has such, bitcoin is a p2p network except the man is willing to give her from his bitcoin investment.Quote from: sokani on May 22, 2023, 06:29:04 AMLooks like some of the married folks are getting smarter...

She is just a typical gold digger and the law of splitting everything that has been acquired since marriage is the worst law that has been created.This is what I love about crypto wallets. If the owner knows keys or have saved them somewhere safely, despite the fact that his wife stole the Ledger hardware wallet, this man can still recover it.Quote\"All of it wound up in two or three different wallets on a foreign exchange — a place like Coinbase, but in a foreign country that does not operate in the U.S. and is not subject to the laws and jurisdiction in the United States,\" Himonidis told CNBC.DiMichael said he has run into similar issues with cases where funds were transferred to a global Binance account, and he was, therefore, unable to subpoena records since the funds were in an untouchable jurisdiction.This is another beautiful quote from that article.The only logical solution in this case and in every upcoming case is:If wallet is a multisig 2/2 and the second multisig owner wife, then it should be split if both agrees but if wallet is not a multisig wallet and is owned by one person, then law shouldn't push the owner to send half of crypto to wife or husband.",

The last one is very difficult to prove especially nowadays that a lot of people only want to exist and be showered with affection and pampered with material things. That is why I do not really agree to speed dating up to a marriage, not unless you know your soon-to-be spouse since childhood and you are sure that they won't flip the switch if it ever comes to that. Hopefully though, the husband gets to keep whatever crypto he has for himself. It's bullshit that your spouse get to keep half of what you built way even before you guys met while the other doesn't really help add any value to your life in case you get separated.",

No one can prove of ownership if she cannot prove that he holds the private key of the wallet which have 12 BTC balance. If she only have snapshot of the balance well the husband can deny that and he will not be forced to split up the balance for just like that. This is the advantage of holding our other wealth on digital currency since we can deny that amount is in our position and you make their life to prove that especially if your wife us not worthy to get some share on your wealth.",

What's your thoughts on this?My thought is that this folk is not smart at all, if he did, he would have been more clever in hiding his Bitcoin. For this to have been discovered by the wife's hunter might mean that the guy was not actually hiding anything as he might not just disclose it or he is just a novice in the business. Because, if I want to hide Bitcoin this day with my level of understanding now, it would be almost perfect as I would definitely use trusted third parties and still mix my coins before I would safely keep them. I wonder how the crypto hunter would be able to reach all the networks used in doing so.It's painful if a divorce is making you pay more for a woman that is not worth it.
