  "content": "QuoteHigh fertilizer prices could put an additional 100 million people at risk of undernourishment, a study suggests.The war in Ukraine has led to the blockade of millions of tons of wheat, barley and corn, but reduced food exports from the region are less of a driver of food price rises than feared, researchers say.Instead, a modeling study led by University of Edinburgh researchers suggests surging energy and fertilizer prices will have by far the greatest impact on food security in coming decades.Until now, how energy and fertilizer price rises and export restrictions affects future global food prices was poorly understood. There has also been little analysis to quantify the scale of harm that hikes in the price of food could have on human nutritional health and the environment.The team used a global land-use computer model to simulate the effects of export restrictions and spikes in production costs on food prices, health and land use until 2040.Their simulations suggest the combined effect of export restrictions, increased energy costs and mid-2022 fertilizer prices—which are three times higher than at the start of the previous year—could cause food costs to rise by 81% in 2023 compared to 2021 levels.Export restrictions account for only a small fraction of the simulated price rises, the team says. Halting exports from Russian and Ukraine would increase food costs in 2023 by 2.6%, while spikes in energy and fertilizer prices would cause a 74% rise.Food price rises would lead to many people's diets becoming poorer, the team says.The findings suggest there could be up to one million additional deaths and more than 100 million people undernourished if high fertilizer prices continue. The greatest increases in deaths would be in Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East.The modeling estimates that sharp increases in the cost of fertilizers—which are key to producing high yields—would greatly reduce their use by farmers. Without fertilizers more agricultural land is needed to produce the world's food, the team says.The simulations indicate that by 2030 this could increase agricultural land by an area the size of much of Western Europe—Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the U.K. This would have severe impacts on deforestation, carbon emissions and biodiversity loss, the team says.The study is published in the journal Nature Food. It also involved researchers from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, Rutgers University in the U.S. and the University of Aberdeen.Dr. Peter Alexander, of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences, who led the study, said, \"This could be the end of an era of cheap food. While almost everyone will feel the effects of that on their weekly shop, it's the poorest people in society, who may already struggle to afford enough healthy food, who will be hit hardest.\"The Black Sea Grain Initiative is a welcome development and has largely allowed Ukraine food exports to be re-established, but the immediacy of these issues appears to have diverted attention away from the impact of fertilizer prices. While fertilizer prices are coming down from the peaks of earlier this year, they remain high and this may still feed through to continued high food price inflation in 2023. More needs to be done to break the link between higher food prices and harm to human health and the environment.\"https://phys.org/news/2022-12-soaring-fertilizer-prices-millions-undernourished.html....This sounds troubling.QuoteTheir simulations suggest the combined effect of export restrictions, increased energy costs and mid-2022 fertilizer prices—which are three times higher than at the start of the previous year—could cause food costs to rise by 81% in 2023 compared to 2021 levels.Maybe it is a good time to research methods of producing organic fertilizers? Could there be a good financial opportunity surrounding that sector, if indeed fertilizer costs and food costs are projected to rise? Or is the media merely being overly negative and pessimistic with this latest series of doom and gloom?One of the coolest methods I found to produce organic fertilizer is to construct \"pigeon towers\". They're essentially structures that are built to be friendly for pigeons and birds to roost in. They funnel bird poop into areas which make it easy to collect and use as a natural, organic, fertilizer. In the world of hot start up concepts surely that idea has to count for something? In the old world, some civilizations were known for constructing massive pigeon towers, which appeared as giant stone monoliths, for purposes of simplifying the collection of bird waste.Of course, there are many other methods. I'm certain there be no shortage of great ideas for producing organic fertilizers as ideas in this era are in abundant supply.",

The price of fertilizer has been increasing, it's not new because it's a chain reaction as the world battles inflation and inflation is seriously winning. Just like many households would not be able to afford more nutrients naturally because of inflation, that is just the way the increase in the price of fertilizer affects it, it's not new at all.This is where the action of a responsible government is required. They need to subsidise this so that the effect on the agricultural produce would be minimal to the citizens.",

      "body": "Fertilizer is important for agricultural processes and lack of it can lead to food scarcity. No doubt that fertilizer is not the only thing or commodity that is affected by high inflation globally but I think it should be made a priority by governments across to avoid shortage of it. If the government is not showing concern in fertilizer production , this means that agriculture will suffer and food shortage will increase. Like in Nigeria, this is becoming a bigger challenge to do agriculture with the price of fertilizer increasing over 100% which is double of the initial price and this makes the smaller farmers whose products can go alongway to support commercial farmers helping to push price of products down is now lacking. The result of this is that commercial farmers have no competition because even small farmers who do house hold farming join in the bulk of the market buyers of agriculture products.",

      "body": "One of the main reason for the prediction of an increase in the price of fertilizer might be the high cost of raw materials such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Apart from the use of organic fertilizer to substitute the scarce or expensive NPK fertilizer seeking for alternative raw materials might be a good option.Most countries have alternative raw materials that can serve as alternative raw materials but they have failed to research and explore these resources because they can cheaply import fertilizers from other countries. This high price of fertilizer is a wakeup call to lazy nations to look inward and tap thier idle raw materials. If they can produce thier own fertilizer, the price wouldn't be high. Most country would also increase thier production capacity.There is a report that Indonesia has large deposit raw materials such as leucite, phlogopite, trachyte and biotite that can make them a major exporter of fertilizer. Nigeria is currently producing below it's capacity because of lack of investment in the fertilizer sector.",

You need the right farmers to produce good foods and rich harvest not those that believe that poisoning foods with toxic chemicals will make them grow. Try and grow some foods in greenhouse with soil rich in natural/organic manure and you probably notice the difference.
