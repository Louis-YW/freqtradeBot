At ROLR, your deposit (real funds) is used before the bonus funds. We don't hold your cash hostage while you try to get through a playthrough. In this case, you might wanna check our exclusive bonus.

Hi Panjul07,There seems to be a mix-up. The \"no max bet\" policy is about the bet amount that fully counts towards bonus wagering. Each game's max bet is determined by its provider. So, if a game permits a $10,000 bet, that full amount contributes to the bonus wagering requirements.The $4000 daily withdrawal limit is for our standard customers. VIPs enjoy a much higher withdrawal threshold.Stay tuned and let the good times roll,ROLR Team",

If so thats a whole lot of rollsHi edmundduke,As presented to Little Mouse, the x40 wager only pertains to bonus funds, this is what we call a Non-Sticky Bonus. In this situation only the bonus amount it taken in consideration for wagering, and not your deposit (real funds).Regarding our Free Spins promotions, you are 100% correct. The bonus can be claimed once per each coin you deposit, for either The Classic Welcome Pack, and The VIP Fast Track Welcome Pack.Stay tuned and let the good times roll,ROLR Team",

Hi dimonstration,Thanks for sharing your thoughts. We recognize that a x40 requirement might be daunting for some, but we're not discouraged. Remember, the x40 wagering only applies to bonuses for new or recent sign-ups. Established players on our platform are offered different bonuses with varying wagers each week. Cashback bonuses on ROLR have 0 wagering requirements. And let's not forget the distinct perks for our VIPs/High rollers. ROLR has more to offer than just x40 wagering requirements; hopefully you'll stick around to discover more.Stay tuned and let the good times roll,ROLR Team",

So I agree with you that the team must reconsider about it carefully.",

If I were you, I would improve user experience and add more games because right now I only see slots, video games and some live casino games that misses Evolution tables. Evolution is a major B2B casino supplier in gambling industry and has a lot of customers, you need to add them on your website. Btw I like the idea of personalized gifts and your own VIP manager, it gives you a unique experience and makes you feel like highly valued customer.Quote from: Little Mouse on October 27, 2023, 10:42:32 AMThere's a 75 free spin on first deposit.
