I remember only South African tour where they got outplayed, otherwise, they've won almost everywhere be it tests or LOIs (interestingly most of the time with their B team). Also, I believe that in LOIs home conditions hardly matter anymore, maybe a slight advantage but not so much. Anyway, they are chokers in ICC tourneys so not expecting much. Having said that new Skipper Rohit is a kinda lucky guy and is considered a lucky charm in T-20 due to his IPL records. Somehow he manages to win trophies.

Now, I have also my personal views about teams which are in this world cup. India: After Dhoni mostly overrated specially in ICC events have no good chance to win this world cup. Because of lake of motivation, even they have good squad. England: Doing good in last few months specially in tour of Pakistan and now have good result against Australia in first T20, so they are capable of going into last two. Australia: A good team which can perform good at home and have quality as well most chances they could be also in last four. New Zealand: All time very balances team with few good individuals, but sadly they are not performing good in big events have no enough chance. Sri Lanka: Recently won Asia Cup and have few good players but here in this event they are missing quality which is enough to win an event like this. Pakistan: Always unpredictable even having few world-class bowlers and batsmen but mostly fail to give their best in big matches, so Dark Horse for me.",

Basically there are three formats of the game, Test match which will last 5 days and each team gets 2 innings each, unlimited overs for a bowler and 90 overs for the day. After the fifth day if there is no result it is considered a drawODI matches, 50 overs a team and a bowler could bowl a maximum of 10 oversT20 matches 20 overs a team and a bowler could bowl a maximum of 4 oversIf both teams score exactly the same runs then it would be a tie and in T20 there will be a super over, which means one over will be bowled by each team and the team that scores the maximum runs will be the winner.The rest is explained in the video above and you will understand once you understand the laws or if you have any questions there are a lot of Cricket fans in this forum who could clear every doubt  .",
