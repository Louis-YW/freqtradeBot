As for the timing, me i no really understand why it had to be now, so many people they talk say Buhari no they in support of Tinubu wey be him party presidential candidate, so him they do this things so people no go vote APC; me i no know all those ones, wetin me i know be say make Nigerian government no they suffer their citizens like this, e no make sense at all.",

      "body": "I'd suggest that the goal of the extra funding, especially during this election season, is to end election rigging. The Nigerian President has made one of his wisest moves in decades. knowing well well that the majority of politicians buy votes with their money. All the politicians who planned to buy votes are now trapped because there is no new money in circulation and their old money is no longer useful due to the introduction of new money. The upcoming election will be free and fair as a result.",

And me i believe say these politicians go still find way to buy vote, e fit no happen like before based on say cash they scarce, but to a little extent them go still find way to buy votes. But wetin be my concern be say, is all these sufferings worth it, cash no they, people they starve, businesses they close, etc, and you come they tell us say all of these go stop vote buying, it is all somewhat counterproductive and to a large extent unreasonable.",
