Well it's a memorable day for Bitcoin. Showing That Bitcoin could be exchanged for food One of the basic needs Of humans. Well I don't advice any to sell their Btc to get a pizza though  I believe it's still far though but there should be a Pizza contest if am not mistaken Sigh I'm already craving a pepperoni pizza.

Last time I checked ETH was a security and the SEC was supposed to go after its developers. Joe Lubin isn't very happy about it Eth has been dumping for a while now and it seems like people aren't convinced that there will be such ETF this year. IMO proof of stake sucks it basically allows people who have a lot of money in ETH to get more for free.",

I don’t think I could ever top the legendary meet up at Bitcoin 2023 at the most authentic Italian pizza place off of Collin’s Ave in Miami. So many OGs were there, artists, coin makers, Bitcoin OGs it was certainly a privilege. Happy BTC Pizza Day 2024!",

Possibly 14 years from now again we will record another milestone that Bitcoin has achieved. The power of HODL is the key to achieving that milestone.",

Makes you look at things in perspective too because bitcoin at some point was a worthless internet money but then things changed for the better and the change was really something that people never expected, maybe some at the early stages believed it but the people that were skeptical were much more compared to those that believe it. You can definitely still make money though, bitcoin still has a potential to grow even higher and this probably not the last time that it's going to happen so we definitely still have time and don't waste it, just keep on investing.",

Those who mined it early could have also sold it early when the price rose a little bit, or they could have lost their coins, because BTC was not worth much back then, and there was not so much incentive to store BTC's safely. However, it is not even about people making money, this is just a time to appreciate how far BTC has come and how much growth it has experienced from the early times until today, it is a great feeling to be part of this network and community.",
