I even searched on Google and did not find any search results, I think that your currency is not listed on any platform, Have you created a special site for it? I created a number of currencies years ago through a website at a cost of less than $5 per coin, but it was only for the sake of trying, anyone can create their own currency, but for the currency project to succeed requires many factors, the most important of which is community confidence and a unique idea. The name of your currency contains the name of the state of Lebanon, and I think that if you are Lebanese, there is a problem that will prevent you from displaying your identity and the identity of your team because the Lebanese government has issued laws banning cryptocurrencies.",

You created your own token and I hope its a good one because creating your own token is so easy nowadays. If Lebanon is a crypto friendly, then that can be a good opportunity for you to maximize this project, just give more information next time.",
