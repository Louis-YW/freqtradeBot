Its native token is IOST and is used to pay transaction fees within the blockchain.IOST (IOST) Price Prediction 2022The IOST Price was swinging from $0.022 resistance2 to $0.016 resistance1 subsequent to contacting the help level at $0.01. It switched from the help level of $0.01 and presently going sideways on the lookout and is supposed to be bullish before long.In the meantime, our drawn-out IOST price prediction for 2022 is bullish since it can't break the current help level soon. We can expect that IOST should reach $0.05 in 2022.",

      "body": "IOST is one of the most popular coins I believed in 2018-2019. But I didn't touch this coin and did not include it in my portfolio.The question of whether IOST is a good investment really depends on how we will look at this coin based on our own factors. With its current Marketcap and daily established volume, it can be considered one of the worthy coins to trade for short-term trading. I don't find this good for long-term long holding though.Either way, as I mentioned, try to improve your DYOR regarding this coin. Really hard to give speculation on that matter. It should be a self-decision.",

Even Tron is slowly dying due to low users on there dapps. IOST has a very massive circulating supply while price room for increase is very limited if you check the price history.Blockchain project like Near and Avax is a better investment rather than this old blockchain project that didn't have popular dapps to attract user that supposed ro be boosting the token price. IOST growth is already stagnant. The chance is your money will just stuck there for a long time before you can have profit.",

That's why I stopped following the prices of altcoins a long time ago. I only follow the prices of altcoins during the bull period. In the remaining periods, I try to focus on the price of Bitcoin, which is the determinant of the market. I think this is what will determine whether IOST will be a good or profitable investment. I wish you good luck.",

I remember the day this token has been getting so much traffic in the crypto but it seems the golden time for this token already gone. I think that's quite better if you are focusing with another first or second layers solutions in the market. That will be far better rather than this token from the various things. IOST doesn't have strong fundamental that can make the project can stand against another project that was coming to the crypto with better vision and product. These days people mainly focus to play in the layer blockchain solution as the things that may be booming in the future.",

But if I speak for myself I would never invest more than $500 here",
