The answer is clear and indisputable, corruption is totally bad. Corruption is one of the reason the world is suffering today. It as destroyed individuals, communities, nations and it is gradually destroying the world. Corruption is the main cause of wars and underdevelopment. Anybody that is collecting or receiving illegal fund is a criminal and should be punished. Although the society don't give a damn about how one makes money but It is not everybody that likes to make money illegally. And some person care about the kind of money that comes into their purse because they abhor illegal funds. Corruption is not and can never be ok.",

I was about to refute your claim that corruption can't be avoided until I used a real life yardstick to measure your statement and understood that you are correct.  The illegally earned money is used to influence and implicate innocent members of the society, thereby indicting themTake for instance, a corrupt money was given to the church, church being ignorant of the source of the money uses the money to train an innocent child through higher education. The innocent child has indirectly benefited from corruption.",

This is a very hard question to answer because it is now looking like corruption is become a normal thing on the streets and in our place of businesses. Corruption involves different tactics so it's not just stealing of scamming people of their funds.The government that intention to fight corruption is likely to be corrupt and it is very obvious that they can really try to arrest those people that are not in power to show a working system. There had been a continual efforts to fight corruption but I don't think that alone could make a difference because many illegal things are happening every seconds.",

Bottom up is okay because its the people just trying to get by. Like for example, if you can, dont ever pay crypto capital gain taxes on trades. because its unfair that other countries dont tax trades but just when you cash out but in the USA they tax every little gain but you get nothing if you lose everything on a trade. If you can be currupt and not pay taxes as an individual then you are doing good. you just have to anonymize yourself first. dont be dumb and do it when they can see you. it's harder for us the people to do it because we have consequences. but officials dont worry about much. they only get in trouble when there is too much light on them and the people rise up in anger and the government has to do something about it. basically tldr it is only okay when honest people do it to get by or make it un an unfair world. people say its bad but why? why should the people sit and do nothing while they watch these psychopaths get rich and richer?",

Unfortunately most government corruption slides under the table. It's only when one party is in power, they go after the opposition. Opposing party gets into power, goes after their opposition. The only consolation is that it's a balancing act through an adversarial system. Doesn't work if there's only one party in power for too long.",

Basically true that most people are corrupt but it takes the few in power or authority to command obedience and all the country will respect the authority in place. The solution is thannt So the government has a big roll they will play to make this act of corruption is reduced. They have to strengthen the laws and must allow the purnishment of offenders.",

There are diverse ways corruption is executed by political leaders in the world. The money that is meant to developed would be diverted to a personal accounts. Employment reduction: When an empowerment scheme is given to them to carry out, they would cut off the total number of persons that would be empowered and took the large amount of money and empowered the few. Then remaining unemployed youth would look for a way to survive. And that led to illegal business by the youth to survive, therefore corruption is a deliberate act by the political leaders to suffer the masses. It is the leaders that can eliminate corruption in a country if only and really they want to do that. But I doubt if they will do it because it will affect them badly. As for me I did not the masses that are corrupt but the leaders are the caused of everything.",
