  "content": "First CrowdsaleJust a few days ago, our team published an article on the Bitcointalk forum. None of us expected such a fast development of events as a result of this publication.But, the opposite happened and thanks to the interesting and unique idea of the project, its dissimilarity to any of the existing ones, on the same day we started receiving offers from various cryptocurrency exchanges. Currently, there are about ten offers from exchanges, some of them are in the TOP-20 of the CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko ratings. Negotiations are currently underway with the managers of these crypto-exchanges regarding the listing of the Anhydrite cryptocurrency.We did not plan to conduct an “initial coin offering” of Anhydrite, but this situation has changed our plans. Therefore, we decided to conduct the first, limited crowdsale, which will sell only 1 million ANH coins at a price 10 times lower than the one from which it is planned to start listing on centralized exchanges.How to purchase Anhydrite 10 times cheaper than its original cost?We have created a separate, special smart contract. To purchase ANH coins you don’t have to do any special actions, you only need to send any amount of BNB to the address of this smart contract and in return you will receive Anhydrite in the ratio of 1/10000, that is, for example, for 1 BNB - 10000 ANH.But, in addition to this, there is another bonus The Smart contract, which is responsible for distributing Anhydrite, also generates NFTs. For this reason, there are certain conditions for this Smart contract: when transferring to a smart contract address, if the transfer amount is 50, 5, 0.5 or 0.05 BNB, the Investor will additionally receive a special NFT, that is certificate token:50 BNB - GOLDEN FIRST INVESTOR CERTIFICATE5 BNB - SILVER  FIRST INVESTOR CERTIFICATE0.5 BNB - BRONZE FIRST INVESTOR CERTIFICATE0.05 BNB - COPPER FIRST INVESTOR CERTIFICATEIf the payment amount does not match the above, the required amount of Anhydrite will still be transferred to the investor’s address, but he will not receive the NFT certificate.When investing, you need to be careful and make sure that your wallet supports interaction with BEP-20 and BEP-721 tokens, otherwise you will not be able to get Anhydrite cryptocurrency and NFT certificates.These NFT certificates are realized only in the process of the first crowdsale, so their number is limited. Do not miss your chance to receive at least one of these NFTs because in the future, they will be quite valuable collectible tokens!How to invest? Transfer any amount of BNB to the Anhydrite First Fundraising Campaign (AFFC) smart contract address: 0x547Fc8bF64B80A2CE8391b91F2Ba8bF259d95Db8. In return you will receive Anhydrite cryptocurrency in your wallet.",
