So my question is if the tournament ends and two participants end up on top with similar scoring, who will be declared as the winner of the first prize?Will the first prize of 0.003BTC be divided among the top winners with a similar score? Even three people can also end up at the top with the same score. We never know as everyone's points difference is not too much and still many matches to go.",

You joined a bit late so you need to predict correctly next few matches to catch up others on the points table.Anyways still you can be in top 3 as we have a lot of matches yet tot be played.Quote from: libert19 on April 07, 2023, 02:16:10 AMMight want to put bitcointalk account requirement with some activity/merit or accounts registered prior this contest, otherwise Mr. Teez can register account and take the top prize. Good point. Actually, this was my first experience making a pool and I made this pool searchable so anyone could join. Now I have changed that setting.Secondly, if Mr Teez was from bitcointalk and has joined seeing this thread, he would have replied in this thread by now. Since so many days have passed without getting his reply so I have blocked him on Superbru he is no more in our pool Quote from: Shan85 on April 07, 2023, 01:47:57 AMAlso, Isn't games and rounds is suitable sub for this post? No, this is also a discussion thread for the IPL Pool participants and the previous pools in previous years have been managed in this gambling discussion board.",
