  "content": "When comparing the two teams, England is clearly a far superior team to Senegal. The difference is really obvious with a three goal disadvantage, and they are very direct and decisive. England secured a crucial World Cup quarterfinal meeting with the reigning champions France.Â  Can England beat France in the quarterfinal round, though?With Kylian Mbappe and Ousmane Dembele on the flanks, they wouldn't have an easier time getting past France, in my opinion. Both players are extremely quick and look like a nightmare for any defense.",
