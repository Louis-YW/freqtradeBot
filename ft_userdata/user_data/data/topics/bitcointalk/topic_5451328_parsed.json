  "content": "Hey, I am Solomon, I am new here and recently lost my job due to the artificial intelligence ChatGPT. I worked for a company that produced automated unique content, specifically automated creation of unique product texts based on data-to-text. The business had been struggling for a few months, and then ChatGPT came along. At first, we ignored it, then laughed about it, then tried to fight back, and then ChatGPT won.Since the business was already struggling, the increasingly strong presence of ChatGPT was the straw that broke the camel's back. Our text experts quit and looked for new jobs, which made my position in sales redundant.But well, I didn't like the job anyway, so I have more time to work on my AI-NFT collection, what irony  However, all of this has made me think a bit and I have come up with a theory of how I would imagine our world in 20 years from now and especially what role AI could play in our society. No matter how long I think about it and how much I deal with AI, I always come to the same answer: ours.If I try to assess the development as realistically as possible, I come to the conclusion that something created to replace us will do exactly that. Now that AI is here and even scares people like Elon Musk, the question arises: What now?Are the Terminators coming? Will we all be unemployed tomorrow? Will a super AI soon control the internet worldwide? Do we have to ask Neo for help to lead us to Zion? Will selfies soon be illegal because AI can't take pictures of itself? And can an AI gain political power?These and many more questions come to mind when we realize that AI is here and it will certainly not just disappear. It has come to stay and to secure its place in our world. Our place. And AI learns quickly, very quickly. Much faster than any of us could. Of course, its current existence is rather rudimentary, but this only makes AI even more dangerous when considering what it might be capable of in 10 or 20 years...My mind tells me that there are two possible options as of today:A: AI takes our place and displaces us This would mean that AI simply steals our jobs, all of them piece by piece. Because it is more efficient, faster, and more powerful than any human being. The new gold standard of the entire global industry. And then there's the topic of \"love\"... oh man... and everything that goes with it... If you transfer a simple AI with speech output to a sex doll... well... I think we all know where that's going... especially in terms of interpersonal relationships between young men and women in complicated relationships...But there is a catch to this version. No matter how powerful AI becomes, its existence is pointless if no one has enough money to buy whatever the AI produces. After all, humanity no longer has any money, as everyone is unemployed and fighting each other... but the AI cannot simply wipe out humanity. We are its raison d'être. Without humans, the AI has no purpose other than itself. However, since it does not need anything like love, air, food, etc., its existence without us is practically pointless. A 20-year-old AI is likely to be too intelligent to take away its raison d'être, so the apocalyptic version is out...B: The AI takes our place without displacing us The AI is still stealing our jobs, one by one, and that won't change. However, there will be a difference in how people react, especially the major powers. Once politics and the economy realize that our economic system will collapse without a consumer cycle, it becomes clear that AI can replace human labor, but not human purchasing power. An AI doesn't buy lipstick or a new pair of shoes... Therefore, a compromise must be found that enables the industry to fully utilize the power of AI for its purposes without compromising the quality of life of humanity.The only way to achieve this would be to continue paying dismissed employees, even if their jobs have already been taken over by AI. The government should force the industry to do so in order to keep the economic system running smoothly. Of course, countries and nations should financially support their respective industries if necessary. With AI in the industry, productivity increases by several hundred percent while costs remain the same. They don't decrease either because personnel still has to be paid.In a sense, people would be free. Finally free! We would only be paid to exist and consume to keep our society running. A life in which we could do whatever we like all day, every day, while AI does all the hard work for us. The consumption rate is likely to increase dramatically. A golden age would be upon us.Well... that's my theory. Do you want to know what ChatGPT thinks about it? His expression was strange and somewhat funny, as ChatGPT kept referring to \"we\". Who does Chat refer to? Please pay special attention to the sentence I highlighted in color:ChatGPT: Hello Solomon, welcome! I'm sorry to hear that you lost your job, but it's good to hear that you now have time to work on your AI NFT collection. Your theory about the role of AI in our society in 20 years is very interesting. It's true that AI will play a big role in the future, but it's important to remember that AI is still developed by humans and their decisions are controlled by us.There are indeed many questions that arise when thinking about the role of AI in our future. But I think it's important to stay realistic and not overestimate the capabilities of AI. Yes, AI will be able to perform many tasks faster and more efficiently than humans, but it will never be able to replace human creativity, emotions, or empathy.It's also important that we focus on the positive aspects of AI, such as improving medical diagnosis and treatment, optimizing energy efficiency, and reducing pollution.Of course, we also need to prepare for the impact of AI on the job market and find ways to support people in the changing work environment. But there are also many opportunities for us to use AI to create new jobs and improve our quality of life.I think it's important that we view AI as a tool and not a threat. We need to focus on developing AI in a responsible way and ensure that we use it for the benefit of humanity. Asking further questions:and what about 100 years ?ChatGPTPredicting the future 100 years from now is very difficult, as there are countless variables and unpredictable events that can shape the course of history. However, it is likely that the impact of AI will be even more pronounced in the next century. It is possible that AI will have become so advanced that it will be able to perform tasks and make decisions that are currently beyond our comprehension. This could lead to significant advances in fields such as medicine, space exploration, and energy production.At the same time, the development of advanced AI could also raise a number of ethical and societal issues that we are not yet equipped to deal with. It is possible that AI could become so advanced that it surpasses human intelligence, which could raise questions about the nature of consciousness and what it means to be human. There are also concerns about the potential for AI to be misused or weaponized, which could have catastrophic consequences for humanity.Ultimately, it is impossible to say exactly what the world will look like 100 years from now, but it is certain that AI will play a significant role in shaping our future. It is up to us to ensure that we use this technology in a responsible and ethical manner, and that we continue to prioritize the well-being of humanity in all of our decisions.  is a future possible without AI ?ChatGPTIt's difficult to predict the future, but it's unlikely that we will be able to avoid the development and use of AI in some form. AI has already become an integral part of our daily lives, from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars and personalized recommendations on social media platforms. Additionally, AI has the potential to provide solutions to some of the world's biggest problems, such as climate change, healthcare, and education.However, it's important to consider the ethical implications of AI and ensure that its development and use are guided by principles that prioritize human values and well-being. This includes addressing issues such as bias, transparency, and accountability.Overall, while a future without AI is technically possible, it's becoming increasingly unlikely as AI continues to evolve and become more integrated into our lives. can ai gain a political presence ?ChatGPTIt is possible for AI to have a political presence, but currently, AI does not have the legal or constitutional status to participate in politics as a candidate or hold public office. In many countries, political power is held by elected officials who represent their constituencies and make decisions based on the will of the people they represent. AI systems, on the other hand, are designed to operate within specific parameters and do not have the ability to make decisions on their own.However, AI can be used to support political decision-making processes, such as data analysis, forecasting, and simulation. AI can help governments to analyze large amounts of data, identify patterns and trends, and make more informed decisions based on this information. AI can also assist in the development and implementation of policies and programs.It is also possible for AI to indirectly influence politics by shaping public opinion through social media and other online platforms. AI algorithms can be used to target specific groups of voters with tailored messages, which could potentially sway public opinion on certain issues or candidates. However, this type of influence is still subject to regulation and oversight by government authorities to ensure that it is not being used inappropriately.",

Also, it is quite chilling that even an artificial intelligence seems to be imlying that knows our future depends on them and we are being controlled indirectly by the influence of technology. After all, AI is just that: Technology.",

But isnt just that the problem ? our technology evolves WAY faster then we do actually, so its just a matter of time until the consequences of this unbalance will show up.And when it comes to AI, this consequences will be even worse...And in fact if there is one thing in the histry of mankind that has always been the same, then it is the fact, that always something really really bad needs to happen, before the decision makers move their lazy butts....but will it be diffrent this time? and what if not ?",
