Is this your first time browsing on the casino live games section or you’ve been playing on a casino for a long time that doesn’t have live games feature. I’m playing too on Duelbits live games and all I can say was they are one of the casino that has a decent live games feature especially when they have promotion.But if you really want to feel the real live casino experience through bonus that specifically designed for live games then you should try to visit livecasino.io because they have a lot of promotion and tournaments designed for live games. You will get more bonus if you are playing live games most of the time which other casino doesn’t offer at all.",

Live casino games can also differ from each other in terms of bonus and the house edge, and their sites that pay more attention to some specific kind of games we have some such casinos around the forum to choose from, and try your luck on them to have a different experience from what you hard on duelbits. Live casino and blackjack fun etc, offer specific special games.",

[locking this thread would be better]I appreciate him that he loves playing on Duelbits but I agree with your opinion that he should post it in the Duelbits official thread that is the right to do and the management will appreciate you more if you can invite friends to play here, this is the right way appreciating a casino, inviting friends and talk about your experience with your friends, there are to many spams associated with that account, he will likely get ban if he continue doing this.",

It is good to lock the thread and post those to their official thread.He will just create another thread in case he will lock this one because it seems that he became enlightened and overjoyed at the same time on playing on Duelbits after his bad experience on the previous casino that he is using. He already made few post for Duelbits and I doubt he can contain his excitement by locking this thread. This feeling will surely go away and we just need to be patient on user like this because he is just happy for his new found home casino.",
