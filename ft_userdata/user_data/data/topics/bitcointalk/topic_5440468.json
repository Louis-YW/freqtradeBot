Because any malicious attack would result in a hard fork, and thus, their now shitcoin is worthless.An AI with unlimited CCAP is a fiction, even if something like that existed, bitcoin would be the perfect currency if we are speaking about intelligence here and not a dumb talking machine. The concern that stems from the notion of having a super intelligence computer is that, they could enslave us, confine us, and at the end when the machine sees that we can't change, it would plot an extinction level event.We are essentially afraid of AI because it can see through our BS, and since it's a machine, it wouldn't feel anything when it tries to kill us all.Bottom line, AI and bitcoin are actually the same.!",

It is not possible to simultaneously hack every instance of Bitcoin Core which is currently running in order to change the code of every single node. And even if such a thing did happen, the new forked coin would not be bitcoin and every node could just revert to and older non-malicious version of the software and pick up the real bitcoin chain where it was left off.Quote from: tread93 on February 19, 2023, 07:05:24 PMObviously would need to be a 51% attack or more to achieve this, and I do believe the largest mining pools are run out of China, so largely they would probably need to be on board with something like that, right?A 51% attack is a completely different concept and has to do with a single malicious miner controlling a majority of the hashrate. It has nothing to do with hacking Bitcoin Core.",

The banks, financial institutions and traditional services are not even safe. BTC network has a way to evolve to counter things like these, but if something like this happens, it isn't only the BTC network that would have to work on counter measures for it, almost every other system will have to as well. So people should stop it with the thought that quantum computers, AI are like a direct threat or a flaw to the BTC network.",

Okay well AI can’t get past BTC, the government can’t, is there anything that could possibly ever stop Bitcoin?You kind of already answered it yourself: \"something like a crazy powerful AI computer w/ like unlimited computational power\", except the AI part is completely unnecessary and pointless. The SHA-256 algorithm used for mining is surprisingly simple and can in fact be done by hand (and possibly a calculator if you're really bad at math), but it requires an extremely large number of \"rounds\" to mine a block. Therefore, you do not require any 'intelligence' but rather a specialized chip that can process the algorithm rapidly. This is precisely what ASIC miners do.",

Also, it would easily be a wrong move considering that that time could easily be poured into something more meaningful. And, the AI can write beautiful code all it wants, but that's not the point, it would still need a machine that has unlimited computational power that can do the actual work.

That's what makes it different than every other computer system in the world.AI can't do anything. Now you could talk about a virus that is meant to infect Bitcoin nodes or Bitcoin miners or something (which doesn't require AI doing anything), but as soon as people realized it they would just shut down their machines.As far as hacking Bitcoin Core, that isn't a system. It's just the code. The system is the many thousands-strong decentralized network that makes up the Bitcoin network. Changing the code on Github of Bitcoin Core won't do anything because the maintainers would immediately see it and see someone had hacked into their Github account and get rid of the changes.Bitcoin is immune to the sorts of attacks that traditionally take down computer software programs. This is one of the reasons it is such a revolutionary technology and why its success has never been repeated and nothing challenges it.",

Instead, their perceptions are heavily influenced by the depictions of artificial intelligence in science fiction and similar genres of popular literature and movies. Also, there's a fair bit of hype and exaggerated claims surrounding the capabilities of AI, which can fuel unrealistic expectations and contribute to misunderstandings about what it can actually do. That's why lots of folks think that AI will just magically turn into all-knowing machines that can solve any problem in a snap, but that's actually pretty far from the truth. While AI has made impressive strides in recent years and can indeed excel at certain tasks, such as processing large amounts of data, it still has its limitations and may never be able of truly human-like intelligence or solving complex problems without assistance.
