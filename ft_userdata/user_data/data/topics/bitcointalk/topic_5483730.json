Bitcoin Spot ETFs are kind of business product and there are many companies with their Bitcoin Spot ETFs compete with each other to have customers. There will be winners and there will be losers.I remember some famous people said that in future, there will be some Bitcoin Spot ETFs to survive after going through selection process of market and customers. I believe this statement is true because it is true not only for Bitcoin Spot ETFs but for all business.",

I think the reason they took so long to approve them in the first place was because they had to do the due diligence and make sure that they were making the right decision in classifying BTC as a commodity. I'd imagine it would be possible to terminate bad actors though if an ETF or group of them had been breaching the law.",

So yeah there's a chance it will be terminated or halted, the possibility is when the ETFs no longer profitable.",

You get certain companies that will delist their company from the stock market, because they want to trade privately, so investment options change over time. So, if ETFs gets less support from the investors, trading platforms might remove it and then replace it with something that gets more income for them.",

I'm sure there will always be ongoing evaluations and audits in the running of ETFs. It may even be that the principle of ETFs is almost the same as trading exchanges, they can remove if it is not profitable. Since the beginning, there have been some big companies that have proposed spot ETFs such as Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock iShares, WisdomTree, ARK 21Shares, and Invesco Galaxy. Although approved, the SEC still warned about the volatility of the crypto market that could be detrimental.  CMIIWSource: https://www.investopedia.com/spot-bitcoin-etfsQuote from: Tanzila420 on February 01, 2024, 07:37:14 AMActually i want to know what means the full form ETF?To learn more you can visit this sitehttps://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/what-bitcoin-futures-etfhttps://www.theblock.co/learn/272940/what-is-a-spot-bitcoin-etf",

Two leaders (exclude Grayscale) are BlackRock and Fidelity, and bottom ones have very few demands.In 2 or 3 more years, bottom ones with little demands will have to self close their Bitcoin Spot ETFs and their customers will switch to top ones like Grayscale, BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK and Invesco.QuoteDon’t think blackrocks or fidelity will however close down anytime soon since it has a large AUM and will be around for years.

I expect they will bring more capital to Bitcoin market because they are very big capital management institutions and total capital they are managing in Bitcoin Spot ETFs are very small compare to total assets values in their management portfolios now.",

Also, if the approvers (SEC) say that the ETFs are no longer profitable, or if the ETF applicants want to stop managing the ETFs, then I think the approving agency can stop it again. But since they have approved it recently we will definitely have time to observe it for a long time. If it is profitable then it will not stop. But everything will depend on the commission. I can say from my personal opinion that Bitcoin ETF will not bring anything significant to Bitcoin as well as there is no chance to see it as a negative either.",

But those ETFs operate as business models and they need to spend different resources for operations. They need to spend inputs for operations but must gain profit from operations to keep their business models running well and sustainable.If a Bitcoin Spot ETF does not attract enough investors, cost of operation will be bigger than income, so their net balance will be negative. You see if they have loss from operations, they will have to close their Bitcoin Spot ETFs. It's fair competition in any business area.",
