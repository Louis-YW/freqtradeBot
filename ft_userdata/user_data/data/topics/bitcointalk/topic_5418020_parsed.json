If you're focusing on one thing you'll have to keep going from widening your content exposure to reducing it (repeatedly) and I don't think that's a good way to start unless you don't know how to find other things or only have one specific interest at the time you started here.If you're interested in crypto you'll do much better being interested in that on here than you will be by having interest in the forum (a lot of users a skeptical of newer users who try to police the forum too as soon as they arrive via reputation topics and trust).",

I will recommend Off-topic, Politics and Bitcoin Discussion (the last is the kernel of this forum) in addition to what you've, if you asked me. It's good to have a niche, especially if those areas make you write and contribute meaningfully without a drag. I've observed certain users struggle to post in boards and threads where they aren't gifted to write on but because of campaign requirements they compel themselves to post there. In such posts, it's often disappointing to read as their contributions often display their lack of knowledge in said subject matter(s). I think this attitude can be seen across campaigns with heavy restrictions on areas to post in and those who apply want to be in it at all cost even when they don't have the basic knowledge on restricted areas to post in.",

And, surprisingly, there are a lot of them. For example, how can a person write about gambling if he is far from casinos and sports? In the same way, in the developers or miners sections, people write who have at least some idea about these topics. It is silly to offer to have time to hang out in all sections since, by grabbing inches from each section, you may not grasp the very essence, simply from lack of time. Each person will always have their likes and interests, and I hope that the OP will be able to easily navigate where he is most drawn.",

Because otherwise there's no responsibilities here, you don't need a high rank to use all the valuable features of this forum, it's simply a place to discuss Bitcoin. If you want to earn a lot of merit, then it's better to specialize in something as a beginner - the inner workings of Bitcoin, trading, economics, altcoins and so on. Because generally you need to show some good insight to earn merit, and as a beginner it's simply not possible to learn everything about all topics in short time.",

People must seek and know their own interests first, and also be able to see what curiosity that drives themselves instead of directly pointing out which niche to thrive in. To be able to specialise within a niche, some people require a broad interest and knowledge on the first hand to see what \"works\" in that particular niche. Nevertheless, if what you trying to ask is the classic specialist vs generalist problem, then it has no meaning at all since there is no urgency or any responsibility demand on this forum.",
