Paid between 1-2% in fees, which was ok. At ATMs in the city you pay a much higher fee. Also there was no KYC in the shop, in case this concerns you.Anyway, in Hong Kong you have so many opportunities to makes this, just google would have answered your question actually   .",

Where are you from originally? Main land China?Just find a foreigner, give him to money to bring it out of Macau (travel together) and then receive it back. Pay him a small fee for that.I will be in Hong Kong in September, but I guess that's too late since there is still 1 month.Nobody will come extra to Macau to make this deal with you. You can only take the ferry or whatever and go to an exchange (they dont ask KYC) to buy the btc you want.",

Think about buying limits if you use bitcoin ATMs as well as the fees. I've never used it, but the info I got is that they limit transactions to $8k on average in the US[1]. Another reference from an ATM company in Hong Kong[2].Maybe you have to go to several ATMs if it's a large number of purchases.1. https://bitcovault.com/faq/is-there-limit-on-bitcoin-atm2. http://hkbitcoinatm.com/faq-by-tourist-traders",
