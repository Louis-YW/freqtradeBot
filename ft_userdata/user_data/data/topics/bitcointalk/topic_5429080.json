  "content": "Many people speculate that Satoshi Nakamoto was none other than Hal Finney. Won't go into the details as to why others believe that. I was reading one of Hal's final posts and something stuck out to me. Here is the post in question:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0In the final lines, he states \"My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy.\"If Hal was Satoshi, why would he store his keys in a safe deposit box? Safe deposit boxes are generally found in government controlled banks. The thought of the creator of bitcoin storing his keys in a bank seems absurd as it goes against everything bitcoin stands for.Perhaps Hal wrote that to throw people off from the idea that he was Satoshi or that he wasn't Satoshi at all. However, Hal was a cryptographic activist and cypherpunk according to his Wikipedia page, so either way it seems odd that such an individual would store their bitcoin keys in a safe deposit box. Or \"safe deposit box\" could be his way of saying a personal safe, but then why not just say a safe? I think I'm looking too much into this, but I thought it was something worth sharing. Thoughts?",

Steganography might also have been used here too to hide a lot of keys (such as with other random things) making the private keys even harder to find - especially if they're hidden within the others. There could also have been a chance the keys were put in other places too, maybe a bank in a different country which could keep it more secure.I wonder if both of his children had to agree on things in order to use the funds though or if each of their keys were able to decrypt and control his.There's the other chance he gave them some bitcoin beforehand and essentially burnt his coins to avoid conflicts but said he hadn't to make bitcoin seem easier to inherit and therefore more valid as a currency.",

Banks are centralized and we can not trust their services 100%.The Russian evasion in Ukraine, this war, show that banks in Switzerland can break their tradition, their terms to freeze accounts and money if they want. It is safer to be our own bank by securing private keys, passwords to encrypt wallet files by ourselves and never store them in central banks.We are fearful of central banks and choose Bitcoin but later return to central banks to store our bitcoins. Terrible idea.",

Nobody would just barge in to a bank's vault.And since Hal mentioned that his \"son and daughter are tech savvy\" right after saying that his \"bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box,\" I guess it means the keys and other important information are not in plaintext. Everything is certainly encrypted. His children are the only ones who could decrypt them.",

Also, I'm certain that he already have those keys encrypted before he handed them over to whichever bank of his choosing, adding another layer of security to a seemingly impenetrable (lol) institution. He understands all of those, and when you are a dying man, the best interest of your loved ones you'll be leaving behind will be put first. And as a dying man, maybe Hal doesn't really want to make it hard for his family, and the obvious choice for that are the banks that can fulfill all of his last agenda before leaving this world—keeping his bitcoins safe and making it easy for his family to claim it.",

Thoughts?- Let's pretend he's actually Satoshi -Because he was never really Satoshi in his mind or he believed in anyone else's mind, even though he was actually Satoshi. There's no need to throw anyone off, because he just needed to do what practically needs to be done. Satoshi is/was human like the rest of us in the community. He probably has a real bank account with U.S. Dollars, and uses a credit card for his shopping.",

The problem isn't that a bank or a government could take control over an address, but they could deny access to it. Imagine if Hal got arrested, the government could seize the contents of his safety box, and he would lose one of his backups. It's not the end of the world if you have other backups, that have different treat model and can't be seized by government easily. So there's no contradiction here with \"Satoshi's vision\", because unlike with fiat, you are not storing bitcoins themselves, but information for accessing them, which can be copied.",

      "body": "It is certainly possible that Hal Finney was using a figure of speech or employing a bit of literary license when he referred to his Bitcoin keys being stored in a safe deposit box. It is also possible that he was using a metaphor to describe a secure storage location for his keys, rather than describing an actual safe deposit box at a bank.Without more context or further information, it is difficult to say for certain what Finney meant when he wrote this. It is worth noting, however, that people often use figures of speech and figurative language in their writing, and it is not uncommon for them to use phrases in ways that might not be taken literally.In any case, the fact that Finney referred to his keys being stored in a safe deposit box does not necessarily mean that he was Satoshi Nakamoto or that he was not Satoshi Nakamoto. There are many factors that can influence people's beliefs about who might be behind the pseudonym, and a single phrase in a forum post may not be sufficient to conclusively prove or disprove someone's identity.",
