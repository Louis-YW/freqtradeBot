Another case of the \"deal being too good to be true\"The fact that you don't to share the details clearly shows that there is everything wrong about your deal.It's either a scam or the phones were acquired through illegal means, which translates to the buyer landing into trouble once the law enforcement catch up with him or her.",

      "body": "Bitcoin's reputation gets a hit due to this kind of posts. Yes, trade should be free and without borders in an ideal world, but that doesn't mean we should allow any illegal activities. Having 50 of them \"on stock\" is certainly a red flag. Of course it does matter how you got in possession of them. Any sane and ethical person would not take the deal especially without proof of purchase. Moreover you're a newbie account. So for anyone interested in this deal, proceed carefuly or better not proceed at all.",
