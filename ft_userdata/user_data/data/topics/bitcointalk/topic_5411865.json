  "content": "Hi everyone! I have observed different interest boards of the bitcoin talk forum and noticed a major part of the forum contents, especially responses, are of high quality because they exist a good number of members who know how to respond to threads, but unregistered readers, the guests, I don't know why you chose not to create an account - if responding to threads is the problem this simple guide will help to get you started in responding to threads like the ranked members through the power of quote button. Active Members who consistently read these forums must have noticed that the effective responses carry quotes of each statement, line, or paragraph in a post with responses, according to the contributor's view, anger, corrections, and excitement on the thread. However, remember that they are no absolute answers a good reason why yours is needed to make the forum informative. The guides should be cemented in your brain  to enable you to make great comments that may yield merits but, building your activity with quality contents is way better. 1) A question about the meaning of a bitcoin term, sentence, the reason why a particular phrase appears in the thread; or the reason why the OP chose to begin or end as he or she did.2) A comment on what you think the thread is about and why you are interested or not interested in that idea. 3) An observation, in quote, about a particular description, line, or sentence to which you had a strong reaction, you liked it; you disliked it; it made you angry, happy, sad, puzzled, or uncomfortable. This method is effective in the forum and adds to the quality of any response that follows this step. 4) A connection between the thread and other crypto posts you have read, experienced or observed in your research about bitcoin. A link to the other blog is always needed to help readers understand your response better.  Note that responding to threads is a place to begin in the forum, when done the right way, these 4 guides will be of great help to everyone not only the guests. Thank you!",

We are still on same line, I pointed “guests\" who may not know where to start from in terms of thread response, my question is won't the guide help them? Another thing is those responses that tend to tackle each statements accordingly aren't they effective to the readers understanding? I never said its a particular way of responding to a thread, watch the post closely you'll understand that many responses in the forum already follow this method and anybody who wish to can do the same way. Even your method of response is also a part of this guide, and its not a must to use the quote button, but if I didn't quote your response how will readers or guests understand fully whom and what post I'm referring to, I don't see anything wrong in the guides above, you may have understood it differently. And I'll try as much as I could to clarify you if needs arise thanks for your response. Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on August 31, 2022, 01:47:50 PMActually it is quite complicated, like mk4 said, we can just response on how we usually do reply on such topic and post here.

But thanks for the heads up, since what you said is correct. You see the laughing emoji where I mentioned “cement it on your brain\" the guide must not be followed accordingly, it can be used in any manner once you respond to a thread you've already followed the guide, hope you get this point, its the main reason I referred to guests who may have not opened an account here because of not knowing how to go about responding on threads, I think some people could have that as a reason and such guests won't hesitate to check this thread when they see it, I'm glad they are many effective responses here that will guide them.",

If you're not contributing any useful knowledge or information to the discussion, I guess your response isn't effective at all.3. Proper sentence construction. Not necessarily perfect, of course.

If you just express your agreement or disagreement with the author without providing arguments or counter-arguments, it is considered a poorly-written reply of almost zero value for both the author and other readers. If you agree with the author, you either don't reply at all (you can say you value what they are saying by meriting their post) or, in case you feel you desperately want to say something, you reply in a smart way presenting valid arguments and providing source links supporting your opinion. The same principles apply to the cases where you feel the need to correct the author or express your disagreement with what they wrote. Try to back up your arguments with links to reliable sources of information, do not be unfounded, and express your opinion coherently so that other users could also learn something from your reply.",

Although that I'm a little on the confuse side to your thread and the reason or need for it, what I can make from the above quote is that you can quote a post and write what you think about it, you can use the emojis on the page to speak something in the quote you are making like you can use grin ( ) to show you are laughing or trying to smile or make humour from the post. Also if you don't understand the way to quote or use some emojis, ads, or other specifications, you can preview a post that has used that writing form you are trying to do likewise and see how it was done.

I could remember my high school days, a very good friend of mine doesn't ask questions, whether he understands or not, he moves on. Likewise in the forum, some people haven't created a single thread. That is their nature.Then for everyone who wishes to contribute to the forum discussion, they should approach it like a normal conversation and only to reply when there is an absolute need to and when you are sure you have a value to add. But what is said is not the reality. Many lower-ranked users don't know posting etiquette and they feed on the kindness of the forum to post in any manner they wish.",

Read and understand the point of a discussion, go through other comments if other forum users have already engaged it, If you really understand the topic, you should have a striking response to give back, just same as having a conversation with someone.
