  "content": "Mycelium is a Bitcoin Wallet that can receive and send other coins like Ethereum.This Bitcoin wallet is in my opinion a good wallet and worth recommending.Today, I got a notification that there is an update on this wallet.I visited the Play Store application on the Android smartphone, there was no update. What I see is that the last update was on 12 Feb 2023 regarding bug fixes.The following shows the update notification.Did any of you get the same notification?",

And then you check the Playstore if there is actually a new update?I downloaded the Mycelium just now directly from their website after installing it my Mycelium upgraded to 3.16.0.16 so the latest app is currently on their direct link not yet been on playstore I guess it has still under review by Playstore for 7 days since Mycelium is under finance category.",
