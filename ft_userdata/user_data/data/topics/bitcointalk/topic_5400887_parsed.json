      "body": "Ultimately this is just another way of the governments to make sure that they will receive the taxes that these gamblers will incur with their gambling habits. I see privacy being a concern too, especially from people who like to keep their identity secret during their time as a gambler. It is a double-edged sword, one to quell underage gambling and the other to remove the privacy that a lot of people enjoy. Idk how it would pan out, but if it works in Denmark doesn't mean that it will work in other countries, that's for certain.",

But there are deeper reasons why they've done this, like what dothebeats said, taxation is the most concern on this.Countries that have been getting huge taxes on the gambling industry focuses only on this. And with this reform and program that they do, it also at least gives back to that reason of tracing those that shouldn't gamble.",

We really don't know, still up to their parents though to really monitor them. As far as privacy goes, the casino's will have the responsibility to protect the data of all of their customers and I don't think there is privacy if you gamble either online or off-line. Offline casinos too require id if you wanted to avail of their cards to gain points or have perks like free hotel accommodations, food and drinks and everything that will make gamblers go back and play more.",

Privacy is not going to be much of a concern because it is already required that during registration process the online gambler to provides extensive information including personal information. The one of the goals of the digital ID is to prove one's age and identity online and offline. At least this step would go a long way in ensuring responsible gambling.

If this law is to protect the Danish gambling space from hackers and other online criminals and to restrict underage gamblers then its a good development. But the government would also want to invade the privacy of the Danish people with the aim of limiting tax invasion and also control their financial transactions. But we have to wait until gambling operators start transiting to MitID for us to ascertain its advantages and disadvantages.",

I keep asking myself: why don't they also ask that alcohol companies start having a system similar to this MitID? why don't they ask companies that make chocolates to put a system like MitID? many children are obese and addicted to chocolates, but governments ignore this, governments and society are only focused on prosecuting gambling and not regulating it in a fair way that benefits casinos and gamblersQuote from: alegotardo on May 31, 2022, 05:20:10 PMQuote from: fiulpro on May 31, 2022, 03:33:05 PMApparently Denmark is all Set to Launch the new Digital ID rules for Gambling in the upcoming July.

On the one hand, all these innovations are introduced under the pretext of good intentions, but in the end we are getting closer to a digital concentration camp. And I also wonder at whose expense online casinos should implement this identification system? If the government of each country will require \"special\" features for its citizens, then I can imagine what an absurdity this will turn into. I hope that in the future there will be a sufficient number of online casinos without KYC and with the ability to use cryptocurrencies. I don't want to have anything to do with officials in terms of allowing me to gamble.",

Maybe they think once they strict gambling at the highest level as possible and totally prevent underage people from gambling, their countries will be perfect in every aspects, as gambling were the root of every issues they face nowadays.I would like to see technology being spread and helping in fields where it really matters and make the difference for us in our daily lives and not to watch us and control what we are doing every seconds of the day. Governments should let people be responsible for their own acts and stop acting like a babysitter or the big brother...This protectionist approach governments have towards their citizens is one of the main reasons why there are lots of citizens who can't take responsability for their own acts and keep blaming others for their own mistakes. Like the gambler who borrowed money from his acquainted, didn't pay, and when sued by him, claimed it was the casino's fault to keep offering free spins every time he tried to close his account.",

As it connects multiple gambling portals under a single monolithic system. It is possible that all of those gambling sites can be compromised by simply compromising one single government site. Which could be a poor model to pursue as far as operational security goes.In the united states they do security audits of infrastructure and different sectors of business, the state and economy. To see how prepared and well defended it is against electronic attacks and cyber intrusions. Every year the united states receives poor grades on its internet security preparedness. I can't comment on denmark's state of affairs as far as internet security goes but I hope its better than the united states.",

Traditionally Anglo-Saxon countries (and others) have been more against them and in favor of privacy, but it seems to me that in the world in general we are moving towards more and more control of everything in all countries.
