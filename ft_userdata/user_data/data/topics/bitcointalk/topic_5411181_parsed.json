  "content": "As referenced in this article, the 50 Week MA is due to cross the 100 Week MA within a couple of weeks based on their current trajectories to form a \"bearish cross-over\". As stated:Quote from: CoinDeskWhile in theory the upcoming bearish cross would imply strengthening of bearish momentum, the indicator has a perfect record of trapping sellers on the wrong side of the marketA few things to note with this bearish cross-over that's looking unavoidable in approximately 2-3 weeks:The so-called bearish cross-over has never happened with price below the 200 Week MA, signalling further weakness in price than previous cross-oversThis has only happened twice before (2015 & 2019), so could easily be considered to have co-incidentally reversed price as opposed to being an established patternThis analysis isn't so different than the Pi Cycle bottom indicator that additionally uses bearish MA cross-overs to confirm market bottoms (ie a combination of price & time)What are your thoughts about this bearish cross-over? Does it signify that Bitcoin has endured it's bear market for long enough in both time & price in order for a recovery, or will we still see further downside?Quote from: CoinDeskBearish crossovers dated April 2015 and February 2019 proved to be contrary indicators â€“ those that tell you to bet against the herd.Personally I'm inclined to think it will further help to confirm a market low, given other indicators have already signalled a low in the market recently. On it's own, it otherwise doesn't amount to much imo.",

Ultimately, it all comes down to the double top and bullish momentum declining since April last year, over 16 months ago. For example price reached the 100 Week MA only 6 months after ATH at around $36K. Compared to 2018, it took 11 months from ATH to get there at $5.8K. This is why these signals are arriving earlier than some would expect. Of course if there was a blow-off top like in previous bull markets, then it's unlikely price would be nowhere anywhere near the 200 Week MA, nor the point of a bearish cross-over with the 50 & 100 WMAs, ie it'd take more time.Quote from: jackg on August 25, 2022, 03:03:38 PM(of course it could also mean there's greater risk because there's much higher volume now too and a weaker price than those times but the high volume/high speed trade executions do look out of place to me for a bear market - unless too many whales just got a lot bigger and are using it to attempt trades/perhaps more risky ones too). I think in many ways there is increased risk for sure, despite Bitcoin's bear markets being more predictable as time goes on - as price has a distinct pattern of recovering - the world in facing a recession, stock markets are looking unreliable, price is back below it's 200 Week moving average, etc. But ultimately, long-term investors favour high risk for high reward, so nothing changes there imo.",

It is bearish in the long-term picture and threatens to sell further, but the steam is low, so it might have a lot of false breakout at the crossover level before a final decision would be made. The daily chart is not helping either, it has been creating more short candles, which signifies that the market is not ready for any definitive movements at the moment. The answer to your question should be clearer in a couple of days after it might have break away from its sideways movement. However, I would support a reversal from the bearish crossover if there is a weekly close above it.",

There is no need to invent new indicators that worked or did not work last 2 times for bitcoin (most likely small sample error). There are indicators that work f.e. 60% times for all assets. For example rising wedge:\" In 82% of cases, the exit is bearish. - In 55% of cases, a rising wedge is a reversal pattern. - In 63% of cases, the pattern's price objective is achieved when the support line is broken. - In 53% of cases, the price makes a resistance pullback on the rising wedge's support line.\"https://www.centralcharts.com/en/gm/1-learn/7-technical-analysis/27-chart-patterns/502-rising-wedgeBear Flag Pattern (67.72% Success) The flag is a continuation pattern that can occur after a strong trending move.Double Top Pattern (75.01%)Head and Shoulders Pattern (83.04%)https://samuraitradingacademy.com/7-best-price-action-patterns/And when we are talking about moving averages. The most popular is golden cross and dead cross which is 50 day crossing 200 day. Not 50 week crossing 100 week. In fact its hard to find probability of success of this indicator on big sample (f.e stocks in last 100 years). Even if I'm wrong and 50 WMA crossing 100 WMA is a well known and well described indicator with known probability than the fact that it wasn't successful here in crypto last two times means nothing.",

Yes, Bitcoin appears to be safer now than in the 2015 and 2019 years used in the drawn for comparison but when there's so much confidence in the market I do be scared of the unknown that may happenQuote from: fzkto on August 26, 2022, 04:05:52 PMI don't know what was said beforehand from various sources, but recently the market movement reminded me very much of a bull trap. when bitcoin went up to 22k and then fell sharply below 21k.

Which could be indicative of a bear trap.You have a point due to the market being unpredictable sometimes but the OP was making comparisons drawn of some years ago to the market trend and since Bitcoin always replicates its 4years cycles there's a huge chance that we will see something happening again though the trend may be different.",

Because while it's a well known fact that these two MAs crossing bearish is bearish across asset classes, twice before it has been a bear trap. Obviously this doesn't mean it will be a bear trap again, but clearly it doesn't mean it's more likely t be bearish either, when twice before this hasn't been the case, in fact the complete opposite.If it wasn't obvious, you can take any example of long-term MAs (whether on Daily or Weekly time-frame) and their crosses reflect bullish or bearish price structure, regardless of the MA value.Quote from: adaseb on August 27, 2022, 04:41:51 PMHonestly its either a bear trap or this entire move to $25K was a big bull trap. Its hard to guage the markets.Yup, this is more of less the point here, well spotted. The move to $25K triggered a lot of long-term indicators to signal $17.5K as the low, even if not by any means a trend reversal or otherwise that price would re-test near lows. This would be the confusion many speculators have, that the low being in means price won't re-test lower levels for confirmation.At the same time, the move back above the 200 WMA could end up being massive bull trap, and instead price will sink much lower.",
