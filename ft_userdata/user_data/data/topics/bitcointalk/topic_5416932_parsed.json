  "content": "Web3 gambling project recently launched in August 2022nice2win.comThe project?nice2win is a gambling platform running on smart contracts that allows to bet ETH, MATIC or BNB on games like:Coin FlipRoll a DiceTwo DiceEtherollRouletteNo signup required so you can stay anonymous. All you need is a web3 wallet. House edge is 1%.Why play?For now, the $N2W token, which is not officially launched, is what generates the most hype for nice2win. You receive $N2W on every bet, whether you win or lose a bet. The token will be spendable on the platform and will eventually be tradeable on DEXes like Uniswap for example.Otherwise, playing on nice2win guarantees a verifiable fair experience. In contrast to what is done on web2 platforms (99% of sites advertising on this forum), it is impossible for nice2win to cheat its user or alter results because the backend part of the platform is visible to the world. Actually, gambling is actually one of the best use case for Dapps (web3 apps) on the blockchain because it is open-source.Lastly, we are a team of talented devs offering fun games and an innovative experience to stack the gains and have fun.Our specs?nice2win is deployed on the following blockchain networks:PolygonBinance Smart ChainOptimismArbitrumWith the help of smart contracts, we redefine the meaning of the expression provably fair commonly used in the community, with the following attributes:All bets are processed by hundreds of validators instead of one centralized database like the ones used on all popular web2 casinosVerify in real-time the code logic that processes your bet very unlike trusting a traditional black box casinoHave access to all-time history results for all bets ever processed by nice2win on; do not rely on the good faith of the \"house\" to store your precious data The site is now available on mobile, tablet and computer.

      "body": "Hello, and welcome to Bitcointalk. I like the idea of decentralized games and platforms like this one you present to us, but I have some questions.Is this casino completely decentralized or your team has programmed an emergency master key to control the smart contract, in case of a bug or glitch ?Does the user need to pay for a transaction fee to gamble besides the transaction fee to deposit and withdraw their money?Is there any limit on the amount of money people can gamble? Whats the minimum? Since this is a on-chain service I assume there is not an option to swap our coins for others before withdrawing.",

      "body": "@Hispo Thanks for the warm welcome. It'll be a pleasure to answer your questions.1. a)The concept of master key here is a bit ambiguous. Yes, we possess the address that owns the smart contract thus meaning we hold the key. However, there are only a limited number of functions this key allows us to use. We cannot alter an ongoing bet; the only event that would prevent a bet from not being settled would be a lack of funds in the smart contract balance or an error on the blockchain itself.The entropy itself is 100% decentralized. The role of our smart contract is only to process the bets via a function named settleBet which guarantees all games on nice2win to be completely decentralized and randomized.This might be more technical but let me list you the functions only the owner (the master key) can call:withdrawFunds = only the owner can remove the bankroll from the contractsetMaxProfit = only the owner can decide the maximum profit for all bets approveNextOwner/acceptNextOwner = only the owner can decide the next owner increaseJackpot = only the owner can increase the jackpot capacitykill = only the owner can destroy the contractsetCroupier/setSecretSigner = only the owner can decide which address settles the betFrom our perspective, these owner only functions do not jeopardize the decentralized aspect of the project. They are mainly used for protection against exploiting the bankroll, enabling the ability to shutdown the project or to transfer to a new owner.Just to be clearer on the decentralized aspect, we cannot freeze your funds and you can remain anonymous at all times b)In case there is a bug or a glitch, which is possible but unlikely (read this Medium post https://medium.com/@nice2win/archived-nice2win-proxy-audit-analysis-ba48dedcd743), we will do something like:1. Settle all remaining bets2. Kill the smart contract3. Fix the bug4. Redeploy the fixed smart contract2. There's no transaction fee to deposit or withdraw because you hold your funds in your own web3 wallet. However, there is a 1% fee for all bets and you also have to pay for gas fee on the respective blockchain. Right now, the gas fee on the Optimism blockchain would be around 0.05$ per transaction.3. The current minimum amount of money to bet with is 0.001 ETH or 1 MATIC or 0.05 BNB.4. Since you don't deposit/withdraw on nice2win, we don't offer swapping services, although we do recommend some on our FAQ (https://nice2win.com/faq)",

      "body": "Nice additional web3 casino but this gambling board only allowed casino that use Bitcoin as currency. Your thread might move on altcoin discussion board if you don’t have plan to accept Bitcoin in the future.And also can we verify that the result is probably fair as normal gambler that doesn’t have enough knowledge on code? User nowadays are relying on the casino license to check whether they are reputable or not and casino without license or anonymous usually only get less interest here since centralized casino is also offering house games that has a probably fair feature aside from there games coming from 3rd party provider.",

I hope you continue working on it.I would suggest you to change the sound of the coin flip game when the player selects head or tails, I personally think it would be better if you use more subtle sound effects, in this case something like a small bell sound or a metallic sound (as a coin would make when hitting a hard surface). An option to increase or decrease the general volume of these sound effects with be useful as well, since I had the speakers at high volume and this caught off guard.Are you going to add more blockchains to your casino?, I was expecting to see Ethereum as a general option as is BNB, but it seems it is only available for one of the games.",

The option to decrease or increase the volume already exists if you click on the cog in the top right of the website.As for the blockchains, all our games currently work on Optimism, Polygon, BSC (BNB) and Arbitrum.

      "body": "@Coin_traderThank you for the reply!We are currently implementing the Stacks blockchain which enables smart contract on Bitcoin so we will accept BTC soon. You can verify that the result is provably fair by reading the audit we posted on our Medium and verifying the smart contract we deployed on chain is the same.Concerning your point about the casino license, centralized casinos have the potential to rig the odds (you are bluepilled if you don’t think this happens already, no matter how reputable a casino is). Players are entering bets with probabilities of winning that are lower than publicly displayed; this is reality so most users would be ill-advised to trust only looking at license. Morever, we are adding house games as soon as we're done coding it (roulette 2 weeks ago).Can I respectfully ask this thread be moved back to \"Gambling\" as we will accept BTC very soon.",
