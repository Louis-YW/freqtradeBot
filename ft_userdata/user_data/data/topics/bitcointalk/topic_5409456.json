  "content": "Global inflation has proven to have a strong effect on Bitcoin these days and the US inflation reports are taking the lead. It has the strongest influence on Bitcoin whether it is a positive or negative report and it explains the recent soar in the price of the crypto. The Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a lower CPI and Core CPI on Wednesday at 0.0% and 0.3% respectively, which made Bitcoin rose and might make it gain strength till the end of August as it has suggested an end or temporary halt to the ever-soaring inflation in the US.Furthermore, the CPI, which is the change in the price of the goods and services purchased in the US and the Core CPI, which is almost the same as CPI, except that the prices of foods and energy are excluded are both good inflation gauges and have been on the bullish path since the beginning of this year. But Wednesday's reports caught investors by surprise and excites the Bitcoin market. The data would have a lasting bullish effect on Bitcoin.Keynotes: High inflation reports were the major reason Bitcoin sold this year, so low inflation reports would push it up. I suggest a bullish trend for Bitcoin till the end of August. Also, continue to buy the crypto in September if the report of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics is negative for the CPI and Core CPI in the month. I will update the values in September.Good luck to you!",

You would realize that I referenced the inflation influence on Bitcoin and also used the latest report of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics as a case study and also speculated how the recent decrease in inflation could help Bitcoin rise till September. This might happen especially if the CPI and Core CPI in next month's reports show negative readings too. So, the post contains the long and short-term effects of inflation on Bitcoin.",
