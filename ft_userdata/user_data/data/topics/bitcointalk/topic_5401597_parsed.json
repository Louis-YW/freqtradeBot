  "content": "Blueshift is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a new-generation crypto asset management protocol based on liquidity portfolios. Blueshift protocol is based on an expanded Automated Market Maker (AMM) algorithm that provides exchange price calculations and liquidity flows gauging. Blueshift deployed its cutting edge protocols on the Milkomeda DeFi ecosystem of the Cardano network.Unlike traditional AMM protocols, Blueshift uses portfolios to hold liquidity and lists of accepted tokens in portfolios are managed by the community of protocol users. Liquidity providers can invest any of these tokens and acquire shares of the whole token portfolio. With this, LPs agree that their tokens can be freely exhanged within the portfolio so that the actual owned assets will vary over time.Liquidity portfolios and virtual pairs create numerous advantages for liquidity providers and traders. Among them are low price slippage, low impermanent loss, decentralized portfolio management - possibility to define token balances in portfolios through a community-driven process.Blueshift's native token is BLUES, a Cardano Native Token (CNT)Â  BLUES token holders will be able to participate in decentralized portfolio management by voting for adding / removing tokens and changing their weights.Learn more: blueshift dot fi",
