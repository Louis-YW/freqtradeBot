Some people may not refer bitcoin as cryptocurrencies because there are over 19000 cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is bitcoin but others are altcoins. Altcoins are more risky, many are shady and many are leading to scam, so bitcoiners prefer to exclude bitcoin from them because it is not centralized like the altcoins that called themselves decentralized but not decentralized.",

If you use translation for this, it may be a good idea to look for the subforum in your language, maybe somebody can explain there better.If you refer to trading/speculating and exchange between Bitcoin and altcoins, then you're wrong.If you refer to Bitcoin as being a coin (coin = a tool/helper for exchanging your work for various goods and services), you're not far from the truth. And I'll go on this path.Quote from: Agathamay on June 23, 2022, 11:30:54 AMAm still trying to understand the clear difference between the both and know how to place them in their separate parts..Bitcoin is \"the firstcomer\". Bitcoin has the strongest network (so overly expensive to break it that it doesn't worth to even try). Bitcoin is accepted in most places. Bitcoin is the \"base currency\" in most cases one wants to buy altcoins. Bitcoin price is fluctuating a lot (in both directions), making many tell that it's a risky investment. Altcoins' prices fluctuate even more. Also the vast majority of altcoins are clonecoins/shitcoins, scams, project that bring nothing new or lie about what's there, just to get you invest (and lose) your money on them.Bitcoin is not only a coin, it's also an investment as you can see. And same goes for altcoins.But while people call them all cryptocurrencies (even though some are just tokens, not even proper coins), they are highly different.In the same way people were using sea shells as coins at some point in the past, just to find out that it's not a proper tool for the job, also most altcoins are not the proper tool for the job and should be avoided.This is imho what makes the difference between Bitcoin and crypto.",

The reason Bitcoin seems so pronounced is because, it is the pioneer cryptocurrency, it is truly decentralized and haven't broken faith with most of its faithful since inception. When we look at altcoins, a lot of them turns out to be scams being pump and dump coins where, the developers just generate revenue off there coin offerings and leave.

The family is so united such that is the head is sick, other members of the family will be sick with him. If the head eventually becomes richer, the wealth will reach other members of the family.

      "body": "Cryptocurrency in its strict definition means a currency protected by cryptography. Bitcoin is one such currency, but is importantly also decentralised. Because the Bitcoin can't be hacked from the blockchain, thanks to cryptography, or confiscated by central authority, thanks to decentralisation, it has found significant success as a functional currency. Not all cryptocurrency is decentralised, though, and that is an important reason to distinguish Bitcoin, for example, from others. The emergence of not just a new currency but a new and more technically complex kind of currency is historically significant. People who don't appreciate this and get involved only for a quick profit will probably be the ones who don't have the best time in the Bitcoin market. Because Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to go anything like mainstream and start finding success that might compare with established mediums of exchange (currencies), and we intuitively seem to know this is a big deal, we speak about Bitcoin and altcoins. Instead of using this more helpful term for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, some influencers (like Max Keiser) have taken to using 'crypto' or 'cryptocurrency' to refer to altcoins, but I don't think this is helpful because of the technical definitions. He should maybe stick to using 'shitcoins' for altcoins or crypto other than Bitcoin, but, besides all that ... The main point has to be the huge historical importance of Bitcoin as a decentralised, potentially universal form of currency that is instant, private and secure. It is a massive deal and if it really wasn't capable of changing the face of money for everyone in the long-term, as most cryptocurrencies aren't, then the big players on Wall St and in the media wouldn't be throwing so much FUD at it.",
