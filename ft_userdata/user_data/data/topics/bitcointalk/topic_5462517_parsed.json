If you analyse it unbiasedly, most projects in the  industry today are centered around enrichment, they might promise to profer real-life solutions but end up fading out even before they started. Memecoins only guilt is the admission that it is shitty and possesses no real-life use case. Personally I do memecoins to spice up my investments and i find them interesting.",

They have a community, and they're even following their roadmap. Upon further research, I found it's already trading in exchanges. Since it's the first of its kind, I think Memevengers is worth giving the benefit of the doubt.",

No, this is only another form of shit token that appears again in this crypto world. Sorry that you are a meme coin lover. I am not and I am talking about the fact. A coin meme especially a new one like this will not be able to become a crypto superhero, even the Doge and Shiba Inu classmates who are already big now won't be that awesome. Not underestimating, but that's the fact. Lots of meme coins have sprung up and they are only hype projects. They might be able to skyrocket in price, pump as high as they can after listing on certain exchanges. But look carefully, how long can they survive? And how much is their ability to compete and survive in the crypto market? I'm sure, after they skyrocket to their highest point, eventually they will fall and won't be able to go back up like they were at ATH again. Even then, it only became shit coins which ended up being dead coins in wallets.",

Won't be surprised if it's the next best thing on everyone's TL on crypto twitter. If anyone wants to enjoy heroic movies or comics, they can binge it instead. Constantly putting out pointless memecoins doesn't make a lot of sense if you think about it objectively. It might even be the reason why we're yet to see bitcoin or any other major alt gaining mass adoption.",

Once hype is been built up then it would really be scattering like wildfire and this is why lots of people would really be having those thoughts that they might really be that investing into it. We cant really just ignore that meme coins could really give out that kind of opportunity on earning big or in profitsbecause we know on how fast these coins pump and also eventually die. This is why you should really be that careful.Speaking about Era of crypto then this isnt only considered on meme, there's no way that beating up those typical Layer 1 coins that sitting up on the top ranks.There's no way that it would really be able to overtaken. They might able to build up some hype but it would really be just temporal.",

I mean if it had a game, factions, market, economy then maybe, just MAYBE, it'd be an interesting development. But multiple coins that we're going to assume are \"heroes\" and have a connection with each other? Boring, not to mention no value at all. In the first place it has no foundation, other than being a meme. And you know what meme does over time? They die. Maybe go up every once in a while, but in general, they just die off never to be seen again. The same could be said for meme coins, especially for ones that didn't reach the level of SHIBA/DOGE popularity. In the end, people in the crypto scene can be considered as investors, they don't buy something which is, in essence, only what the community assumes. They want something solid, guaranteed, and is profitable.",
