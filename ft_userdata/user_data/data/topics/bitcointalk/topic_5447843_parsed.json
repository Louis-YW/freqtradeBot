Thanks.I will say it is one of the good coins that you can buy, you can even stake it on your noncustodial wallet and earn around 4.3% APR. After the whole bear market, its marketcap is still in billion dollars, having over $13 billion in marketcap as of present. All-time-high was over $3 and now $0.38. The good advice is to start to buy the coins now.",

They may have the list of projects but its still ETH that is used widely.There is one if I'm not mistaken, I forget what they officially called it. But I have seen predictions on ADA in the next bull run that it won't even reach $1? But If I'm not mistaken, last bull run it reaches as high as $3.00. So not sure why the prediction for ADA is like that. Although we all know that this is just prediction and it could be just a hit or miss.Personally, I'm thinking of investing on ADA, not huge money but I still hope that it could give us a good profit and hit a new all time high.I remember the last time, I didn't invest on it others advise me, and it went nuts the last bull run.",

Thanks.There was a good hype before for ADA but I can’t see any right now because they have no more good updates and they are claiming to be an ETH killer before but look at them now. Though you can still see their project as a good one but if you want to have a more profitable investment, I’d rather choose ETH over ADA.",

Previously Cardano was just a single blockchain, just like Bitcoin. But over time, and the development of smart contracts became a demand from various crypto developers, Cardano developed a blockchain with a smart contract system.",

I wonder if Hoskinson is still on this thing but I think they're being biting the dust of other layers that are out in the market, too many Ethereum killers right now, but none of them can kill it.",

      "body": "One common criticism of Cardano is that the cryptocurrency is still in its development and growth stage, and there is still a lot of research and development work being done. Some critics also argue that the focus on academic research and formal verification has resulted in slow progress in implementing new features and updates compared to other blockchain platforms.Another criticism is that the Cardano network has not yet achieved widespread adoption, and there are concerns about its scalability and ability to handle a large number of transactions. Additionally, some people have raised questions about the governance model of Cardano and the role of the Cardano Foundation in managing the development and growth of the network.It's important to note that these criticisms are not unique to Cardano and are common among many blockchain projects. As with any investment, it's important to carefully consider the risks and potential rewards before investing in Cardano or any other cryptocurrency.",

We all knew if a project gaining traction if theres a lot of it everywhere but none means no interesting event happening on them now or in the past time.Not so fan of it, I think never had a chance to have this token even for trading purposes.",

But now it's down like more than 87%. So not sure if there is still that big buzz on this project in the next bull run, or will other projects take over and the gain might not be as big as the previous one. Unless it can repeat itself, then another 20% growth will mean $6 or close to it. Not impossible, but hard to accomplished, just saying.",

      "body": "What I know about Cardano is a decentralized blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and sustainable infrastructure for smart contracts and decentralized applications. It was created by Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum, in 2015. Cardano uses a proof of stake consensus mechanism, which is less energy intensive than the proof of work used by other cryptocurrencies.Cardano has gained popularity among investors and developers alike, as it offers several features that set it apart from other blockchain platforms. This includes its layered architecture, which allows for easier updates and maintenance, and its focus on academic research and peer review to ensure platform security and scalability.In terms of market performance, Cardano has experienced significant growth in recent years. As of April 2023, it is one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, with a market cap of over $100 billion USD. Please note that like all cryptocurrencies, Cardano's value is fluid and may fluctuate based on factors such as market demand and adoption. I hope this information was helpful in answering your questions about Cardano.",

Thanks.Cardano (ADA) project was very ambitious and its main idea was centered on taking advantage of the high Ethereum fees and providing acceptable stakes for subscribers and thus continuing to grow and attract projects to the network.The success of Ethereum to switch to Proof of Stake was the final blow to that project, and with low fees and a second layer like Polygon, they were the main reasons for the absence of new ideas about the project.Even their staking is no longer valuable compared to Ethereum.",
