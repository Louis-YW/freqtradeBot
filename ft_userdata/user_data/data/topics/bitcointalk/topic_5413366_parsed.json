That is a huge drop and most likely bitcoin may stay at $20000 to $25000 for a while. If it falled below $20000, there would possibly be another correction back to $20000. What is likely more possible after a long time is people to awake to buying bitcoin. Bitcoin price will rise, this is one of the best time to just buy and hold.",

Most beginners who have invested with very little knowledge of the fluctuations in the market and possibly might have enmeshed with way much that they could afford to lose would make the mistake of selling like you did. I would have too but, thanks to my close attachment with the form that have tought me several lessons. Even if I were to sell and I still sell, it's surely going to be a slight portion that wouldn't matter much on the whole and I've always got plans of replenishing it when I have any cash to spare. Withdrawing from my holdings is more like taking a loan that needs refunds.",

I don't feel anything again, neither do i have any attitude about it, what's there to have an attitude when you already know of its short term volatility, and you know you have to hold and if you can't, don't invest, because waiting for it to be a money making scheme for you will be much to your chagrin later on. Selling your bitcoin is not a terrible stuff, bitcoin is meant to be bought, sold and spent, you cannot hold for eternity, if you have sold you can surely buy again, and if you have never bought before, you can surely start buying now or anytime you are ready, everyone should do what works for them.",

The same thing is happening today because people are disappointed that Bitcoin did not reach the price of $100 000, and now they are waiting for some new opportunity in the hope that the price will go down even more. What is important is that people learn something from their past actions and not repeat the same mistakes, and if you think you made a mistake in 2018, then you have a new chance to correct it today. It's never too late for a new start, and if you look historically, Bitcoin has always been a very profitable investment - although only for those who understand what they're actually investing in.",

I forgot that there is nothing wrong with me starting as soon as possible.There's nothing wrong with you because you're just one of the many that have sold during 2018 and even when it's at its lowest, like when it's reached $3k. I'm sure that too many have been hiding and don't tell anybody that they're one of those that has sold their whole bitcoins at that low price.Quote from: johnsaributua on September 13, 2022, 07:03:57 AMI want to know what is your attitude with the bitcoin price today? Don't be too emotional when you know the game already. Like if you've been here for many considering years of watching the market, up and down.

It seems you regret what you do from the past since you base things on current level, but actually nothing wrong really wrong with that because at first place we don't know about if the price pump. What most important thing to di since we already see that bitcoin really recover is to take good decisions on our trades and always do good actions especially when we see a bear market condition since we are sure that red days are just temporary season on the market and if we are doing action like buying when market is in bad shape for sure we can earn huge pile of money especially if bitcoin reach for its another ATH.",

The wave of highs that I always see after the decline makes me also sure that there will be new price highs created. But many current price predictions still tend to fall deeper. adi to anticipate that the DCA strategy will make us feel calm. What's certain is not to do with all your money. Buy it gradually. In addition in the DCA process the most important thing is patience.  It is very rare for a person to be patient for old figures and that requires practice. Because I am also very difficult to restrain my emotions to take advantage immediately. So we just need to be patient for the Bitcoin and Altcoin cycle.",

If you trust this cryptocurrency and believe bitcoin can make you a profit in the long term, then don't think too much, just make a decision and buy again. The huge price swings are all part of the process of unearthing speculators and separating investment wheat from chaff. The main point is that there will be cycles, and when the time is right for another bull run, bitcoin will again rise to become a highly profitable asset. So I think it's a good time to start again (this is my personal opinion, not financial advice).My personal belief is that the price will rise exponentially, but do not expect to get rich over night. If you want to invest in Bitcoin again, invest small amounts you can afford to loose, try not to go all in. Don't repeat your mistakes from the past.Never FOMO, don't sell your bitcoin when in loss and keep your cool!",

I am still keeping an eye on the price, but I do not let any sort of price fall/surge get into me.Just keep holding like usual, OP.I do not really care how long we're going to stay in 20k, it is just like how I did not care when Bitcoin fell back to 3-4k back around 2018-2019 (can't entirely remember what year).",

This is inevitable with the dollar and other currencies plummeting. It is easier to start again for those who already experience and see how the market flows. There is a time for some dump and pump that we need to handle to be able to have profit in bitcoin. Many lose interest in bitcoin after 2018 dump since they didn’t think that bitcoin can still recover after it set another ATH, not knowingly there will be more influencers and big companies who became interested and gives hype again in bitcoin that set a much bigger ATH. The price dump is normal now due to different events happening in many countries as well knowing how high the price of bitcoin before it gets in this bear season. So starting again to accumulate some bitcoin to hold can be a good start to newbies or to any one who wants to enter in bitcoin again.",
