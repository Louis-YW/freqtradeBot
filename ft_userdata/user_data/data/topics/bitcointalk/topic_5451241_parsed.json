I deposited $350, I took the bonus that I lost and then I made another deposit of $270 from which I managed to win $1250. Today I was refused withdrawal on the grounds that I have several accounts, which is completely untrue.Scammers Profile Link:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3515379Reference Link:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5450567.0Amount Scammed: 0.043 BTC/$1250Payment Method: BitcoinProof of Payment:https://blockstream.info/tx/dbbe803c08b2ca58b7fa999f726a95645cfce5655c67936cb63c163e25c51f5ehttps://blockstream.info/tx/af4b21144205b35417cd27f2722488f667e76fc768e5da62f3ce2da19ad0c67fProof of rejected payment:https://imgur.com/a/dm0LWMO",

Whoever that user you deemed trustworthy enough to review your evidences, you'll just put them into a tight spot. If they see the evidences and favored into your side, the OP will get triggered and accuses that user as part of your team, a liar, or the likes. If they favored OP and deemed your evidences is not strong enough, you'll say the user is not trustworthy.Are you registered on any ADR? CasinoGuru? AskGamblers? Or --only-- if you're confident that the evidences will not be detrimental to your security system, you can share it here in the open for everybody to review.",

I never had more then 1 account. Also i never won anything from your bonus. I lost it and made another deposit without bonus.Ok we will expose him :He first opened an account BCR312 he won $1581 and he request the withdraw to be paid here bc1qd30hjnhkwqcpn36jf52gvencp9203a9sngt208 proof of the request https://imgur.com/0SDL8Zl we paid BCR312 the $1581 because he won fair and square A couple of days after he opened a new account to claim again the 200% welcome bonus he requested 1 deposit address  bc1qxlut8xnf5jkeghqz07s9fuqct2yysv6za3jg4q proofhttps://i.imgur.com/TxKZMuR.pngThe problem BCR316 sent bitcoin from bc1q0dhu6c6xzgc692t0kjze7csmf57g5wly8pvz53 to our site deposit address and bc1q0dhu6c6xzgc692t0kjze7csmf57g5wly8pvz53 got his bitcoins from bc1qd30hjnhkwqcpn36jf52gvencp9203a9sngt208 proofhttps://mempool.space/address/bc1qd30hjnhkwqcpn36jf52gvencp9203a9sngt208After that he made a second deposit request from our site now our system gave him this address bc1q67ny3hal8clgkrujls70ujj6cj8vdp99esa5l9 now he deposited from bc1qc98u8u5armr33tfjdr7vcjma8vyf2the450wmk butbc1q0dhu6c6xzgc692t0kjze7csmf57g5wly8pvz53 sent money to bc1qc98u8u5armr33tfjdr7vcjma8vyf2the450wmkIn resume you use your BCR312 withdraw address to fund a new account to claim again the 200% welcome bonus Thanks to scammers like this cody we have to reduce the welcome bonus from 200% to 100% so we are not going to get new scammers trying to exploit our site",
