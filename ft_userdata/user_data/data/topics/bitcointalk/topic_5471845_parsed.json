They compare their boyfriend to other guys that lavish and spend money extravagantly on their girlfriend without knowing the source of their wealth or income, most of them boldly even prefer yahoo boys because they feel they are the people that can meet all their needs without thinking about the outcome of their decisions. Now in the quest for their struggling boyfriend to meet up their demands, they will start involving in criminal and fraudulent crimes just to meet up the demands of their girlfriend. Until we accept and cherish the little we have and hope for a better future, such stories of these nature might still keep on reoccurring.",

December don reach so everyone is hustling for their December funds, and this season dirty things dey happen. Fraud, organ harvesters, ritualist na this season them dey operate most, just because you see your mate buying car building house you con decide to join the big boys trend and na illegal way. The only thing wey I fit blame the victim be say, you're dating a guy he has money, latest phone come he buy latest hair come he buy and you couldn't find the source of the wealth, nawa. But sometimes sef girls them too do, as this thing happen so girls still dey find ritualist, to date to show that no lesson learnt. I dey feel say na the pressure wey girls dey give boys and the attitude wey broke boys dey receive wan make them dey do all this evil act. The thing be say make everybody dey careful, because girls too can do this evil act no be only boys o the world don turn to something else wey human go gather dirty mind.",

Why everyone is shouting and talking about this very one is because the young man was caught and that's why it looks as if it's happening for the first time while it's been happening but because we didn't catch them and when they come in public with their luxurious cars, accessories and oppression lifestyle we turn out to envy them knowing fully that those things were gotten from a fraudulent and ritualist means but because they were not caught when they were doing it it doesn't matter to us anymore, we don't ask questions about the source of their riches. Any one that attempt to ask is tagged as enemy of progress.The society is to be blame in all of this, young women have been made to believe that they don't have to hustle for their own money, they now live with self entitlement mentality that another has to work hard for them to eat and live a comfortable lifestyle. The hustling guy on the street is regarded as one with no bright future,  too expectations has been laid on the boy child so now those that have lost their conscience and humanity are now doing the unthinkable to live the rich life as society expects of them. How sad we all know the truth but pretend not to.",

I waka jam the post for Twitter yesterday night and I dey think of making post about it. As I visit the board this morning I con see the post already for our board. My brother forget this thing wey you dey talk. Yes, I know say some parents dey pressure dem pikin but no parents ask you to go kill person or engage in any fraud. As the OP put am, na so e be. Na just lack of contentment together with greed dey push dem into this. No be parents pressure. To justify am, Some of them dey even leave house after it work for them so nobody go disturb them. If na parents pressure, dem go stay back to care for the parents. One thing with this our generation be say we are in haste to make money while we know that we no fit rush time until it reach your turn. Imagine someone in his early or mid 20s thinking about driving the latest car. Why you no go do ritual when you dey think of wetin pass your brain. The comparison wey parents dey do na to make you no lose guard and become lazy. When the pressure is too much, please think of anything positive to change the story.The important thing to note is that, the day you plant the seed is not the day you eat the fruit. The process na gradual and you no need frustrate yourself to bypass the process. The only time wey I go blame the parents na when dem see pikin with suspicious things and dem turn blind eyes without investigating.",
