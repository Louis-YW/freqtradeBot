In the past week, it hasn’t dipped below $90K, not even once. Kindly check the price history.https://www.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/historical-data",

      "body": "I think you mean $98k?  Well good luck convincing people to buy near ATH though. It's a very tough hit or miss because many people are going to FOMO without direct knowledge or evidence that BTC could go any higher, and others are going to think it's too high of an entry price and would rather wait.Both sides have their rights and I would say especially the more cautious folks are right to want to wait. Because there's no direct sign the world economy could be doing any better or worse. With globals markers moving as normal, there's no narrative to drive BTC much higher now. Adoption is lower than the bolm a few years ago, institutional adoption is already high on market access etc. So there's little the Trump administration could to help crypto even more. So the prospect of Trump being better on crypto doesn't seem THAT good to me to justify prices going up as much as they did. Who knows though.",

It's been here more than a decade and a half and still, many haven't invested on it. But you're right that it has really come a lot and longer way from where it is right now. The maturity that it has shown to the people made significant gains that it has got for each holder that have been seriously holding it for so long. And for that reason, all of those that haven't matured from this market yet, didn't took profits and still holding, I'm glad that you are still holding it because it's completely a different matter for me. I've sold way too early before the last 2021 bull run has happened and there's still sort of regret from it but I've learned a lot. So for sure on this cycle, many will learn as well.",

Bitcoin has really come a long way and is now matured enough for everyone to invest Bitcoin is a great asset, I think we can agree on that given that we are on a bitcoin forum, but whether an asset is a good investment depends greatly on the price at which you can buy it, getting bitcoin for nearly 100k is not really the best move when just one year ago you could get it for much cheaper, besides the profile of the trader that is interested in investing in bitcoin right now is not someone that wants to hold long term, which would be the best justification for that move, but someone that wants fast profits, and while I think the bull market can still give us great profits, such a move is way more risky now than what it was just a few months ago.",

The problem about Trump is that he never acts in the best of the country's interest, but in the best of his personal interest and those two things aren't always congruent. He said he was pro crypto, but he also said he would stop the war even before he gets inaugurated. It won't happen. And pay attention to the detail, he said he is pro cryptocurrency, but I can't specifically remember that he said Bitcoin will be supported. I only recall how he was slowly positioning a potential crypto company founded by himself and his friends and family or whoever else was involved. Trump wants to support things he can control, and he can't control Bitcoin for the most part.",

The reason is simple, it has an economy, its adoption is still wide open, and it has high potential in the future. Although we can't avoid its price volatility, but if someone understands how to invest in Bitcoin and only puts money that they can afford to lose, it should not be a problem for them to invest immediately.

Because this will take a lot of time and they will not be confident enough to invest when they see the price of bitcoin drop.

I think now a lot of people fall back into old patterns because Bitcoin is going through a small correction and now everyone thinks it is the perfect time to wait and catch the dip, but then the next day FOMO could break out again because Bitcoin goes back up by $5,000. That is why I think people should make a fundamental decision whether they Bitcoin is something or not and if their answer is yes, then make a plan and get into it. Some will be lucky getting the moment right when they wait, and some will get lucky if they don't wait. Bitcoin still has a level of volatility that makes it impossible to catch the perfect highs and lows. As was said before here somewhere: time in the market > timing the market.",
