  "content": "I am reviewing Bitcoin security standard.  There are many reports out they that their Bitcoin Wallet has been hacked by hackers.  Well, nothing is impossible but I think all the hack went on when you put your Bitcoin in an exchange's custody. It could be the exchange employees has stolen the btc and blame to an external hackers. For as far as I am concerned about the matter, I have discovered three different way you can protect your Bitcoin. Make sure your Bitcoin is in your own custody. Make sure you do not forget your private key. Make sure you do not delete your Bitcoin  Wallet from your computer hard drive. My advise is make multiple copies of hour Wallet and keep it safe. Now - how not to lose your Bitcoin ? We need is an encrypted secure Wallet which is compatible with KYC.  When you buy Bitcoin, you need this Wallet. This new Wallet I have designed is completely secure and weather proof.  Weather proof mean absolutely secure and no hacker can ever hack into your wallet. I have tested over the last 6 years. Yes, if my Bitcoin in my new Wallet no body can hack it. If I forget the private key, I always can regenerate the same private key. If a thief steal your computer they see the btc but cannot move it to another Wallet.  If lost the Bitcoin Wallet because your computer has crashed, no problem, you click KYC in a particular place and you can get your Wallet back.  If a group of robbers like Dread Porate Robert, hijack your Bitcoin Wallet and your computer and force you to reveal the private key and they manage to transfer the coin, then still you can get it back but you need to file a criminal case to the police. The Bitcoin Police will provide you the KYC code for your Stollen BTC then the police in your country can find out the stollen btc for you and return to you. All this is in my new KYC Lock Wallet.  To protect your Bitcoin get lost you need this KYC encrypted Lock Wallet.",

Do you really understand the meaning of a decentralized system and KYC? You should consider making a research before any further due. Well I will just hit the nail on the head. Bitcoin should not be stored in Third party wallets, where you get to do KYC similar to exchanges. Not your keys not your coins. And I wonder what you meant by your coins can be recovered after they are stolen.? It's so obvious this isn't even a Bitcoin wallet. The more reason why your coins will get stolen in the first place, is when you consider using a wallet that may be compromised since it's no longer follows the standards of a real bitcoin wallet.",

There's a chance an exchange will freeze your account for one reason on another, demand various documents from you, perform an exit scam or simply become a victim of a devastating attack.To protect one's coins, one simply needs a non-custodial wallet, a secure virus-free device, and safely stored copies of the passphrase. Nice and fairly simple, no need for any KYC. There are always some risks (mainly probably not of a hack but of losing access to one's own money), but by having a good strategy one can minimize those risks.",

I was just so eager that you would go in details about the possibilities without undermining that you are a beginner rank here in the forum. Finally you failed to tonus how the exchange operatives has always been the one responsible for the lost of funds right there in the exchange platforms, you also talked about letting us know a solid wallet you built/created which is very much authentic and reliable with a zero access to thefts at all means trying to steal your Bitcoin and also how not to bother if after misplacing your seed phrases even at when your electronic devices crashes. And there also, you failed to make mention about the wallet and how possible all the hyping about your so wallet seed retrieval and Privacies are possible to be reality.To me, you ended up paying things unrealistic since none was proven so OP, disclaim to know how to secure your bitcoin assets and how to keep your holdings privately and secured by raising a threat there in the beginners and help board where you can learn more.My advice: Do not portray of knowing it all when you barely knows anything and even if you knows, act like you do not know so that you can acquire more of knowledges to take you on a far journey. Be submissive at learning, especially critical and technical facts pertaining your goals.",
