The claim was for infringementof copyright in the Bitcoin White Paper. Dr Wright secured Judgment in default ofacknowledgement of service and defence by the Order of HHJ Hodge QC dated 28 June2021, which includes an injunction preventing the defendants from infringing copyrightin the Bitcoin White Paper, whether by making the Paper available for download or inany other way. To the extent necessary, the status of that Order can be considered at theForm of Order hearing following hand down of this Judgment",

But they will also see the mistakes that CSW made so if they will claim themselves as Satoshi they won't follow the same path that CSW followed.

And his technobabble, not as a superior intellect putting him above all other experts, but as a cover for his lies. Everyone here who has been following the events surrounding this fraud known as faketoshi always knew about the outcome of this case. What is interesting though is that the price of BSV has not gone down, on the contrary, it has been slowly and steadily increasing again. Even though the price of BSV is down by more than 96 percent it again shows an upward trend. This indicates that fools still believe that he is the original creator of Bitcoin and that his legacy will prevail. I would love to see more cases brought against this fraud and his team so they end up in a cell, unable to access the fortune they made with fake claims.",

Honestly, it's refreshing to see a judge being straightforward in his statements, instead of using legal jargon without any specifics. He's talking about Wright lying repeatedly to the court about many things, with the biggest lie being that Craig is Satoshi. He also clarifies that Craig Wright isn't the author of Bitcoin whitepaper, is not the person who operated online under the name of Satoshi, and did not write early Bitcoin software.I think most of us here have already known all that, but it's good to have it officially confirmed by an esteemed judge in a country with strong judicial standards.",

He was described as a habitual liar, an unskilled forger, and an individual with low intelligence. The judgement identified how this imposter came up with conflicting lies and when he is caught he will blame unknown people for his misfortune. All the documents he forged were poorly done making it easily identifiable doctored evidence. The judge further highlighted that from his writings and oral presentation in the court he is not close to the ingenuity of Satoshi Nakamoto. I am beginning to suspect that Craig Wright is mentally unstable. I just hope that this disgraceful judgment will end this madness.",

Most of his lies related to the documents he had forged which purported to support his claim. All his lies and forged documents were in support of his biggest lie: his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.Woah. The judge couldn't be more direct and to the point.Here's an unpopular opinion: None of the evidence proves that he is not Satoshi Nakamoto. It is entirely possible that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, or that he was part of or contributed in some way to a Satoshi Nakamoto team.However, I mean \"possible\" in the same sense as that it is \"possible\" to guess a private key.",
