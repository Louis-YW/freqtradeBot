This sites used for buying and selling of Ordinal (BTC based) NFTs.Thank you for this useful warning topic.After the Galxe platform was exposed to a social engineering hack, we now find Ordswap was also hacked, But Ordswap's losses are almost nothing compared to Galaxy's losses. Based on my reading of Ordswap's XÂ  account tweets, I believe the fault lies with Netlify company, which is responsible for website development. Perhaps the hacker may have gained access to the domain data and placed a button that prompts platform users to connect their Metmask wallets to the Ordswap website. This is common on phishing sites. Those who interacted with the site after it was hacked are the people who will be exposed to risk. Otherwise, this incident did not affect the users' keys and assets and their NFTs. The Ordswap team has published a tool to help users recover the Ordswap private key through the MetaMask wallet, But I honestly don't know if this tool is helpful.",

I don't really know the cause of this and how are to trust even those wallet we used in storing our asset, don't you think one day we might wake up and noticed that our wallet has been swipe off with the rate at which hacking is going round as we are no longer safe with saving our funds in most of wallet.",

But there are no further details so who knows what exactly happened. If you are a user who connects their wallet to smart contracts regularly, it is wise to always disconnect/disallow after you finish using the website/platform. You also need to make sure you don't visit a fake website or fake contracts. Phishing or faulty smart contracts are the major attack vectors, so you should be prepared to avoid any loss. If you don't do any of that, then the risk of losing your funds will be higher.",
