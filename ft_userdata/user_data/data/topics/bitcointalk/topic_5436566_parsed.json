I think we should also talk about the little vendors too that accept bitcoin as a means of payment for services why I say so because these vendors do business on daily basis so therefore mostly very hour, they do transact which is also very important in the blockchain but these big firms do only carry out transaction mostly once and that as well but let is give cognizance to the little pretty traders who on their own decided to accept bitcoi as a means of payment, they on their own in their own little way contribute to the adoption which we have longed for  and this is very important because they are at the grassroot  so therefore it would be nice that such takes place In the more global adoption and acceptance process.",

For example, Regarding Tesla, stopped accepting bitcoin for some unexpecting reasons and they maybe start accepting bitcoin once again however even if they do that they will once again face with questions like why even they stopped accepting it before and why they start it once again.",

Since it's a tough business full of competition among each other, these professional sellers have to be creative and offer their customers different payment options. The more the better, and that is where bitcoin comes in handy.

This is more of an adoption because if we depend on big companies like tesla and the rest, it will only limit bitcoin adoption within the rich and the average person will be left with no choice but to own Bitcoin only for holding and as an asset but will not be able to pay for good and service using Bitcoin as an alternative. The whale will have more Bitcoin in their possession and they can easily manipulate the price.",

That only makes sense when you get your primary earnings in bitcoin, but that's only the case for very few people even within the bitcoin space itself. No one is really going to buy BTC for fiat just to spend it in store.And since we have quite a few crypto-powered payment cards available, does it really matter if a grocery store accepts bitcoin (and immediately exchanges it to fiat), if you can pay directly from your bitcoin balance with such card anyway? I'm guessing the difference is it requires 3rd party and KYC.",

Tesla also once accepted Bitcoin, but then Elon was made to believe that Bitcoin is causing much harm to the environment, so he decided to stop it. I'm not sure if it's truly the environment he was concerned of. Perhaps it was simply because such impression is against the way Tesla cars are marketed--as environment-friendly.I don't know which brand will be accepting Bitcoin next, but I don't care much. It's probably good enough for me that remittances of overseas workers are now safe from predators like Western Union and others, or that small retail stores are accepting Bitcoin payments, or that people are saving in a currency that is not fast devalued by the people we're supposed to trust.",

If it's about companies in general, it's even harder to follow and check because it can be a local brand which may not make the international news.It's great when big brands start accepting Bitcoin because it boosts its publicity and reputation. However, I'm more with a couple of others in the thread who are more excited about local companies selling everyday stuff accepting Bitcoin than big brands of expensive things like cars. In my country, a popular pharmacy chain has recently announced accepting Bitcoin payments, for example. Unfortunately, it's only via a Binance account, but it's still a step forward.",
