      "body": "It will be safer if the Facebook page bear the same name as the forum username. In that case, people will know it is from the same person. The safe thing to do is to add the statement, \" as I have posted in my Facebook page before\" then add the link if possible. I am saying this from experience in the academic world... the issue of plagiarism is a serious one and it is not taken likely anywhere. Since the consequences here is immediate, it is good to exercise caution so you don't get your account messed up.",

But the best way you can go about it is to include the Facebook link or where you copied it from.You can see people on this forum that they will quote themselves and still include the link in the quote, I use to do it and it makes me feel that it is better that way than not to include the link. Adding link will not affect your posting quality but makes your post more authentic and it gives you high chance of not getting banned.",

Because the post don enter public internet except you go first delete the post for ur FB den u nor need reference again.It is plagiarism Sir, please don't mislead the OP, as Charles-Tim has said, the person must include the link of the information for users to verify it. Because not everyone in the forum knows that you are the one who posted it in the facebook or the on the social Media. And if you didn't put the link and brought the article to the forum then it becomes self plagiarism and you must be ban. therefore, whenever you brought something from places be a self written material or from another person.I will want you to check this article. https://www.scribbr.com/plagiarism/self-plagiarism/ QuotePlagiarism often involves using someone else’s words or ideas without proper citation, but you can also plagiarize yourself.
