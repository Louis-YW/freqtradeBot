You launched a demo, you didn't raise much fund on the last token sale, and then, later on, your demands raise, so you decide to \"upgrade\" the token to do another sale? Wouldn't the statement that your demand is growing implies you'll begin to generate profit with that current state?

My question was your claim of increasing demand and to have a second token sale for it, which puzzles me, because if you're in such condition, you can gather your fund for whatever purpose it is from the profit gained from people [or, the demands] using your service.",
