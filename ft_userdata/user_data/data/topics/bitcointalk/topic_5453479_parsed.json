So, Bitcoin doesn't offer lending services like banks do.But can someone borrow Bitcoin? Well, in this forum, there are a few individual-managed Bitcoin lending services.

So I'd say a lot of people are stupid trying to compare bitcoin to banks. They always say that banks should be eliminated when banking is a field that provides us with hundreds of services, not just savings. Too many people have no knowledge of economics and are stupidly crazy about bitcoin. Bitcoin is the perfect choice for investment, protecting privacy, but it cannot compare to the entire banking industry.If there is any service that lends money to bitcoin, it is also a centralized service run by humans, not bitcoin.",

Getting BTC loans by using altcoins as collateral seems kinda pointless to me. The altcoin prices might collapse faster than the BTC price, so the lender has to liquidate the loan and the sell the collateral fast. This makes the whole process more like crypto trading, rather than borrowing. Also the interest rates for crypto loans seem to be higher than the fiat loans.

Â If yes, what is some criteria that may be required? I never took a loan from the Internet. But yes, some centralized exchanges offer loans. The main criteria to get a loan from them is you have to provide them collateral, and they accept altcoins as collateral. This is not the main part if you care about privacy. You have to provide KYC on centralized exchanges. So, if you have valid collaterals like altcoins, You can try to get a loan from the Lending section with collateral. Since you are a newbie, don't ask for a non-collateral loan. Your request will be rejected, and you may get tagged as well.",
