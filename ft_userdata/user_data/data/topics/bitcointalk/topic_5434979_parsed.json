So possibly someone is playing with their holdings but I have my own doubts that I would not reveal for now.In either case dont even look back at these coins, forget about investing a single satoshi, they are dead coins and they are not coming back - because once a name gets ruined in this industry there is no coming back to clean up the image.Rather focus on bitcoin as it is going up, sell when you need to cover yourself and buyback at the next bear market.",

I've made a ton of money trading dead and crashing coin bounces. They are specially good for trading because you don't need to hodl them. You just trade the waves and leave them behind. Ulnile coins like chainlink that slowly loses investors interest, when they have good fundamentals those are more long time hodling, not for chasing pumps. At least you can take comfort that you can accumulate chainlink in peace.",

I can't say exactly why those shitcoins are pumping alongside btc but you should not forget those shitcoins are only for trading now, so probably some group of whales pumping the price to later dump on investors who knows. When the proper bull market sets in, Link will have it's moment.",

It's not surprising if they bounce once the retail investors or casuals starts riding the hype. They will look for that next heavily dumped coin or token and repeat the process.Agree with what you have said.However, whales would prefer to choose a top coin that has fallen and does not have a large buying volume because it is easier to manipulate and trick many traders or investors into getting into the coin.Once a lot starts to enter, the price can increase rapidly.That way the whales will carry out a sale on all their assets so as to generate large profits easily and in the end the traders and investors who enter only become victims of the whales.So every swordsman or investor has to be careful if you want to get into a coin that has been hit by FOMO because it has a very big risk.",

Comparing dead/shitcoin into a major coin it's really wrong, did you know why they called shitcoin?It's a coin with high volatility, and easily to be manipulated without any foundation of the movement.",

While other coins are following later. I think it is a normal gain, nothing very surprising about this. The coins with good fundamentals will also increase soon if Bitcoin can increase constantly. So, don't worry about the coins that you are holding! As long as you hold good coins, you will have a chance to see their pumps, too. Just wait for the time, dude!",

No matter how majority considered something as \"dead\" if afterwards it will still have a demand for any possible reason, then its market value will again be active. Indeed, things are just way too unpredictable in this industry because demand in the first place is not consistent and is changing from time to time. We saw many projects which are still 'alive' up until this point even if they are not considered by majority. As long as there would be a small community to create a demand, then things are still possible. But when it comes to investment, engaging with dormant projects won't be advisable even if rewards would be big because of the possible rate of increase.",
