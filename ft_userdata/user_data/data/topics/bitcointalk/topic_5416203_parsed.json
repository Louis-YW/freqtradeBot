  "content": "I thought the group would like this...        Let me start by appreciating our leader's and readers,both have tremendous impacts on man's life.        Leaders learn principles to carry on a task,this process is achieved through reading.when this habits is inculcated your mindset is influenced and improved in the society as well.Thus a leader  is a person who leads and have authority to direct.Oxford dictionary will.have it that a reader is a person who reads and recites,but it's a way far beyond that because readers are influencers of what they read.when you read your intellectually inclined and informed,so in order to be a good leader you need to invest a maxi percentage in reading and developing yourself to carry on the task at hand.    Here a Clarified difference of both is that;                                                                             A Reader think to Grow while                                                                              A Leader read to lead.Fortunately,we can learn the keys to success from both perception.the books you read motivates and lay impacts on you.you can't be a good leader intellectually wise if your not a good reader. Let me drive it to this forum now,if we don't read to get informed of a knowledge we end up being deformed.A leader can also be a good reader in the sense that he has assimilated a positive reading habits which has developed and impacted him.and thus making it his lifestyle.and again,not all leaders are readers because they want to bear a name without making a name.In conclusion,I'm urging that a good Leader-reading habits can be achieved by effectively analysing and practising what you've assimilated while reading,and accomplishing it.having done this;this is when good praises and honour are given to the leader's from their subject's because here now he has read,think,grow,and acted.So I advice we all should inculcate a good reading habits to develop ourselves and society.",

However, if you look at the cold war history, you will find that many Russians asked the American people for help... because they understood America's people to be Christians.Many of America's people still are Christians. It's just that they have come to believe that their system of banking and the media is right, as well. This has come about because of the way government has infiltrated their thinking over the years.The point is, if Putin and the Russian people get back to a correct understanding of God and Jesus-salvation, God will use them to wake up American Christians. The process might not be a happy one. Nobody likes being forced to believe, by the factual evidence, that he was wrong.PUTIN DECLARES HOLY WAR ON WESTERN SATANISM! INVOKES JESUS!Quote from: https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=208539\"They [the West] are moving toward open Satanism,\" he said in a speech broadcast to millions online.Western elites were teaching \"sexual deviation\" to children who changed their gender, he said. \"We're fighting for historical Russia, to protect our children and grandchildren from this experiment to change their souls,\" he added.Putin invoked Jesus by name to bear witness to his \"truth\" and portrayed himself in messianic terms.\"I believe in the spiritual power of the Russian people and my spirit is its spirit, the suffering of the people is my suffering,\" he said.\"The destruction of the Western hegemony is irreversible,\" Putin added, as he neared the climax of his oration.Putin also blamed \"Anglo-Saxons\", referring to the UK and US, for blowing up two Russian gas pipelines to Germany this week — in a potential casus belli with Nato....",

A leader must be a proficient reader in order to be outspoken. Readers dominate the world, and leaders who promote reading have a deeper understanding of their subjects' cultures, histories, and environments. If you watch the leaders of different nations, especially those who are performing openly, you will notice that they are all readers. Reading is what makes a man, and leaders need to be exposed to new ideas, skills, knowledge, and ways of thinking. Reading enlightening books can provide leaders with fresh perspectives on how to govern their subjects. Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers, according to Harry S. T. Truman.",

Of course, this was not done foolishly, he knows exactly what would gonna happen when he starts the war and he is probably taking possibilities about two scenarios. One when they win this war and what's next after it. two is when they don't succeed to take Ukraine it might be gonna result in their plan B which we hope will not gonna happen. Because no matter how we look at it, if this war will come as last resort for Russia, it would become a nuclear war because they rather use everything they had than surrender to the west and its allies.",

He should educate them about taxes and their responsibilities. I have seen 2 types of leaders in this world,1) who works for the betterment of their people and continously tells them about rights and responsibilities. 2) who comes in power for their benefits  ,to accumulated their wealth and bank accounts  and to do corruption. So first one Is a good leader and a blessing for any country.",

We have two types of leaders which are good leaders and bad leaders. A good leader is the one that reads, understand and put his knowledge into practice but a bad leader is the one that reads,understand but do not practice what he has read. That is why some leaders fail in their leadership, they turn the other way round instead of doing the right thing because of some personal or selfish interest.

A good leader is able to be updated in what is happening around and the changing climate, situation, crime and the punishment to them. Leadership is also part of making people obey what rules in the area so I bring in the rule, law and how to guide the people. I believe if a leader is knowing what to do, he knows the laws that will best practice in his country. By reading wide he will have the knowledge of new laws from the one practice other places.",

It is also important to state that it is not all books or information that is truly helpful. That is why we must always verify and meditate on what we have read from books. One of the problems most countries are facing is that their leaders are technologically, economically and politically backward because they don't study. They govern their country and make policies based on outdated knowledge that might not be relevant currently. That why most government are banning or restricting the use of Bitcoin because they lack requisite knowledge about its operations and benefits.",
