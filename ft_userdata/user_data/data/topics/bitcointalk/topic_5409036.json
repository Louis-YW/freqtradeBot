Yeah, seems really strange that they would apologize and pay only to the US. First of all Trump didn't investigate shit XD there is no conclusive evidence to point in a diretion. If aynthing, China is at fault for not being transparent enough with the investigation.",

If China would play fair it wouldn't allow people to travel freely when they detected covid in their country, which was in late 2019, but they kept it a secret until early 2020. Only after cases started to appear in large numbers all around the world and the trail led to China, they took some of the blame and said the virus was detected on the market in Wuhan. China should be blamed for this situation and I think they should apologize. Not for covid itself, although I think they were trying to experiment on it, but for not warning the world of what was coming.",

The blame still goes to China for keeping it secrete instead of informing WHO before the rapid spread of the virus.    China is not apologizing and will not pay a dime to the US because Donald Trump is no longer the president of US and Joe Bien has no gut for such claims. If it was Trump by now China they might have apologized",

The blame still goes to China for keeping it secrete instead of informing WHO before the rapid spread of the virus.I think this is part of the problem. With no proper narrative on origin or source as, some claims have it that, it originated in a Chinese lab from a research that went wrong... stuffs like that. It makes it difficult to point the finger although, no one is really disputing on its origin to have been China and so, China gets to stand in that accused box but would they pay or apologise?I guess not. They've not done that and probably won't.America might be the world power but they don't lord over China like they do in most nations as per influence. Now, Russia has made it even more clear that America has got limits to avoid due to certain consequences.Most of all, the leadership in Biden is different from the radical Trump. No one is threatened over anything and the issue with Covid-19 is done with.",

Everyone that worked in virus development, security, transport companies, people who visited China, people that has strong immune system and unconsciously became virus distributers, and etc. Well if you believe what they're saying is the source, then it's that exotic meat market - which coincidentally is near a biolab. And it's not really farfetched, this is not the first time an outbreak was traced back to China. Remember SARS? Turns out it developed from their practice of housing poultry on top pigstyes and so the virus jumped from chicken, to pig, to human.

By the time they shutdown transportation, the virus has already spread. And it also was telling that even when they did this, it was for local only at the beginning, they kept international flights open. That's what I remember from it, there were vids of people trying to get out of the cities before the buses and trains were prevented from operating.",

I recall reading their theory that it was the U.S. military that brought COVID-19 to bear. Perhaps they've changed their story again -- changing these cover stories is more convenient than shelling out any compensatory damages.",

Yeah, this seem to be on people's minds now. Of course no one would confirm it but we've all moved on from blaming bat soup. Those poor, poor bats. The Chinese have been eating those for like, centuries that it now seem rather odd it took this long to have an outbreak.",

The United States alone has millions of infectors and people died simply from the lack of medical resouces due to the malfunction of U.S government/hospitals. In contrast, China has implemented the Covid-zero policy in the past three years and whenever there are any infectious cases, that area would be soon locked down for a few days. Yes this policy sacrifices a lot of economic gains but fundermentally ensures many people's lives and make sure the society remains stable, more importantly, this benefits the stability of the whole world. Why would China appologize ?",
