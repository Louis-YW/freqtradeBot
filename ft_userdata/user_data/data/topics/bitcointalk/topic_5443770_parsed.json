Those are the only two possible ways, so, for 2033 I expect to see the price over $150k for each coin.",

It is certain that it will be much more valuable than its current all-time high, given that a specific price cannot be accurately predicted by anyone. In the next ten years, we would have seen 2-3 bitcoin halvings, with the expected outcome always being a new all-time high of bitcoin that surpassed the previous ATH. If I had to guess, I'd say it'll be X3 to X5 of the current ATH.",

A pretty good vague guess would just be somewhere between $500k and $1 million.I think Bitcoin will maybe hit a million dollars for the first time in the 2036/2037 bull run so I don't think it'll be there yet in 2033, but 2032/2033 will be a bull run if the 4 year market cycle still holds a decade from now so price should be at the high end of the market cycle so it should definitely be over half a million. I expect peak bull run prices in '25, '29, '33 to be something like $150k - $200k, $350k - $400k, $600k - $700k. So I'll make a guess of $600k - $700k peak price in 2033.",

No one really knows, I suppose the majority of the forum members suppose the price will be higher than its current levels, but we do not know how high the difference will be, and since that is the case just enjoy the ride, there are so many things that could happen during that decade that any price is possible and trying to guess it is simply unnecessary, as what would you do with this information even if you had it?

That is now considered standard Bitcoin behavior. If you can read it, the chart will say many things; if not, it will say nothing. Bitcoin saw nearly satisfactory growth at the start of this year. Despite various minor glitches imposed on the BNB FUD, we are still playing well. Nonetheless, I think it will eventually disappear. I am therefore bullish based on market movements this year.

And if it continues than what will be the price after 10 years and I am very curious to Know about this. You can not say anything surely about price of Bitcoin in 2023, next 10 years. What you can say is simply prediction that mostly is not correct in reality.The only thing you can say and it is true is How many bitcoins will be mined totally at 2032 halving block and how many bitcoins is left for mining until all 21M bitcoin is mined at 2140.Controlled supply.At the halving block in 2032, there are 98.44% bitcoin will be mined and after the end of that era in 2036, 99.22% of bitcoin will be mined. So from 2032 till 2140, there will be about 1.6% bitcoin in total supply will be mined in about 80 more years.Price impacts for Bitcoin is huge as you see after next 3 more halvings, effects from halvings would be smaller than 2024 halving. If in 2020 bull run, Bitcoin reached to nearly $70,000, in 2032 I believe it will not be less than $150,000.Another version of controlled supply but better presents effect of halving on miners, Equivalent Network Time",

Bitcoin has been widely adopted from the year it first appeared until now so that it makes its value increase from year to year because basically bitcoin has a limited supply with a total of 21 million, when demand is higher then supply will also be lower resulting in the price of bitcoin will continue to increase from its scarcity.Asking the price of bitcoin in the next 10 years, I don't think you will find the right answer here because no one can predict with certainty about the future price movement.",

So hold and keep buying more.At the same time make sure to spend and buy back to increase your collection of bitcoin while using mostly fiat for daily expenses. Going by charts, we can say that in 10years a lot of price rise is possible and a lot of things can happen in this world.
