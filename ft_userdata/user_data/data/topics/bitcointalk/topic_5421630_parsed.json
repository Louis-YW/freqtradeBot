  "content": "Socket is a complete interoperability stack which allows asset & data transfer across chains, enabling developers to build truly cross-chain appsWebsite | Docs | Discord | Twitter | Medium | Github | Bungee Exchange Socket is an interoperability protocol for secure & efficient data and asset transfers across chains. Socket is not a bridge, or a cross chain app - it is an infrastructure that allows developers to build these things easily. Developers can use Socket to build apps with interoperability as a core part of app infrastructure. Every approach to interoperability optimizes for different objectives & trade offs (trust, latency, generalizability etc.). No one approach is best for every type of use case. Our goal is to empower developers to optimize for their use case & objectivesSocketLL OverviewSocket’s liquidity layer enables seamless cross-chain asset transfers. It unifies liquidity across chains by aggregating all asset bridges & DEXs.The result is ultra-efficient cross chain swaps powered by an advanced routing mechanism that dynamically selects the best bridge/route & optimizes for developer preferences like cost, latency or security.Learn more about how you can use Liquidity Layer in your application, or how Liquidity Layer works. You can try out Liquidity Layer in action on Bungee.Socket DL overviewSocketDL enables cross-chain generalised message passingData movement is the next step in enabling true composability across chains. It allows apps to extend beyond the boundaries chains & build protocols in a chain agnostic way. SocketDL enables smart contracts to read state & perform arbitrary communication with other contracts across different chains. For example, a protocol on Polygon can read Aave’s APY on Arbitrum; or a protocol on Fantom can deposit funds into Aave on Optimism via Socket.SocketDL is coming soon to a chain near you and will open doors to a broad variety of interesting & truly multi chain use cases for the ecosystem!",
