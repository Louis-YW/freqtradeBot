As above post explained, there are some people who drink booze when they are doing well in crypto or being successful in crypto for a celebration. As you can see, drinking booze doesn't mean that you won't be successful if you drink booze just don't get drunk.",

How about you, are you doing well on most days?Drinking wasn't completely a bad thing I mean as long as you drink responsibly and moderately you should be fine, I drink alcohol sometimes if there are some occasions and I wasn't a big drinker as well and Im good as well as my investment in cryptocurrency. I mean it's a great drink if you're going to celebrate something but if you drink with your friends that was just the best thing, the chitchat was just great with alcohol.I mean as long as you have discipline and really wanted to earn some profits, you're going to start investing, saving, etc. It is just all you want, alcohols are not really that expensive and it wasn't an everyday thing, so as long as you manage your spendings avoid unnecessary wants, I mean just to make sure to not buy something that you can't afford, manage your salary make sure you don't spend over your budget, save a big percentage of your salary. This wasn't a big deal so just, enjoy both drinking and investing at the same time its that easy.",

How about you, are you doing well on most daysIt's beneficial to ultimately give up alcohol so you can have a clean head but other people find that getting intoxicated inspires them more. I occasionally drink alcohol, but I do so responsibly, therefore it hasn't in any way changed how I live or how I make decisions regarding bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

It's awesome to invest in bitcoin, but if purchasing trendy items brings you the most joy, why not do both at once? After all, everyone has something that makes them happy, that’s why we don't think twice about spending money on things that make us happy. we only get one life to live so let’s spend money on the things that make us happy.",

How about you, are you doing well on most days?Just some for warming up my body when vacationing on the mountain. I don't know exactly what you think to relate it with Bitcoin. because if I am under a condition in alcohol, my ideas come up often, I can write a post and article of more than 300 words in only 30 minutes, which means alcohol makes my brain fresh and dig deeper into my mind. So if you want to relate it with your money, it could be suitable, because you don't need to spend money to buy some bottles, In my country I need at least $100 to buy some bottles, with that $100 I can DCA bitcoin, it's better than I bought Absolute or Jack Daniel.",

How about you, are you doing well on most days?Speaking of current conditions, I think many are confused by the current market conditions, without the need to drink alcohol. Yes, the market is like a chemistry lesson during the day where the temperature is above 40 degrees. Dizzy, on average, you don't have any more funds to buy BTC for now.",

How about you, are you doing well on most days?How is it related to Bitcoin, blockchain and smart contracts?Your story sounds like you already knew about those things before you stopped drinking alcohol which is not bad if you don't binge drinking. Drinking a little bit daily is good for heart and your health but don't overuse it and don't let your self addictive.Learning about Bitcoin and its blockchain is good but I am not sure the same for smart contracts which are no smart and secured enough to protect smart contract users. Many hacks and exploitations on smart contracts and they are worse than Bitcoin Proof of Work decentralized network.Don't waste your time with smart contracts. Learn about Bitcoin is better.https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/",

How about you, are you doing well on most days?I am a Muslim and Alcohol and related drinks are Haram for me, so i never tried them and all of the Muslims are prohibited to use them. So, if you are asking in the context of drinking alcohol that i am doing fine? then yes Alhamdulillah i am doing great because such drinks eat away ones mind. Left it, use-less mainly when you are addicted to it. And history has proven that addiction of any kind either it's of Gambling or Alcohol will eat away your mind as well as your future too.So, i am save from both of them. So, yeah i am living a happy life, i may have to face financial ups and downs, or face any problem that life has for me, but it's all good, and i am living a happy life with BTC. as my earnings are in BTC so i am like quite dependent on it. I congratulates you on quitting the Alcohol, as I am happy too. you have made a good decision there and saved your and your loved ones future too. Because your behavior might effect theirs too. So i am happy and i hope you will stick to this decision to the end.",

This is for an alcohol addict. If you have enough to drink responsible, I think there isn't any bad in it. I have people who drink and smoke and still invest big in crypto. They always try to manage their earnings between their investment and fun.",
