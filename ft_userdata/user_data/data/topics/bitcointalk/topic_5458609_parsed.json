If you are not aware of those transactions you do not have to do anything, but if you were expecting them you can use CPFP to bump it up and have it confirmed sooner.If these are transactions leaving your wallet then sweep them into a new wallet as this one has been compromised.",

Non of this two transaction i made my self. Thank youIf both of these transactions weren’t initiated by you then it simple means your wallet has been compromised. My first question is do you know the owner of the recipient address if it doesn’t belong to you then the hacker might be trying to send this funds to his address (which will be weird, considering he has been doing RBF with very low fees, a proper hacker or a learned one would have move them out in minutes). My advice is double spend this transaction and also everything on that wallet with a proper transaction fee (check the mempool.space for the transaction fee) into a new wallet address. Do not bump the transaction, because should you do an RBF now or bump it with another method and the recipient address isn’t yours then it would certainly go in there.",

The first transaction is invalid since it was replaced by another before it was confirmed by the network. But, whoever sent that transaction didn't include enough fee, so it's probably never gonna get confirmed either. It will simply expire and be removed from the mempool after a while.",

Non of this two transaction i made my self. Thank youIf you are not the one who made the transaction then your wallet is compromised and what you should do is what Upgrade00 suggested which is to sweep your wallet but if you did the first transaction then you don't have to worry about it because when you do an RBF (replace-by-fee) it will replace the first transaction with the new transaction with a different fee. As you can see, it was bumped several times with different fees.If you did the first transaction then there's nothing to worry as it was bumped, that's why you can see the old transaction is replaced. I would also suggest to do CPFP if you want the transaction get confirmed sooner. I think you are expecting that BTC going to your wallet and you are confused because the transaction is replaced since the RBF is enabled.Quote from: Zaguru12 on July 04, 2023, 08:26:07 PMIf both of these transactions weren’t initiated by you then it simple means your wallet has been compromised.

About 0.03086250btc.\" which made me think that he did the first transaction and then bumped.",

I really don't understand who could make transactions using your wallet... but  fee used for transaction you posted used very low fee of 2.81 sat/vB.You could wait for it to be confirmed itself or you could bump up fees  since RBF was used for this transaction, but than again, if you didn't send this transaction than you can't bump the fees., only sender can do that.Checking Mempool website you can see estimated fees with different priority levels and I always recommend checking that out before sending any coins.You can also use browser extension my team made a while ago with my suggestions, called BTC Mempool Fees Extension/add-on for Firefox/Chrome browser.",

Thank youDid you download zeus wallet from links appear here https://zeusln.app/aboutIt seems that the zeus wallet is open source phone wallet that focus on the lightning network, and I do not expect that there will be a problem on the part of the wallet, so if you were not the one who broadcast that transaction, then there is no problem with your phone or you downloaded an unofficial wallet. Did you update the wallet or were you asked to reinstall it from outside Google Play/APPStore?",
