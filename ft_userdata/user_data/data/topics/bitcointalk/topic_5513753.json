He did great things to create a decentralized currency and disappeared to make it more decentralized.Lastly but most important, I wish him best health and enjoy his life, because if you have good health and a healthy life, you have almost everything.Quote from: dimonstration on October 19, 2024, 02:10:34 PMThanks for everything and please don’t over access your Bitcoin stored on wallet address that you owned since Bitcoin community will surely experience a chaos. Even Satoshi Nakamoto is active online again, the Bitcoin community will be in chaos again. It does not need to have any movement of bitcoins in wallets owned by Satoshi Nakamoto to be chaotic.QuoteAnd if ever you read this, since you are already a billionaireA hypothesis is Satoshi Nakamoto did not sell his bitcoins, so did not sell it, he has yet become a billionaire.",

The young bitcoin community in my country, are an endangered group in the hands of security agencies because we own and believe in bitcoin, nevertheless, we won't let their intimidations and persecutions break our spirits and belief in bitcoin.

They expected Bitcoin to free humanity from material hardship, in a complex bid to save ΛμϞιηα civilization from economic collapse (from hyperexpansion). They didn't understand human nature and learned the hard way. As much as they understood, they didn't expect illegal activities to take over Bitcoin's reputation, in some ways causing human society to degenerate.Since the turn of the 21st century, SATOSHI NAKAMOTO (ΛμϞιηα) worked to lay the foundation for First Contact and reveal themselves to the public, merging interplanetary communities with Earth. They've developed a cyber warfare-proof blockchain dedicated to enriching Bitcoin's original function- Bridge to the Stars.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5513720",

Besides that, if he doesn't want to use his Bitcoins why he doesn't want to publicly burn them once and for all or to airdrop them to the faithful BTC community.",

I know that Musk is creating many interesting things, but in terms of finance, Satoshi has created something extraordinary. Giving each person the opportunity to store their coins in their wallet without having to do KYC and without having to run the risk of the government charging them taxes is a very good thing. Of course, when a person converts to fiat, they may pay taxes depending on the country in which they live. Secondly, I wish that wherever Satoshi is, he is healthy, happy and safe.",
