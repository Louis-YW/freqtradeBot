So dar, I can also say they are trusted too.Well thank you mate for the suggestion now I am going to just exploring that. But the thing is, I'm very stingy,  and it's better to spend a little money on what I'm going to use it for.That's why I would like to see any person who has Bitcoin on their wallet(like trust wallet) then it could be easier because their the transaction fees are going to also low. So cost will be low  . I don't know if there any others way to The transaction fee can be more reduced welcome those",
