But the term \"bit\" doesn't stand out enough from \"bitcoin\". We need to find something different, and above all, use it.Some of the ideas that backs bitcoin is the consensus about the ideology it portrays and I feel the day we start seeing changes such as the proposed, that’ll be the day you introduce doubt into the system on decentralization as people largely aren’t going to be okay with this and the system is just good as it is. There isn’t any need for a book of account on it.Bitcoin seeks to be considered on its own and not having its value to be defined by fiat.QuoteThe current and future exchange rates with the main FIAT currencies would then be of the same order of magnitude: with $1 = 34 Nk at present, and why not, with time, a move towards an exchange rate close to parity: $1 ≈ 1 Nk.While this proposal might seem rational at the time of typing, you could as well recall that bitcoin is highly volatile and the values at which the conversion rate would be equated will continue to have some real sudden changes. That’s not the sort of thing we hope to see. The bitcoin and Satoshi or mBtc as we’ve got is okay for any conversion rate.",

I much prefer using either BTC or sats, and not complicating things with additional in between units.

It's true that it is equivalent to a quite high value of currently around $300 USD. But it is still a number not too far from many everyday purchases (rent, clothing, weekly buys in the grocery, up to small cars all are things between 0.1 and 100 Bitcents). And the term \"cent\" is established in many currencies, people will immediately know what's meant (1/100 of the main unit). It could be used this way up to the 100-200K, maybe also 300-500K (then the smaller items would be priced 0.01 to 0.1, but this is still a manageable number) price range for BTC/USD. And for everything below we can use satoshis.Edit: @Christophe_dcy: Got it, thanks for the link correction!",
