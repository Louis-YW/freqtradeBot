  "content": "I have been working on a new type of decentralized consensus protocol capable of competing with CBDC incentives to spend as daily currency(currently calling it proof of presence). The network works synergistically with bitcoin as a long term value store and fully decentralized daily digital transaction medium.",

And most of them are without use. I don't think we need more. But of course innovation is always encouraged and shouldn't stop. Could you expound more on your proof of presence? And why do you have to compete against CBDC? CBDC standards are not worth competing with.",

How is it better than existing consensuses?Utilizing a new type of consensus mechanism the network is modelled after living systems such as mycelium and the stock market. In terms of mycelium the main thing that was referenced is the way in which the system receives environmental input(nutrients) and adapts it’s next system state to optimize for nutrients access.(search Japanese fungus subway experiment)Instead of distributing nutrients for growth (mycelium) this consensus(PoP) is defined by proportional contributions to network traffic. In other words the system is built around optimizing network traffic and communication . If people are encouraging and contributing to network traffic they are increasing network value. As a result they should be rewarded proportionally as to further increase network value into the future. This model allows the network to grow similar to a living organism with transactions acting as potential nutrients for system growth and adaptation. Additionally as computation and networking capabilities improve the network will become capable of higher transaction speeds as well as higher network loads. This means separate from software, the network will naturally get faster and more efficient as the technology that makes up the network becomes more advanced.I am looking to build a founding community of  members to ensure the initial ownership is distributed as widespread as possible right from the moment the network goes live. The goal is not to sell the currency but to distribute it.  A more broadly spread initial distribution allows for higher network security and accessibility. For this reason the vast majority of initial network equity will be distributed for free to people interested in participating in the community. In this community I will be willing to discuss further details on protocol function. This is to protect protocol integrity and limit risk of potential dishonest imitations.I am not usually the greatest at communicating things clearly so please feel free to message me with any questionsTo summarizeBitcoin = long term storagePoP network protocol = traffic optimization network = daily digital transaction mediumBitcoin + PoP = fully decentralized transaction ecosystem completely out of central control",
