      "body": "I think racism is more dangerous then religion. It is a true statement and history itself shows how racism continues to exist and continues daily worldwide. There is so much hate, showing racial discrimination towards a group or an individual based on stereotypes. The violence that comes with racism is what makes it dangerous, and this is very sad. I honestly do not think that viewing your skin color can base you on how you are treated or be looked upon. If we all can think like this then maybe we can stop the dangers and racism can end.",

Yea true , but I think religion have done more harm to the society than Racism, religious differences have led to war between two countries and even death of many others, racism will only make a certain set of people this they are super special than other people and deprive them the opportunity to carry out some legitimate legal rights, two of them are enemies to the growth and peace of a state and shouldn't be encouraged at any level.",

We should love each other and the love we have for each other Should go beyond our skin colour and our religious beliefs and we should always understand that we are one and all humans.There is already a separation no one can violate. Good(Light) is seperate... Evil (Darkness) is seperate. The problem is uniting Good and evil(Light + darkness)... True Light will cancel darkness = Light, or  Darkness will remain darkness. The good needs to influence the evil and make it good otherwise both good and evil have to be seperate whether the Good is in people who are \"black or white\", or Evil in \"black or white\" people.  They should be seperate so that the good doesn't turn bad. The good has to turn the bad to good else they seperate. Once seperated the good will not be turned evil and partake in the curses/punishments reserved for the evil. We can be good or bad as different people/races. There is only one Religion anyone can be good in... It's the Religion of followers of JESUS CHRIST. Every races have been told by the CREATOR of Heaven and this Earth to follow HIM. HE is the only ONE who can lead humanity to the Source of Existence (the CREATOR). And it's only through HIM people can be saved to live a good life and be good",

Islamists, as we all know can be very dangerous but it is a minority of people who ruin it for everybody else.Racism is disgusting & people should be locked up for vilifying people for the colour of their skin. We all bleed red, skin colour doesn’t make you any better or any worse than anybody else. Treat others as you would like to be treated.",

So i can say that religion is more dangerous.",

I hear you chairman... A dangerous question requires a dangerous answer, but we need to enlighten the public on the effects of the two, in a civilized society this two shouldn't be found, because it doesn't encourage togetherness and Unity, it breaks a country and take development out of an area,There should be public awareness on this, NO TO RACISM is already a campaign program in every UEFA champions League match as it is on the jerseys of the players, and you know football brings us together so the message is very clear, So another sports Should adopt the same strategy on Religious differences.",
