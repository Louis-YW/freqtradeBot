  "content": "I've noticed that my eyes often want to quickly skim quoted text (which is a bit smaller) compared to unquoted text and it sometimes takes an effort for me to read it properly. I browse the forum from two different computers with two different monitor resolutions (one a fair bit higher than the other) and I recently (~1 year ago) had my eyes tested (grateful to not need glasses yet; must be all those carrots -- thanks, mom!) so although I haven't ruled it out, I don't think it's me or my setup.I'm aware that I can fix this for myself by making things bigger with browser settings and whatnot, but while I was poking around the forum's CSS I found what I think is behind my problem: normal text is set to 13px, quoted text is set to 11px and quote titles are set to 10px. Now, quoted text should appear smaller than normal text, and quote titles should appear smaller than quoted text (ignoring boldness), so I'm not proposing making them all the same size (that looks really goofy, I tried it) but I think making it go 13px/12px/11px is better than 13px/11px/10px.I think this is more important than it might seem, because I believe it subtly affects how people read posts (i.e. subconsciously avoiding carefully reading quoted text, which is often as -- and sometimes more -- important than unquoted text in terms of fully understanding a given post).Here's what 13px/11px/10px (how it is now) looks like:And here's what 13px/12px/11px (what I'm proposing) looks like:Anybody else prefer the second one?Edit: The above screenshots are a little hard to accurately gauge the difference on because of font hinting and the like, so take them with a grain of salt (i.e. the same stylesheet adjustments will likely look a bit different on your system).Not that theymos needs it (it's a trivial change), but for completeness' sake, here's the stylesheet patch: Code:--- ./style_before.css 2022-11-27 10:03:55.091702000 +0000+++ ./style_after.css 2022-11-27 10:06:29.647700841 +0000@@ -120,25 +120,25 @@ {  border: 0; }  /* A quote, perhaps from another post. */ .quote {  color: #000000;  background-color: #f1f2f4;  border: 1px solid #d0d0e0;  padding: 5px;  margin: 1px 3px 6px 6px;- font-size: 11px;+ font-size: 12px;  line-height: 1.4em; }   /* A code block - maybe even PHP ;). */ .code {  color: #000000;  background-color: #fff;  font-family: \"courier new\", \"times new roman\", monospace;  font-size: 12px;  line-height: 1.3em;@@ -152,25 +152,25 @@  overflow: auto;  /* Stop after about 24 lines, and just show a scrollbar. */  max-height: 24em; }  /* The \"Quote:\" and \"Code:\" header parts... */ .quoteheader, .codeheader {  color: #476C8E;  text-decoration: none;  font-style: normal;  font-weight: bold;- font-size: 10px;+ font-size: 11px;  line-height: 1.2em;   margin-left: 6px; }  /* Generally, those [?] icons.  This makes your cursor a help icon. */ .help {  cursor: help; }  /* /me uses this a lot.

I don't think I could go back to the old way, now (13px/11px/10px).Quoted text shows up so often on Bitcointalk and in so many contexts that having it be just a little bigger (but still a tiny bit smaller than normal text) is quite an improvement (to my eyes).",

I'm hoping theymos will merge the member filtering patch at some point, because it's very useful and I think most people will agree once/if they get to see it in action. Back to this patch though, if anyone is curious (and tech-savvy) enough to want to experiment with running it locally (without having to install browser extensions) then here are some instructions (for Firefox, or Firefox-derived browsers like Tor Browser):Step 1: Browse to \"about:support\" to figure out where your \"Profile Directory\" is (should be near the middle of what's listed under \"Application Basics\").Step 2: Create a folder (if it doesn't already exist) named \"chrome\" within the directory from the previous step.Step 3: Create a file (if it doesn't already exist) named \"userContent.css\" within the directory from the previous step.Step 4: Browse to \"about:config\" and enable the setting named \"toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets\".Step 5: Close your browser.Step 6: Put the following inside the \"userContent.css\" file, from step 3:Code:@-moz-document domain(bitcointalk.org) {    .quote { font-size: 12px !important; }    .quoteheader, .codeheader { font-size: 11px !important; }}Obviously, you can put whatever stylesheet overrides you like in there (take a look at the forum's main stylesheet for ideas) but I'm only concerned (at the moment) with what I wrote about in the initial post (i.e. making quoted text slightly bigger).",

I'm going to test it. Can you put a screenshot before and after modification, with more changes to the CSS, then your argument will be stronger and closer to implementation.Have you tried it on the local boards, because we will hear an opposite complaint if it is worse and has been applied to the entire forum.I find that the quotation line is much smaller is a logical reason. Mostly the quotation is citing the source and therefore you will return to the source or it is part of a previous discussion,  I think it is logical for it to be smaller in size (13px/11px/10px).",

You're probably right.If you or anyone else decides to give 13px/12px/11px a try then here's a little advice (if I may):Make sure to give it a fair shake. If you've been using the forum for a long time or even only ~5 months like I have, then you've gotten very used to how things look right now and your initial reaction is likely to be: \"No, I don't like that.\"Force yourself to use it for a full forum session (i.e. browse a few boards, write a post or two, get up-to-date on what's happening in reputation, answer some PMs, etc.) and when you're done I think you'll find that you've changed your mind.
