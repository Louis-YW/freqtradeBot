  "content": "Hello guys, i’m new here on forum and i want to ask an experienced person in earning online there are some websites that works like e-commerce they are saying that they help merchants like amazon and walmart to increase their products visibility and increasing sales. They contacted with me on whatsapp and telegram to register on thier websites and do some tasks like grabing order and pay for it and money will return back to me with commission and they asking to deposit for their websites. I’m asking is these websites are safe and their is a really work like that online for earning money or its a scam ?!And thanks for support",
