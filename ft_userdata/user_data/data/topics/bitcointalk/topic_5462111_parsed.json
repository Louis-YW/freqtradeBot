Its Elons site or ownership and on whatever things that he would be planning in his own company then there's nothing we can do on what are the rules and changes that he would really be imposing into Twitter/X and there's nothing we can do but to deal with it. Other approach of people? Of course they would really be finding place on which they could freely be able to give out those trading related or investment related kind of post or those signals like whale alerts or something. We dont know on whats on the mind of Elon if he would really be deciding about on stopping these kind of post or this kind of approach.We dont actually know on how their brain works and what are the ideas and reasoning that storming out inside on which it would really be leading out with those kind of odd decisions and other approach which is something that shouldn't really be happening but well this is something that a possibility could happen specially if the owner of said platform would really be making out decisions something like this.People would really be hoping out on other platforms on which they would really be able to see these alerts and mostly this would really be on messaging apps or other socmed.",

I just don't understand your mean to stop trading on Twitter? Do you mean restricting people from posting anything with regards to trading? Then I think many will disappoint as Twitter becomes more centralized where they tell people what to post only. Let's see if Twitter will be more innovative in the future and wait for their stand when it comes to cryptocurrency.",

Twitter is the best social site to check the latest updates of a project and one of the important thing to analyze the market fundamentally. There's no way we can stop a thing that is never happened. So maybe what he mean is to stop all the trading signals on Twitter. I believe he won't stop crypto related tweet in Twitter because he held some Bitcoins, not until he sold it.

Sometimes I used to follow big whales calls on particular coin and invests in them. Most of the time the whale’s calls gave me profits also. So till now, I would say, Twitter hasn’t done anything worse to me. Now regarding the change of ownership, then yes Elon musk can do changes on the platform, but he can’t change the calls and the news. So for me new owner won’t be a bigger problem.",

We are just bystanders on this subject. Who has control over the product, then he has the right to change anything including what Elon Musk bought, namely Twitter which rebranded to \"X\".Elon Musk is a smart man, he knew that Twitter had good potential in the future and he bought it. Then he transformed it into what he wanted it to be.See how much it has changed and he will integrate crypto as well. Dogecoin will probably be one of the accepted payments. Now X or Twitter gives rewards to users who are active and have many followers. But I don't know what the mechanism is, but it's already in effect.",
