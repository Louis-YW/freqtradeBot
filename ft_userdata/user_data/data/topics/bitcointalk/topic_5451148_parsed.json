It's because of emotion and FOMO. That's why if you're going to ask that friend of yours, he probably bought bitcoin because he's seen it during the all time high. He didn't make enough research about it and went directly on the search engines and typed \"how to buy bitcoin\". Other than that, he did actually a research of how to buy but not with the characteristics of bitcoin and its nature as a volatile asset. We will always have that type of person that will be worried asking if bitcoin's already dead or if there's still a chance for bitcoin to recover. We do get a lot of that everytime the market don't look good.",

Someone who has already started disturbing your chat and calling you to ask you if Bitcoin will survive or not is a typical example of someone who doesn't believe in the currency and only invested their funds because someone asked them whether they were liable for taking a risk.",

Bitcoin will rise when is due to rise, remove fear and plenty rumors. Well, about that, every person is not the same; those kinds of experiences occur usually during their earlier stage of knowing and investing in Bitcoin, but as they continue to read, learn, and understand more about Bitcoin price history and market volatility, they will still get used to the process. Some of the old Bitcoin holders have really been familiar of the whole process and how Bitcoin works, so that's why you will not see any of them coming to brag about how many Bitcoin they hold because it can even expose them to some hack attacks.When talking about people you introduce to Bitcoin being a disturbance, it depends on how you introduce them. For example, if you really did not give them all the required information to help them, they would still be so clingy, but if you told them all the terms that are involved and also gave them some material to learn from, they would be more self-reliant. Some months ago, someone was talking about Bitcoin to their friends, and he asked them to invest in Bitcoin and wait until next year, when the Bitcoin price will be so high. So what if, during the next year, the Bitcoin price does not show positive growth? That means those guys will call the person who introduced them and ask him what is happening. So, it's always cool to define things for people when teaching them, if they really want to learn anything.",

The $30 that you feel is nothing might be someone's savings for many months,  so they don't want to lose their investment which is why they are also scared. It is very important to educate people about the Bitcoin sector before you introduce them to the sector. Don't introduce the sector to them as a  because it is not. And they should be aware of the risk involved in bitcoin. After you are done with the teaching, don't force or persuade them to buy the coin, allow them to take the decision. Let them bear the responsibility for their investment.",

Most of them were probably told that there are people that became millionaires with cryptocurrency and as such they relate such pump narrative to bitcoin. These set of people cannot hodl and those you see clearly checking charts and every hour. It is even easier for these people to fall into scams by those selling signals or people promising them to double their earnings through staking. It is natural since it is there early days, but once they got use to it; if at all they don’t lose their funds before then, then they would also careless of the bitcoin price movement daily. This patience is only exercise by old bitcoins that have study bitcoin well enough or people that only invested an amount that is considered losable to them.It is hard thing to guide people like this if they persist you tell them it is not always green on bitcoin and that the can’t get there millions from investing just few hundreds in short term.",

There are several reasons why people do not investigate or Research into what they want to invest in and in the end of the day they'll begin to shout about being scammed. One of the reasons is because some people are lazy and they would like to be spoon-fed in everything they do including investment and financial management. Another reason is because of trust. If someone you trust in real life introduces you into any Investments, they would not hesitate to participate, but most times things are not done so. Even the person you trust might not be aware of the negative aspect of the investments. So, investment is not just done solely based on trust but also research. And finally, the major issue is the get-rich-quick syndrome. Some people will do anything possible to pay one and get two within a short period of time and those people are always victims.",

Not everyone can be suitable for a high-risk thing like Bitcoin, it is for the person who has a strong mentality and knows well crypto market only.Yep, investing around $30-$50 is a small fund, no need to worry as long as holding it until the bullish season. That amount of money won't bother our financial stability too, just forget it and check again in the next bullrun.",

Their minds suddenly become creatively tragic. That's sad but that's always true to the great majority of people. Whether we admit it or not, investment is not something many are willing to risk. It isn't everybody's cup of tea. I mean, the real investment, the one with ROI but also with risks. People only love the good side of investment, when they make profit, but as soon as the market is in red, which is normal and healthy, emotions come in, clouds their judgement, and put you all the blame. They panic sell; they blame you. They buy back at a much higher price; they blame you. They forget that they're adults capable of making sane judgments. Sometimes, we better be on our own. If others do what we do, they're totally free. They ask for assistance, we're always willing to lend a hand. But we don't suggest, convince, encourage, exhort them even with all the disclaimers.",

This is the umpteenth time that we have heard, that investing without knowledge is wrong and trying to invest based on solicitations from other people is very wrong behavior, in the end they are the ones who are responsible for this hasty decision. Your whole story makes me conclude, that you are a beginner trying to give advice to other people about investing in bitcoin and you don't need to do that in my opinion?There are conditions where we must stop advising people that bitcoin is the best investment for the future, the reason is clear how people can interfere with your time to focus on work, rest and leisure with family and I am more focused on increasing my own investment than introducing bitcoins to others.Quote from: Godlovesyou on May 03, 2023, 07:12:00 PMBut come to think of it many have bitcoin in B figures but you can't hear them making noise but people with $30 will not allow you to rest especially if you're responsible for introducing them. Bitcoin will rise when is due to rise, remove fear and plenty rumors. That's why there is no reason or responsibility for people to introduce bitcoin to others, while information disclosure is very likely they get everywhere for now. Nothing is more important to them than finding out the basics of investing before getting involved and the tendency for people to choose bitcoins is based on what they know.When you are present to introduce bitcoin to people who do not understand bitcoin then that is where you are responsible for giving the best advice for the investment they are making and to me that would be a waste of time.",
