It looks so cool and remind me of the kids magazine that I read when I was still a kid but the design isn't only limited on their announcement thread because after I check the site, the cool designs are still there. This is a definition of what you see is what you get. They should put an effort if they want to be successful in this industry because they are new and the competition in gambling is already tight.It's too early to tell if they are safe or not really but we can observe how it goes. About the website's security, it can be always improve but for now we can expect less from them because they are still a newly released site.",

I have not tried to login by connecting a wallet as I dont install any wallet in the PC I'm using at the moment, the available games are also not that attractive for me so even though there is a promo code, I wont force myself to claim it as I dont really like to play dice and crash game.
