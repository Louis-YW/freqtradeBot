Many have predicted the price rise. Twitter is full for months with predictions of price increasing \"any day now\".2. The current price rise is small and there's unfortunately still a good chance to be reverted (bull trap).3. If you want to have a proper discussion, discuss here, not on YouTube (i.e. post words, not links).",

Also I hold a little bit of Ethereum too and didn’t sell it. But we’re not sure if the bulls can keep the momentum going. Not sure what is the real factor behind the “green” day that we have today, but a pullback would be likely if the trend is just short term. There would be traders who bought at $17k to $19k might sell it that would result for the price to pull back a bit. It’s going to be interesting to see where the market goes after the end of the week.",

It would be interesting if the pump could go to that price. I wonder what will happen after the price can reach that price because if nothing happens out there, the price can get a correction, which can go lower price again. And I am worried if that will really happen later. So we must be careful in this situation.But this situation is explained to us that bitcoin can get stronger soon and will reverse the situation for to better. Hopefully, it will push the price to break the higher price and back to $30k.",

It happens to meet the expectation sometimes and other times it will not so that is why not to invest more than you can lose is still the professional way to go in cryptocurrency investment.

I think about the recent news is all about the UK's regulators recognizing bitcoin as regulated assets.Well, is that a good news?For those that likes to see regulators touching crypto assets, that could be a good news because there's confidence that the government of UK won't be banning it.",

No one really knows.People would normally be calling themselves that they had predicted the right thing when bitcoins hits up the market but its totally random.Come to mind off that we do only have two possible paths which the price might go up or down.Of course we would really be making out some analysis which we would be predicting whether it would dump or increase on certain levels.By the use of those technical indicators then we would really be having at least the idea on where prices could gobut bare up on mind that its not 100% precise.",

It’s going to be interesting to see where the market goes after the end of the week. Seeing the current price pump makes me even more excited on where bitcoin price could go. Although this is a sudden increase but we know bitcoin is definitely heading for it. So we don’t have to worry about this, though we may encounter a bull trap in the end but it’s fine as long as we never get tempted to sell, instead hold tight for future profits.",

This is good for those who are able to bought at a cheaper price, taking profit will start to happen as well which might put the price into some pullback. ^ We hope that they are all right, it seems all are predicted in a bullish way which is I think it is possible that will happen to the BTC price. We are in almost in the fourth quarter of the month which is the most anticipated moment that the BTC price will raise. However, just prepare your fund for investing in DCA way. When they got wrong about their prediction and instead of a market correction, accumulating more would be a great move here while waiting for the bull market.",
