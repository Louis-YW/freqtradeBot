They have banned mining for citizens, citing a shortage of electricity, but they themselves have entered into an agreement with BITFURY and are mining at hydropower plants. According to unofficial data, at least 500 MW of power is dedicated to mining. Every winter, we experience power outages or increased tariffs. We are deceived into believing that we have a water shortage, while in reality, they sell water to our neighbors and use the generated electricity for mining. As a politician from Kyrgyzstan, I am requesting your help, the crypto community, to conduct an investigation through Shodan.io and find out how many mining devices are operating in Kyrgyzstan. Let's expose the energy mafia in Kyrgyzstan! Let's help the people of Kyrgyzstan!Its MW per hour or 166 666 ASICS with 3KWT per hour consumption each You can send the information to the email address civicenlight@gmail.com",
