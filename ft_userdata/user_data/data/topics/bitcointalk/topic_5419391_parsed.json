I would agree that in the beginning there is a lot of hype as well, specially in the bull run that we have in 2021.But since we are in the bear market now, who knows, maybe it's a good time to buy this project and wait for the next bull run.News is that it went as high as +7% in the last 24 hours.",

      "body": "what i ask myself:will fifa use altcoin in the world cup? I don't think so! So why are people rushing to buy this altcoin? i honestly can't understand how people in this cryptocurrency market think, people run to buy this altcoin even though they know that in the world cup they will not buy this altcoin fifa is just using the altcoin technology and is not buying the altcoin itself let alone not endorsing people to buy that altcoin, so what is the point of people rushing to buy that altcoin?Quote from: Dave1 on November 04, 2022, 09:15:02 AMYeah, I heard this from some random tiktok account saying that Algo could hit big as it is the Fifa official blockchain partner.However, it this is the case then what will happen after the Fifa, so it could be another pump and dump project? I would agree that in the beginning there is a lot of hype as well, specially in the bull run that we have in 2021.this is another question, what will happen to altcoin when the world cup ends? also fifa is using the altcoin blockchain and is not buying the altcoin so it makes no sense for people to rush to buy this altcoin or am I missing something?Quote from: Dave1 on November 04, 2022, 09:15:02 AMBut since we are in the bear market now, who knows, maybe it's a good time to buy this project and wait for the next bull run.News is that it went as high as +7% in the last 24 hours. the entire cryptocurrency market has gone up, that's why this altcoins has also gone up, the prices of many altcoins are going up against the BTC - Altcoins  pair",

I don't think so, Algorand has become one of partnership for world club but i don't even think if that will have great impact to the algorand. Did you think when people seeing ads of algorand and they will be buying it at the same time? It's a way to make more exposure for algorand but it doesn't mean it will give massive impact to the algorand like massive adoption.

The only possible thing if we can assume a few percents or even less than 1 percents were adopting algorand by seeing that sponsorship.",

      "body": "All that comes out of news and an increase in the price is purely speculative, in Qatar (where the World Cup is) not many people tend to spend digital money and the cash is still overwhelming, so if we assume that FIFA, for the sake of argument, chose that currency, the percentage increase in demand for it will not exceed 1%, which is different. Just as if Bitcoin was used which is not going to happen soon.Therefore, it is another form of pumping and differentiation based on spreading rumours.",

      "body": "Being a World Cup sponsor does not mean being a good fundamental. Because this is not like a traditional business which when sponsoring a big event like the world cup can increase sales. Crypto needs technology and use case, if both have good news, even if it is not a sponsor of the world cup it is possible that cryptocurrency will increase in price and increase in holders. However, for the news about this sponsorship, I think the potential is the remaining flash pump, which needs to be rethought, its good if you can maximize the moments, but not for hold too long when pumping.

This just means that it’s going to be liked by many so there is a hype and community around it. Reddit fell in love with Nano as well back in 2018 altcoin run, and you can see how terrible Nano is doing right now, I bought so much and now it worths nothing.So Algo is a bit like that, there is a hope for it, there are a lot of people who hope a lot from it, and there are eyes on it that watches every single move, all of which is a great thing for any project but that doesn't mean that it’s going to be any good, it could also end up doing terrible as well.",

I don't think so.The announcement about FIFA partnering with the Algorand blockchain was published a few months ago, and indeed when that happened the price of $ALGO went up, but for now, I feel that the hype is gone. There are no clear and correlated fundamentals between their current partnership. Can we buy world cup tickets with $ALGO? no isn't it?",

I'm not optimistic with its future although if there are fundamentals that makes it good and desirable, that's just my opinion and I would look rather with other altcoins that have potential in my opinion. Just learn the lesson when mostly are bullish, the opposite might come so don't hope and expect a lot from it so that when the expectation you're setting on it didn't come, you're still safe emotionally.",

Let's say there is nothing to do here for x100 profit hunters, but if we are talking about quiet investing in the long term, for example 3-4 years, then ALGO is quite suitable for purchase.",
