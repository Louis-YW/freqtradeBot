What's your point of view whether bitcoin can give the opportunity to earn because nowadays I see more people who lose money from it instead of earningThey panic because the price has dropped and then sell their assets so it's a clear loss, Bitcoin also give an opportunity better to earning. I think if you're more interested investing in shiba then do it, but it is better to split half into bitcoin or other altcoin that according to your observations will have potential in the future, so having more assets is best not only one.",

What's your point of view whether bitcoin can give the opportunity to earn because nowadays I see more people who lose money from it instead of earningThat's because they cannot handle the shock of the sudden dumps. Those people whom you saw lose more are always expecting to win the game. It's all about patience, throw away that quick money mentality because it will not get you anywhere. About Shiba Inu, what you are planning may be the correct way to make some money out of it. If you are decided that it will be the coin of your choice. Trade it, because that's what I did before and I made some profits. It's not for holding long-term, in my opinion. It's better off to be always moving.",

I'm sure that there're lots of experienced traders who can give me an advice I am not really a experienced trader as i am more the hodler type of guy but my advice to you would be to not invest into Shiba Inu because after all it is just a shit-coin with no use-case no purpose or anything that matters. It was created because Elon Musk made a few tweets about Dogecoin and the type of dog that is depicted in the Dogecoin logo is a Shiba Inu, that is literally the only reason why Shiba Inu exists. I have to admit that the guys behind Shiba Inu made some things right because it is pretty much the only meme-coin of the second generation that is still alive at the moment even though the meme-coin hype is dead now, thank god. In the longterm tough i think it only goes downwards for Shiba Inu.",

A memecoin has nothing to offer in the long run, it was to be just for fun. \"meme\" Same like Dogecoin. Holding it will jeopardize your investment because there's no assurance as when a group of whales will dump it. It could be later or tomorrow and there's a chance you are asleep while they are dumping it.",

Honestly, it's just another meme coin that has past an ATH and bull run. We shall see if the same ATH or more with that if the next bull run comes in.Remember that even experts tell you that it also has a future, no one will know what will happen exactly in the future. Today, it may be looking that low in price and there are still investors interested on it but you won't know by tomorrow if the same thing still exists for it.",

Better to buy more good coins, while the market is still down a little because in the coming days most probably we will for the next bull market so better to grab this opportunity now.",

Well, personally I don’t think its worth the risk, better if you analyze it again and see its fundamental status, you can know if its worth buying or not. For me, if there’s no usage and have a huge supply, I’ll pass and look for another project, this is too risky.",

I don't expect much for these meme coins, though I see it has some potential but I really don't have the guts to trust this and become my long-term asset. They are just preferred for short-term investment and a good choice during the Bull market. But if we think about it many years from now, that seems so hard to speculate it and probably we just got wrong (which in fact, it is always).",
