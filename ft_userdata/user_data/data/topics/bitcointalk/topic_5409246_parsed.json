Perhaps you should start by explaining why the involved accounts used the same Twitter profile links and username. I don't think it was just a mistakeBefore that, someone already report him but one of the moderator didn't ban him because mia_houston use the address earlier than rindo, but in this case it's different where rindo use the telegram before mia_houston.Quote from: _BlackStar on January 23, 2022, 03:07:22 PMCan any one of you explain to me why any of these users are not banned even though the evidence I have found is valid enough to say they are alt? mia_houston and rindo are alt based on the wallet they used before, rindo has been banned while mia_houston is still active until now. Are there any special considerations why one of these accounts is not banned?Quote from: _BlackStar on December 25, 2021, 10:03:06 AMBan Evasion, please review this catch.Well, if some of you find a lot of newbie or other low ranking members doing ban evasion, then this time I found a hero member who did it.

But this time, the rhomelmabini got a good catch, very clear evidence that they were ban evasion. Rindo posted a Twitter profile in 2015 [she/ he was banned] and was then followed by mia_houston in 2016. If in Deember mia_houston was acquitted, then this time it seems not.Quote from: Mia_houston123 on August 09, 2022, 02:15:21 PMPlease reconsider the evidence reported.However you have violated the rules on evasion of ban, and as a old user you should know how these rules are enforced.

As an account investigator of course you know how cheating can happen, can you tell me the real reason rindo was banned from the forum, and why didn't he appeal ?the offense he committed at that time was not due to the use of the my old wallet but another mistake which I also don't know the reason for, but, after he retired because he had got a job as a teacher, I once contacted him and he say told me if he no longer had control of the account and I don't know why but what is certain is that the account has been controlled by someone else since December 2017, as seen in this archive https://archive.is/ga0y5You can ask members from Indonesia here, when in 2015 in Indonesia cryptocurrencies were not this big and if I'm not mistaken, Indonesia only had one truly trusted exchange at that time that supported bitcoin/IDR exchanges, namely bitcoin.co. id which has now changed its name to indodax, each indodax registration can only use one id, namely an ID card, sim, or passport, whereas at that time we did not have a sim or passport to register the indodax account, so when he used the wallet it made me very angry but finally I no longer use the wallet and prefer to make a wallet from several gambling sites, you can ask @black_star (because he was the first to investigate the use of the wallet), did he find my use of the wallet again after it was used by someone else or he finds a transaction link between the my old wallet and my new wallet that was used afterwards?Because it was due to the limitations of the wallet registration method and also the exchange at that time in my country so I handed the wallet to him and if I'm not mistaken I was still a Full member rank at that time, because it time was easy to increase the rank of course I didn't think too much and  I ever thought about not continuing to build a mia_houston account, but because this is my first account, of course it's a shame to throw it away, but I really don't think the problem will be as complicated as it is now.Quote from: _BlackStar on August 11, 2022, 11:13:06 PMI hope any answers and questions that users in this thread to ask mia_houston don't influence the moderator's decision to ban any users especially mia_houston.

So this really doesn't improve anything, and I think it's a moderator's area though we can share some opinions.I really respect you for the knowledge you have, and I hope you can be fair to anyone regardless of whether you like the person or not, because you are now a DT and as a DT you have to be fair and not just drown someone with mistakes  with not have absolutely solid evidence as you did some time ago, so to give rise to the notion that you are abusing trust.I don't care about the number of accusations, or even ridicule from other people as long as they can't provide stronger evidence against me because it's based on the presumption of innocence and I hope the moderators can act fairly and also wisely in making decisions taking into account every accuracy evidence and defense that I do, because after all the moderator is someone we respect here and if I'm guilty of course I won't appeal because many say my chances are small, because actually there are a lot of people who might not appeal just because they have a chance small, but I don't want to be a desperate person because in any case, it's certainly not justified for someone to get a sentence without stronger evidence.I also hope that the moderators will be very wise in making decisions based on the principle of justice and also stick to the principle of the presumption of innocence in deciding whether someone is guilty or not.I also hope that the members here don't have to immediately convict someone without providing strong enough evidence to declare him guilty, or even directly judge the person based on arguments even without solid evidence just to appear active in the forum and also based on other  because people reports that indeed all this time he had a routine to report other people and we all immediately believed him because he did have the power over the trust given by the forum to him.I hope that we are all wise in seeing every perspective that exists because indeed we are human beings who do not escape from forget and mistakes by accident.",

There is no record of changing the email address or password on that account in the Security Log: https://bpip.org/Profile?p=rindo At the very least make sure there is some valid evidence to back up your bullshit story. Besides, that thread only proves that you cheated in the MOVEMENT bounty campaign with a fake Portuguese translation of their ANN.

How is that possible? Especially considering that he was supposedly your \"mentor\" who introduced you to the world of Bitcoin.

How is that possible? Especially considering that he was supposedly your \"mentor\" who introduced you to the world of Bitcoin. As far as I know, a valid ID card is a legal requirement in Indonesia upon reaching the age of 17. Didn't I say that he has used my indodax wallet? after I found out he was using the wallet then I gave the wallet completely to him, did I ever say he didn't have an ID card or other wallet, try to understand what I said well?when he used the my wallet off course  I say that in the end I gave it to him because if I use it again of course the problem will be more complicated from now.",

Or did you translate your posts on sports from somewhere on the Internet? Just for a woman to know so much about soccer is amazing  I've met very few women in my life who know soccer so well.I'm not a journalist, but since I was little I lived in a sports environment, especially football, but wait.., I hope you won't try to say that women are forbidden to know more things, especially sports or football than men, I don't know where you live but I think that in today modern era, sport or football is no longer owned by men but it is already a plural sport that even women are no less powerful than men, when a woman can be an athlete, a politician and even a president, then why when women know more about the world of football actually doubt you?Oh my God, what the hell are you talking about? Where in my words have you found a manifestation of misogyny? All I said was that I've hardly ever met a woman who knows soccer that well. That's all I said. And you just jumped all over me... With views like yours, I don't see the point in continuing the conversation.",
