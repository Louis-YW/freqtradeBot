That's why he/she stated they need a bounty hunter, not a bounty manager.",

You should really give some more important information, at least some basics about the business in question, whether it is a start-up or already active. It is also important, apart from Twitter, which other networks would work on. The requirements are not the same for Twitter and TikTok or even forums for example.It is also very important that you present some expectations and goals that you want to achieve. To start from the beginning and make noticeable results, I think that $100 a week might be a small amount.Quote from: coin-investor on May 28, 2023, 02:57:37 PMWhy are you looking for one bounty hunter if you want to increase your Twitter followers then launch a bounty campaign or a contest, invite people to follow for a chance to win $200, or if you really insist on only one then be descriptive on what your goal and what you want to achieve on your Twitter account so the applicant will have an idea if they can do this job.He wants a person who will manage his social media accounts. He awkwardly said he was looking for a bounty hunter because it was not a bounty program, but a paid ($100 per week) position for a social media manager.",

Then second is can you please specify if you are looking for a Bounty hunter or a Bounty Manager?        And then what you are looking for should be here, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0, then it should be better if you apply for copper member here in the forum so that everyone can send you a message here in the forum, and also indicate your telegram channel or where you can be contacted as well here too.",
