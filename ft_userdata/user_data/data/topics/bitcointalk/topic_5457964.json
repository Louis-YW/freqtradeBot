But wallets do not estimate in byte. If he needs the fee rate to be estimated in byte also, maybe because he wants to use ViaBTC transaction accelerator and the transaction support replace-by-fee and needed to had some fee, he can use the explorer to get the fee in sat/byte. But that transaction will not support replace-by-fee because he broadcasted it using Blockchain.com wallet which does not support it, he should just yes ViaBTC accelerator directly to know if the transaction will get accelerated or not.Quote from: Hatchy on June 29, 2023, 06:01:41 AMPending transaction sometime could be as a result of low transaction fees.

      "body": "if you underpayed the fees (which is the case in most stuck transaction cases), there are several things you can do... They depend on how you initially created the transaction, the receiving wallet,, your technical knowledge and the urgency...wait it out... if it's a transaction between your own wallets, it'll either get included in a block sooner or later, or most network nodes will prune it after a couple of weeks and you can re-use the unspent outputswait it out, but keep broadcasting the transaction so the network nodes won't prune it (usefull if you're paying somebody else that trusts you completely... like a family member or a close friend... It'll probably be slower than the first option, but the receiver won't see a \"dissapearing\" unconfirmed transaction)bump the fee (this only works if your transaction is opt-in rbf). I don't know blockchain's wallet... haven't used them in many, many years... But if they create opt-in rbf transactions, i suppose they'll have some kind of menu to bump the fee (but other users have already pointed out that they believe blockchain does not create opt-in rbf transactions)you can try to double spend the unspent output but use a bigger fee this time... The problem is that most (if not all) nodes will reject your transaction... This is more or less the \"bump the fee\" equivalent of a non-opt-in-rbf transaction, with waaaaaaay less chance of succes and it requires waaaaaaay more technical knowledge.you can do a CPFP IF you either received change from this transaction or if you're also the receiver. Some wallets (like electrum) even have a nifty wizard to help you with this process... I don't know if blockchain or trust wallet have such a feature tough (can you import your trust wallet into electrum? That would probably help you a little bit?)you can pay a TRUSTWORTHY BIG bitcoin mining pool to include your transaction in their next block... I know and trust viabtc... But i'm not affiliated with them! If you payed > 10 sat/vbyte you can even use their free tx accelerator (but, if you payed more than 10 sat/vbyte, i guess your tx wouldn't be stuck for 20 hours) => https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator",

I do not know if it is possible to use the web version based on the data of the application.As for the Trust wallet, the private key of the receiving address can be extracted and used on the Electrum wallet, for example, to activate CPFP, since the Trust wallet does not support this feature.Quote from: mocacinno on June 29, 2023, 07:18:40 AMyou can pay a TRUSTWORTHY BIG bitcoin mining pool to include your transaction in their next block...

Generally, OP has nothing to be afraid of since in the most extreme cases the transaction will drop from the network and the amount will be returned to his address in the blockchain wallet.",

All you can do is wait or try Bitcoin accelerator or else try CPFP, not sure it's possible in trust wallet and if not the import the address to Electrum wallet and bump your fee.Trustwallet addresses are native segwit. The recent blockchain.com addresses too are native segwit. The only free accelerator that is working presently is ViaBTC. The mempool fee rate for highest priority now is 11 sat/vbytes which may go up, but if the transaction is around that fee rate, it would have been confirmed.To use free ViaBTC acceleration, it will require 18 sat/vbytes for sending from segwit to segwit address. Also the transaction size should not be more than 500 byte (not vbyte). With mempool at 11 sat/vbytes and the transaction if not yet confirmed, he can not go for ViaBTC free accelerator.I will not advice anyone to go for ViaBTC paid one because it is expensive. It would be better to import the seed phrase on wallet like Electrum and use CPFP to pump the fee. But he should know that the fee should be like he is paying for two transactions (the former transaction which is not yet confirmed and the the one he is just broadcasting).",

What can I do? This never happened me before.Please help.It lies in the fee settings when sending which makes the process slow.If the transaction fee fee is small, then the process will also be slow to complete. That is, sooner or later the transaction process is completed depending on the amount of the fee that will be used.If that's the case, then you have to wait. I think for now the transaction you made has been confirmed or the Bitcoin you sent has been entered.Why did you choose Trust Wallet as a wallet to store Bitcoins when there are some better wallets to use?Have you studied how secure Trust Wallet is before you move Bitcoin there?",

      "body": "Adding a small fee doesn't make your transaction slow, nor the process... Adding a small fee will give the miners a smaller incentive to add your transaction to the block they're working on...A block can contain up to 1Mb of transaction data (+ a maximum of 3 Mb of witness data). The difficulty gets adjusted every 2016 blocks so that the average time between two blocks is about ~10 minutes (on average).This means that (on average) about 6 Mb of \"actual\" transaction data can end up in the blockchain per hour. If more than 6 Mb of unconfirmed transactions get broadcasted per hour, the mempool of the nodes get filled with a backlog of unconfirmed transactions. Since miners are businessmen, they try to optimize their financial gains. They do this by prioritizing the transactions with the highest fee per (virtual) byte of transaction data. They do this because a miner can add a coinbase transaction to the block. This coinbase transaction funds an address generated by the mining pool with a value of the current block reward PLUS the sum of the fees of all transactions included in a block. So, if you add insufficient fees, you give no incentive to miners to prioritize your transaction and the odds are it remains in the mempool of the nodes for a longer period of time. By default, nodes prune old unconfirmed transactions from their mempool after 2 weeks (if my memory serves me right)However, there are tricks to increase the incentive for pool operators to prioritize your transactions... If you loop back to my previous post in this very thread:if you wait it out, you do not increase the incentive of the pool operators. Usually, your transaction will only be mined if the backlog of unconfirmed transactions is gone. If this takes more than 2 weeks, odds are most nodes will prune your tx from their mempoolif you wait but keep rebroadcasting, it's the same situation as the one above (just waiting it out), but you periodically remind the nodes of your unconfirmed tx, pushing your tx back in their mempools once it gets prunedif you bump the fee, you replace your transaction with one with a higher fee, so the amount of sats per (virtual) byte of transaction data is higher, giving the pool operators a higher incentive to add your tx to the block they're trying to solveif you double spend the unspent output used as an input for the stuck transaction, you kind of try to achieve the same thing as bumping the fee, but in a much more artisinal way with waaaaaaay less chance of succesif you do a cpfp, you basically use one of the outputs of the stuck transaction as input for a new transaction. The miner can only add the fees of the new transaction to the coinbase reward if they also add the stuck transaction to their block. The trick is to make the CPFP transaction with such a high fee (per virtual byte of transaction data) that the pool operator has a high incentive to add both in order to be able to claim the fees of the second (cpfp) txif you pay a mining pool to add your transaction, you directly give money to the pool operator to counter balance the low fee... This is a non-technical sollution, but it does work (eventough, as noted before, it can be pretty pricey)One thing to remember: those are all odds and averages... It IS possible to get into a block with a tx with a 10 sat/vbyte fee whilst there are 15 sat/vbyte fee tx's still in the mempool. It IS possible your 100 sat/vbyte tx doesn't get added to a block eventough most other tx's in the mempool have a 15 sat/vbyte fee... This being said: the selection of the tx's from the mempool is allmost always an automatic process, and usually you can predict pretty well which tx's from the mempool will be added to the next block.Quote from: tabas on June 30, 2023, 12:35:11 PM--snip-- there's no other reason why a transaction gets unconfirmed for several hours.Eventough insufficient fees is allmost allways the culprit, it does happen that a transaction has unconfirmed parents, or is dropped from the mempool of most nodes (usually because it has been broadcasted to long ago). There might even be other reasons, but i can't think of any except those two right now.",

OP didn't come back to this thread and didn't post the TXID and looking at the mempool right now, it seems that everything has cool down and cheap so I guess that since it's more than 24 hours. It's possible that it's likely that his transaction has been confirmed already. Hopefully those that will encounter this in the nearest future as the potential bull run is about to come and more transactions will occur at once again, this will serve as a lesson to check fees before pressing that send button.",
