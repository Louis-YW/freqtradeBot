But besides that some coins fake volume with exchanges is concerning. Yeah it's dead, the problem is some exchange sites were manipulating the volume but again this is always related with the low tier exchange site and you will rarely saw that on the legit exchange site. The exchange site was manipulating its volume caused by it was looking for the demand from the market. We know that if the low tier exchange site has very small amounts of users. Sometime the dex volume can be manipulated as well.",

Millions token ath was over 200 dollars, it was a year ago before the bear market occurs, so maybe this coin is really dead? But not totally since there are still some volumes left and a few exchanges still allows this coin for trading but for your safety you can just stay away from it if ever you are planning to invest.You can instead go on the other coin derace as its ath is only at 8usd. That wasn't a lot and I think there is still a chance for this coin to recover together with others when the market returns to normal.",

Don't get me wrong, I never really say this to people directly, but when people invest into these type of tokens, maybe they learned something from their mistakes? I mean it is clear that it was NEVER  a good decision to invest into it. Yet, even with that in mind, some people still invested into it, which makes absolutely no sense to me.This means that either you will make the same mistake again which would be bad, or you will learn from this and maybe not make the same mistakes again? That would be the ideal situation for people to be in. I feel like this may not be a right time for buying more altcoins; we must wait for some more time for not losing compared to failing to catch exact bottom price levels.",

Is it dead what you think?There are a lot of tokens experiencing a huge drop during this bearish market, not only MM tokens. Not sure whether MM will be dead or not, but you can't say it is dead for now because it still has trading volume in some exchanges. I know the price has dropped from $223 to $2, and this makes the trading volume is decreasing much, but as long as there are people who trade MM tokens, we can't claim it is dead already. If you are planning to buy this token, I suggest analyzing it deeply. Simply don't buy it if you think it won't survive a long time!!https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/million#markets",

No users, no buyers, no demand and nothing come for this token. You can move to the another token. This shit token may still there but the volume is showing if the token is dying right now. Millions token was a garbage token along with derace token. So, are you actively gambling with the meme token like that has no volume and demand? You can get a better options rather than those tokens.",

The price is around the ICO price so that means people still hold those tokens. No surprise the low volume since the team isn't marketing it anymore since they want the price to go up first before they start marketing it again. I don't know what the situation with it is, but even if it's dead, that's not always a bad thing. All good things must come to an end eventually and this may be the end for that coin. If that's the case, then I hope everyone involved enjoyed their time with it. Just because one thing ends doesn't mean another can't begin.",

However, between the risk and return on something like this, at this point, it can also serve as a test of the investment if you are willing to lose. I personally don't have too much of a difference in care for it, but I think if people go with it, they will always know how to hype it to maintain as well as promote it as pump and dump games in the short term.",
