Absolutely.That's usually the case in gambling. People will always tell the stories about when they won, but forget to tell about all the times they lost money.Some people seem to simply forget the times they lost, and celebrate the times they won. It's funny how the brain works. And casinos try their best to make gamblers continue to play for a long time, so that they win a few times, but in the end they lose money if you actually count the money in and out.",

Or even if they did win, wouldn't really consider the money they won as worth it to be called as \"paying off\". I myself have won and lost my fair share but I've never really considered it to have payed off, it's just a process now that adds to the enjoyment.

I haven't heard about this before and I see nothing related to it while I used search engine.The reason gamblers lose is because they gamble more frequently. Those that gamble infrequently win than those that gambling daily or almost daily.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on July 28, 2022, 06:07:46 AMThis is a complete departure from what would be a scientific study, as people tend to exaggerate their winnings and minimize or hide gambling losses, which means that these data are not reliable. How is it not reliable? I can easily know if I my net profit is positive or negative. I do not see anything wrong about it and people will have to have it in mind that this is just a poll from people. There are many researches or findings like this.But the best and the most accurate information about this can only be from the betting companies though because they have the betting history of their customers and they know the numbers and percentage of those than win or lose.",

Football is one of the game that is very profitable if you will just bet on teams that has high probability of winning and up against the underdog teams. Like basketball, Team that has a good statistics always win on this game so sport bettors that has a good analytical skills about football team has a high chance of winning same as the graph shown which most country is a football fan. Even that percentage seems small for normal viewers, Having a double digit percentage is still a good result to see the numbers of person winning.",

Those stats are like \"who are the biggest liars?\" in my opinion. I personally love to bet on football although I generally target low scoring teams to get better/surprising odds.",

I also find this data unreliable and with the potential to be misleading, because if people say betting has paid them that is they have made profit from it, how much really have they made? Can they really beta their chest and say the amount altogether is substantial enough to say that they are making profit or the winnings they have made are just little little compensations for the massive losses they have made. IMO this data should have included benchmark amount that can be generally accepted as profitable. I didn't see any African country on the selected list however I'd like to say that my country has a very high interest in football and roughly I can say majority of sports bettors bet on it. There are regular and many stories of how people have earned substantial sums from it, hence many people around me including myself bet regularly/occasionally... So yes football betting can pay off.",

Conducted in May 2021The trouble with these sorts of data and graphing is it doesn't really represent an accurate figure. Unless you're getting the raw data from a reliable selection of sportbooks (who would most likely never share what could be perceived as valuable information) then it can end up with all kinds of discrepancies. It can even be a cultural thing, where Italians are very macho and it is not macho to be a loser - so they might decide to lie even if it is an obscure anonymized survey. There could be other things going on like slight differences in translations which encourage people to pick different answers, or even where the data is gathered - if your respondents from a particular country are more clustered around the best performing team then they might genuinely win more.",

Maybe people on Italy doesn't have a nice luck when it comes to betting.Football betting pays off the most if you can produce more wins over your losses. If not then I think many are still going to do it only for the sake of being entertained. I know that watching the sport alone is entertaining already but that feeling can increase dramatically if there was a money at stake and you put it in your favorite teams.",
