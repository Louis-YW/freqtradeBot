I made a warning thread about this casino few days ago on our local board https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5464308.msg62763252#msg62763252 when I experience bug on their game.

The website purposely disable live support to avoid confrontation from user like me and just let the global chatbox open for the announcement which contradict to each other since they always suggest to use live support for concerns which is not available.",

I am quite confused with their demographic. I thought they're focusing on SEA countries, but I can see Singapore on their no-go list. And interestingly, I actually tried a VPN through Indonesia [or was it Malaysia?] when they blocked me from accessing through Europe and US regions, and so I thought they're focusing on the countries close to them. Thus I tried Singapore first [which was blocked, obviously], and then Indonesia, and still hit the same wall, but I can't see Indonesia and Malaysia on their no-go list.Anyway, the point I tried to reach from my efforts, do they have social media where they can be reached more publicly?",

[...]For this matter, I am not sure if Philippine applies the same rule, but my country as well as several other countries have a law that prohibit government officials to have their own business while working for the country. Thus, providing the business permit [or other SoW] kinda ensure them that you're not govt. officials. Though I am not sure why a govt. staff are not allowed to play in their platform, unless gambling is prohibited in Philippine?",

It's just that sad that for this amount they're going to let things slide which won't benefit them at all but are fine to lose one client.
