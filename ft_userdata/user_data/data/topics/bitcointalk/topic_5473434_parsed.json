Also the price of the coin isn't the only factor. Some coins go higher prices but their inflation is also higher so in reality holders are not in profit.About DOGE 1 dollar isn't impossible, but reaching this price can only be achieved through extremely speculative movements. You remember how it went ATH the last time. That wasn't an organic growth so it's not sustainable.",

Bitcoin was created as method of payment and Doge coin was created for fun but surprisingly during the last bull run of 2021 its price skyrocketed to $0.74, which nobody had expected, largely attributed to backing of Elon Musk. How it performs in the next bull run, will depend on its practical use case, support of its community and celebrities like Elon Musk.",

And many are there.It is true that dogecoin in existence for over 10 years. But it can never touch the Bitcoin or can not get hype like Bitcoin. Its value from 0.0000869 to 0.076 it is just due to Elon Musk. He was manipulating this meme coin. And still can Manipulate. If this will happen so we can see the Dogecoin at $1.",

      "body": "There are a couple of red flags with Dogecoin and the biggest of them is its high supply. If I am correct it has a supply of $132 billion and that does not make it good to achieve $1 price in the long term or the short term. The reason why it reached an ATH of $0.76 last time was due to the hype created by Mr Musk and the due to the bull run. It is not a cryptocurrency with any kind of real-world utility as it was created as a joke/meme coin by the founders and to date there is zero development happening after its creation. It does have a big community but most meme coins have a big community which does not make it a favourite of everyone. Everyone holding a meme coin is only waiting for hype or a bull run in the market to exit.",

The population is very low and it is when the population of the coin is high the price is also high. This is a very simple mathematic. If Dogecoin founder pump invest some millions of dollars and when people see the appreciation in value then people will be using it and the price will be on the rising side. But nothing is done to increase the value the population will also drop because nobody will like to keep funds in a place that is not moving on. And the way I look at it, Dogecoin is one of the major coins that is making altcoins a shitcoins because the movement is not encouraging people to invest. But as you ask I ever the coin will hit $1. Guy this is serious matter. $1 not even $100. Well from the figures you have 0.0000869 to $0.076 that means it is getting closer, so I believe it will hit the $1 next year. That is my prediction on it.",

I can create a coin today that will cost $100,000 tomorrow. How will I do it? I will create a coin of which there is only 1 piece and i own it. Doge is not as small as you think, because there are 7,300 times more of them than bitcoins and this makes dogecoin only 70 times smaller than bitcoin and not 50,000 as you might think.My thread about this written in 2018.difference between 1$ coin and 1000$ coin",

So, for the likes of those meme coins or tokens, there is not that much hope for the newly created ones. They gain popularity and then make some buzz in the news and community and then what's next?

I'm guessing that most of you have been holding thousands to millions of it but if you have never dumped that coin to the peak or at least close to that, you've missed the train. I am not saying that it is no longer going to peak again but we don't know when it does. As an altcoin, it follows the trend for Bitcoin but we saw that it didn't do much during 2021 bull run.So in hopes of the next bull run maybe next year or two, if it don't move that much again then your expectations for it to reach $1 should be void. Remember that Dogecoin keeps on printing more supplies so it has an unlimited supply and that's why instead of deflating, its supply is inflating and its price will keep on decreasing, law of supply and demand mate.",

      "body": "It purely depends on particular Altcoin and their supply, service it has to offer and development. Since we are discussing particularly about Doge, let me share my opinion as I think doge definitely has possibility of touching $1 as it went so close in May 2021 but it didn't happen due to any solution which coins offers in real world but rather because of hype and FOMO created by Elon Musk's lethargic support for Doge as there are people who had respect for Elon Musk and his work hence they blindly invested into Doge as the talk of the town was if Elon being the richest person in the world is supporting Doge then they though he has some plans of including Doge in his projects but it was just occasional tweets and talks nothing more than that. After a while even Elon's mention of Doge started fading it's power where we saw 10x increase for the first time was reduced to just 10% to 20% pump for few mins whenever Elon was mentioning Doge at later stage. If similar thing repeats with a strong speculation that Doge will be made mainstream then we may see it touching it $1 but cannot guarantee it will stay around same level.Even if Doge is here for 10 more years without any development we cannot expect it's value to increase.",

You cannot compare Bitcoin and doge coin in this regard. If you have to compare price of two coins, compare those which have identical supply.
