Which team is your favorite to get the title this season?For me turkey is no stranger to me, when it comes to football clubs, they have a team that excels and is the best in the super league, such as: Istanbul Basaksehir, Besiktas, Fatih Karagumruk, Galatasaray and many others.@ingiltere, I think this is the Turkish super league, which is worth betting on in this season's competition, if I may suggest, you should post here the first round team, second, semifinals and finals specifically for the turkish league and the eliminated and defending teams to make it easier for the community here to judge the team that won this season's champion.for the results of the match, I looked at 5 top performing and good clubs, but maybe I should watch and follow the match first, until the semifinals.",

They seem like the most motivated club for the upcoming season. Like most of the big teams, they started last season horribly but after the coach change they were performing much better. By the end of the season, they were probably the best performer. That is why they got the second position in the standing. They want to continue that momentum and they have a new coach now, Jorge Jesus. I believe they are the team most likely to get the title next season.",

      "body": "The previous season was a really interesting one. I never thought for even once that Trabzonspor would dominate the season this much high. Fenerbahce were able to pull themselves together while we were getting close to the end and they had a decent streak too. However it wasn't enough for competing with Trabzonspor for the championship. For this season, I expect Fenerbahce to be even more competitive actually but I have a little doubt too as they have changed their manager. Jorge Jesus is a great manager but we don't know if he will adapt to Fenerbahce yet.",

It's a league fixture, not a cup, the team with most points will win the championship. There are four big clubs historically who won the championship, as you can see their names in the poll. Those are the favorites again this season. Other than them, Bursaspor and Başakşehir had one championship but think about it like Leicester City's PL trophy, it happens one in a million times.I expect one of three biggest clubs to win the championship, I don't think Trabzonspor can do it second time in a row. Teams that don't play in European competitions have lighter fixture so that might be an advantage for them.",

But they also finished the league very badly. They have consistently lost points in the last weeks. I choose Fenerbahçe. They showed a great performance in the second half of the league. They will continue their great performances in the new season as well. They are the closest team to the championship.",

In order to prevent the victimization of the clubs, agreements should be made in foreign currency instead of the national currency. I think the transfer limits should be adjusted in a way that does not force the Clubs. Fenerbahce will start the season early. The first step was to deal with experienced technical man Jesus. I think experienced name will make Fenerbahce champion this year.",

We don't know what the biggest teams of the league will do before the season begins. Galatasaray need to improve many positions and they need to solve their manager problem as well. Fenerbahce have a great manager like Jorge Jesus from now on but we will see if there will be a problem. They seem like a serious candidate for the title now.",

But, the price that is talked seems a bit high, or maybe it looked high to me.The talks have been around 20 million lira per year, when you look at it that way I do not know how they would make that much money if they keep paying this amount to each player, they do pay less for most other players, but when you look at it at euro levels that is 1.15 million euro, which is not really a lot of money for any player to make, if he left and played in Europe, which he totally could, he could make 1 million euro per year at base, plus incentives for sure.",

Trabzonspor, on the other hand, will be very tired in European matches.I agree that there was an immense political support for the Trabzonspor. If we remember throughout the season, the beginning and the middle of the season especially, we can see countless decisions that obviously staged up and there were orders from 'the upstairs'. We all know half of the ruling party AKP has members from the Black Sea region, which almost everyone supports Trabzonspor. This year, with the economy going terrible, they made sure that Trabzonspor won so that their supporters can get a somehow relief. I don't think this will happen again. This year they will make sure that one of the big three will get the title. Probably Fenerbahce.",

Fatih Terim on the other hand thinks that Burak Elmas won the election thanks to him. In the last discussion, Burak Elmas implied that they paid a salary for Fatih Terim in vain. Tensions continue between the two. I think that the person who will be the favorite in the presidential election will be Dursun Özbek. Because Özbek is an experienced name and if he wins again, he is someone who will save his team from a bad situation.",
