  "content": "So we have around 1 month left for the 4th halving. Thought of creating a topic to gauge the bitcoin fever!I first found out about BTC back in Q1 2011. I think i seriously got into it in May 2011. Dl'ed the core software on sep 30 2011.(blockchain size was around ~600mb). Got free BTC via bitcoin faucet 0.05.  Started mining in 2012 via bitminter(geforce 525m getting 12mhps). HDD crashed and i forgot until 2022 when i started serious devotionYeah Yeah i missed the bus even if it was in front of me. Had i lived in a country where Mt Gox supported my currency, it would have been another story.OLDEST Bitcoin video!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjnM2shYIrMI posted my first BTC in this forumhttps://broadband.forum/threads/trading-in-cryptocurrency-in-india.49820/bitcoin 0.4.0 software which i burned in 2011 novhttps://imgur.com/a/Fn17I3q[/img]",

It simply means \"System crashed, bitcoin millionaire trashed\"https://broadband.forum/threads/trading-in-cryptocurrency-in-india.49820/This comment is from the broadband.forum website that the OP referenced and it got my attention. I guess most people had the same view concerning Bitcoin. Many of them will be licking their wounds because the currency they called a thrash is now more valuable than all the currencies of nations. It has equally made not just millionaires but billionaires.  Quote from: ajaxtempest on March 18, 2024, 05:02:48 PMThis is going to be my first time experiencing the Bitcoin halving as a Bitcoin holder. I am super excited about it and looking forward to it's after effects. I have caught the Bitcoin halving fever.This is also going to be my first halving experience and I am also highly expectant. It looks like the approval of Spot ETF by the SEC has made this halving a unique one with price predicted to go very high. I have read a lot about the halving but it seems there are slight variations in this present halving maybe because of the ETF.",

Gox is going to get paid in that currency besides the dollar or other popular currency at that time, another thing is that if you've got Mt. Gox at that time then you'd probably be one of the suckers that would've had their bitcoins stolen. I think that you did just fine with your mining in 2012 but it feels bad to see what happened to that HDD and it's not really your fault that you've become serious about bitcoin in 2022, back then it's worthless or close to worthless and a lot of people aren't taking bitcoin seriously. I've heard bitcoin the same as the year that I've created this account or maybe a bit of a month earlier.",

I hate to say it but the platform has become a tool to spread misinformation.",

I used to look for ways to earn money online those days, and one of the days when I was surfing different websites through a Google search, I stumbled upon a Bitcoin faucet that was giving away satoshis for free every day, I was shocked to see that there is a currency that has a very high value, it was valued less than $500 at that time, I don't remember the exact price though.That was my first impression of Bitcoin. After that, I started surfing different faucets and accumulate satoshis every day, from there onward, I started learning about Bitcoin and what it is, and I was very fascinated by the technology.",

The halving hasn't yet come but we have seen how the market this past weeks has been, even shit coins saw some rise in price.The Bitcoin halving would still cause so many coins to spike up this is not a guarantee that those coins would be successful. The Bitcoin halving would cause many to move into crypto-currency even if they do not Believe in crypto. Everyone would be looking for fast gains.

Me too, bro. I also miss the time when I was clicking on the faucet captchas site to get some of Bitcoin Satoshi And I used to visit these faucet sites daily and spend hours clicking and earn a good profit from them. I used to use freeBitco.com for Bitcoin, which I think gave 800 to 1500 satoshi at the time. I wish if I had all those coins, I would have earned more profit. But anyway, it was my starting point, so I lost a lot and found a lot, and at the same time, I collected knowledge and gained more experience, which today proves my 90% decision was right.  However, my journey also started with faucet sites and after that I started trading by using the same collection of faucet sites which was the first and hardest step of my life. But I was consistent, and finally I earned millions of dollars in my journey through crypto.",

I may not really want to remember how I got here and became one of the bitcoin holders - but I cherish all my time with bitcoin after I invested in it. Of course this is the best thing I have come across from many investment assets – I mean bitcoin is more than just an investment asset.I don't regret anything I've been through before - it wouldn't do any good if I didn't rush when I got to know him. Being a holder is something special for me even though the amount of assets I own may not make me a millionaire by the halving period in 2024.
