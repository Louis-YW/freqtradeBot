Ok caution! Although it's not an ideal solution and works much slower then above two but you can try You have to create a google alert like this:Code:bitnote site:bitcointalk.orgAbove code will search for your name \"bitnote\" on \"bitcointalk\" and will send you an email notification if there's any new result.https://www.google.com/alerts - Click Show options then change below default settings - Change How often: to As-it-happens- Change How many: to All results - Click Create AlertPlease note this all depends on Google Crawler how often it will traverse bitcointalk and how soon you will be notified.",

It is fast and it is easy to configure, you only need to have a Telegram account if you want it to work. There is only one issue with this bot, and that is its ability to accurately count the merits you receive. I am facing this issue otherwise it is the perfect Telegram bot to get instant notification from the forum.",

Once you install that bot and after that anyone who mentions your name in a thread or post then you'll get notified for that mention. That's the best way to see all the mentions that you get in threads or posts and you won't miss a mention with that bot. The best thing about TryNinja's bot is that it's complete free and open-source and you an add changes or extra features in it if you know software development. If you really want to see that who tags you or calls you in a thread or a post then install that bot and you're good to go. The ones who see that thing automatically are most probably using TryNinja's bot or they have made their own bots.You'll also get notified if someone sends merit/merits to your post and you know the more merits you get the more dopamine you'll have. If you want to have dopamine plus all those extra feature then install TryNinja's bot and trust me you'll love the experience. Best of luck!",

Even on threads that aren’t of your origin, you could still get a notification in place on any response to that thread but, it might not be specifically on your post.To get notification on your post, you can use adhoc bot services designed by some established and grounded users of the forum. There are several threads that have been created to support this prompt notification in conjunction with your telegram. Follow the procedures and you would be set.",
