  "content": "It is called address poisoning.I do not know if anyone has brought this on this local board before, but this is happening to me repeated anytime I send money from Binance. And also when I am sending money to Binance (as the scammer knows my Binance address already. Even if I send $300, it happens. I think those scammers are targeting exchange users, like those using Binance. People can easily track the addresses that Biannce is generating which they give their users. I hope you all know that ERC20, BEP20, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum and many other chains are using the same addresses. These makes the addresses easier targets for hackers.What happened I do not want to reveal my Binance address which will be the reason I will not show the proof but people on this forum on English board know how this is real. You will see many scammers address that ended with your Binance address, continuously sending you 0.000357 USDT to 0.0005 USDT with the addresses similar to your Binance account address as you know USDT is a token on those chains. The rate this is happening to me continuously has increased and it happened again yesterday.The scammer's targetThe scammer's will generate address similar to your Binance account or the exchange account that you are using because the address are fixed and not changing like bitcoin address on noncustodial wallet. They will generate as many as possible addresses similar to yours in a way if you only look at the characters ending your exchange account address and the scammer's address, their last 7 characters are the same. The hacker is thinking that if you want to send coins to your exchange address next time, that you will just copy and paste his (the scammer's) address on your wallet directly which is easier instead of going to copy it on your exchange,l account, thereby copying a scammer's address instead but thinking it is yours, using it to send money to the scammer, thinking you are using it to send money to your Binance or exchange account.",

When it comes to doing some kind of transaction it is important to pay attention and be more focused. This is because there are possobilities that we could make a slight mistake on the process. Even without these scam of a thing, we can easily release payment or send to a wrong address etc. My brother as those website they do 5 times confirmation nah so we suppose they do to. Anytime we wan do transaction like this, make we confirm am like three times before we press the send button. E no go make sense say after all the struggle we con carry our hard earn money go dash exchange or another person.",

      "body": "What I have understand so far about those scammer monitoring our addresses is that whenever you save your address somewhere and you don't regularly go to exchange to check if the address is correct, then you don't have mindsets that someone else could send you usdt to you account or mostly when you have lot of funds in your address and regularly perform transaction. As the owner of the address you don't just have to copy your address from a previously sent tx because the scammer is the last person who sent you usdt or ant other assets and you would think is the right address so before you knew it you would end up copying and sending to that address.Advice to anyone who scammers are monitoring; Don't save your address somewhere else anytime you wanna send payment go to your binance or any exchange you are using to copy it back even as that before copying or after copying when you paste the address where you want to send out payment, always go back to the exchange and thoroughly look your address before hitting the send button otherwise it could be that scammer manipulate and have their address there for you to send give them.Usually where I do noticed same thing is when even I swap token I will end up having scam token with fake dollar value displaying in my wallet and if you aren't careful enough and you greedily went to swap the token you would endup sweeping your account due to phishing token they sent to your address. But when I noticed it I don't pay attention to it again.",
