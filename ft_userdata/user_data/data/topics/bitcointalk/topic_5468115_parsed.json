I am closely following this project and performed some interactions in the test network and now I continue to interact in the main network, hoping for airdrop.",

      "body": "An article about speculation for criteria to be eligible for by the airdrop hunters. There's nothing concrete about line token airdrop. It's just a common thing. I don't take it seriously. Even some criteria make any sense, but we are still far away to see linea airdrop to come soon. There have been various articles that were posting the different metrics to be eligible for airdrops. Just to transactions regularly and it will enough to make you eligible. Being active in the network is a key to be eligible for airdrop once it will happen. The only linea team and god knew what real metrics for the token airdrop if that will be going to happen.",

      "body": "This is not an official criteria and I doubt there will ever be any because the linea team have consistently maintained the \"No Airdrop\" statement anytime they addresses the community. Besides the criteria are kind off high for many airdrop hunters who don't have the funds.After such rigorous testnet process you would think it will be considered as one of major criteria for qualifications assuming this was coming from linea team. Eventually, it will boils down to who has burn the most gas fees interacting in linea mainnet. Again linea has always insist on \"No Airdrop\" so guys be careful with all these airdrop info, 99% are fake and scam link.",

Creating token is free money for even project itself, it's likely that there will be a token. Linea was launched by ConsenSys who are also developers of Metamask, If I were to guess, Linea airdrop criteria will be broad and will include metamask users as well.",
