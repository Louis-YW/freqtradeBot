  "content": "Well, i know that there are a lot of mixers available and some of them are really good ones. Then we have instant exchanges and the normal crypto exchanges where people can mix their coins to some extent.I was thinking that it is possible to mix the coins through DEXes. There are a lot of DEXes available and there are also bridges too where one can convert the coin from one blockchain to get another coin to another blockchain.If you can shed more light on this, it may be helpful for many of us.",

This is just called mixing. For ease, you can use [banned mixer] for it which is a mixer. Use the advanced which is about the bitcoin and monero mixing method.",

But that doesn't mean it cannot be traced especially in p2p tx, the one you are dealing (p2p) in dex will suffer the most if we're talking of dirty coins, especially if the user transfer it eventually to its custodial wallet. Unless that user uses different approach like swapping coins to other coins with dex.You will probably get the clean one, then those who will use the dex after you with the same approach will get those dirty coins.",

      "body": "I believe it depends on who is looking at your addresses, it is trivial to hide from people who really don't have any blockchain knowledge, and sending your coins to a decentralized exchange is good enough to hide from such people. It may be worth mentioning that you should not do this with a centralized exchange because they have your kyc data and they keep logs, which they can give to LE at anytime.For better privacy you can exchange your BTC for XMR and XMR back to BTC, and you can do than in a decentralized exchange like Bisq. You can also use swap exchanges like exch.cx that does not collect kyc from you to swap your coins, they are also tor-friendly and you can use their onion link and connect via tor for privacy, all of these should be enough to obscure your tx in the eyes of 'normal' people. But if maybe you want to hide from blockchain analysis companies or your government, you should use CoinJoin tools for that, and send your coins only to a decentralized exchange after CoinJoining.",

      "body": "AgoraDesk is not a mixing service. It is a p2p exchange. The platform itself is also not as anonymous as one would think. I would not consider this, or the method of \"depositing, exchanging for monero, exchanging back)\" as a way to mix.Dexes like Bisq can provide you with a level of anonymity however I would not call it bulletproof either. Other dexes, like uniswap and other on-chain services, are not at all anonymous as the blockchain provides all information about all transactions and trades.Mixers are vulnerable in the sense that you are trusting node operators with - the fact that you trust then with your data- with your data, if they don't respect your privacy in all aspects.The same goes for swapping services that claim to be anonymous. Mixers and swap services can take a lot of data about your as it is ultimately required by law, and they are businesses that want to continue to operate at the end of the day (their marketing means nothing, their TOS means everything)Privacy chains alone can be used, however you need to be sure about your system security and browser/network privacy as well, as these can also make processes redundant. Achieving privacy is hard these days. If you are doing anything wrong, it is easier and better for you to just not do it. If you are innocently just trying to achieve privacy, first master security and privacy, then you can easily utilize privacy chains and various exchanging services with less concern.",

Almost all coins are tainted. What do you want to talk about Coinjoin? People nare using both successfully.People are encouraged to use dex for privacy purposes, so why should i say don't use it. Most coins are tainted but not as tainted as much from hacked exchanges, launder, etc. Don't mix for having privacy and having clean coins after having such transactions. That's the disadvantage of using p2p transactions and maybe but not as much when using Coinjoin. But it still work for privacy tho, just like i said, just don't transfer them directly to a custodial services, because it might be a problem sooner.",

Bisq.netowrk is a combination of a decentralized and P2P exchange, but then again mixing through a P2P exchange should never be advised. The reason is simple. Law enforcement agents can infiltrate the service and pretend to make offers just to fish out and trace people who they think are \"breaking\" the law.This has ever happened before with localcryptos - IRS Sends Undercover Agent to Bust Criminals on Crypto Marketplace",

This is just called mixing.Doing a straight swap to monero and back again achieves very little, and the service you used will be able to see exactly what you've done. If you want to go down this route, then you should swap bitcoin to monero using one service, split the monero up and move it around a couple of times, and then swap different amounts of monero back to bitcoin using different services. If you plan on doing this all via Bisq, then it would be best to use different trading partners for each trade.Your other option for privacy would be to use a good coinjoin implementation such as JoinMarket or Whirlpool.And with everything to do with privacy, you should be running your own node. If you are relying on light wallets synced to third party servers, then your privacy is constantly at risk regardless of what obfuscations you make on-chain.",
