  "content": "NEWS BACKGROUND in the BTC reversal zone at 8 08 2023🟢Justin Sun is associated in society with TRON. The main blockchain for transferring the most popular USDT stablecoin. The exchanges of this marketer are not something influential on the market.🟢USDT is the main and strongest trump card in the game of speculative news deception.How can this affect the market? Is it good or bad for the market❓🦌The plot of FUD is developing for the direction of action \"my right hand is good, and my left hand is bad today\": Please note that FUD is played out in the BTC🪙 Reversal Zone🔴If USDT is bad (to force people to get rid of the \"bad\", but the most popular and liquid stablecoins), then \"bitcoin will logically be good\" and other liquid altos. What can trigger a pulse-shaped exit from the clamping zone🟢if there is an exit from the wedge on bitcoin (the rapid FUD plot of USDT is bad, the emphasis on stablecoin) - the pump of the market. People get rid of USDT through purchases of conditionally \"any cryptocurrency\".🔴If there is a final takeaway (moderate FUD plot, emphasis on Justin Sun and his exchanges) of short StopLoss and encourage people to go short (fuel for a long reversal) on bitcoin with a price squeeze, the pump is canceled.It is logical to understand all this and wait for the outcome of the trading situation, observing risk management and money management",
