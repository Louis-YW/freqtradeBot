Already tried to look Debian software lists.Something very close to bictoin-core.Could you look for \"Electrum\" or \"Multibit\" in Google images? Neither looked or had a \"login\" like a website, but doesn't hurt to check.I doubt that finding the software used would be of any help though. Because if you only have account name (not sure what you're referring to by that but I would imagine the address?) and the password and you have no seedphrase to restore your wallet, then... you would still need to have access to the wallet file but you're saying you no longer have access to that computer.Are you sure it wasn't Blockchain.info? It was quite popular back then.",

The beauty of Bitcoin is it's non-custodial, means that there's no custodial service or server who hodls your Bitcoins for you.With it, no one can recover your bitcoins from a server, even the developers do not have access to anyone's bitcoins.You need to recover the wallet file or any backup of it.That's unless your login details are from an exchange, some custodial wallet, or web wallets.In that case, it depends if the service or owner is still active.",

If by recovery seed, you mean a seed phrase which usually includes 12 or 24 words, take note that there is no seed phrase in Armory. In Armory, private keys are backed up by root key. Armory's root key includes 18 meaningless words and that's different from a seed phrase.",

Thanks for all who tried to help.Yep, if you can't remember anything more than that, you can consider whatever you had in that wallet lost. It won't help you to think about what could have been.But as a side note, you could give it a shot by going back through all your notes from that time, if you've got any. I'm in the habit of jotting down all sorts of stuff and little reminders on paper, and I almost never throw away my old notebooks. You never know what you will find there that might jog your memory.",

Already tried to look Debian software lists.Something very close to bictoin-core.That didn't help that much. First off, plethora of Linux wallet apps to scour the internet from and much of them would've probably changed interfaces over the years, so much so that they would be unrecognizable decades from now (correct me if I'm wrong here, not really that educated regarding how Linux softwares work but yeah). Apart from that, pretty sure the only definitive way we could get your coins back even if we do get your password and your login username is to still get the hardware, as some wallet apps lock themselves upon specific hard disks to secure and make sure that nobody else could gain access to it other than you, regardless. I think your best bet now is to just jumpstart your bitcoin journey without these. it's sad and all that, but at the very least, its search lead you back into trying to investing into bitcoin yeah?",
