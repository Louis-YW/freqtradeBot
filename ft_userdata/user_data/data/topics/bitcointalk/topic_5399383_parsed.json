Using Connexus Network, developers can develop software and DApp projects using a single infrastructure for Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana and Avalanche networks.At the same time, developers can redesign their Smart Contract production not for single networks, but as multi-chain with Connexus Network smart contracts.In summary; Developers and project owners can create a DApp application that supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Avalanche blockchain networks for their multi-chain supported Tokens. In this way, the project token is made available for trading or staking not only on 1 network, but also on 4 networks.WORK Connexus Network is a multi-chain + DApp infrastructure software module for smart contracts. It has a structure that combines DApp systems created using Node.JS and React with Solidity and smart contracts.Developers don't need to create DApp connections for every blockchain network and mess with RPC systems. It is possible to build DApps for 4 blockchain networks on the market using Node.JS modules powered by Connexus Network.UTILITYDApp & Software DevelopmentBuild multi-chain DApp applications for your project. Address users of Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana networks, not users of a single network.High Speed MachiningUse additional Connexus Network Libraries for slowdowns on Node.JS and React infrastructures used on standard DApp systems. Increase your DApp speed by up to 32.27% by standards.Reliable InfrastructureReliability, the most important aspect of blockchain technology, also applies to the Connexus network. Every transaction made on the DApp is 100% securely encrypted.",
