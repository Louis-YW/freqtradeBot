Most welcome the halving because it reduces the selling supply because less issuance and less sell pressure. If Op was a miner he wouldn't be in so much doubt or I would say grieve? Maybe yes or no. Op may just be an investor who's not feeling excited with the fluctuating manners of the bitcoin values. Haha.He could just want the halving to come maybe so he could accumulate more to how holding or he wants the halving to just pass by so the price of bitcoin could skyrocket following the bull run so he could make some huge amount of profits with his holding.I think I've heard of such aggressive bitcoin holders.Op, we're all aware that halving comes in every 4 years but doesn't have a specification day for its kick rather we should understand that the trigger of the halving is usually based on the velocity dispatch of miners.",

In that case, every other crypto project is a scam because they did not mention many other updates in their white paper, which they made after launching their token/coin. Take Ethereum, for example. Vitalink never said in the whitepaper that ETH would move from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. I guess we can call him a scammer because many GPU miners lost their investment because of this. Nah? Why not weirdo?",

He says that every 210,000 the block reward will be cut in half. There is also some mathematical formula to prove all of this.The halving is not discussed in the whitepaper nor mentioned or used but Bitcoin halving is openly discussed in public and even has the schedule announced.  I may missed something but I did not even read on the whitepaper that Bitcoin will half its supply every 210,000 block reward bu regardless, everything is not published on the whitepaper especially when the development is actively and continuously done on the system.  It is best to have the bitcoin github[1] as reference since all the updates and upgrades are mentioned on that repository.I believe Whitepaper is only a means to introduce the project since it discusses the projects purpose and its abstract.  It does not states the actual development of the project nor the upgrades and development integrated into the system.Quote from: Skybuck on April 13, 2024, 04:41:16 AMThe halving of bitcoin is indeed a dirty little trick hiding in the source code.Information about Bitcoin halving is not hidden, it is openly discussed so it is not correct to say that the halving of Bitcoin is a dirty trick hidden in the source code. Let alone the source code its self is openly accessible to the public.Quote\"The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins...\"Well there   is at least a steady addition of Bitcoin which is constant in 4 years, and is constant to reduce into halve every 210,000 blocks rewards (estimated every 4 years) and is a constant that can be only claimed/gained through mining and solving the block difficulty.Quote from: Skybuck on April 13, 2024, 04:41:16 AMWhite paper does not mention halving !But it is openly discussed in public, it is not a hidden fact to be an issue, IMO.[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin",

It is also part of the principles of Bitcoin through the way its capped supply is defined.QuoteThe bitcoin white paper misleads:\"The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins...\"Point being:White paper does not mention halving !It is not misleading, you have to read the entire paragraph not just some words. If you do, you'll realize that it is talking about reducing the amount of supply being created. \"...a way to initially distribute coins into circulation...Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.\"It is also not suppose to mention or explain every little detail of the Bitcoin protocol. White papers are not meant to do that, they are an abstract idea giving the reader the general idea behind the innovation (that's what documentation does). There are dozens of other major things about the protocol not mentioned in the white paper and a million different details that wasn't even pointed to.",

You just have to embrace it as it's a feature that has been mentioned by the creator himself. I get that maybe you're looking and pointing at it with the POS = proof of scam and maybe you're not literally pointing it out to Bitcoin but with some other projects that has that POS algo.  Anyway, it's not a dirty trick and if the miners complains about it, they should have done it long time ago but no, maybe a few of you but not in general that most of the miners doesn't like it but they're already aware of it.",

It never talked about bitcoin circle, because bitcoin was still new and nobody will be able to know what will happen to bitcoin in future. It is as time passes by that people started studying bitcoin movement, also with miners, that they came to realize that the miners reward is always divided into two in particular period of time. So as time passes by, the value of bitcoin increases and people will want to know why is it like that.Satoshi never also mentioned anything about the bear market and the bull market. Bitcoin is very complex to understand it in just 2 years. So I don't see why you sound this way, when nobody knows what will happen tomorrow. It is people that studied bitcoin, together with miners that noticed the halving and saw the bitcoin price movement repeats history due to past records. I don't see anything like scam.",
