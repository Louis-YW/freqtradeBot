      "body": "Hello there !My name is Rémi Forte and I am the director of The Satoshi Mystery documentary series. I have been on Bitcointalk for a while now (it is even featured in the series) but this is my first post.First of all, I would like to thank you, Tibu, for that post ! Thank you very much. It is awesome to share our Plebeian auctions here.Second, I am sad to read that Plebeian is not working that well. We wanted to try this platform which I think is pretty cool, but as I understand it it is only a few months old so it can not be perfect yet - even the lightning network is somewhat still an experiment (with a 5.000 btc capacity as of today though !). Given that the series is about Bitcoin, it made more sense for us (Victorien Aubineau who made the animation of The Satoshi Mystery, Grégoire Terrier who composed the score, and myself) to make the auctions in Bitcoin, not in fiat, even if the options are quite limited and if there are a few bumps along the way.If you want to place a bid but are struggling to, send me a PM and I will bid for you or figure something out.As for The Satoshi Mystery customized Satochip wallets, we indeed only made 6 of them: the team (Victorien Aubineau, Grégoire Terrier, and myself) kept 3, and the 3 others are on Plebeian right now.BUT, if everything is not sold on Plebeian, we will sell the remaining objects separately. I will let you know, Mopar, if you are interested.If you have got any question, please do not hesitate to ask me  Thank you for your interest !",
