They might have in mind that they will not let emotion controls them but after they open a position, all they will find out is that they later go against their trading plan which lead to significant loss. After the emotion, changing of trading plan and money loss, the market will later reverse back in a way that would have favoured them. The ones I can not go for again is increasing leverage if I start a trade with 3 to 5x margin ratio. I will first prefer to start with low amount and average instead. Anything going more than 5x for bitcoin, I can do again. Martingale strategy which is very risky has been what that affected me most that is leading to losses for me. It can get to the point that the market might reverse before liquidation but I would have closed the position because I do not want to lose further. Leverage and increasing leverage is very risk. Too much leverage is risky and is what that can mostly affect your emotion and trading plan.This is crypto. Another thing that can make someone to lose is the coin they are using. I prefer to use bitcoin and just bitcoin alone. There are some good altcoins too, but I prefer to focus on bitcoin. There are many altcoins that are gambling and they are shitcoins. The trader may be very good, having good analyses that will favour the traders if they use good coins like bitcoin, but using shitcoins will lead to losses and losses.It is good to know that trading is very risky.",

It's healthy that you still feel emotions imo, that means that you're not totally a slave to money, if I'm being honest it's okay to express the emotions instead of bottling them up, the key to not affect your trade is that you can control when you express it.Quote from: Oshosondy on August 14, 2023, 10:36:21 AMThis is crypto.

That's where your skills in trading sharpens though, makes you great at analysis and predictions.",

If you see a defect in the results, you should re-evaluate the plan and then decide whether to continue, move to another strategy, or stop.Changing plans in the middle of the journey is not good at all, especially if it is closely related to the plan that we built at the beginning. We must be consistent in anything, but we must also be able to evaluate what we do. I am a person who believes that there is no perfect strategy, or in other words, we must continue to improve or evaluate at all times.Now sometimes I see people misinterpreting this, especially for those who are new to trading. They listen and swallow raw what others say, when it should be processed first.",

      "body": "Excessive greed in trading is a threat to one's money. It is never right to over-profit, the trading should be sold only when the amount is profited. There are many inexperienced traders who don't have enough knowledge about the market so when they take a trade and when the price of the coin they are trading increases, many new investors don't sell their investment because they don't have enough knowledge about the market. As the price of his investment is going up, maybe if he holds it for a while, the price of his investment will go up even more, thus he loses a lot of money. So one should never be overly greedy. A target should be set at a certain level only then it is possible to achieve something good by trading.",

Even though knowledge and experience are quite qualified because what is being traded is an asset with high fluctuations, it is possible that someone will always be faced with an inappropriate position. Quite naturally and unsurprisingly, in crypto this sort of thing happens to almost everyone. Related to changing plans in the middle of trading, usually based on initial trading by prioritizing speculation, or applying methods that are not quite right Finally in the middle of trading the decision becomes biased.",

Trading shouldn't be so rigid - sometimes you also need to make adjustments instead of sticking to a strategy that isn't more profitable. I hope you see what I mean - but it's not too hard.",

So, efforts makes the man more successful so keep trying for best strategies which would increase more decision making.Point is, we should be more dependent on ourself instead of other or others news because here we see a news from an unofficial platform there we try to exist from the entry or vice versa. Such acts are foolish and lead us to greed and we all know greed is curse. So we should try not to fall prey to any market sentiment instead we should try to follow our own plans as you said but plan must be good too.",

We are all gonna experience that unfavorable kind of condition and this is where your knowledge and skills would be applied in all the challenges that you had faced in the past. You would be applying on what you do learn and would really be lessening up such risks.You would be considered to be a good trader if you are that able to make yourself that sustain despite of the unpredictable market condition which had been always the main challenge on wheretraders would be facing on.
