But those who have good experience with crypto and currency won't believe you easily. Because they know there are many scammers in this cryptocurrency.

Therefore, if you say such, it means you don't understand exactly what you are saying or you just want to sweet tongue people to send pm to you and you start your nefarious activities from the pm. No everyone is not the same and can't be equal. Quote from: auy on August 22, 2022, 06:35:37 PMwe all will be united and will help each other,to protect each other from rash actionsThere is no guarantee for that. Assembly of people doesn't really go as planned because of different ideas, interest etc. No matter how positive it is, there could be rift somewhere, even stake.com casino can be used as an example as the partners having little allegation issues.",

It means that you have posted in the wrong section. I think the appropriate section is through “Project Development”, but mods correct me if I’m wrong though. And of course, you need some proof or portfolio on why we should be trusting you rather than just convincing with your own words. It’s not good if you only send the details via PM. If you think that you’re legit, you should not hesitate to showcase your portfolio in this thread.",

I'm sure he has already spread PM to several members who are active in the Trading Discussion thread. Turns out it's true, it's not just me or you. maybe OP has spread spam PM to many members.At first, I thought he was inviting me to join a trading group. maybe some kind of group for analysis or signals in general that we see often.but there is also a possibility that he invites us to invest in a joint project.someone professional wouldn't do this. unbelievable.",

So it seems a little fishy to me.",

So it seems a little fishy to me.Spamming out something on PM's is never been that good to look at but rather ending up on those suspicious kind of impression of people whom do recieved the message.Its true that its better to invite nor convince people on this thread itself and not just forcing them and sending out pm 1 by 1 which wont really be that effective and as saidthat you dont know their real trade experience or portfolio which it is really that somewhat pointless on sending messages randomly and asking if they would join upon a group or not.Expect that there would be no people would be doing such thing.",

If you want to offer services then do this professionally, there is no need for you to message everyone you see as qualified. To avoid this stop spamming our messages, start making a thread that is more worth it, I doubt that many will join that so called team for traders.",
