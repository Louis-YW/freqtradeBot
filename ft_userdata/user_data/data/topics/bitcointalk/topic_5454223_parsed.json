  "content": "Greetings my fellow Naija people, happy children day to us. since am still new to dis forum the best thing that will help me to grow higher financially and materially like the way some of d guys here are displaying their achievement dey got from BTC investment, always give me joy and hope that one day I will make it too to celebrate ur senior men in dis forum. My question is, how many times do you guys use to make profits from ur BTC investment? Because I was told that we have long term investment and short term investments, and short term investments is from day to 6 months before u can sell to make profits while from 6 months to 4 years is long term investments. How many times do you guys use to make profits from short term investments before the end of  6 months or year because the price of BTC was very low through out last year 2022.I believe there are many people like me in dis forum that is using dis forum to learn so many things concerning BTC and crypto.",

      "body": "That is true. Any investment that is less than six months should be regarded short term. Six month plus, to life time investment should be considered long term. It is not about how many times to make profit, it is about investing after bear market. Another time for good investment is some months or weeks before halving. We should be expecting all-time-high after the next halving.",

If the set goal has arrived then reaping of what you have sown in the last two to three years is the most happiest day in every bitcoin user's life. If you invest in the bear market and when the bullish has come then reaping period has also come. It is not the time but how long have you started the journey of bitcoin investment and how far have you gone far.",

All of the exchange fall and stories about altcoins are driving some new investors to lose patience since they believe their money is gone and would be difficult to recover from, but I am confident that if they are patient enough, the return will be enormous.",

For instance, you may decide to buy bitcoin at 26k which I know around Last week it was in that price and if you are smart enough you wouldn't wait for the price to increase exponentially before you could make money from bitcoin. If you buy lows always target the right position to sell and accumolate your profits by so doing you will earn gradually by consistently doing it. But if you don't love that then you buy hand hold for bull run to make profits.",

If you consider bitcoin as an investment, avoid it if you are not willing to hold it for a long period of time since you will always be disappointed if you expect to profit from it in the short term. The concept of bitcoin was to return power to the people, to unbank the bank, to enable peer-to-peer transactions without third-party authorization, and, most importantly, to serve as a store of value.If you think Bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme, you're in the wrong boat, guy.",

There are lots of pressure you could face when holding bitcoin, is very tempting and as a newbies I don't think you would seat and watch your investment lost 20 to 40 percent.

So in other to make profit in either short or long term, as an investor you need to study the market to know what time best for which kind of Bitcoin investment.",

I don't even worry about price pomp or dump because I'm not in a hurry to sell. And in order not to be all left out, I also do short trading. I buy a few bitcoins and stocks somewhere, and watching the market closely, I sell them off when I realize a little profit from what I purchased them with. That's a continuous action; sometimes I do sell at the wrong time and later regret my actions, but it's what it is. The market won't always be in our favor, especially for day traders. Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win the trade, but you just have to know the right strategy to use in order to minimize your losses.So as a trader or holder, you just have to choose the best part that will be a better option for you, but it's always advisable for a newbie to practice either shot-term holding or long-term hodling; the long time is always preferable. In the short term, sometimes the price might not be in your favor when you want to cash out your investment.",
