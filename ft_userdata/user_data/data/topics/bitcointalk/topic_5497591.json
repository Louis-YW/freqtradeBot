Is this really necessary in the Bitcoin blockchain?Stark and the Lightning Labs clearly understand the possible consequences of this new development. While on earth should the Bitcoin Blockchain be the main center of target. Of course, this idea would help in terms of businesses transaction wise, but it doesn't change the fact that it's also a way of spamming the Blockchain. From the FT Live crypto summit she had in London, she clearly stated that this idea has caused issues for other Blockchain, but feels the Bitcoin Blockchain is the best place that the otherwise won't happen. Could this possibly be part of their reasons for launching the Bitcoin Lightning Network?, Don't know what their true intentions are, but they need to think of better things that won't cause problems.",

I mean that's the only way that things can go because if this will lead to another congestion, wouldn't it be a bad move to just do nothing about it, I don't know a lot about bitcoin network but I'm sure that with all of the developers out there contributing to the network doing hours and hours of commit, wouldn't they've thought of something to do about this one? If it's in Lightning Network though, wouldn't it not affect the bitcoin network that much or will it still affect it?",

Will this start a new wave of network spamming?New demand will cause new transactions and mempools will be overloaded than now but will people spam the network with stable coin transactions, I don't know.I guess it can be true demand for transactions because it's non sense to make a stable coin transaction and hope to get rich with stable coin. It is different than their hope to get rich with NFTs, Inscriptions so less reasons for spam.QuoteMaybe it will be a good thing for new businesses, but somehow every good idea eventually turns into its opposition with the appearance of many fast and easy money ideas. Bitcoin blockchain is more secure than altcoin blockchains but I am really curious and unsure how it can help peg of a stable coin?In my thinking, the peg of a stable coin depends on how that team design that stable coin and their treasury of $ to peg that stablecoin, for example. It does not depend on Bitcoin blockchain.QuoteIs this really necessary in the Bitcoin blockchain?If it does not cause network spam to convert bitcoin to dust, like transactions for Ordinals, Runes, I think it is good enough to accept as part of Bitcoin blockchain.",

This could democratize cross-border payments at a low cost.I don't really expect it will be successful because:1. People have a lot choice, they can swap their stable coin to other cheaper network e.g. BSC, SOL etc. Even though they're centralized, most people don't really care whether it's decentralized or centralized.2. Funding the channel using Bitcoin network would be costly, if Bitcoin network is cheap, people will not have to use Lightning network. There's an alternative, people can use the wallet's channel, but it will fall to centralization.",

That means the stable coin transaction will make use of bitcoin and these can still make the stable coin transaction to be having a very high fee just like USDT on Omni layer. Or probably my assumption may be wrong but we are going to know after the project has been finalized and done.Let us see what would happen. It can also be that the stable coin can later be able to be like the bitcoin on the lightning network with opened channels. The developers of the stable coins are more pros in lightning network which will not make this not to be surprising at all. If this is it, the transaction will be cheap for those that like it. But I will prefer to use lightning network for small amount of money.",

They were very easy to integrate into existing cryptocurrency exchanges, easier than traditional e-money because of their blockchain-based transparency, eliminating the risk of \"chargeback fraud\" (that's why those exchanges accepting PayPal usually charge high fees), and also easier than offering an on- and offramp via bank transfers. In addition, it allowed thousands of altcoin exchanges to offer a fiat-like product instantly, without having to maintain a huge fiat reserve, which would need other kinds of infrastructure.So basically the main advantages are for exchanges, not so much for ordinary users.Apart from what you already mentioned (which is also delivered by PayPal and similar e-wallet services), there are a few more advantages of stablecoins which also can appeal to some groups of ordinary users:1) to store a fiat-like product with your own keys, not on an exchange;2) to move a fiat-like product from one exchange to another one, for exampĺe for arbitrage purposes;3) to integrate a fiat-like product into smart contracts, perhaps even into atomic swaps and Lightning;4) to be able to store a fiat-like product without KYC in some cases.Of course, the \"not your keys not your stablecoins\" principle is not the same as \"not your keys not your bitcoin\". First, stablecoin issuers can go bankrupt, and second, they can block your stablecoins even if you have a valid private key in most cases. So most stablecoins don't offer censorship protection.",
