  "content": "How much do you really about our computers? I found this interesting article while browsing the internet today. I donâ€™t think Steve Jobs was aware of this, it seems to me that there is a bitcoiner at Apple HQ. If you have a Mac, you can try the code to see if it works. Also let me know if you knew this before. Quote  Apple has hidden a bitcoin manifesto in every Mac since 2018, says a tech blogger who discovered it by accident\"While trying to fix my printer today, I discovered that a PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper apparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018,\" Baio wrote in an April 5 blog post.He said he asked over a dozen of his friends and fellow Mac users to confirm, and the document was there for every single one, the file called \"simpledoc.pdf.\"To find it, according to Baio's instructions, users can open the terminal and type the following command: open /System/Library/Image\\ Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdfFor those using macOS 10.14 or later, the document should immediately open in Preview as a PDF file, he explained. Insider tested out Baio's instructions and found a copy of the document stored on the computer running the most recent update of macOS.The now-famous white paper, titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\", was published in October, 2008 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. In it, the author lays out their thesis for the underlying mechanisms that power what is now the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value. The paper's abstract reads: \"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\" https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/apple-bitcoin-manifesto-mac-white-paper-tech-blogger-markets-crypto-2023-4",

      "body": "The management of apple will surely vet their tech team to find out how this got there, an explanation is really needed because this is really surprising and we all need to know why. What can be the purpose of motive behind this?Has it been effective in any way promoting bitcoins to apple users? Those remain the question, but one thing is certain with this discovery that it will discontinued.",
