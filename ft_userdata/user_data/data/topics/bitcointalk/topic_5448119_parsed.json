As I dey read am cef eh, I just know say the matter no go get head. Not with the corruption way still dey our system. Which policeman way go wan put body for watin no go give am immediate benefit. Sometimes I defender of them no dey pay them cef with the way them put body for the money them dey task for road. Different vehicle come with different price now. No be everybody #20 or #50 matter again. Inpectors no dey sweet them again, na copra make them for dey patrol the street and get check points.Omo, we fit still run reg for formality sake but, na you kwa go still pursue your matter if you want am to get head. Best still, avoid to enter that kind situation, get tracker for your car and even at that, na by parts them fit still sell the car. People no dey smile gor this we country.",

Me self know say e no go work, corruption don to enter our police, the funniest part is that Nigeria police really sabi work if they wan really do their work, but you see corruption no go allow them work and also we still have to blame our government. In the process of performing their duties, if anything happens to them maybe if them die, na so government go just forget their family members leaving them to suffer, if na other countries now, if their police die, Government go take care of the police family members, but for naija your family members go suffer tire na why most of them self dey fear to put body for work.",
