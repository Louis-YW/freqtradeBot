Because their only strategy is to convince them that they device is safe and secure which is not 100% true and their insane pricing for the gadgets released is getting outrageous.So do you think they will survive forever or will go down in the next 10 years if they don't make any changes?",

And by the time when Steve Jobs was still there and explains the feeling of owning one capturing the moments that you will have to remember a life time is what sold to the people.Until it's been developed and the luxury feeling that a consumer needs it has been built. They just managed to maintain that and good thing they're successful on it.Quote from: jrrsparkles on December 02, 2023, 08:31:41 AMSo do you think they will survive forever or will go down in the next 10 years if they don't make any changes?No one knows, really.",
