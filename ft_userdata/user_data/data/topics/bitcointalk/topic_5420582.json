You must be happy, you got your big fiat reward after speculating with BTC. Thanks to all who made this technically possible, those who maintain the network and who have created wonderful things these last 4 years. They worked twice as hard thinking btc would get to 100k (not saying it won't get there) you have left us wonderful things for crypto.I hope it goes down even more, how happy I am every time I will be able to get some btc at a fair price.https://i.imgur.com/ohBNfQ5.png",

But at the same time, also wants to see it this low for more accumulation whenever I buy. I guess it all comes to the point that we have to know what we're up to and the long term plans that we're setting before the next bull run arrives, just like now, it is for everyone who wants to buy it at a cheaper price.",

I’m not sure that this can bring any benefit, this happens because very serious players have come to cryptocurrencies and the strong ones are removing the weak ones, this will continue to happen. Perhaps the benefit of this will be that in this way cryptocurrencies will be cleared of weak links that could spoil the reputation of cryptocurrencies in the future.",

Setting aside that those willing to make purchases now will find it cheaper, which obviously has its upside, one needs to consider the chain of events that derive in that situation, which are quite a blow in the mind for many to come, not to mention all those that are trapped without being able to retrieve their funds. Yes, they could/should have practice self-custody and avoided a bunch of overhyped tokens, but from a global market perspective, it isn’t a situation I would personally find any comfort in, nor gloat about the misfortunes that lead to the current price.",

Sooner Bitcoin would recover from this short dump.Even though we know that the problem is the exchange platform and the token is not on bitcoin but people panic still they will sell it until it becomes a dump and this is always associated with bitcoin which they think may be dangerous even though bitcoin does nothing it's just a mighty coin without anyone being able to control it.Still, where there is a big event and they panic it will affect the market, while those of us who hold bitcoin don't mind unless they hold FTT and SOL tokens which are vulnerabilities due to this problem so for me it's worrying whatever happens to the platform because there isn't any assets there, don't hold their tokens and other types the only thing they hold is bitcoin.OP, if you expect prices to return to 2018, will you be mentally prepared?",

When others are afraid is when we should be greedy, wealth is not for the masses.With all the events that have been happening to other crypto's and centralized services one begins to understand that BTC's main advantage isn't even in its price or ability to rise after a plunge, but in its security and decentralization. I know many people want to use BTC as a long term investment, but when you look at other crypto crashing, centralized services declaring bankruptcy, possibility of stable coins being frozen even in your own wallet, etc, all of these things that can't happen to BTC because of its secured and decentralized nature, you'll begin to appreciate the network far more than just its price, but how the network is built, its algorithm, hash rate, POW, security, decentralization, etc, with the price just being another part of its advantages, but not the main one!",

A good entry point to those looking to keep their bitcoins in the long run, I'd say, and there might not even be another opportunity like this in the future.I think the latter should be case as what the OP said, the shave off was a big opportunity for those who are late in the game, maybe from 2020 to current.And then seeing the price going down on a spiral move in the last week, hitting $15k as new lowest low, those who want to enter will be happy so see that price and now comparing it to the 2018 bear market, at least that early price before the end of 2018.So I do agree, another chance and hopefully investors are going to take advantage of it and not become fearful of the price crash.Maybe they are thinking that bitcoin could spiral move, and then declare it dead again. History shows us that bitcoin will always recover by this crash and then eventually goes on a massive bull run right after the halving.",
