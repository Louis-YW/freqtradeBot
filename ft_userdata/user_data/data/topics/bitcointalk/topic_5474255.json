But, I don't think that would be the case since with all these tech, we'd be able to predict and take necessary measures, Internet is equally important for governments. From the article linked: QuoteFlares, he said, reach Earth in 8 minutes. That sets the clock ticking for the possible magnetic field disruption in 18 to 24 hours. If we have a warning, every minute counts because you can put satellites in safe mode. You can take transformers off-line from the grid, so they don't fry,\" Becker said. \"So there's things you can do to mitigate the problem.",

If there is no buying or selling then the market is more likely to remain unchanged. But it seems to me that it is not possible that any country or nation will shut down the internet system because if the internet system is shut down the whole cyber system of a country will be broken and that country will suffer huge financial losses. If they feel the need to make such a decision then I think they must think of alternatives.",

If there is no internet connection, it means that there won't be any activity going on anywhere that required the use on internet connection. There won't be buying or selling of any sort so you have no reason to be afraid of shit as everything in the crypto space will resume as usual once the whole thing has been fixed. What you should be worried about is the effect it will have in the general functioning of the society.",

The internet will probably survive if the said solar flare won't hit anything underwater, as far as I know there's already a lot of undersea cable and data storages that's stored in the water but if it will hit it then the internet will definitely go down, this kind of event is something that we can never be really sure until it finally happens.",

The global economy and the global financial markets would also be affected. I think that the financial markets will be simply closed and nobody would be able to buy and sell for a while.Everything will get back to normal, after the electric grid gets repaired.",
