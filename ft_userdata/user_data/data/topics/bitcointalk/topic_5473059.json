I think this would have strengthened our Naira against the USD. They have lifted all bans placed on cryptocurrency and crypto related businesses. Nigeria is a crypto friendly country now even though Bitcoin have not been made a legal tender. On the issue of fuel subsidy removal, it will be difficult for the government to invest the money for subsidy on Bitcoin because most of those monies were borrowed, not that we had excess money in out treasury. You will agree with me that Nigerian government does not gave a culture of investment, most of the borrowed funds are injected into infrastructure and servicing of old debts. So, we can talk investment when we have a leader that understands the importance of saving for the next generation... only then can we expect diversification to Bitcoin and other profitable investment instruments.",

You never wonder why this issue of fuel subsidy dey the agenda of every government wey enter seat? E dey costly to maintain and according to wetin I read for  Here, naija no be contri wey go fit maintain such since those in power no sabi how to plan on how to balance the resources so that them no go incur debt while them dey do the subsidy. Also, another thing wey I feel go make this your suggestion get k-leg nah be say govt, not only in naija no so dey in support of Bitcoin unto say agreement to allow am free rein go give them less control and e go hard for them to falsify records when ever them tiff money.",

I think this would have strengthened our Naira against the USD. That is going to be a very huge declaration if it was made in the day of the inaugural lecture. This cannot even be possible, how can you make declaration to invest public funds into bitcoin when they know nothing about it, it doesn’t make no sense and it will cause a lot of mayhem in the society if such is done. It is a good idea to we bitcoin enthusiasts, but do you think that other people that have say in the economy, I mean the house of assembly members can easily be convinced to allow this pass through when we complain everyday of them be corrupt leaders. Bitcoin is a very volatile currency and you can’t tell the next move of the currency. In a country that the economy situation is not stable, can this money be putting into an investment that will benefit the public in the long run and not immediately. There is a lot to consider before such is done, I just hope the fuel subsidy money removal will go a long way to help the citizens and make the country better for all in the long run.Quote from: Zanab247 on November 06, 2023, 03:13:21 PMIt look like our leaders are still playing games with Naija citizens destiny because, how can someone came out public and declared fuel subsidy removal for the benefits of our economy but the economy is getting worst everyday and is causing people to do any evils things just to survive in the country.  Now that many people are regretting for hailing the president for his inauguration speech because, they thought the man will rescue Nigeria the way he rescued Lagos state economy when he was a governor for 8 years, and he did well by making Lagos state the most highest state that has population of industries in the country.Expectations are too high which is not a good mindset to have when hoping for a change from a new government. Not all political promises will be fulfilled and we just have ti live by the little that is done. Those people going to do evil cannot be said they are doing it because of the economic crisis of the country. It is by their own will and we won’t blame the government for that. If everyone is feeling devastated by the economic situation, then everyone will become evil in the nation, does that makes sense to you? Change does not happen overnight and I hope and pray that we have a better country and good economy in the next four years. I haven’t lost hope yet because Rome was not built in a day, so Nigeria cannot get better overnight.Quote from: Zanab247 on November 06, 2023, 03:13:21 PMYou know, there are many people in the country that hate decentralized currency which they will never support president to make some pronouncement to invest such amount of money in BTC because they will not have access to it to withdraw the coin the way they use to have access to fiat money by saying snake has swallow the millions or billions and get away with it easily.If they really want to, it can be done even if it will take time to put things in place before finally pronouncing it. Public funds is not money for any political appointee, if the money for their office is already allocated to them, they shouldn’t be looking at what they will stand to get in the public funds already invested. Remember, any investment in bitcoin to reap a good profit has to be for a long term and not short, so they can’t be waiting forever for the money to have been profitable before they will do their work if funds are provided to them as well. Money invested in bitcoin are not money that should be needed soon, take example of El Salvador and see what investing public funds into bitcoin is all about.",

Naija government no go fit make Bitcoin legal because if they do, they will not get much power over us because they know say most Naija citizens go dey save their money for Bitcoin and they will not get full control over us again. They dey fully aware of why Satoshi created Bitcoin and as our leaders no think good for us they don't want us to gain that freedom. Our leaders fit wake up one morning and tell us say the Bitcoin wey they used the fuel subsidy money buy say they done lost access to the bitcoin wallet or hackers done hack the Bitcoin.",

I no see anything wey wrong for this thing regardless of what people will say, even people wey no like crypto(bitcoin) definitely no be everybody go like am but people wey no like am go just adapt to am for example make we see how the fuel sudsidy removal dey affect everybody but government no even care them no mind ohh this fuel subsidy was removed to increase workers salary but still yet no salery increased still yet na government them dey thief the money e for better make them invest this money for bitcoin, bear market no dey stay for ever definitely bull market go still come",
