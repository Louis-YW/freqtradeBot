      "body": "It's not that it can't be profitable to mine bitcoin in the current bear market. A few days ago, the total hash power of bitcoin reached its all time high. That wouldn't happen if mining couldn't be profitable. Whether mining is profitable for you or not highly depends on the price of electricity in your country. You can use mining profit calculators like whattomine or asicminervalue to see whether it's worth to mine bitcoin for you or not.",

That is the single most important thing to factor into a decision to mine....Only if you have low cost electricity does one move on to the next question: Do you have a place to setup and run these VERY noisy, hot miners? Do remember that all that power going in comes out as heat. A LOT of it...Like most things in Life the answer to your vague question is not a clear cut, binary, yes or no. You need to think about all it entails.",

Is it better to buy bitcoin now?I would love to meet the guy who started this nonsense about the cost of mining a bitcoin as a sum between x and y, especially if it would be the day I carry a baseball bat with me.If the guy above has free electricity as he has bought some 100 extra soal panels for his business, he has the batteries to do so, he already has the space and his rent is zero, he doesn't need a tech guy to check on the machines, what's the cost of mining a coin? Zero?Â  An xp running at 7cents gets you 5$ in cost, 5 in profit, that would mean the cost per coin is 10k, way outside the \"rumours\".Quote from: FP91G on November 02, 2022, 11:07:35 AMWith free electricity, this ASIC will give a profit of $ 12 per day or pay off in more than 2 years, because the hashrate is growing.With free electricity that hydro will ROI in 11 months, for it to ROI in more than two years you will need the hash rate to double tomorrow, and there is no way you're going to see 260exahash being put online not by tomorrow but not in 6 months!",
