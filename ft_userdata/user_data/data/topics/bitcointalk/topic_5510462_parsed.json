  "content": "The FTC's report shows a massive increase in Bitcoin ATM scams, with $110 million scammed last year. This year alone, the figure has already reached $65 million just in the first half. If we compare this to 2020, there's been a tenfold increase in scams...isn't that alarming?The main types of scams they use include \"government impersonation,\" \"business impersonation,\" and \"tech support fraud.\" Scammers create urgent situations to convince victims to withdraw cash from their bank accounts and deposit it into a Bitcoin ATM using a QR code that links to the scammers' wallets.And as usual, older adults are the most vulnerable to these scams, especially those 60 years and above.Here’s a short video explaining Bitcoin ATM scams:Code:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ03vfpJMGMhttps://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/new-ftc-data-shows-massive-increase-losses-bitcoin-atm-scamshttps://consumer.ftc.gov/",

If any stranger contacts you, it's an alarm. If he asks you for things related to money, it's a second alarm. If he tries to put you into urgent situation, it's a third alarm. So you can stop right here, and quit the conversation, and you will never be scammed.",

The report likely was written with intention to maximize severity of this scam and how much money stolen through Bitcoin ATM scams. Because it does not give us comparisons through figures of scammed money in different years. It simply has figures of total stolen money since 2020, and says it's tenfold increase.QuoteSince 2020, the amount consumers reported losing has increased nearly tenfold to over $110 million in 2023.This information is very vague and it is really hard to count for scam severity growth with years. We know that Bitcoin ATMs have very good growth together with Bitcoin adoption growth. From about 6,500 ATMs in 2020 to nearly 40,000 ATM in 2022 and 39,000 in 2024, it's big difference. Total ATM roughly increases 6 fold and total scammed customers increases 10 fold in the same period, it makes sense but it's not too serious and scam increases less than 2 fold, rather than 10 fold if we read given number in the report.https://coinatmradar.com/charts/manufacturer-growth/https://coinatmradar.com/charts/growth/",

Many countries struggle; does that mean this problems gets worsen in the future? No, the key is educating people about these scams. Is it easy? Not at all, but continuous effort will help reduce them. If we assume that scams will keep rising, then it just shows we don't trust the government to tighten the law and educate people effectively. For the Bitcoin community to gain mass adoption, these incidents- or Bitcoin scams in general- need to be minimized. Why just minimize and not completely eliminate them? Because it's impossible to get rid of them entirely.",

That is one of the main cause why people fall for scams that cost them a fortune. I can imagine how much that was been scammed that would give such a sum of amount ($65 million) this year when it's not yet over. Still, more and more people are being victims of scams because of a lack of knowledge about the process of it. In a conference I attended. There was a discussion about cybercrime with tech-savvy individuals that engage in projects that are Ponzi schemes and scams. And I made a suggestion there, that a school for those who are victims of cybercrimes or are discussing with someone who they feel might be a scammer should be built for such persons. That will help increase global awareness.",
