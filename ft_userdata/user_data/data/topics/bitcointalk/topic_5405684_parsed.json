      "body": "Elliptic curve multiplication is not a normal multiplication; it is basically a combination of two operations: point doubling and point addition. This is how it works: you take the generator point G and multiply it by your private key in a binary format. \"Mutiply\" means you perform point doubling of the result every time you see \"0\" in your private key, and you perform point addition of the result every time you see \"1\". For example, you private key is 1010. That means you add G to itself and get 2G, than double it and get 4G, than again add G to 4G and get 5G, than double it again and get 10G. 10G is your public key.",

      "body": "It's when you multiply a point by a number, aka. repeated addition of the point with itself.The point is a two-dimensional number with an x & y coordinate just like on graphs. But these points are inside a point group, which means a fixed set of points that may not be numerically next to each other or even in numerically ascending order. The curve characteristic is a very large prime number which represents the number of points are in the group, and any multiplication by numbers which are larger than the characteristic (it is similar to maximum int value, by comparison), \"wraps around\" just like conventional numbers, and the wrapping around is accomplished by the modulus operation. Therefore, multiplying by p+1 is equivalent to multiplication by 1.",
