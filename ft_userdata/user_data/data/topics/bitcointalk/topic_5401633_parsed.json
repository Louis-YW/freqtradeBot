Looking at the 24 hour chart in op, it looks like a sharp decline, but zooming out to about 30 days, you will notice that it's just another regular price movement in the wave of volatility.This is speculation board after all and I can understand why traders would want to explain all price movements as it helps to build analysis for future price predictions",

      "body": "I can explain this with ease. The reason for the dump is the pump just hours before.Where does the pump come from? Traders buying to see if people will buy it as an opportunity to buy and jump in and then these traders sell hoping to scalp the top and gain 1% or so over the exchange fees. These are people who work on tight margins and you can see it's the same money being bought and sold by looking at the volume. There's almost no volume in these pumps. They're like buying 2k BTC in 6 hours and media outlets catch this and write these stupid articles with \"bitcoin is pumping\" headlines. Here's one: https://decrypt.co/102104/bitcoin-ethereum-jump-crypto-market-reboundsIt's not even funny anymore. Somebody buys 0.001% of total supply, the market moves by a little, they write their tabloid pieces \"bitcoin looks for higher highs as market recovers\", 12 hours later bitcoin falls 5% their write about it \"bitcoin loses another 5% as bear market continues\". In reality over the course of 3 weeks there was no moves, bitcoin was at 30k and it still is at 3k and it doesn't matter if it's at 31 or 29k it's still the same range.",

But in my opinion, this is not surprising if we look at the cycle that bitcoin has gone through since a few years ago, and after getting a high price, bitcoin price will surely fall to a low point. Many people say that the current price or $28k is not the lowest price because the bitcoin price could drop even lower. All we can do is prepare for the worst while preparing our money to buy at the lowest price.",

That's not a bad thing of course and we need to just learn how to live with it until we reach the bull period.If the prices crash to 25k or lower then I would understand the frantic fear of crypto prices going down and the bear market being here, but we haven't been under 28k for a long time now, so we could just relax and look at the future.",

Fortunately support levels are strong at this moment and bitcoin has been pushed above again. Little events like this are helpful to raise confidence among investors, as they can see bitcoin is pretty strong and solid. It's a signal investors are fearful bitcoin won't stay cheap for too long, so at the minor of the crashes they immediately set their entry point to not miss the opportunity.

So the initial reports says they 'aided' them, but we will see since they are going to cooperate as per their official spokesman.
