Being banked or underbanked, we can still enjoy the benefits and the accessibility of transactions as long as we have access to internet. Another benefit also is the anonimity it gives to people(although some would probably say not totally). By this, it is only right to say that Bitcoin has the potential to completely transform the way we think about money and finance. Compared to what we traditionally knew about finance, cryptocurrencies and bitcoin allows an individual to participate on the global economy without much requirement that otherwise it would be impossible. Although this is beneficial for developing countries, where traditional banking services may not be available or accessible, we couldn't deny the fact that it is slowly changing or disrupting the financial structure that we knew.what do you guys think?",

People have benefits from the structure and many have incurs losses from the project.But one thing is stricken, the local banking system or services are as well very important to societies weather developed, developing and underdeveloped countries. Bitcoin only makes it easy for transactions, it's introduced global technology mechanism for exchange of goods and services.Bitcoin is not actually slowing any financial structures because it was made to understand from the beginning that it's involved ups and downs movement threads. Is just experiencing the bearing phase which we should expects from the onset. Though the bearing has affect the financial status of many because is been long the price keeps going down.",

Of course, the mass adoption of Bitcoin will be completed one day, but for a while I thought that the strongest environmental conditions would be people who could not access banking services.

BTC transactions can be made directly between individuals without the need for intermediaries like banks or credit card companies, this decentralized and transparent nature of BTC has the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems in several ways, but I don't like the word disrupt here, it could be an alternative to fiat.Several ways as I mentioned could be because of lower transaction costs, faster transactions in online payment, and last global accessibility which can be across any borders. So for me, probably there is a small chance that has the potential to disrupt our financial landscape by providing a decentralized and transparent alternative to traditional financial systems.",

Also, the anonymity offered by Bitcoin can also be seen as a benefit for those who value privacy in their financial transactions no matter how some may argue that this anonymity is not total and there are still ways to trace transactions.Though Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt traditional financial structures, it is still a relatively new technology and there are still many challenges that need to be addressed such as scalability, regulation, and security.Still, I believe that the benefits of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies outweigh the challenges, and they have the potential to greatly benefit individuals and communities around the world. With any new technology, it is important for individuals and institutions to approach it with caution, but also with an open mind to its potential benefits.",

Although I advocate a workaround it in terms of regulation, which is the only way it could stick to a more merit side than the negative side.With regulations, economies would be recorded for the due countries and illicit transactions would reduce unlike what is happening now.",

The best one is potentially the ability for people who cannot get a bank account to store or receive funds. There are some countries where the cost to use banking facilities is extortionate and others where it can be physically difficult to be in range of a bank. For others it allows money to be repatriated from overseas while again avoiding very high fees that are not warranted but are milked by the banking institutions or currency exchangers. If anything, hopefully it has nudged some banks to reduce their unnecessary fees.",

If there wasn’t stepping in of the bigger authorities like SEC, CBDC, and overall government then we would have said that bitcoin had no impact on the global system. But it did move all of them.

There are agendas about bitcoin in the Intenrational meet ups so definitely it has become something different. As far as developing countries are concerned there are only few who are really trying to squeeze it in. For example, Nigeria, Thailand, and some part of Asia.

It's actually how a good financial system should operate in a trustless/public space. It uses the anonymity for the protection of its users who do transactions with people they don't know or trust.I have notice how vulnerable people could be in traditional financial system when it come to preserving people privacy/anonymity. Imagine giving people you don't know really well your bank details which typically includes full names. It's actually an evil system. And Bitcoin is part of the solution to this lack of protection for users.",
