The thread is bad. When you place money first in whatever you want to do then the best will elude you. This is appalling and the reason that third world countries struggle in football especially countries from Africa.Those at the tops only care about their own immediate financial benefit and not care where the player gets to tomorrow with the myopic thinking that they have benefited from the player. I will still blame the government when it comes to corruption.",

Imagine how further they could reach on World Cups if they had Mbappé on the team, profiting much more and getting much more recognization than what they would have earned with the bribery... Corrupt people think they are smart, but they can only see things on short term. What really matters is what happens on long term, and that is something only God knows and sees. So better to walk straightest as possible in life, never creating obstacles for our fellow beings, rather trying to help them as possible.",

Whether it is jist a scam being pulled by a nobody or an organization, this should be alarming for serious franchise of any sports indistry 'coz a bright future of their players are being played on simply because money has the power to do so. pArt of this, I guess, is scouting. Many talents are being wasted because of such scheme instead of them to be on a better team that would hone their full potential and to be a bigger 'someone' in the future. Not only with governments but the league should also put attention on such cases.",

In the case of Brazil or Argentina which are also regarded as third world countries, theirs is still fair if they do such obnoxious stuff because they still perform better during world tournament. Maybe in there own case, most of the players are gifted and it doesn't affect them as such. Or maybe they have had issues of selection during tournament that they didn't perform to expectation.",

Probably Mbappe may not have become one of the players among the team that won world cup, but definitely he will still be known as he plays for club. I see Cameroon to miss him though, he would have been a better player there.",

But the problem there is what you have said already. You will see a good talented people in those countries but unable to make it to national league just because of this. Not only that, the clubs in the counties will also suffer because only people that are able to bribe will be more in their clubs while talented people will not be able to get there. This proves how Africa has been lacking and unable to win world cup.",

Lots of African countries have lost lots of talented players just because of issues like this, if you cant pay coach or you are not connected to a highly influential person, then you wont be allowed to play even if you are very talented, they prefer allowing players that are less talented and can pay then to play.

If he those not miss the country he wouldn't have visited the country, but the country really lost a very great talented player, the government should arrest the coach that was asking for money and he should be punished so that things like this wont happen in future again. coaches are suppose to build the team with the most talented players, and they shouldn't build the team due to the players that can pay them.",
