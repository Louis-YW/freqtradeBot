  "content": "I am pretty sure that almost everyone in the crypto space knows that FTX and the CEO shit over their customers, there is no coming back from this hurtful experience but days back I read somewhere online that FTX has started moving their assets on the blockchain, maybe that's what prompts this attack. The reason for this move could be 1. They want to start paying back their customers.2. To start running their shitty FTX 2.0 comeback. The problem now is some wicked souls are trying to take advantage of this, targeting those who have already lost a lot to FTX, these scammers know no mercy. Scammers are now sending out new scam emails to all available email accounts, I got this a few days ago and the funny thing is I never used FTX exchange once, I don't have an account with the exchange, and this is where they messed up, but let's pretend I was also FTX customer? I know this is not from FTX because...1. I don't have an account with FTX exchange. 2. The sender's email is weird ( something spcuid@ opulet.com) But this is me, if this landed on the old victim's email addresses they may fall victim all over again, Let this be a warning for those who are not aware of such scamming tricks, always abstain from clicking links through email, always check senders address when you get emails from crypto exchanges. Stay Safe out there!",

The scammers always tries to use an even to their advantage and this is certainly one of them. The best way to go when sensitive mails like this is received is to look at the sender address and then go back to the exchange and check their support for there official email address and once even a letter differs, one should avoid the link. Also check their social media handle to actually check if there is an announcement of such instructions. Check the link of that comes with the mail and see if it is to their official page",

      "body": "You can compare those scammers to criminals. Well, scammers are criminals as well, but the point is that, they don't care about yourself, your feelings whatsoever. As long as you're their target, they will do what they can just to get money from you. That's why we as investors need to remain vigilant at all times. Don't fall out with these shitty emails. Always be observant, always look at the website that you're visiting. When I was starting to know which are scams, and which are not, I often watch some Youtube videos, and that helped me a lot. Not only 1 video , but many videos. As for this FTX comeback, maybe those who lost their money in that FTX drama a few months ago are the ones who might fall to this trap. I just hope that they will not fall into this one again, or it will just add to their burden.",

No they don't, they don't care about how much you have lost, if you are in a sick bed because of the one that has recently happened, if you are to borrow to survive, or whatever bad situation you are in, they don't care. What they care about is how to convince you to invest and give out any fund that you can get your hands on and offer you a recovering proposer, which won't even happen. They try every possible way that they can, come up with ideas that the real companies have never even had in mind just to convince their victims and take their hard earned money from them. If everyone can be guided and disregard every email that comes from an unknown sender, then we can all be safe, and secondly, any company that has just recently mismanaged customers funds and is still requesting any form of payment in order for the customer to get back their funds is not real and has never had the intention of paying back.",

It gets leaked or sold most often. Thereby, increasing scam rate, just like the example OP shared.",

However, those who send such e-mails are nothing more than ordinary vultures who hope to pick up the remains of what is left behind by the Kwon-Bankman scam pandemic, and you should not be surprised at all that you receive such e-mails, because I also often receive e-mails from various CEXs, although I only registered on one once upon a time.The best advice that everyone should apply is to never click on links in e-mails until they are sure that they come from a legitimate source - and we can easily find this out by checking the sender's address and comparing it with the e-mail address that is always on to a legitimate website.",

Their mind is not always at rest to create means to scam individuals who are less ignorant to stay updated on the latest happening in the crypto space. The scammers keep developing strategies of any sort to make sure people fall for them. To scammers, every little announcement or latest happening in the crypto space serves as an opportunity given to them to dope people of their funds. They created their own type of scammer email because of the announcement the FXT exchange made concerning returning people's funds. You can imagine the number of people they sent this email to, notifying them of the FXT withdrawal being available. Only those who are less smart or exposed to the crypto space would fall for this though",

Although some of them may believe that now is the moment to retrieve their assets back, they may fall victim to this phishing mail campaign and lose money again.The lesson here is that I should always avoid phishing messages via email and phishing URLs because this is a classic example of phishing because you have never utilized FTX Exchange before and are receiving the letter.",

I think more awareness needs to be conducted especially to the people who's into cryptocurrency investment and a thorough investigation needs to be carried out to fish out the perpetrators of this criminal activities else the rate of scamming won't be reduced.People need to understand the need not to give a listening ear to everyone who's sending all kinds of useful information trying to assist them when they have challenges with their funds or their investment, it is difficult to get a genuine stranger in the cryptocurrency world who wants  to help you without getting something in return or scamming you, people should verify informations they receive to be true and genuine before rushing out to give full details about themselves and their portfolio's, scammers are always ahead with information don't be surprised to see them re-strategize once they find out that a lot of people are not falling to this particular tricks.",
