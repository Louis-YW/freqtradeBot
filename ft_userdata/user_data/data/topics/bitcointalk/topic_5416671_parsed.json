  "content": "QuoteAd Age illustrates just how quickly a booming company can fall apart.If you’ve watched a Formula 1 race this year, there’s a good chance you have — if only unconsciously — seen plenty of Crypto.com ads. Along with companies like Aramco, DHL, Emirates, and Heineken, Crypto.com has looked like it’s become one of the key players in financing the future of global open-wheel motorsport. But right now, all that money might be drying up.A new report from Ad Age’s Asa Hiken describes a company that has marketed itself into a downward spiral. If you’ve watched any sporting events in the recent past, you’ve probably either seen a commercial or an eventside ad for Crypto.com, a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Now, it looks like thousands of employees are being let go as the “crypto winter” descends.Just after Crypto.com announced that it had hit the 50-million user mark — and just after it had served as a primary sponsor for F1's Miami Grand Prix — the crypto market crashed.From Ad Age:QuoteIn the months that followed, Crypto.com quietly downsized many of the partnership deals intended to garner mainstream attention for the brand, and in some cases the firm has attempted to pull out from these deals altogether, according to details shared by former and current employees at the company who spoke with Ad Age on the condition of anonymity.The exchange also saw a reduction in its headcount of previously unreported scale, with 30% to 40% of its pre-summer workforce departing the company from June through August—the vast majority of which were due to layoffs, according to former and current employees.A lack of internal directories prevented Ad Age from confirming exact numbers, as well as differentiating between layoffs and natural attrition, but multiple sources independently stated that just over 2,000 employees have left the company since layoffs began. Crypto.com was previously reported to have let go of just over 1,000 employees at most. Marketing personnel were some of the first to be targeted by the layoffs, including an entire in-house creative team that was eliminated mere months after its creation, sources said.In the article, one advertising professional who worked with Crypto.com described the company as follows: “I’ve worked with many ambitious clients before, but Crypto.com is probably the most ambitious client I’ve ever worked with.” That’s because, in a span of less than a year, the brand became internationally known thanks to its intense marketing push that saw it become a massive enterprise. It worked well at getting Crypto.com’s name out.But a downturn in crypto interest saw the platform tumble. Crypto.com has dissolved deals with Angel City F.C., Twitch Rivals, and the UEFA Champions League. It has maintained several other deals with sports teams or events but has in some cases reduced the number of hospitality packages available.Right now, the future of Crypto.com and cryptocurrency as a whole is a little unclear. It obviously hasn’t become a universally adopted form of currency, and the initial allure seems to have faded. It could keep tumbling, or it could see a new rise in interest. Formula 1 likely won't fall apart thanks to Crypto.com — but it's yet another fascinating chapter in the sport's long history of accepting sponsorship deals that aren't quite cut out to meet their promises.https://jalopnik.com/formula-1s-crypto-com-sponsor-is-falling-apart-1849626650....Terrible news, if true. I had high hopes for crypto dot com doing well with their sports enterprise. As they own and operate a crypto exchange, I was hoping it would help insulate them from volatility and negative price trends. It would seem trading volume in crypto is on something of a decline. Does anyone know if crypto dot com has sources of revenue aside from their exchange. They expanded so quickly in so many major markets. Maybe it will give them enough holdings to survive and prosper over the long term. Considering how easily they expanded into mainstream sports markets, is it possible that many sports in general are on a decline? Enough so that there is a diminishing demand for sponsorships which made it easier for crypto dot com to get their foot in the door.Video games and esports seem like the main growth sports that are gaining in size year after year. Other more physical and athletic sports appear to be in something of a decline. Am I correct in making that observation? Also if you were CEO of cryptodotcom what steps would you take to secure the future of your brand? Is there an exit strategy or recession proof business plan that they can deploy here to turn things around?",

I guess they took advantage of the hype to bring about the best but then were hit not only by the downturn of crypto but also due to the economic situation (imo), hence the layoff. I don't think they have anything outside of their Exchange and NFT marketplace.

Am I correct in making that observation? eSports is definitely up there, but I don't think you can also call the athletic scene dying, more like stagnated (since I consider there's still a considerable fanbase behind them) while eSports on the other hand is still continuing its popularity growth.

They were growing too fast and too big, when the crypto markets were on a bull run. When the bull run ends, everything falls apart. The crypto businesses are as volatile as the cryptocurrency prices.Why would a crypto company spend millions advertising on Formula 1? Can't they just spend less on marketing and achieve better results?",

Does anyone know if crypto dot com has sources of revenue aside from their exchange.I think that the exchange and cards were supposed to be those that bring the revenue. The spread on the exchange is quite a big money provider if you have plenty of users for it. Of course, on long term the users may vanish while learning that there can be cheaper alternatives.And crypto com has a history of irresponsibly waste money. Such a gamble was even acquiring that domain name, which sounds great, but was overly expensive (millions iirc) and I am not convinced even now it was worth it.If they indeed didn't take the crypto winter into account, then they are yet another exchange/company from somebody's list (I think CZ stated at some point that quite a number of exchanges look really bad now).But, with some luck, crypto winter may be close to an end. If they're lucky, they may survive this one, this time. Still, if they do, they have to become more attractive and get more users, and learn to be more careful with their money.Quote from: davis196 on October 11, 2022, 06:34:26 AMWhy is this post in the Gambling Discussion forum?While OP has linked this to F1, I agree, this is about crypto com company/service, not about motorsports or gambling.",

They could have focused on one particular sport and perhaps branched from there before getting all these deals in one go. That way they can still get their name out while also allotting lots of time and resources on making their brand the real deal, as opposed to just advertising. A bad move, but hopefully they get out of this one.",

Diversification can be good, but if not done calculatedly can suffocate a business. This IMO is the scenario crypto.com is facing. Their intention with the massive ads and chasing all the deals was good, but I think they lost focus and forgot one of the primary purpose of business which is to survive. As someone who is in business as well, I sympathize with other business owners when I see their businesses going through a tough time, I hope they recover and bounce back good. This new development should also serve as a warning to other business who plan on following the blueprint of crypto.com.",

It's just like what @dothebeats said they've built their project heavily focused on ads but not the project itself. I have no idea what goes on with crypto.com, all I know is you can stake thier token in the exchange itself and earn from it. After that, they are already going for ads like being on UFC shirts.",

Cryptos' value might decline but the demand for it will increase eventually so it's always possible for them to recover what they have lost.",

Each niche has its public which seems to be very loyal to the content they consume. What I see is a notable growment in cryptp and gambling advertisements at sports events, although it is more related to soccer.I believe traditional companies found more efficient and cheaper ways to promote their products and services on the internet, therefore sports events had to find alternative companies to sponsor them and that is what is happening.",
