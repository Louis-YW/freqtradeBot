They are rivals and anything like that is expected.I read on news after he (Atiku) went to the school Tinubu graduated and said Tinubu's certificate is not real.Quote from: https://dailypost.ng/2023/10/18/chicago-certificate-atiku-urges-supreme-court-to-ignore-technicality-overrule-tinubu-on-fresh-evidence/The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last presidential election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has again pleaded with the Supreme Court to jettison technicality and grant his application for leave to tender fresh and additional evidence to support his claim that President Bola Tinubu, submitted a forged document to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to contest the February 25, presidential election.But let us see what would happen and see what supreme court would decide about this. But I think Atiku is a loser.",

As it stands, the truth of the matter need to well verified, cause how person take be governor, hold many political office and yet them say e no go school, no be say I dey support anybody ooo but make we reason the matter well, how e take happen wey no body talk since that time. As this issue come out so, na to help Nigeria or ja to fight for the seat. If tinubu and atiku dey dsame party, shae Dem go gree bring this matter out. The major reason for the matter never clear and me dey think am say na just to collect power for in hand no bcos anybody care about our countryNow , the selfish wey don dey everybody for Niger don bring every us out as the most corrupt and fraudulent country in the world.Wetin even dey if runner up join winner to make the country better. Na position Dem dey fight for rather than uniting and making the country better.Wetin Dem suppose put for constitution be say all presidential runner up should form the president carbinent to make the country a better place, this one go give all people wey no win d chance to bring their idea to pass through collaboration.",

It is obvious that the worst of us are those in charge of leadership. It will continue this way as long as power is usually given to the highest bidder. Those that are supposed to enforce the law are the prime breakers of the law, it makes our case a serious one.",

But I think Atiku is a loser.Atiku has always been a bad loser, and he has lost more cases in court than any other presidential candidate. He had concerns regarding PBAT and demanded his Academy credentials, which he received, and then proceeded to summon CSU for a deposition, where the registrar confirmed that PBAT was a CSU student who graduated with honours. I don't understand why the certificate case is still being litigated after the CSU deposition. So, the Supreme Court will not Grant new evidence. They will base their decision on the evidence presented at the tribunal.",

Some of these issues are usually raised before election, but the cabals will back them and tell them to go ahead because na man know man game Naija politics be. Inec will go ahead and screen the person and they will pass the screening. So the other party will now say no and go to court to challenge the authenticity of the certificate and you know Nigeria legal system they will delay the court proceedings till after election. Before the court go hear the matter election don finish and the person has been declared winner and assumed office. So na by this time the court go come dey hear the case and judgement passed. Sometimes it favor them and while other are thrown out of office. We cant say not all holds water, some dey hold water. Like the one wey happen for Bayelsa State in November 2019 election. APC won the election, but due to the certificate saga of the deputy governor, the court declared pdp winner.",

It is the same country where people buy certificates from people and will still use it yo get a federal government or state government job. In Nigeria so far as you belong to a party that is in power no matter the crime one have committed it can be used to disqualify politicians.  Naija ns country wey no dey strict with their laws to politicians,  that is why a politicians wey Don get series of crime offenses ho fit still become president and the lawyers wey we get for the country go still be in support of the politicians to say their is nothing wrong with crimes they have committed in the past.",

Na because say our justice system don turn to something else, if not the court for don nullify some of these elections based on certificate matters. The politicians already don know say, nothing come out from the system so dem dey do anything way them like without remorse. We need to sanitize our judicial system if not we'll continue to see situations like this recurring.",
