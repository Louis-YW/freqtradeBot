Some still think cryptocurrency is illegal in Nigeria (I once also believed this until Charles Tim enlightenment on it), whereas we are just banned by cbn from making any crypto relating transactions with banks.2. Some see crypto and bitcoin as a get rich schemes without thinking of the risks involved. 3. Some see crypto and bitcoin as ponzi schemes because there are alot of crypto ponzi schemes like the cstcmine that recently crashed.4. Some see bitcoin as something relating to fraud because of those fraudsters who call themselves BTC boys.I will like to know how you teach others about bitcoin and cryptocurrency and what you focus on (whether it been a means of payment or as an investment)? .",

      "body": "Does someone really needs to preach about bitcoin in Nigeria again?From my state both young and old talks about bitcoin even some famous Nigerian musicians calls bitcoin along the line with their song. The things there is that they had different perspective about bitcoin just as you already said, due to what happened to them from a site or investment platform because I believe an average Nigerians loves ponzi scheme. They love a platform were they could be getting return of their investment without them going into detail of where they are putting their resources, I myself have been against any platform were they said invest to get back 100 percent in just 7 days or so. So I think all these scenario are what causes most people that are from our locality not put much Interest in bitcoin because they believe it would just end same way without them knowing that there are more to learn than just investment.Teaching people bitcoin is just like putting yourself into risk because they wouldn't mind to learn all it takes you would see them breaking out from you to start doing the investment themselves without an adequate teaching and proper orientation to stand firmed on their investment journey. Then lastly, this is fact \"We are impatient\" it could be hard to teach those who are not patient especially our young boys doesn't like what would stress them.",

I tell them it is an investment because you know say when person get money because he too lazy,most of them no go won stress themselves again. So I go tell them if them like to invest for bitcoin that they will benefit from it in a long term package.Nigeria young boiz no like stress and you know say to invest into something you need to get the proper knowledge, so them no go fit dey patient enough learn and invest. As long as na their money them go use and them no go see profit immediately, them go laugh you say,you dey waste your time.  I believe say time dey come wey many of these youths were dey see bitcoin as waste of time go say had I know.",

Some even too are afraid of the CBN ban on banks for Crypto related transactions and hence desist from associating themselves with bitcoin or anything related to Crypto for the time being but I had to let them know about the major Claus as regards the bank ban on Crypto transaction but they insist since government don talk Dem don talk say Dem no want anything way go make efcc or other government agencies come after them.Na so the mata take be now but I never stop talking to my friends of bitcoin and other developments as regards to bitcoin and Crypto even when I meet with new friends I do give them small time before I tell them about bitcoin.

I hardly teach people about  Bitcoin but when I teach I always make sure that I touch every part I know about Bitcoin, so i don't focus only on one particular section of Bitcoin. But the funniest part is that many nigerians are not interested to know others section of Bitcoin but only investment section because they are eager to make quick money at all means.",

They had that mindset that since government has banned crypto transactions in nigeria, that it is illegal and a scam which they do not really understand the clause behind it. They have already made up their mind to see it as a scam since the government has made a pronouncement so therefore it is termed illegal in the eyes of the law which in the real sense it is not so.",

If you remember well na after MMM Bitcoin begin reign wella wey be dat 2015/2016 time. The bull market for 2017 come make other ponzi scheme get better patronage. Secondly immediate person cashout for Bitcoin or cryptocurency in general, next thing na to show offem and e come dey be like quick money business.Yahoo boys own na him worst pass because all of them dey claim to be Bitcoin traders or investors so when them finally catch dem e go come belike anybody wey dey talk say him be trader or investors say na the same thing wey him dey do.
