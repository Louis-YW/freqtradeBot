  "content": "Let me pretend that I'm aware changes are constant in exchanges, but when they do their changes, it is supposed to be thorough and void of issues for their customers. They should be mindful that many people are using their crypto for a centralised system and AML must be strictly adhered to. Binance almost cost me a fortune on a Tron (TRX) transaction last week claiming I now have a new TSS address. I was only fortunate that it hadn't been too late for me to extract my money from their old address.I recently sent a substantial amount to a regular broker via Tron, and the dumb thing Binance did was send the money through the old address and expected me not to receive it from that address anymore. Is that not lame? If you know well-regulated brokers, they will only send back withdrawals to the same address as the originating one. I wonder the stress I would've gone through if I hadn't withdrawn some profits on time to detect such an issue.Why not use the new address to send the new transaction for my broker to record the recent address for me? This is also a lesson for you all who use well-regulated businesses for transactions and expect to receive withdrawals through the same address.",

Even though something happened your statement here already prove them free, and between why would you turned off ur mail and expect them to still not to message you, like I said they sent messages to their customer including me received it and immediately I deleted those addresses where I saved them for only transaction, so if that I blocked my mail and went to make deposit would I still have Binance to blamed at this point?",

Yes, I know how annoying those emails are but nothing says you must read them immediately. I've so many unread emails from Binance as I type this and I will only take out time to open them and scan through (not necessarily reading them deeply) when I'm bored doing other things.QuoteIt's bad to allow an old address to withdraw when you are not accepting it but will not let it receive money freely.If I got you right, withdrawal was through but deposit was problematic. If that was the case, I think it was better than having it in reverse where deposit would be allowed but one can't get one's money out during withdrawal. Anyway, what I normally do whenever I'm depositing to an exchange (even with the ones I constantly use) is to check for the deposit address of any coin I'm sending and ascertain it hasn't changed. It doesn't take me more than five minutes to do that. Like I said earlier in another post, I take my time in everything financial transactions.",

Most time pop-up notification do help as well, even without one going through his inbox whenever I received a mail without me login to my inbox I have the immediate email displayed at my top screen where I can just draw down my phone a bit to easily pip the few line of the email. That was how I did to get this mail I didn't actually go through my inbox it was just notification, and tell me anyone who blocked his mail and expect to apportioned blame to Binance for his mistake of not enabling mailing.",

It's bad to allow an old address to withdraw when you are not accepting it but will not let it receive money freely. What if the customer must obey anti-money laundering with the transaction?first of all, marking as spam emails from a company where you have a \"fortune\" is not the smartest thing and at this point you can no longer blame binance 100%. Secondly, I don't think any crypto exchange runs their wallets in the way you described. For a simple reason. If you deposit trx, sell to usdt and withdraw usdt, whose address should it be sent from. There is no USDT on the wallet you deposited TRX? What about trx on the old address? Its still there. That's why exchanges dynamically pay out from different wallets and use users deposit address only to know who deposited funds and move them to hotwallets asap. If you have a regulated broker that requires deposits from your previously connected address, connect your wallet (f.e. Trust) and use it as an intermediary between CEXs and your broker. Otherwise, such mistakes will become a daily occurrence for you.",

This doesn't mean that you can't be annoyed by it, you can very well be annoyed by it, and it is definitely something we do not want to see, but that doesn't change the fact that we are going to end up with something that would be a bit different on the long run, we just need to end up with something that would be a bit different in the end and couldn't be all that weird.I get that sometimes we want things to be done differently, but we can't force binance to change it, they did what the yare suppose to do, and they are not responsible for anything more than that. If they didn't notified people via email regarding this or put any announce on their website then we would be able to say that they are the wrong ones here, but they probably did, and that means we can't put any blame on them no matter how annoying this could be.",

It is really that impossible that they wont really be making out some email letters or announcement on such changes.Even into their APP (based on experience) on which there would really be some certain pop up in regarding those possible significant changes on which it would really be alerting the user that you should really be needing to act so that you would be able to avoid some possible issues later on.This might be a different thing or situation but whenever your deposit address to be changed or expired (USDT) example then they would really be having those prompt and telling you this and that.Its impossible that you wont really be that fully aware about those things. Just like the rest been saying that we arent that defending Binance on here but basing up with my experiencethen i dont really have any problems about notifications or information about certain updates. It is really just that depending on someones awareness and actions been made.",
