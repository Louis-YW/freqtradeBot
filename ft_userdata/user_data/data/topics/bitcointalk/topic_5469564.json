My parents took care of me from childhood and they taught me education and they are still trying to teach me education. Father is very old and it is not possible for him to work as he used to, so I myself feel that I should do something. At the moment, if I could somehow earn to help my family or pay for my education, then maybe the pressure on my father would be reduced a lot. I joined Bitcoin to fulfill my dream. My mother has a dream to build a house, maybe in the future I will have to help her fulfill her dream because my father is spending the money he earns on my education and running the family so at the moment he cannot afford to build a house. I have already gained enough knowledge about trading by being involved with Bitcoin, firstly I want to start my Bitcoin journey through trading, after making some money from trading I plan to invest in Bitcoin for four years. These four years I will hold my investment and also save the money earned from trading or signature campaign for four years so that after four years I can start building the house.  You must pray for me so that I can fulfill my mother's dream.",

You need bricks and cement to build a house not BTC. Hehe don't mind just kidding. I pray that your wish will be fulfilled very soon. Your plan is good as you have started trading in BTC and also want to hold BTC for longer period of time. You do have a good plan and I pray that you will reach to a rank where you can join the signature campaigns. But till then you can spend your time in learning some other skills, like advancing your existing trading skills or in learning another skills. You are studying, so you have a progressive mind now and you can adapt new things very fast, so don't waste time and learn some skills like developing etc. Skills depend on the relevant education your getting. Don't waste your education so please find a way to use that too. That's why I said find a skill related to your education.But to be honest, it does not matter at all. The thing that matters is, you making money. So at the current time, you might give a try to join bounties because at the most you can earn around $1000 from bounties but in a year. This estimate is based on my personal experience. I was participating in videos and articles campaigns.",

After two years of service I got a fairly good benefit from them. ~ A few months ago when the bitcoin market was 17 thousand USD I invested 80% of the dividend in the bitcoin market and I still hold it.

It will not come easily but surely, it is achievable if the will and dedication is in place. I wish you good luck. Quote from: Essential10 on October 07, 2023, 04:09:58 PM I have already gained enough knowledge about trading by being involved with Bitcoin, firstly I want to start my Bitcoin journey through trading, after making some money from trading I plan to invest in Bitcoin for four years.To trade Bitcoin, you realise capital will be involved as well as the risk of loosing the capital? Are you prepared for whatever outcome you will experience? I do not mean to scare you but understanding the risk involved will help you in planning and decision making. If you have a cashflow that can support you buying Bitcoin no matter how small, why not apply DCA and run it till the next bull run instead of depending entirely on day trading? After funding your trading account, I am suggesting you start accumulating Bitcoin after making your financial projections. You can start very small and grow with time... in that case you are pursuing it both ways: trading and investment.",

Your father is trying to give you an education so you can provide for yourself, I don't think they want you to be responsible for them if ever the time comes that you get successful in life. I mean, that's how parents are. Now you said you are trading. Are you sure about the path that you are taking? Even though you learned so much about it there are always chances that you might get rekt if the market won't fluctuate the way you like it. There's still risk involved in it and you will need money for your capital which means spending, so where will you get that money?Don't get me wrong I am not bringing you down, it's just that you said you are still a student and I do believe your father can still manage it for your education. If you can save some money by working a little then good, but don't force it and try to finish that education first. It will be the best gift you can give to them.",

Just think about how to buy building materials.Building a house requires a lot of money. For those who are not balanced with their monthly income, this will be an obstacle. Try investing in Bitcoin instead of as savings because when the Bitcoin price reaches its highest, you can use the return from the current purchase price to buy building materials.",

Well welcome to the forum and in as much as everyone is entitled to their dreams and the process of how they Are going to achieve that dreams I would say is your sole dream and aspiration only to get a house? You speak off saving for four years and then use it to get. House then what next? The house is not an investment that would be bringing you income. May dream of something more that would guarantee you and your family financial security.Also trading is unpredictable, the fact that you want to enter Bitcoin trading does not mean you would be successful in it, if not everyone would be trading. You don't have the luxury to enough capital in my opinion, I would suggest you start with investing in Bitcoin and then grow your portfolio with that. This are just my thoughts you have the final say .",

There is a lot of money for the ones who master some skills and if you can master a skill like graphic design, photo retouching, video editing, application development, web development, and game development in Unity then it will be much easier for you to get clients and earn some money.
