      "body": "ASICs are more powerful than GPU, so they have better high-quality specs for better mining rigs. So I'd rather prefer to choose ASIC mining rigs than the GPUs and the power consumption would be 3,250 watts for the 95 TH/s (90-95 Terahashes per second), that's an Antminer S19 power consumption. For the GPU, mining in altcoins and what coin could be mined.  Here's a list.https://www.hashrate.no/",

Anyway, Compac F USB miner is much cheaper and more profitable compared to Apollo(Based on their power consumption).",

Close to none!Right now an S19 Pro gets you close to 14$ a day while burning 78kwh, which by your price is 12,5 $, so at current levels you're going to spend 9000$ on gear that will make you 1.5$ a day. An s19xp will be better meaning that you're going to ROI in about 5 years not a decade.Quote from: sportsman18 on May 22, 2022, 10:57:54 PMThere is any GPU to mine Bitcoin? No!",

The price of electricity for large miners is 4-5 cents, in Russia there are places where the price is less than 2 cents. Electricity is the main item of your expenses, so look for favorable conditions.",
