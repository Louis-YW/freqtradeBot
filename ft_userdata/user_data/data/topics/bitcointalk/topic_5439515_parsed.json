Disregard this ignorant post. All the answers were there, I just needed to look. Was mainly confused on the super bumps. I came across some thread that really laid everything so good a while back but forgot about it. In terms of ranking up I of course know how that works and have been fortunate to get some good merits for my posts. I want to contribute more to this forum in a wholesome way. So please excuse me and any rants that I make or ones seemly very stupid üòÇ I‚Äôm trying to sort out a lot of things in my life right now, but I appreciate all of your comments! The ranking system on here is very legit, and I like it a lot.",
