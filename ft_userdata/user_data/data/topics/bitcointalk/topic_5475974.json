  "content": "Few days ago Satochip and me organized a nice Giveaway for 14th years of Bitcointalk forum and lucky winner was selected randomly.Interest was shown from other forum members who really liked the design of this cards and they wanted to buy them if possible.Current card design N1 was printed in only 5 limited edition cards and this design won't be printed ever again, so better hurry up if you want to find them in stock.You can check all the details and make purchase on official Satochip page:https://satochip.io/product/BitcoinTalk-Satoshi-1/This is how the cards look printed from all sides, and you can see ID numbers from #1 to #5:  You can use this Satochip cards as open source hardware wallets and they work great in combination with Laptops like Thinkpad that have card readers.Satochip cards works with Sparrow wallet and with Electrum Satochip client (using plugin):https://satochip.io/software/Satochip Bitcointalk cards website:https://satochip.io/product/BitcoinTalk-Satoshi-1/",

I said that the shipping was \"free\" but that's inacurate. Let me give you an overview... At Satochip, we try to offer affordable AND secure solution. Our business model includes the shipping costs. Why? Because we think it's a non sense to sell a 25 bucks products and charge an additional 10 bucks for shipping.How can we achieve that? Simply by sending the product using a small letter... Easy, cheap. With no tracking, no insurance.Such shipping method works great from Belgium to Europe, the United States and Canada. We have a 95% success rate, with 4% returning due to incorrect address and only 1% lost.It's IMPOSSIBLE to use this method for Latin America. Eg: Brazil require some specific papers to import electronics goods. Peru is a nightmare if you don't use tracking services etc...Kinda same reasons for Africa or some specific countries in Asia. Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world.In a resume, the tracking shipping is mandatory (and must be paid by the user) for:- EU : --- Belarus, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Moldava, Macedonia, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain and Ukraine(We had to add Spain to this list because the Spanish postal service sucks. The rate of lost or stolen mail is very high). - ASIA, AFRICA and SOUTH AMERICAFor the rest of the world, you can chose between free shipping or paid tracking shipping as an option.I hope this is more clear and again, sorry for the confusion.",

It's a bargain, especially for those who have the integrated card reader; you're practically getting a hardware wallet for as little as €25.",
