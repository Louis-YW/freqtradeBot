If it really was only up to 150W, many of my rigs would be crashing all the time and i constantly would have to change melted connectors, although i never had any problems.Surely i'm missing something, can someone give me some information?",

It can deliver more until it burns  All over 288w on the PSU side is out of the specifications / save use, but it doesn´t mean all cables must burn.The max I do over an 8 pin (GPU side) is 225W for long term mining.",

Only difference between the two is that the 8 pin has more ground pins.The wire can handle all that wattage the bigger issue is the female connector pins. When you plug something in and out a few times it spreads and contacts aren’t as good and it’ll start to melt at the harness connector pins.",

Average is perhaps 30-50 Watts from the PCIe slot. So if a GPU is pulling 300 Watts then from the PCIe external connectors it uses maybe 250 Watts max. Hence 2 connectors are more than safe.Here is another thing to keep in mind. Some lower end PSUs have 2 PCIe 8 pin but they are in series not parallel. If that is the case don't connect it to that. Because it'll pull too much current from those pins.",

Some 300W cards have 2x8 some have 3x8.I shouldn't need to explain what that means.",

That's 76% of the rated capacity, so 228 watts from the2x8 cable, 114 from the 1x8 cable, and 57 from the slot.",

That is the safe rating, and you go any higher than that at your own risk.https://www.gpuminingresources.com/p/psu-cables.htmlCables and connectors can work at high power values, but you need to read the documentation for your equipment to assess the risks.",
