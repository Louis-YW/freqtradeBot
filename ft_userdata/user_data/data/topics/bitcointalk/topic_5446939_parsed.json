  "content": "Gooday mates, I have checked this forum and I haven't seen this thread so I decided to share it with you guys. First of all fire ðŸ”¥ catastrophes are the most critical situation that somebody should experience, my motive for saying this is because of the incident that occurred on an island at Balogun Market in Lagos state, these fire ðŸ”¥ outbreak has caused a lot of losses and I can testify that properties of most businessmen and woman are lost and even the governments of Lagos state isn't doing anything about it, I know that this is not the first or second time a fire incident had occurred in this island and my question is what is the cause of this fire outbreak in Lagos state. Here is the news linkhttps://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/590474-breaking-fire-erupts-in-lagos-market.html How can these fire outbreaks stop?",

Although many people have lost huge sums in cash and goods, life is priceless. I just hope most of the traders are under insurance policies that will help them recover their losses. The government should also come up with some welfare plans that could reduce the financial hardship that the affected traders will go through. Markets in the Nigerian city of Lagos have been having recurrent fire outbreaks recently. There is a need to investigate the causes of this havoc and come up with preventive measures to avert future occurrences.There is also a need to have a well-organized, trained, and equipped firefighting department. That will respond quickly to fire outbreaks and stop the fire from spreading. Roads and buildings should also be constructed in ways that will grant these firefighters unhindered access to these affected buildings. @OP I think you might get more responses if you have posted this topic on the Nigerian local board.",

This fire outbreak has damaged a lot of properties, and I can say that this fire disaster affects those that are from the East more than the indigene of Lagos state because they are the most successful businesspeople in lagos state.",

Let the government put it as a law to all shop owner in Lagos not to connect electricity to their shop but to allow them use generator to do anything they want to do in their businesses. If you can flash back what normally caused this fire outbreak in Lagos is through the electricity, the outbreak use to happened in the midnight where people has closed from their business activities, either some people forgot to switch off their appliance in their various store. If all the shop owner can be use to generator in their business activities, I guess it will really stop this fire outbreak in Lagos because it always reduce the victim to zero level.",

      "body": "A fire outbreak is usually caused by some careless mistake people make at times, such as forgetting to turn off the stove, pressing iron, or forgetting to completely put out a little fire that could linger and lead to a great flame. There was a fashion house that got burned. In my city of residence, and that was last year that the incident took place, when the source of the fire got investigated, it was noted that the cause of the fire was because they left an iron on top of a plastic table without turning it off, and when they closed work that day, they did not turn it off, and the iron overheated, melted the rubber, and caused the flame that burned down the house. I just thought that people should be more careful handling things they know could cause fire or explosions.",
