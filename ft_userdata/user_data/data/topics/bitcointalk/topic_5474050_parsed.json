Would you invest on crypto, stocks or household when the cash is not the king? During high inflation periods cash is one the worst investment choices we can make. We are just going to lose value each year with the rising inflation. Investing into anything fixed rates like bonds or savings account is not going to do much better. The central bank will likely keep rising interest rates to combat and inflation, which decrease the value of our fixed payments in the future. Stocks is definitely a better idea to invest, if the business is not hit hard by inflation themselves. As long as the company can charge the customers with the higher inflation their business model is not at risk. Crypto currencies seem like one of the best solutions, because they are independent of your country and the value should not be affected by your local inflation. This all depends on how much money you can save and if you might need it short term. In case you can't invest longterm you could also consider switch some money into USD, like many people in Argentina are doing to escape their struggling high inflation.",

Not even Argentina, which has 120% inflation this year is suffering from hyperinflation. Let's see:What Is Hyperinflation? Causes, Effects, Examples, and How to PrepareQuoteWhile inflation measures the pace of rising prices for goods and services, hyperinflation is rapidly rising inflation, typically measuring more than 50% per month.Investopedia gives a more traditional way of preparing for inflation:QuoteIt's critical to remember that hyperinflation doesn't happen very often, especially in developed countries where a central bank focuses on reigning in and controlling inflationary periods. However, there are some actions you can take to reduce the effects normal or high inflation have on your portfolio.A balanced and diversified portfolio can help you reduce losses through inflationary periods. Commodities and real estate can reduce the adverse effects of inflation because they tend to increase in value during these times. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) can hedge against rising inflation because the principal you have invested in a TIPS adjusts with inflation.Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that practice inflation swaps can also be used to combat the effects of inflation on your portfolio.To this we should add while we are on this forum, and as mentioned, bitcoin.",

Would you invest on crypto, stocks or household when the cash is not the king? Hyperinflation may result from several economic factors, and trying to find a single solution to all inflation problems in all countries will be impossible, although some investment solutions such as purchasing Bitcoin and gold may contribute to reducing the negative effects of inflation.If you are in a country suffering from explosive inflation, look for the reasons. If it is the government’s mismanagement of cash or budget imbalances, it is better to try to withdraw your money from the banks, otherwise restrictions may be imposed on that.If the reason is energy prices, then investing in sectors such as solar energy is better than buying Bitcoin, and so on according to your circumstances. The only constant is not keeping the local currency.",

Before investment, you have to be able to reduce expenses so you can have enough to put into investment. You have to cut budget and let go of more pleasures and luxury, spend more on more assets and lesser liabilities. Financial intelligence and strong discipline are key factors to make it through inflation, you have to be strategic wan wiser with spending.

It's better to invest into real estate if you are not familiar or not comfortable with Crypto or stocks.

This can lead to a severe erosion of the value of money, as prices for goods and services rise rapidly and the purchasing power of the currency falls. If there is hyperinflation, you have to get rid of the hyperinflating currency as fast as possible. Besides buying food and other essentials investing in not inflating foreign currencies or hard assets like real estate, commodities, not speculative equities and precious metals were ways to protect people from losing purchasing power rapidly.     if you honestly believe hyperinflation is about to occur, borrow as much money as you can and convert into easily sold portable assets such as precious metals, investment grade diamonds, cryptocurrency. If the country you are concerned about isn’t a major economic power, then a different foreign currency or real estate are also a reasonable choices.",
