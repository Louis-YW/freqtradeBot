I like to see the opinion other forum members on this thought.You really need to put some periods in between your sentences. I had to re-read this block many times before i got the actual question.Personally, i'm very hard against what you're proposing (recycling unspent outputs that have not been used for a long time...) for multiple reasons:Who is going to tell us if that unspent output is really \"lost\" or is merely controlled by a real hodler? I have unspent outputs that are several years old, will you be robbing me by voiding those unspent outputs? I can tell you, with great certainty, that i would swap chains and move every single satoshi i own to an altcoin that wasn't thinking about these shenanigans if there was ever a real discussion about voiding old transactions and said discussion would ever start translating in actual BIP's (and it was plausible they would be implemented)On a technical level, how would you solve \"voiding\" old unspent outputs? You *could* add them to the block reward of the next block, but that would mean a miner would not only be able to add the block reward and the sum of the fees to the coinbase transaction, but also a value of unspent outputs that were generated by a transaction that was included in a block with a height (current height - x?). Seems pretty arbitrary to me...In reality, bitcoin will never be out of reach for the common man (or it doesn't HAVE to be out of reach)... Even if ALL private keys get lost except just one private key whose address was funded with just one bitcoin, it could still be enough for everybody... At the moment, bitcoin's smallest on chain denomination is 0.0000001 BTC (one satoshi), but (for example) the LN uses millisat as it's smallest denomination. If there was only 1 bitcoin left, we could all start using nanoSat as smallest denomination... or picoSat of femtoSat, or...",

Also, \"the unbanked\" is a marketing term created by new online banks, so that they could tell investors how they will attract millions of users. The whole point of the term \"ubanked\" is to make them \"banked\", not \"bitcoined\".Bitcoin is not running out of units of account, the network would need to lose 99.9999999% of its total supply before it would start becoming a problem, and current estimate for lost coins is something like 5-20%, and the rate at which coins are getting lost has greatly slowed down",

The more bitcoin is becoming valuable, the more people will be careful not to lose it.Most lost bitcoin in the past is because people did not believe bitcoin would become more valuable and unbelievable to them, it even become more valuable than they thought, but they are already careless with the private key of their bitcoin which is lost forever.",

I like to see the opinion other forum members on this thought.A senior member who has not yet moved away from the beginner's questions and thinks that there is not enough Bitcoin in the world for all those who want it, or that there will not be enough in the future... What is completely neglected is the fact that Bitcoin is used in one way or another by a maximum of about 5% of the world's population, and it is questionable whether this number will double by the end of the decade. What is lost can only contribute to a higher price of Bitcoin in the future, but one day when computers are far more powerful some of the lost coins will probably be saved - it will be a challenge for some future digital treasure hunters.",

But because of the high privacy and security in the Bitcoin network it almost impossible for that to happen and that is why most of us Bitcoin supporters ride with the idea of lost Bitcoin as a contribution to the price.Quote from: Oshosondy on June 22, 2022, 08:11:36 AMMost lost bitcoin in the past is because people did not believe bitcoin would become more valuable and unbelievable to them, it even become more valuable than they thought, but they are already careless with the private key of their bitcoin which is lost forever.Yeah the number of lost Bitcoin is on the decline recently because people are getting more aware and informed about Bitcoin, and how to protect their private keys, But still from 2017 report lost Bitcoin is placed at 20% of the total circulating supply.Quote from: mocacinno on June 22, 2022, 08:03:42 AMYou really need to put some periods in between your sentences.

I like to see the opinion other forum members on this thought.Reuse is an incorrect term. When you send your Bitcoin to a receiver, you lost it, forever. If you send it to a wrong receiving address, you lost it too. You can not summon it and reuse it!There is change addresses and there is circulating transactions of Bitcoin on the network but it is not reuse by one person. It's exchange between sender and receiver.You can use the HODL waves and make your estimation on possible lost Bitcoin. Estimation will be different when you use different cut-off of UTXo ages. Old inactive UTXO does not mean it is lost forever.https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/hodl-waves/",
