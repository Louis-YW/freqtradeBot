Like, are you actually bullish on bitcoin in a broader sense? Or are you just here solely for the money? Because if it's the latter, you're bound to be disappointed.",

It wasn't a good year so far for all of us, let's tell ourselves the truth.The manner it keeps going down is even scaring, nothing really impressive putting your money again, the saga is too much to bear but let's hope things turn around",

Even though we are only in the first quarter of the year, we are still far from the end of the year. Therefore, we should not compare 2023 to the beginning of the year. The individuals who sold their investments during the downtrend do not have sufficient crypto knowledge or preparation. However, an individual with a strict stop loss is unique; some of them were fortunate enough to purchase again at a lower price during the downtrend.",

How do you succeed your year with bitcoin? Is it good to you or worst kind of time?I guess overall I was doing well accumulating bitcoin buying 2 times a month, sometimes I buy more when the market price was down by a small percentage, and probably just a normal buy when the price continue to increase since I will get more profit in the future when I buy more bitcoin especially when the market is down. So I usually increase the volume every time the market continues to go down.It wasn't a good year compared to the past year since the last time was a bull run I really did well on trading and especially NFTs where I earn a really good amount of profit on flipping, and that gives me enough to hold on to this bear market and probably survive, I just quit my job recently but I can still find ways to earn income and I do save a little bit for my bitcoin investment every time I earn.",

OP, the strength you seek is within you, do not rely on the good stories that you want others to talk about, this is not the right time for that, the only success story I have in this bear market is making 10x of my money from a A.I project called Vaiot.

How do you succeed your year with bitcoin? Is it good to you or worst kind of time?Actually, for people who have experienced this kind of phase, they will not be surprised. Because indeed a few years ago this kind of prank also happened. Perhaps the slight difference is, right now is a financially difficult period due to the recession. But with the current situation, everyone can still make a profit with the features of trading services such as margin or futures.This time is indeed a period that requires quite a lot of patience. I've been through this period da times and I don't think this is bad. But it should be a period that should happen. Right now all you do is be patient and stay disciplined with the strategy you have set.",
