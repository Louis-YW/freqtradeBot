Nobody can feel good spending more than 5 minutes on your exchange trading. It looks like it was built by a 15-year-old.CryptoRadar Exchange doesn't try to be like every other exchange... We focus on internal features as much as on the looks. The current user interface adapts to multitude of different screen resolutions and window sizes with minimal code. There will always be people who don't like the user interface, but there will also be people who feel familiar with it... The user interface was originally based on looks of Peatio-based exchanges, but most of the code was rewritten in PHP to eliminate bugs that annoyed the team members.",

I've seen more than one exchange use same license number that I verified was fake from Estonian police. Only cryptocurrency exchanges that allow FIAT deposits and withdrawals require a license. The whole team is online on the official Telegram channel. Some of the team members use their real names, some of them don't, but that's how cryptocurrency world works. The owner's real name is mentioned in the whois information for the domain.What comes to ToS, there is only one thing that is forbidden, sending lots of small deposits. This essentially means mining directly to exchange deposit address.CryptoRadar Exchange lists a lot of less known coins that have been around for many years, but also lists coins that attract bigger traders. It's one of the few smaller exchanges that allows multi-chain currencies from the launch and plans to extend the support for more token types and blockchains. The main advantage is really low listing fees as the operating costs of the exchange are in big part covered by the owner himself.A lot of exchanges listed on CoinMarketCap have inflated trading volumes, but all the trading in CryptoRadar Exchange is real as there is currently no API for bots to use and the trading engine limits both the minimum and maximum amount that can be traded in single order. There is also delay between each order to make it really hard to use any script to create large number of orders.",

Really, who in their right mind would decide to leave their KYC data on this page?The original layout was designed by man who was born in 1963 and did run his own exchange before it was shut down by government in his country... We bought the codebase and cleaned up it a lot, but like you said, it's not done yet. We will be adding some of the missing information in next few weeks, but currently we focus on adding and testing more currencies. I know some people think it's risky to deposit cryptocurrencies to a freshly launched exchange, but it's one of the fastest way to make sure everything works as intended. I would call it a soft launch, not a finished product.What comes to licenses and things like that, it really depends on applicable laws of the country the exchange operates from... Some countries like USA and Germany have stricter requirements than other countries. In some countries it's just illegal to run a cryptocurrency exchange.KYC and AML go hand-in-hand, most countries require complying to at least AML, but you can't have AML without some kind of limited version of KYC, even if a lot of cryptocurrency traders think KYC is just a government conspiracy, as some countries don't even allow storing KYC information for verification purposes, so the information must be re-collected each time and immediately verified without any delay.",

A message for the designer, It is really necessary to keep up with the times, technologies develop and improve very quickly. It is not possible to work on the same thing for a long period of time, especially not when it comes to Internet technologies.QuoteWhat comes to licenses and things like that, it really depends on applicable laws of the country the exchange operates from...

Simply, you have to register and thus make your business official.

To whom do you justify the legality of funds, if you yourself are illegal? Who is responsible for monitoring your business?",

Just as I said before, malicious websites copy information from other websites, so revealing as little as possible protects the company behind CryptoRadar Exchange from potential identity theft. Whoever wants to know more can ask for the information from the team members on Telegram and if it seems the request is unjustified, then we just don't reveal the information.I've seen a lot of websites nowadays hide the information from public records, but CryptoRadar Exchange doesn't do that.The exchange operates under jurisdiction of Australia.",
