  "content": "Not only the title, but 10% of ALL deaths in the US are from hospital/doctor mistakes. And if they are happening here, what about other countries... especially 3rd world countries.Nobody really knows how many deaths occur in hospitals, because of mistakes/accidents. But some sources suggest that it might be close to a million a year. Of course, that's an old statistic. It has only gotten worse.From the 3rd book in Lois Bujold's Borders of Infinity: \"The sheep look up, but are not fed... .\"Top 9 SCARIEST hospital surgery mistakes that are quite commonQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-07-17-top-9-scariest-hospital-surgery-mistakes-common.htmlSome surgeons fail to sterilize equipment and others are not prepared for potential complications. Plus, many surgeons are fatigued, reckless, or heavy handed. Lastly, some of these doctors and nurses have substance abuse problems themselves, and easy access to the drugs.These 'situations' are not uncommon in US hospitals, believe it or not, and often result in major malpractice cases and loss of medical licenses. What's worse is these problems pose serious, quality-of-life altering injuries, or loss of life itself.Shocker: Over 10% of all deaths in the U.S. are due to surgical errors and other \"never events\" Of course all surgery is dangerous, but thousands of patients are placed at disproportionate risk of injury or death just because of negligence and \"never events,\" to the tune of $1.3 billion in malpractice compensation every year, and that's according to the JAMA statistics found at jamanetwork.com. Have you or a loved one been a victim of US medical industrial complex negligence and medical malfeasance? Maybe you're entitled to a slice of the next $1.3 billion or more about to be paid out this year in America....",

      "body": "A fairly good friend of mine is an Operating Room nurse and she told me about an incident which she was involved in personally where a visiting doctor hooked up a heart/lung machine backward so blood was flowing the wrong direction.  Took 15 minutes to figure out what the problem was, and by that time the patient died.Everyone involved kept their mouths shut about it and the family was satisfied with the explanation that the patient 'just died.'  So, of course, this particular incident isn't 'on the books' as a medical mistake.  One has to assume that this is a fairly common end-point for such mishaps.  This would have been at least 25 years ago.  I sense now more and more that such 'accidents' are of a more targeted and strategic nature in certain hospitals for certain procedures.  e.g., 'ventilators' for earlier victims of the covaids scamdemic.",

      "body": "^^^ In addition, my sister is a hospital nurse with about 3 decades of experience. She explains how the hospital nursing boots-on-the-ground, in-hospital procedures have become more lax. Certainly they are way more lax than the 1950s in the US. There are hundreds of little mistakes happening all the time... mistakes that don't necessarily kill people, but ones that often make life more miserable for patients, and certainly ones that could have been easily avoided if the nurses cared.If you value your life and health, do all that you can... live your life in such a way... that you stay out of the hospital.",
