  "content": "Ive been seeing this Worldcoin trending lately. So, I decided to make a little research on it because of that.First of all, the coin is founded by Sam Altman who was a partner of Elon Musk in open AI. Apart from that, he is a Billionaire also. So, If you look at this coin from this point of view, It actually looks great with that. So, after checking the whitepaper, I see that's its an identity and Financial Network. And its also secure as described in the whitepaper. With this technology, you can scan your eyes to prove that you are a human being also. After seeing the coin ($WLD) trading on several exchanges like Binance, Bitget OKX and more, I feel more confident about the project and coin and I see huge potential in it. So I feel like sharing it here to see people's opinions also.",

Seems I will be more careful interacting with the coin for now till I see much circulation and no regulation. I have been experiencing with so many projects that listed on the various exchange sites like binance. The project like sui has proven how the more tokens in circulating supply gonna give impact for long term. I kinda feel if privacy is not that important anymore in this decade. You must be careful for that. it's caused by the impact gonna happen for long term. People were wrongly understanding it. They think that as long as the project listed on binance and the price won't be dumped. The main problem is if invetors were also getting their own tokens that will be dumped once these tokens will be unlocked in the future. The retail investors aka buyers will be only exit liquidity for them.",

Right now it has about 2 million dollars marketcap that is still questionable and not even certain, this is self-reported, and even in their self reported ones it's this low. Secondly it has 500 something discord members with just 30 online as of writing this. Imagine a coin that has 500 members and 2 million self reported cap, and imagine you can convince people to invest into that.This is exactly why it's not going to end up being any success, it's going to suck and it's not going to have any good return at all. I believe that we are going to end up with a trouble one way or another if we keep trusting all these low cap small stuff, do not trust them this easily, they are just not doing a good job.",

Based on some of the researchers, this worldcoin will not bring what investors will be expecting before the end of this year 2023, because the way the coin appear in the market show that it will not last like Ethereum and binance before it will disappear from the market which is the fear of many investors. I don't think, I will invest on this new coin than to watch the coin through out this season to know if the coin will show any improvement before I will invest.",

The scariest side of the Worldcoin crypto is your eye scan and it has proven you who, where and everything is so clearly shared with technology.
