Therefore, this is without any doubt a phishing email. The real question is: where dud those scammers got your email address from? You said you received the same message on two different addresses, so you need to check what you have done wrong!Anyway, thank you for the warning.",

So since we know that this phising attempt exist they should do their own diligence to verify because if we track back on the first day we create our wallet on metamask the platform didn't require us to provide email address. So if we receive the same like email we can tag it as scam or it create harm so that we can easily delete it before it create damage to us.",

How can Metamask need an upgrade that requires them to send me a message?They are not MetaMask but scammers who make it and all they need is your email address and make sure that you have posted your Ethereum address publicly, then the possibility that you have used MetaMask is high, they can collect this information via a social attack while sending this e-mail does not cost them effort or time.Quote from: Nwada001 on June 09, 2023, 07:01:05 PMI moved the mail to my Apple device, which I don't use for anything relating to financial transactions.

They can now open your camera, take pictures of you or collect more data such as cookies, including knowing more information about you to use in next social attack.If you are suspicious of a link, stop with the mouse on it, and the link extension will appear to you, and if that extension is hidden or a redirect link, do not click on it.Quote from: Nwada001 on June 09, 2023, 07:01:05 PMBut what I saw was an open form for me to use my hand and type in my 12-word phrase, which is handing my wallet access over to the scammer or using the private key option.If you enter any random words they accept.",

I did it, when I look at junk, about a hundred emails like this (because a long time ago, I used my email for anything registered). But sometimes, if strong, an email is received also in my email inbox. Again, when they ask for a seed and private key, that was pretty sure is a scam, it's the same if a swindler (fake bank support) calls you asking CC number and CVV to deceive the OTP code on a short message. So just be careful, scammers are lurking victims everywhere, the scammer needs money without working.",

So, like Google, Infura can begin creating user psomeone may be able to purchase your data from several sources, and then he will have information such as your addresses, your IP addresses, and your personal details such as your email address. All he will need is to prepare a message for you, for example, $ 500 has been withdrawn from your wallet with XXX address, and you need to update your wallet With an email that is very similar to the official email.",

It's just a question directed at the scammer's way of thinking: do they actually think anyone who is familiar with how the system works will fall victim to such an easily identifiable scam?I have read it carefully before posting the reply and that was my response in such situation. I also never mentioned that it was you who said Metamask requires e-mail for creating wallet, but it is my way of replying to a question. My whole reply was to show that how those malicious hackers are using the name of Metamask to create panic in the mind of the users in order to steal their secret key. I think they might sent such mail to a list of users not only you, and many of those users might have shared their secret keys on that site of the malicious actors. You were technically good and were aware of such things so you protected yourself from their trap, and shared the thing with the users to promote awareness regarding such scams.

However, there are some users who basically register with their single e-mail account on many websites and in that case the better option is to just block those senders and even if they try sending you the mail from multiple accounts, it's better to block all of those accounts. I personally use my main e-mail to register on many sites and I have seen such e-mails many times, I blocked most of the senders who sent such e-mails and now there aren't any such mails coming on my e-mail account. I would also say that if someone can create a new account then that's the best solution to get rid of such fraudsters, but if it's not possible for a person to change the e-mail account then the best option is to block the sender or senders if they are using more than one account for sending such mails.",
