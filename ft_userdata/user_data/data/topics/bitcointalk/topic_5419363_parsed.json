  "content": "QuoteApple supplier TSMC believes that US efforts to rebuild chip manufacturing at home are doomed to fail, as it finds itself caught between China and the United States in a tech cold war.Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987 when Taiwan recruited him from the US to help build an electronics industry. The contract manufacturer rose to become the top chipmaker in the world, commanding 20% of global wafer fabrication and 92% of advanced chip capacity.US share in global chip manufacturing shrunk from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2020, but the country wants to regain its dominance. In particular, US Department of Defense is worried that the country's dependence on Taiwan could put chip supplies for the defense industry at risk.In response, President Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law on August 9, 2022. It provides over $52 billion to help US companies build new semiconductor facilities, fund research, and expand existing manufacturing.Taiwan isn't happy about the move because it sees its semiconductor dominance as a \"silicon shield.\" The government believes that if China were to attack the country, the US would come to its aid to prevent China from seizing the industry.When US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August, she met with Morris Chang and Mark Liu, chair of TSMC. Chang told Pelosi that Washington's efforts to rebuild its chip manufacturing were doomed to fail, according to Taiwan's Financial Times.But the United States may not have much choice. Analysts at investment bank Credit Suisse have estimated that if the world loses access to Taiwan's chip plants, it will disrupt the production for everything from computers to cars.Apple would be impacted too, as it relies heavily on TSMC for chip production. While it has expanded some of its manufacturing to other countries such as Vietnam and India, those moves do not diversify Apple's chip supply at all.Still, TSMC remains a major supplier for Apple and other companies, and its future between the US and China is uncertain.\"The monopoly in semiconductor production creates instability,\" said Brad Martin, director of the National Security Supply Chain Institute at the Rand Corporation. \"If the US is faced with a need to make a decision between protecting its economy and defending Taiwan, that starts to become a very stark decision.\"TSMC has made some efforts to help the US by planning a semiconductor facility in Arizona, the first such chip facility it will develop outside of its home country. TSMC expects it will reach its production start in early 2024.https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/10/24/tsmc-says-efforts-to-rebuild-us-semiconductor-industry-are-doomed-to-fail....I would be interested to know how public opinion views this content.It seems that semiconductor supply chains needed for US manufacturing will be further throttled due to conflict between china and the united states. When supply chain disruptions first arose in 2020, Elon Musk considered buying a semiconductor foundry to produce tesla semiconductors in house. Unfortunately the high price tag of a semiconductor foundry, small margins, and long start up period discouraged Elon from taking this route. And he opted to buy twitter instead.Semiconductor mass production appears to be an extremely difficult industry to tackle from an engineering and business perspective. Is it fair to say a future forecast for semiconductor shortages is likely. Or will production ramp up on a global scale to meet demand, in a way that will make all of these discussions moot within 5 years.",

If it's playing an integral role in keeping a government/country secure and functioning it should be easy to source production internally if necessary. Italy is in the top ten of countries that can produce planes and that's directly to support their military efforts (this may be outdated, I was looking at the stats in March).When wars happen, countries generally strive towards socialism - militaries are \"socialist\" (heavily funded and controlled by the government), ownership of infrastructure becomes more and more important too there are examples of this from the past like kindertransport).",

If there was patent infringement, it's not like it matters. There is no global patent police that has jurisdiction.It takes years and billions of dollars to build these factories. The U.S. tech sector could eventually catch up if they're inclined to do so, with impending Chinese invasion of Taiwan awaiting. TSMC obviously doesn't want the U.S. to become independent on their chip production because it would lessen the reliance U.S. companies have on them. If the U.S. does not have a reliance on Taiwan, there is no incentive for the U.S. to protect them from invasion.",

The way I see it, the chip production (and the hardware production) in Asia has been long preferred by giants within the industry like Apple, I thought it was only because the cheap labor force. I wonder how competitive would the American chips will be in retail price and I hope USA does not abandon the people of Taiwan if they succeed to rebuild the national chip industry.",

If a small island like Taiwan was able achieve such economic miracle decades ago then the USA should be capable of rebuilding it's semiconductor industry. Saying that this is \"doomed to fail\" sounds way too pessimistic. Perhaps the US chip manufacturers will have to outsource their production facilities in Mexico or Costa Rica, because of the cheap labor.The main problem here is the US government. You can't just throw 52 billion dollars at the US companies and expect fast results.There will be semiconductor shortages for sure and expects all electronics to become way more expensive in 2023.",

Despite what China's Leaders say/think about the matter for the foreseeable future Taiwan is NOT part of China and will remain so. Someday that may change but won't be anytime soon.China has ZERO advanced node chip making capabilities, their 'bleeding edge' is the 7nm node and even there it is problematic for them because China has never had access to the still by any standard fairly advanced lithography equipment needed to improve their yields. Smaller than 7nm is out of the question for them and with the chip technology embargo in-place even the 7nm node may no longer be possible for the (yes, 'the' as in their only one that was capable of 7nm) Chinese Foundry to use~~ Silicon Valley does not have to 'catch up'. Why? Simple: Foundries like TSMC et al are not the ones who are designing the chips and the basic processes used to make them. Companies like Micron, Cisco, Broadcom, AMD, nVidia, etc design them. Recently even Intel has shifted production of some chips to TSMC.Foundries are given the chip designs by their customers who work with the foundries to implement their designs into chips using whatever process node they want to use that the foundry can provide. Guess where most of the actual design work for leading/bleeding-edge chips is done - the US, Europe and Japan. Not Taiwan (and certainly not China).~~ Manufacturing cost is a different story. All aspects of chip making is heavily automated as there is no other way to do it so that bit is out of the picture. Oh, and just *where* is the equipment made? All advanced process equipment is designed & made in, you guessed it - the US, Europe, and Japan. Now, yes Taiwan does have lower labor costs but that is their only advantage.~~ Hardware Patents - again, most are held by US, European and Japanese owned companies with #1 on that list being the EUV lithography systems. Now Process Patents - that's a different story. Process Patents are a Foundry's highly optimized Secret Sauce but if need be there are always ways around that with the most obvious being Licensing. Barring that, just do things in a significantly different way. Ya know, like Intel, GF & Samsung have done with their Foundries. The whole point of TSMC opening a Foundry in the US is simply to have a long-term safe place to operate that is (mostly) free of major political unrest with zero chance of China causing problems.",
