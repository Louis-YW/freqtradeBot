Trading and other high-risk activities shouldn't be taken as a means of making passive income,  since there is no consistency in its inflow of cash/ profits,  so being subjected to indie pressure could aid the individual to make poor judgements.",

These trades you take don’t make sense they are more revenge trading. And what normally happens you blow your entire account.Pretty sure this happened to most traders in their early career and you need to control emotions and not let one trade spiral into a loss which ends up blowing your entire account.",

However, many novice traders think that trading is the fastest way to double the money and open a buy position because they see that there is a panic, the price will fall quickly and improve quickly too but it turns out they are wrong because the panic lasted quite a long time and the decline was very deep, while he need money fast and the next step is to sell with the condition that the asset has fallen quite deeply. The lesson is don't think of doubling money in trading because of urgent need because it's stupid.",

Yes, if you're aware of cutting loss and you're also setting it, that means that you're not letting it go into further losses and that makes you also control your emotions. You won't just let it continue to drop as low as it can when you're an active trader.",

For instance, if I want to buy a goods and it costs let say $50 and I have that money.  I would not be comfortable to use the money for the goods, rather I'll first try and trade with the money and have some dollars extra before I use the $50.
