I really feel like this is a discussion we should having now rather than latter.",

For signed integers yes; but not unsigned because it is only whole numbers, not negatives ones.That bug wouldn't effect Bitcoin right?",

If it's released in 2075 with a 15 year wait to be enforced then you still have another 16 years for people to stop running old clients.

Perhaps in the future there will have to be a mandatory hard fork that makes the hashing algo more difficult, updates the time to 64 bits over 32 bits, along with other things that may come up.Question is, is a hard fork ethical? From a philosophical view, is it still Bitcoin at that point?Quote from: DaveF on November 11, 2022, 12:22:06 PMQuote from: ETFbitcoin on November 11, 2022, 12:03:35 PMI disagree, year 2106 is 84 years eight from now and most of us won't live until then (unless live expectancy significant improved).

And if you are running, what would be 30+ year old software at that point you get to upgrade.-DaveYeah that's a good idea!Having a waiting period of X amount of years would prove the code to be genuine and battle tested. I would suggest having the code updated in perhaps 2057 with mandatory upgrade by 2107 so that 50 years prior (2009-2057) Bitcoin was tested and we trust it, so in theory, if this fork also holds up for 50 years it could also be considered as a worthy.In addition, I believe virtually everyone will be on the updated version after 50 years and that their computer's OS won't even be able to install the original Bitcoin Core v0.1. After thinking everything through, this really is the smallest problem Bitcoin really needs to overcome.Mod note: Consecutive posts merged",

On top of what DaveF said regarding scheduled changes, I will add that we can pack both hard forks into one; ECDLP will be undoubtedly solved at some point in the future (likely before 2106), so we could hard fork it once, and add both a quantum resistant algorithm and switch to 8 byte timestamps.",
