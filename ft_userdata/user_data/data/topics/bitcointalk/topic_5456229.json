I want your adviceSincerely if you ask me, there are many thing to give ones spouse on a very special day like a wedding day but bitcoin is certainly the least of them. If I may ask does your wife know about Bitcoin? Does she know to trade or store Bitcoin? What does she know about the safest bitcoin wallet? Women treasures physical gifts a lot and there's no better time to wow her than your wedding day or night. My advice for you is to look for something lovely and tangible and present to your wife based on your financial strength and the bitcoin gift can come later.",

Even worst, Bitcoin is illegal in your country, your wife might tell to her friend or her family and force you to stop invest in Bitcoin, what do you think?",

I want your adviceI don't want to rain your parade, OP but considering that you mentioned that Bitcoin is illegal in your country, you're just asking for a knock on the door from legal authorities. I assume you're from Bangladesh based on your post history? You could either just do it privately  or don't do it at all.  I understand that you want to give your wife the best present as much as possible, but there's plenty of ways to do it sweetly and nicely. You never want to ruin your honeymoon or at least be paranoid about it.",

Will it look fancy or appreciative? because we know that women like something everyone will see and admire so that they will be happy, but nevertheless, if you can guide her through the Bitcoin process and tell her some good news about Bitcoin and its value, I am sure she will appreciate your gift.",

Should I gift bitcoin to my wife?If I am not wrong, in most countries, by laws, all assets two couples have during their marriage period are considered as co-owned by wife and husband.I know that you want to make your wife happy but is it necessary that bitcoin you have will be considered as co-owned by your wife if you buy it after your wedding, with a valid marriage certificate.In addition, it is risky if your wife does not know about Bitcoin, steps to keep it safe. You can teach your wife but probably she will have less experience than you and worse practice than you.Lastly, it is not her key, not her bitcoin. You create that wallet, give it as a gift to your wife but you know the wallet private key and you can get it back anytime.",

A relationship between wife and husband is something very intimate which isn't from the business of other people. To give a Bitcoin gift to your wife might have a personal important meaning for you and to receive that gift might have an important meaning for your wife as well that most of us who are outside couldn't understand exactly. That is a matter of feeling. If you feel like you should gift her, do this. Just have self-confidence to make your choice based on what you think you should do and not on what other people think. After all, a marriage gets annoying and messy when the couple can't decide things by themselves and start taking the advices of others in consideration frequently.",

You might make it worse and depends on how your wife sees it as an investment or an asset. You didn’t mention any views of your wife Edith, so it might not be as well coming as what we might expect.Maybe invest your money from your bitcoin to something that is memorable to you and your wife. That would be a better wedding gift than bitcoin itself.",

There’s a lot of thread that same like this about buying Bitcoin or etc. while Bitcoin is illegal to your country.Seriously, you are giving your wife a gift that is illegal? You are putting her life at especially if she doesn’t know that she is committing a crime by accepting your gift. Just gave her a good life and that will make here happy for the rest of your life. Don’t make her life complicated and don’t involve her on your sneaky investment. I will support you on gifting Bitcoin if it’s legal. Think logically.",

You have said that bitcoin is not an illegal asset in your country, so you will definitely be in trouble if you force yourself to give bitcoin for him openly. You have to take a different approach, of course you can give your wife bitcoins privately without being known by many people.But to be honest, I don't know what's your point in giving him bitcoin?",

Unless you already have taught her about it so yep she will like it. In my experience, girls prefer the effort even if it's a small thing so know what they like. My best advice, buy something that will make her look good, something shiny like earrings and a necklace.  It's what they talk about when they gather with their friends and not BTC.",

I want your adviceI mean you getting married and all of your investment will be one with the investments of your wife so I guess no need to give it to him since she owns it as well already or maybe you could just teach him about Bitcoin so that he has the idea that you already own Bitcoin and it's her Bitcoin as well.It was a great wedding gift I think you could send your Bitcoin to your friends or family wedding I think, or just get them a whole wallet since most of them probably doesnt know Bitcoin or doesnt have a Bitcoin wallet. You could give them the whole wallet and with that, they might get interested in Bitcoin and probably become an investor in the future because of your gift also it would help them have a good mindset on investment and saving.Also, you might get in trouble since you mention Bitcoin is not legal in your country, in my opinion, you shouldn't teach someone to invest in Bitcoin or buy Bitcoin if it wasn't in first play legal your just putting them in trouble in the long run.",

Tough question to answer if you ask me. While there are wives who are supportive of their husband's investments, you might want to consider their stance before tying the knot.My honest advice is to keep collecting bitcoin like the rest of your country members are doing discreetly and wait for the country's stance to change. Only then there is a chance that your upcoming spouse might be willing to accept it.",
