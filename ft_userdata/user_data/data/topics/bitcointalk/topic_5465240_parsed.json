What about shipment fee and from where you're shipping?There is a small difference which makes it higher in the reselling price. OP is offering a \"shadowless\" charizard - these are even rarer then the ones that were listed on ur pricecharting-list.Looked thru that list and the highest one which was sold for 1.5k $ wasn't one that is listed in this thread.  This list should fit better:https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-base-set/charizard-shadowless-4?q=charizard+shadowless",

What about shipment fee and from where you're shipping?Hi,No, it’s not that card. For charizards from 1999 we have these main 3 versions: 1st edition, shadowless and unlimited. That link you showed is the unlimited version (cheapest one).The one I’m selling is the shadowless version in mint condition PSA 9, here it is:https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-base-set/charizard-shadowless-4Also if you want to understand the differences between the versions:https://sellpoke.com/value-of-old-charizard-pokemon-card/Do a CTRL+F there and search for “difference between 1st edition, shadowless, and shadow”, they explain the differences.Also for the shipping, it is about $100 (insured and assuming you’re in US) and the card is shipped from Switzerland",
