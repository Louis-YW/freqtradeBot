  "content": "With the recent update, SEC's seems to be complicating things in the crypto world. It seems that Staking is also at high risk of getting overruled by the SEC judgment after they have taken down Kraken Staking business and stopped all its operation. Obviously if it was done for one exchanger then it would be followed for most of them in the long run and thus we won't be able to do the Staking. The Plot: It seems that SEC is slowly injecting hard rules for the centralized market. First they imposed strict KYC ruling on the exchangers. Then they started with the strict accounting data of them and in turn users tax info. By the time it gets fully operational now they have started banning the Stake operations. Thus, we will be always at high risk of loosing our funds if we have them staked in \"Custodial Wallets\" or simply on an exchanger. However, it means only one thing for us and that was the main goal of crypto in the first place: Be your own bank. Does this mean we will have to stop the staking operations?Apparently we do not need to go that far. For example, we can always do the staking using Non custodial wallets or wallets whose private keys are in our own hands. The article that I have quoted suggest ETH staking which can be performed right from your wallet. You can easily have this done with wallets that allow such staking OR simply merging yourself with the staking pools. Though SEC is performing their devil part here, we should not be afraid of their actions. They can only thrive their rules when we are in the centralized market. They can not enter their jurisdiction into the decentralized market. QuoteBalancing Regulation and Innovation in the Crypto World: Staking at the CrossroadsStaking, the act of retaining a specific amount of a particular cryptocurrency in a wallet and taking part in the validation of transactions on the network, is one of the most discussed topics in the digital asset world today. And for good reason. Staking has been promoted as the answer to several challenges facing the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including scalability, decentralization, and security.But just as staking was beginning to gain momentum, the threat of overregulation rears its ugly head. The SEC’s recent action against staking services has once again spotlighted the issue of regulation versus innovation. While regulation is vital for stability and security, excessive regulation can hinder innovation and curb the potential for future growth.It’s a tricky balance, but one that the SEC seems to have gotten wrong with their latest crackdown on Kraken’s staking program. This heavy-handed approach only serves to drive innovation offshore to less regulated regions, where these opportunities will be accessible. And who suffers the most from this? The American people are being deprived of the benefits of a thriving crypto ecosystem.The truth is, staking is a vital piece in the puzzle of the future of the crypto world. The rewards of staking, such as increased security, decentralization, and profitability, make it an important tool for building a better, more secure, inclusive, and profitable crypto ecosystem. But overregulation threatens to disrupt all of that.So, what can we do about it? Well, we can start by recognizing the importance of staking and speaking out against overregulation. We need to make our voices heard and let the powers that be know that staking is here to stay and an essential part of the future of the crypto world.Don’t be discouraged by the SEC’s latest move. Get involved in staking and reap the rewards for yourself. And who knows, you might even help shape the future of crypto in the process. Staking with a centralized exchange (CEX) or custodial service may seem like the convenient choice, but why trust a CEX with your precious assets when you can be the master of your own assets with noncustodial solutions? That’s right, with wallets and staking pools, you can stake your ethereum (ETH) or other cryptocurrencies without relying on a custodial service or exchange.Stiffing the Staker: The SEC's Latest Crackdown on Crypto Innovation",

      "body": "Before this was announced I was looking into the UK's regulations on exchanges (I wanted to invest in concentrated liquidity pools) and found that while there's a lot of restrictions on what you can do as a centralised exchange, there's NONE on dexes. I viewed this as quite positive news at the time and I'm not sure how positive it is now because it does mean that if you know what you're doing, you can receive good rewards from it and if you don't then you should maybe just speculate and hold the asset or do safer staking (like the one you suggested from the wallet).Cex staking seemed like an opt-in procedure so I don't know whether it made sense to come after that - the \"investment pools\" exchanges like bybit and binance operate though I'd expect to be next. There's not really much education on what to expect from either afaik (although I have barely looked into them - particularly coinbase eth).",

Though we had various occurrences over the time in regards with exchangers getting hacked, money along with the KYC details getting stolen they never learn about it. Definitely SEC putting restrictions on staking can cause the crowd to move towards the options that are mentioned in the OP. Like staking Pools, staking from wallets. It may lead to development of more decentralised pools sooner or later. Because not every coin is capable of PoW mechanism. Even coin like ETH moved to PoS thus making larger change in the way crypto works.",

I wonder why they are not asking Coinbase to help them win the case as coinbase promised to fight against SEC if they are targetted. I think the crypto exchanges should unite to fight against SEC otherwise it's a loss of one may cause panic just as it did last week.I can't help thinking centralized exchanges are in cahoots with SEC's crackdown and operation chokepoint as they just give up that quickly. Imagine a business paying $30M all for that? Where do you think will he get that money?  Are the ETH staking rewards to be handed over to SEC or are they just split 50% for SEC and 50% for Kraken?",

So what SEC does is.. right, for a change. I mostly agree but I think that stable cryptocurrencies also contributed a big deal to expanding the crypto ecosystem as well. Having an option to hedge part of your Bitcoin by paring it in stable cryptocurrencies was certainly something that was missing until the first reliable options came out. It also made taxation less complicated for the users since they didn't have to calculate exchange rates between Bitcoin and another volatile cryptocurrency. You could have sold for USD as well of course, but that comes with the hassle of having to wait until the USD arrive in your bank account. Now whether or not someone likes and uses stable currencies they still contributed a lot to the overall crypto market I guess. But yes it did add another risk vector to the system eventually. However, I don't expect the SEC to shut down those stable currencies because if they deem it a security and the issue is just that it wasn't registered as such, isn't the most likely turn of events that Binance or Paxus registers it as such and perhaps pays a fine? If it is backed as those reports state by 100% US Treasury Debt and Bills, what reason would the SEC have to deny attempts to get it registered and just operate it as a security?",

If they engage in a competition of who is paying more for nothing, it could have ended in another disaster like FTX at some point. Anyway, I agree that decentralized solutions are the way to go anyway for those who are interested in parking their crypto in exchange for an interest rate. The only problem I see with non custodial staking is that it will lead to centralization over time or not? Won't the rich get richer and gain increasing network dominance? If those who stake the most also re-stake their gains, they'll start dominating the network. It shouldn't be too much of a problem as that also increases their skin in the game, but centralization is still one of the results.

Since the transaction costs are still relatively high, I don't know how those pools would be best handled, but anyway. In a centralized interface when we talk about exchanges offering stable coin staking, the money is just coming from the exchange itself. In a decentralized interface we are talking about algorithmic stable coins I suppose, but I have never really looked into them or used them. I just came across some theories once where attacks on algorithmic stable coins were discussed. As soon as you want stable coins to be backed with fiat currencies, the risk for those offerings to get shut down is very real as we have now just seen. However, if those companies like Coinbase have the required licenses and can prove that stable coins are backed by \"safe\" assets, I don't get why they would make a difference between a bank offering interest rates on deposits and registered crypto exchanges. Sure auditing requirements would perhaps have to be adjusted, but as long as there is sufficient backing of pegged cryptocurrencies, why shut the offerings down?",
