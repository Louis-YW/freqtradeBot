It's the oldest and biggest crypto space although it will be a bit difficult if you do not have BTC as a payment option which I guess you don't. But in any case, a professional touch and advertising strategy may increase your chance.Feel free to reach me if you are looking for such person.

We are excited to see the addition of new games in the future. However, I strongly suggest that your smart contracts undergo auditing to ensure that there are no malicious codes present.

Just use metamask and gambling can be done easily. Supports more than one network so there will be many choices as well as several other ERC-20 tokens.Using Web3 also makes withdrawing winnings easier and can be done instantly, because it uses smart contracts and goes directly to the wallet safely. A good gambling platform with Web3 support like this should get more exposure. I hope the developers give a good space to be able to promote this moon win palftrom so that it is better known and can build a brand and better connections.",

The web3 gambling platforms are actively developing now and yours looks attractive, but the rates in eth, as always, depend on the cost of the gas network, besides, your FAQ states that the bet is accepted only if there are enough funds in the contract, it would not be bad to have some banner indicating the current bankroll. The most suitable for betting from the point of view of the minimum balance will be BNB, Matic and Tether, since in ETH, judging by the current bets, the minimum is ~ $43",

Unfortunately, there's no smart contracts in Bitcoin Network and the only option for now is to have some backend to accept and play in BTC, there are some centralized options to play Dice on the market.We want to stay fully decentralized with all the logic on smart contracts, currently I consider sharing source code of the front-end, so people may run it locally to play, if some connection issues to the website happen.Quote from: Newlifebtc on March 13, 2023, 10:16:37 PMQuote from: Gianluca95 on March 13, 2023, 09:13:57 PMWelcome to bitcointalk.org !It seems to be a nice platform, I've seen your site and how it works.
