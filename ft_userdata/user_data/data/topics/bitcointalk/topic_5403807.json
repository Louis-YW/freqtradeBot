  "content": "I'm about to make a 10K purchase of Bitcoin via bank transfer on Coinbase. What is the difference in fees between Coinbase and Coinbase Pro? Is Coinbase Pro significantly cheaper?Is it worth the trouble to open a Coinbase Pro account just for this purchase?* If so, how much would I be saving in dollars and cents?I don't care about trading. I only want a simple breakdown of the difference in costs between buying Bitcoin on Coinbase with fiat currency vs. buying it on Coinbase Pro. I can't seem to find this info anywhere on the internet (everyone only talks about \"trading\" costs, not PURCHASE costs).  Thanks*I'm aware that Coinbase Pro will be discontinued at the end of the year",

Thanks, I suspected this. Since I'm lazy, I'll probably just hold my nose and buy through Coinbase. I don't want to go through all the verification, I.D., and waiting bs that I went through the first time around in 2017, especially when I'm not even sure the savings, if any, will be worth it, and Coinbase Pro is slated to disappear by the end of the year, anyway.",

So basically they have same price but you can purchase cheaper on coinbase pro by doing a limit order and wait for your order to be filled unlike the normal coinbase version which you can just market order that gives you no choice to choose your preferred price. Use coinbase pro if you are willing to wait  for buying at your preferred price.",
