As you mentioned, we've only been in bear season for a year, which means that we will have to wait another three years before we see bull season again. So for 2023, I still believe that the market cannot recover regardless of whether the economy in 2023 will get better or continue to deteriorate.",

To think that we will be lower is too bearish in my opinion and it would be the worst cycle since the creation of bitcoin, although it is not impossible. But no one should expect great joy. Maybe we will go up to the 30-40,000 USD area and then back down to 25,000 or so, then back up again and so on. We will not beat the highs of this cycle until the next cycle. In other words, I only expect a bull market as such after the next halving, although I would like to be wrong. Let it start today, as far as I am concerned.",

I don't think just because the market pumps a bit which of cause as I mentioned earlier $25k was the highest BTC price has gone since its drop to $17k, thinking a Bull run is eminent in the near weeks or months isn't likely. I think the market will see its share of accumulation before a proper bull market again considering the usual market circle.",

Other altcoins that do not have strong support will lose their position in the market and investors will leave the altcoin because the altcoin is no longer profitable for investors.3. I don't think so but a lot of positive news about bitcoin will give bitcoin stronger support in the market and people will certainly want to own bitcoin so which will trigger an upward price movement.4. Maybe now there is something to do with global inflation, where people today need more fiat to buy their needs and sell their investments.Don't worry about the bull market because it will come again. You need to prepare yourself by having more bitcoins than now so you can sell them at the highest price.",

Generally, I think that it's going to range between $18.000 and $20.000.2)Altcoins have existed since the dawn of cryptocurrencies. While some may slowly disappear, see Terra, for instance, they'll always co-exist because they are serving other purposes and are vital for the future of cryptocurrencies.3)Maybe, but I don't believe in Bitcoin's mass adoption as a currency or legal tender.4) We're going through a recession and a war. The threat of a nuclear launch is higher than in the Cold War. The current situation is not supportive of much economic growth. The stock market isn't performing well either. Bitcoin is more of an asset than a currency; thus, it's also massively affected.",

Once the bull market begin, we should aim for the new ATH so technically the price will not be on the same level.2. BCH will stay, but other altcoins will surely be affected by the dominance of Bitcoin and other top altcoins.3. NO. Bull market already happened before even if there’s no mass adoption.

Global crisis really affects cryptomarket, there’s a lot of crisis we are experiencing right now and I think cryptomarket will stay on this level until we see good recovery of most of the countries.",

As you mentioned, we've only been in bear season for a year, which means that we will have to wait another three years before we see bull season again. So for 2023, I still believe that the market cannot recover regardless of whether the economy in 2023 will get better or continue to deteriorate. It all depends on the present economic state that time as positive economic state will also make a positive and bullish market. But whatever it is, it’s better not to expect much so you won’t get frustrated later on. Just stay being positive and always take advantage on the opportunities the market gives. That way, you will never  have to complicate things and you won’t have to risk things at a loss. Just trust the process and I know the market  will be bullish again in time, the problem is we don’t know its certain time so patience is the best virtue here.",

Bitcoin will bottom when there is clear evidence that inflation is under control and we won’t get any more rate hikes. Currently inflation is still increasing MoM and the yields are rising as a result. This is not bullish. We need some major indicator such as loss of jobs which means that inflation is definitely topped and means fed will make rate cuts in the near future. No idea how far away that is however.",
