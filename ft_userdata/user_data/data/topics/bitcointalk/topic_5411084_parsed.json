Hundred dollar bills are the most common outside the US. If they are invalidated, it will instantly undermine the financial strength of many states. Apparently, US-friendly states in this case will be provided with an approximately equivalent replacement with either digital currencies or new samples of one hundred dollar bills. This is a very interesting initiative. However, on the other hand, this will mean that the United States should not be trusted in the matter of finances.",

But this is still difficult to implement. Because there are still many people who do not understand digital money, nor how to use it. Yes, gradually it can be implemented.If this works, of course it is very profitable for small countries, because they can control how much a country prints money in each year. In the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944, 44 countries stipulate that the printing of paper money must be guaranteed gold equivalent to the value of the paper currency being printed, or the so-called gold foreign exchange reserves and gold standard.Then with the existence of digital money that is indeed transparent, the superpowers cannot print money above the gold foreign exchange standard because it violates the agreement.",

Users of cryptocurrencies can rejoice. It will be challenging to stop the use of existing currency; only notes that reach the bank can be invalidated. Those who own it won't want to release it because it will lose all of its worth after that. This can also lessen corruption in nations that utilize the US dollar as their primary currency and are branded with the corruption stigma.",

Putin keeps repeating in his speech about multi polar ruling, i think what they want is that US rules the west and east stays east which the USD reserve stays in US soil and in Europe will be somehow EUR or probably the Ruble and an then in the Far east will be Chinese Yuan (RMB).i have not read the news about $100 circulation removal, no link provided by OP.

A number of studies, discussions, and researches must have already been done in relation to the plan of replacing hard cash with digital currencies. Of course, it wouldn't be a quick process. Everything will be gradual. It might even take decades before cold cash will be totally wiped out of circulation. As for the hundred-dollar bill, this has also been talked about for years now. So far, the bill is still in circulation. New ones are still issued. I don't know if it's timely to stop its issuance knowing that money's value is continuously falling. Here in my country, what used to be a bill is now a coin. This conversion in form is representative of how low its purchasing power has fallen.",
