  "content": "UTXO consolidation has a lot of benefits for bitcoin users. It gives them a decreased number of inputs during transactions after consolidating many transactions outputs into one, provides low transaction fees and more privacy. It also makes the user to manage their portfolio simply. Between BTC segregated witness (segwit) starting with bc1q and BTC tap root that starts with bc1p; For instance, when sending transaction to many addresses at a time, segwit is the best to use for reduced transaction fees and when sending from many addresses to one address tap root is the best to use. My question now is, when sending does the sender and the receiver have to use the same address in order to achieve the reduced transaction fee?",

With consolidating your UTXOs when the fees are low, you can make your next transactions cheaper, but you don't increase your privacy and you may even decrease your privacy. Take note that with using multiple UTXOs in the same transaction, everyone can conclude they are owned by the same person and that may harm your privacy.

If the transaction input will be more, use pay-to-taproot to send. If the outputs will be more, you can use segwit version 0 for sending.If you want to compare the input and output, you can use this bitcoin transaction virtual size calculator: https://bitcoinops.org/en/tools/calc-size/",

Both the segwit versions 0 (bc1q) and version 1(bc1p) actually saves or reduce transaction fee by just moving the witness data or signature data separately there by reducing the the weight of the transaction and not the size. The reduction of fees then occurs since the fee rate is now calculated based on virtual size (weight). But in general the saving of fees actually comes from the input address, because the outputs address (both old legacy and the segwit) have just 3vbytes difference while the inputs differs is around 80vbytes.

But difference of each possible combination is negligible and IMO you better use your effort to check mempool condition before determining TX fee rate for transaction you're going to make.Agreed, taproot inputs are much smaller than SegWit inputs but the as for the outputs then Segwit is better, if is even a case of 1-input and many outputs then SegWit version 0 edges the version 1",

You can edit it after sending too but only to \"bump\" up the fee, not to reduce it.Since you are consolidating, you should be looking to reduce the fee and not to increase it. You are sending to yourself, so just border around the minimum feerate at the time.- Jay -",

Yes it is possible but it depends on the wallet you’re using, my guess is currently almost all HD wallets allow customization of transactions fee and as such you can edit it. But before doing that you need to check the mempool for fees and if the transaction fee is quite high I.e the pool is congested then it is best to leave the consolidation till it goes down. Just as un_rank said you can set the fee low and wait but if you grow impatient then you can bump it using either RBF method or CPFP.
