  "content": "I don’t know if this is the appropriate section to talk about this, but am sure the post will also be useful to be newbie’s in the forum here. Am sure scammers are also on the forum here which are looking for every opportunity just to steal from us, the forum is doing everything possible to fight scammers here, and all the high rank members are trying their possible best. I just noticed something recently and I decided to share it here and  am sure lot’s of people will really benefit from it. After creating forum account here, some of us do make mistake of leaving our email public, some people don’t really know about this so after creating account, they just start using it without changing email visibility to private. Some people’s email address is not properly protected so immediately scammers have access to your email address, they can easily compromise your email address and they will compromise everything linked to the email address including your forum account, and you will be losing your account to scammer. Just imagine scammer using your account for illegal things, they are spoiling your reputation on the forum here and some might endup selling the account to other people. I think it’s better we all take preventive measures so that we won’t fall victim . Am sure some people don’t know about how to hide email address from public, I will be providing short steps on how to do that so that we will all be free from hackers. Click on Account related settings.You will see(Hide email address from public?), click on the box at the front.",

I find this tutorial useful because I have been exposed to diverse security tips like using different emails for a different purposes. This is because privacy is key to avoiding scammers and fraud. This might make one have many email accounts that will be very difficult to maintain. Hence, it might not be out of place to keep a record of these emails to facilitate easy access.
