For me, being reliable can mean that we can easily need the money when we need it and that is something Bitcoin can offer but not in the banks because often times they can lock up/ freeze our accounts or do some other alibi's when we are about to withdraw money. Risk is everywhere or on anything. Yes BTC is is risky due to its volatile state but the point is, its value can recover and it can even rise more. Banks or banks money (fiat) are much stable but there are inflations which can lessen the value of our fiat money. This can only be an added risk to what I said earlier about banks.",

We all love bitcoin here! But that does not mean we will criticize the banking system and find flaws in it or even think about replacing the banking system. That should not be the case! Bitcoin can not challenge the retail banking segment in terms of speed and convenience. It can only challenge it in terms of anonymity. If you want to talk about speed and fees, bitcoin can only challenge international settlements. The entire banking system can't be replaced!Bitcoin is convenient for some and banking is convenient for some! They must not be compared because they are structurally different. If you send money to an incorrect account by mistake - you may get it back in the centralized banking system, but in bitcoin, there's no way!

A carrier pigeon? Faster than.. A message in a bottle? Anyone who understands Bitcoin and the blockchain couldn't possibly compare them to a well functioning banking system that is able to deliver instant money between accounts. Admittedly some countries are way behind when it comes to instant transfers between people's accounts, but other places like Europe have had this functionality for over a decade already. The existing banking network is much more efficient on most counts, but Bitcoin does have it's benefits - primarily sitting outside government interference and it is reasonably good for transporting medium to large size sums across borders avoiding unnecessary fees.",

The reason why Bitcoin was created is to give users the freedom from centralized power aka the government and everything about regulations smells government so I don't see how regulation will work here. The only projects that can be regulated in crypto space are the likes of XRP and other centralized projects including crypto exchanges.",

It is trustworthy because it is decentralized and does not require third-party approval before sending or receiving funds over the internet. We can say that it is safe to use for everyone.The nature of the coin's volatility is the second case. If I have a coin and it falls below the amount I left it the day before, I will be disappointed that I have lost some money; can this be called reliable again? So people's perspectives and approaches to it differ; after all, it is an alternative to save money to using the centralized means of saving money in fiat.",

I would say yes, it's fast but not faster, especially when the user knows well about the mempool and uses a higher gas fee for the transactions while sending the BTC to an external wallet. The transaction should be completed in about 10 minutes, so it's still reasonable. While sending within the same wallet could be way faster.Now, it depends on what you are comparing it with, if it's fiat banking within the same country, then they are faster than Bitcoin, unless for the Swift Wire Transfer. Aside from banks, online payment systems' transfers are done instantly, not in minutes.Furthermore, the reliability of Bitcoin is being put into doubt these days because hacking is more pronounced, and even wallet companies and exchanges are less trusted these days.",
