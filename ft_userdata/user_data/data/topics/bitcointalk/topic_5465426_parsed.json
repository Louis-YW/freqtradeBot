Then, I wonder I need to share this question with you so I can find the list of corrupt politicians and honest politicians. I know most of the politicians are corrupt but some politicians are honest.",

Or you can start by naming those you know by yourself if you want to make such list but honestly it is not worth it. What criteria would you use to make such list? If you would start from your country then it can be discussed.",

How do we know the honest and corrupt politicians. for me, politics is a dirty game and I can tell you here that, no politician is honest. in one way or the other, they have make some policies that have effected the poor. but remember, the one you think that's honest may be bad to someone else, and the one that's corrupt may be good to someone else also.for me, we don't have a honest politicians.",

Transparency, accountability, and public service are vital components of trustworthy politics. While creating a definitive list may be challenging due to differing perspectives, it's important for the people to engage in informed discussions about the actions and policies of their elected officials. Striving for more transparency and holding politicians accountable will help improve the integrity of political systems worldwide.",

Then, I wonder I need to share this question with you so I can find the list of corrupt politicians and honest politicians. I know most of the politicians are corrupt but some politicians are honest.AFAIK, there are NGOs that track these records and have their stats and index on who are the most and least corrupt politicians. But one thing is for sure with this, if a country is progressive, there are certainly good law makers and politicians that can be found there. In my country, the Philippines, it's a total disaster. It's like corrupt politicians are everywhere, coming from local positions up to the national position and I wouldn't name names. It's like that the policies they make are only for them and rich folks that they're tied up with. I still believe that there are few honest and real public servants but they're not taking the spot light because each politician here is thinking that a good person is always a candidate that they'll be against with in the future elections.",
