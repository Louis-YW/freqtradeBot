      "body": "Yes, I believe, but that can't work with just having a positive mindset. The first is to have a positive mindset, followed by working towards achieving the goals that come with the positive mindset. because believing that you can do it alone doesn't get things done, but working towards making those beliefs come true Also, having the mindset that it will work is what makes it work.Let's say, for instance, that if you have the mindset that you can make it through school work with a good grade, you have conceived that in your mind, which is good, sitting at home doing nothing, not reading, and not following up on the necessary things needed for you to be able to achieve that goal will lead you to failure because at the end of the day, your result and what you have in mind won't be the same. For you to achieve those grades, you need to sacrifice your time and do things that are actually needed to be done, and then keep the dream alive by having that positive mindset that it's going to happen. That belief should be what encourages and motivates you to work hard.",

For you, do you believe you can have anything you want, starting with a positive attitude?I believe it's true, but you have to show working after telling yourself you can achieve anything in this world. For instance, if you want to have a good knowledge of how Bitcoin works you don't need to stay idle to achieve it or hope to know how Bitcoin works through social media influencers you will fail with this strategy. You have to make a sacrifice by reading Bitcoin whitepaper and books about Bitcoin too. With this step, you can understand how Bitcoin works.",

I've always believed having a positive attitude is important, but had trouble focusing on results and deadlines. For you, do you believe you can have literally anything you want, starting with a positive attitude?\"You can have anything\" could mean there is no limit to things you can have, but this isn't true without relying on the CREATOR of the Universe who is the source of anything in existence and can give it to those who rely on him. Your belief has to based on the truth that the CREATOR can give you anything good you ask, if you deserve it. People are heavily limited on their own... being positive without relying on the CREATOR won't remove the limit.. Better still, humans don't have the power to do or have anything they want on their own. It comes from the CREATOR. If you are able to have or do something \"great\" it could be the limit of what you can have or do. That doesn't mean you can go beyond your limit to have or do something greater. But with the CREATOR, the limit (depending on your faith) is removed.",

I've always believed having a positive attitude is important, but had trouble focusing on results and deadlines. For you, do you believe you can have literally anything you want, starting with a positive attitude?I believe this is true. But there are other factors.An example of another great factor is combining your faith and God's faith. Jesus said, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”Remember, Saint Paul said, \"Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.\" The Word of Christ is the Bible.",

Finally, trusting in the Creator should pave the way for creating good possibilities through proper Action planning An important thing in different mediums is that nothing can be achieved without effort, that's why it is important to try. Creator said that whoever does not want to change himself, the creator will not change him.So reality is an important matter and positively important matter.",

It's not about wanting the impossible, but about believing in your potential and being willing to work for it.So, yes, having a positive attitude and belief in yourself can open doors to what you desire.

Yeah although I was confused and understand it later on.This varies on everyone's belief. If it's about the thought that you can't have it then you easily give up and that's fine because not everything that we want to have on this life, we can't get as of the moment.But don't you forget that sometime in the future, when you work hard and suddenly make that belief alive again, that positive attitude is going to help you and give you a better perspective about life and achieving things.",
