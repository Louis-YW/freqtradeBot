  "content": "Bitcoin main purpose according to Satoshi himself, is as an alternative payment to fiat currency. But over the years bitcoin has grown in such a way that many have seen it’s potential of been a great investment asset. This could be deduced from some of the advantages of his below;1. Decentralization 2. Stores of value 3. Great Return on Investment 4. Fixed Number or Supply 5. Adoption rate. Due to all these advantages some  people have not only taken bitcoin as an investment asset but have generalized it to other cryptocurrencies as well. Some have thoughts that investing in these alternative coins are actually diversification of one’s portfolio. But is this really portfolio diversification? Diversification of portfolio can be termed the process by which investors, invest in different assets to mitigate a loss been encountered in a particular asset. Alternative cryptocurrencies cannot be regarded as diversification of portfolio because;1. Most of all the altcoins follow the same price trend as bitcoin, with just few going higher than it due to hype, which has made many to call them pump and dump coins. 2. Bitcoin is the only true decentralized cryptocurrency and as such eliminates the fear of centralization which is in many altcoins which could be use to manipulate its market. 3. Bitcoin supply limit is what makes it a store of value and also an hedge against inflation, giving it an edge ahead of other cryptocurrencies. With all these and more, and most importantly the fact that bitcoin price change is actually been followed by other cryptocurrency which are not secure, makes them more risky to be used as an investment asset. It will be better to look into other assets like stock, gold and real estate for an ideal portfolio diversification Aside bitcoin, treat alternative cryptocurrencies as pump and dump coins that they are. Note: I am not advising anyone on investment",

Example are people that invested at $50000. But bitcoin is still going above $50000 again. Even above $100000.",

Some will even give you a list of some altcoin that is worth investing in. Maybe they understand the sector more than me. But for me, investing in altcoin is very risky. I don't really have the proper risk management skill to handle the high rate of uncertainties that rules the altcoin sector. Apart from Bitcoin my best investment option will be real estate. So I will gladly diversify my investment by buying affordable lands and houses in my country than risk buying some altcoins.

And bitcoin is gradually becoming a currency that recovers easily from attacks by certain unfriendly firms or individuals. In recent times FUD has had little or no effect on its price. I can not guarantee that some altcoin has enough market cap to withstand minimal attacks. Most of these altcoins collapse immediately after a key player dumps them.",

Bitcoin goes up with hype too but a biggest difference between Bitcoin and altcoins is decentralization, from its network to developer and user communities. Altcoins are centralized so their core teams can abandon their projects which will become dead anytime.Quote2. Bitcoin is the only true decentralized cryptocurrency and as such eliminates the fear of centralization which is in many altcoins which could be use to manipulate its market.Bitcoin and altcoins are all can be manipulated by whales. They are not different and generally the total marketcap of cryptocurrency market is very small and easy to manipulate.Quote3. Bitcoin supply limit is what makes it a store of value and also an hedge against inflation, giving it an edge ahead of other cryptocurrencies. You're missing a point.Only a limited total supply does not create any value. You need examples?Please look at altcoins, more specifically Bitcoin forks.How many Bitcoin forks are there?You can create a new fork but I am sure, that new fork will have no value",

When I say \"easier\", I mean primarily those who invest money in altcoins, and it is mainly about the younger population who dreams of overnight success, many of whom are minors and may not even have a bank account.What makes cryptocurrencies attractive is the fact that you only need a smartphone+internet and some app to invest, which is much easier than buying physical gold or shares for which you still need a broker who will do it for you. If something is simple, accessible to most people and with the possibility of a possible big profit, then you don't have to wonder why it attracts so many people.Quote from: Findingnemo on July 26, 2023, 08:41:51 AMAs of today's price valuation, the market cap value of total crypto is 1.17 Trillion dollars but bitcoin only has 48% of the total share which is 560 billion so the remaining 50% is invested in the so-called altcoins. ~snip~Market cap does not represent investments, but only the possible value of coins that are often manipulated to make them look more attractive.

And you are right people are always looking for the next Bitcoin, next Ethereum, next Dogecoin so with less capital they can make millions which is somewhat similar to expect winning a lottery.Some people will learn that it is stupid to expect such returns or they will keep doing it so my point is it's our choice to decide where we want to stand.",

At whatever price point you buy Bitcoin it will always give you a high return if you have diamond hands. If you cannot hold and tend to panic when the market goes down then you should not invest in Bitcoin. Weak hands in any kind of investment would always suffer losses. There are other shitcoins that can give you 2x, 5x, 10x, or even 100x on your investment but they do perish fast and you could lose money, whereas if you keep on believing Bitcoin it will surely give you better returns than gold or property in the long run.",

I'm sure next cycle there will be altcoins that will make X100, while Bitcoin won't even remotely give that return. The question is to get which one right, knowing also that there will be many more than 100 altcoins that will go to 0 or lose more than 99% of value. Today I think it is more worthwhile to invest in Bitcoin for its intrinsic properties, which is something the OP points out, than for the security of a moderate return, not because it will give spectacular returns in the next cycles, no matter what some influencers want to sell us.",
