  "content": "In an interesting news today we have another winner who is going against the wild trading monopoly and applying for the ETF for the Bitcoin and Ether as well. This is happening in the Australia and Monochrome CEO Jeff Yew is the guy behind this success. Monochrome is also one of the highly reputed investment firm after the BlackRock. The partnering firm is Vasco. Monochrome has initiated their application already with Australian Security Exchange and they have way to go for the License. CEO of Monochrome is highly confident that it will help the natives to trade these two assets with full confidence as they get protected status just like trading the Traditional way. Quote“Through a Bitcoin ETF, it makes it possible for them to buy and use the asset class in however they see fit with the investment choices [and] in a regulated manner, and also operating within the regular regulatory perimeter.”With various financial institutes applying for the ETF, I think we have amazing days ahead in the future as many countries and regulatory bodies will finally accept the fate of Bitcoin ETF.QuoteAustralian-based crypto investment firm Monochrome Asset Management has updated its application to offer a spot Bitcoin  BTC $31,226 exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) through its partner Vasco Trustees. The ETF — Monochrome Bitcoin ETF — will be able to offer retail Australian investors direct exposure to Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), according to the firm’s July 14 announcement.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Monochrome CEO Jeff Yew explained that by obtaining a license, Australian retail investors would be exposed to Bitcoin within a formidable regulatory landscape:“So that is the benefit, I guess, compared to, say, unregulated exchanges where there’s no investor protection,” he added.Yew believes that if a Bitcoin ETF goes live on ASX, it will send a “clear signal” to traditional investors that the “unregulated Wild West is coming to an end” because their investments will be backed by a “familiar,” “structured” and “protected environment.”Vasco, its “Responsible Entity Partner,” is authorized under an Australian Financial Services Licence to offer retail investors regulated exposure to the cryptocurrency market, the firm stated.Spot Bitcoin ETF applications have been a focus point for the industry lately, particularly in the United States. In recent weeks, the industry has seen spot Bitcoin ETF filings from major financial firms, including Fidelity, Invesco, Wisdom Tree, Valkyrie and the $10 trillion asset management firm BlackRock.Reference: Monochrome revises filing for spot Bitcoin ETF at Aussie stock exchange",

Wait and don't feel like after such news, that application will be approved. The lastest won lawsuit of Ripple against SEC. that XRP is a commodity, not a security is a big win not only for Ripple but also for cryptocurrency communities.From that lawsuit, SEC. could not arbitrarily sue any cryptocurrency company and automatically win it. Same with Bitcoin Spot ETF applications, they will have to follow existing regulations to approve it. They are not powerful to drive most of cryptocurrency companies out of the USA.QuoteAnd if I'm not mistaken, there are also countries that might have approved bitcoin ETF (I might be wrong though), but all eyes are still in the US SEC.

      "body": "That's a good news for BTC. No doubt such steps are not in favor of the decentralization of BTC blockchain for which it was mainly developed but still, such steps are necessary. To migrate the interest of investors and market spectators towards cryptocurrency too. Because most of people are still ignoring crypto and focusing on Stocks, forex, etc.Which of course a good source of income but instead of making income they are not the best to store money value. So if these ETFs got approved which I think will start getting approvals once Block Rock got it. Then the adoption of BTC will increase but unfortunately, the main purpose of decentralization will not be promoted. Which is bad.But still I have firm believe that approval of such ETFs will increase the price of BTC because the dominance will increase over ALTs. The main con of it will be not getting full control of your BTC. I do not understand why would traditional people will buy such share from centralized authorities while they know those centralized authorities also bought it from decentralized platform or maybe centralized but the BTC remains the same. Then why those people targeted as users, try to buy directly from exchanges instead of buying shares of such ETF approved platforms.",

It has generated new wave of optimism in crypto community. The next important event could be approval of BlackRock spot ETF. BlackRock is one of the leading financial institutions with enormous potential to invest in new emerging projects and technologies, their involvement in Bitcoin will potentially propel Bitcoin price to new heights.",

I do not guess anything bigger would happen.I know a lot of people put their hope into ETF's because if they happen then that's going to be a good reason to make money and they think that they are going to make a lot of money from it but that doesn't mean that we are going to end up with a profit like they assume neither, it is going to be totally different than that. Lets hope that they actually do something that makes sense and make a profit because it is a different situation.",

To migrate the interest of investors and market spectators towards cryptocurrency too. Because most of people are still ignoring crypto and focusing on Stocks, forex, etc.Certainly, purchasing Bitcoin shares through ETFs means transferring custody and management of your assets to a centralized authority, and it goes against the core idea of decentralization Bitcoin was built upon. However, it is important to note that ETFs are playing significant role for promotion and adoption of Bitcoin by attracting broader range of investors, and ETF of MicroStrategy is a good example in this regard. The rationale behind buying shares of thee ETFs is that, some investors prefer security and regulation provided by these ETFs managements.",

It's better to teach people about self custody and responsibility. People who invest in these ETFs don't care about bitcoin and the principles it was built upon. All they want is for their broker to buy them some of this \"bitcoin stock\" that young people are talking about all the time. On the other hand, maybe it's for the better that they do it this way instead of buying it themselves and forgetting their seed, or falling prey to scammers with remote desktop software.",

They're the ones that's also filing cases against those violators and endorsers that have been misleading people to invest. At least with that, they're able to make something good and gives justice to the victims of those scams. Well, about the approval, it won't just be approved because of the hype.
