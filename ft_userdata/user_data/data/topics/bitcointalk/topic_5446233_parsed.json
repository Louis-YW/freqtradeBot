(i figured the fee was paid by my acct)Coinbase Commerce feesQuoteCoinbase charges a flat 1% transaction fee on all cryptocurrency transactions.For assets hosted on the Ethereum blockchain like USDC, DAI, and ETH, the transaction fee is instantly deducted from your customers’ payment. All transaction and fee information are reflected in your payment details and in generated reports.You must make your payment including the value required by the recipient (company) plus on-chain transaction fee. Coinbase is not responsible to give you leftover of your payment transaction that exceed value required by that company.",

When I use my HW I put the amount I want to send and then the fees are added. This is the most practical from a user's point of view.However, Coinbase has its rules and now the OP will surely not forget how it works next time. Although he might as well stop using that centralised, anti-bitcoin exchange bullshit:Coinbase the most anti-Bitcoin organisation. Make #DeleteCoinbase great again",

Although Coinbase displays the total amount including the fee, the recipient's wallet may deduct the fee from the total amount received. This can result in a discrepancy between what was sent and what was received, causing issues with payment acceptance. It is important to take this into account when sending cryptocurrency to avoid similar issues in the future.",

When I use my HW I put the amount I want to send and then the fees are added. This is the most practical from a user's point of view.But according to what I have noticed since I have been using bitcoin, even most wallets are deducting from the amount you input that you want to spend.On exchanges too, the amount that would be sent can be seen after the fee that would be charged is shown. That is how it is on the exchanges that I am using. So you can make the calculation yourself to send the correct amount that you want to send.What I am just most concerned about is that Coinbase is charging fee in percentage, when other exchanges are not doing it like that. Using percentage to charge fee is a way their customers will pay even high on fee.",

Most services or wallets will send the provided amount to the recipient as it is and will deduct the fees from what's left on your account's balance.Deducting the fees from the sent amount makes it hard for the customer to calculate how much he needs to withdraw.If I need to pay a merchant $10 then I should type $10 and the exchange can deduct whatever they want from the remaining balance.@OP, what's the merchant's policy when they don't receive the full amount?",

Same remains for us to carefully look at what amount is eventually sent and make manual adjustments taking into account the network fee.Binance, Kucoin, and Huobi are also the same, and must make adjustments so that the amount sent is the same as the payment to be made. Fee adjustments like this really have to be careful and read the rules that have been embedded before making a withdrawal. For gateway payments or paying bills such as the bitpay gateway, the amount must be the same otherwise the payment will fail.But for CEX ByBit, unlike Binance or others, Withdrawal uses a fee that is added so that it does not reduce the amount to be sent. and Wallet and DEX also use the same method as ByBit, so there is no confusion about having to adjust network fees manually.",

(i figured the fee was paid by my acct)That seems misleading to me.   Appreciate feedback!In contrast to Coinbase's policy regarding flat fees and deducting from the sent amount, which usually results in situations as you have described in your message, network fees are more predictable and logically justified, and they are mostly calculated based on how many inputs and outputs your transaction has. Your wallet estimates what your final payment will be, and these calculations are based on pure algorithms that take into account the fee rate, the structure of transactions, script types, and other relevant information. Everything is transparent, predictable, and done in a decentralized manner to ensure that everyone gets what they deserve. Please also note that it is considered a best practice to avoid sending payments directly from accounts on centralized exchanges because this money is not yet yours: you cannot and do not control the situation. A centralized exchange like Coinbase surveils all your incoming and outgoing transactions and checks them against an arbitrary set of criteria regarding the \"purity\" of your coin. If they suddenly decide to block your transaction and account upon receiving or sending, you may lose your hard-earned money along with trust to centralized regulated entities flirting with the masters of the fiat world.",

(i figured the fee was paid by my acct)That seems misleading to me.   Appreciate feedback!Exchanges have different kinds of charging strategies. Some charges are based on percentage, which is why some charge a fixed amount, like Binance, which charges from the user's withdrawing amount just like @Charles said the receiving amount will be displayed before the final confirmation. There are exchanges where they already have a fixed withdrawal fee, like Finexbox, where any withdrawal under the Ethereum blockchain has a fee of always about 0.01 ETH; that's how some other exchanges base their charges on the network you are withdrawing from. So the mistake was really on your side; you should have noticed the total amount that the receiver is going to see before the final confirmation page. Unless those platforms are good at hiding fees, I don't see Coinbase as one.",
