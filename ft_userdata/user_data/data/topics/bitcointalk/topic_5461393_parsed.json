If my memory serves me right STEPN which was the birth of the concept started about two years ago with GMT making some impressive run for the early birders but it's important we understand M2E project ain't primarily focused on profit making but encouraging healthy living. Trading them could be the play or perhaps buy to hodl cos they are still nascent and needs time to fully develop and also I think more awareness is needed to also encourage adoption.",

Actually I really did take part in those other M2E projects you talked about but I somehow have a feeling that this could be better and this is why I think so. It is aÂ  product of Staika which currently is having a good price trend and most especially is getting listed on Bitget. Somehow I think this will rub off positively on this particular project. Don't you think so too? Or either way I still get to keep fit even though I hate it ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",

I don't think being listed on a exchange that is not known is not relevant. It's just like being listed on an decentralized exchange because new exchange are trying to get as much customer as they can that's why they are not strict on listing tokens. I got your point and yeah it's like you are earning in play to earn games with micro earnings. I'm still unsure of it's future though but yeah we all have our own bias. If this move to earn concept blooms, I guess I'll regret this as I don't have plan to put my money into it.",

The hype around Move-2-Earn projects ended when the mainstream hype around STEPN ended. All these models are fleeting and their life expectancy is extremely low. If some project is talked about very often in various social networks, it means that it is too late to invest in this project. All these projects have big problems with tokenomics and that is why the price of these tokens falls very often, and indefinitely.",

And from the story it can be seen that you are satisfied with using the bracelet to track your burned calories instead of using a moving money-making app. Not all monetization apps offer exaggerated benefits though, and some tokens may become useless in the future.
