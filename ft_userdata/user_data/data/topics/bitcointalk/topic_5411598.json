It seems to have the best performance for your needs.The other options are John the Ripper (https://github.com/openwall/john, https://www.openwall.com/john/) and btcRecover (https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If you want to use CPU only, it will be very slow, if you have GPU available, follow instruction how to enable it in btcrecover (https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GPU_Acceleration/#btcrecover-gpu-acceleration-guide)",

Can you explain how you will do it if it was yours? Thanks in advance. All depends if you have any clues, what the password is. If you know nothing, even length, it is very difficult and the most probably not worth to do it.If you have any knowledge about password, you should thing what are you sure about and what is doubtful. For example you may be sure that length is 10 characters, or you may think it might be 8-12 characters.Then think if you build your password from a \"real\" words, sentences or numbers. Was there any \"template\" of passwords you used in the past (like name + number)? What mistake was done? uppercase/lowercase, typo etc.But if all you know is that - for example - it was 16 random characters, it does not seem to be doable...",

And of course you may think about charset (language) - did you use plain text, or accented characters or Japanese?",

If you have set a custom password then dictionary is not going to be useful for you. The dictionary is only meant for people who have set a very weak password so that it can be cracked instantly.You should stick with token lists, but instead of adding stuff to the end of the password, try to replace some words with others, do number and special characters substitution and concatenation.",

Yes, knowing hash it is only possible to find password. But at the end it is just a \"word\", you cannot do anything with it without wallet.dat file.",
