I also think something will happen once the forum returns to normal. But I didn't notice anything different at this time or I didn't realize that there was anything new after almost 3 hours after my first post today, the forum displayed the gateway time-out error code 504.I don't know...

But it would be great if they won't let us in the dark during this day. I also checked Twitter (aehh I mean X) and couldnt find much about it. I mean, we are back in busines for a few minutes so we should calm down but I would appreciate if the staff would share some updates/infos about this downtime. I myself have never experienced such a long downtime here.",
