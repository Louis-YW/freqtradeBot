I can't access the website, it keeps showing \"This site can’t be reached\". also, I found a website called \"aex.com\", perhaps that's the website you are talking about?anyway, I am not sure how legitimate your story is but if it is true, then it sounds like you got  \"friendship/romance scam\" I usually hear this kind of scam from people who are looking for love online. is the person who you are in chat with still in contact with you?",

Just curious why would you send funds there without double checking if it was legit?  Especially if they don't have much of an online footprint or reputation.  I know this doesn't help you to get your money back, but just something to think about for next time.",

Trusting my friend's seemingly genuine instructions, The rule of the thump always is to protect yourself and your funds and you fail to do that, if you're going to purchase a huge amount you should do an investigation and dig deep it seems $40k for you, is not worth doing an investigation first before sending money.QuoteI purchased $40,000 worth of ETH here and transferred it to 3Aex through NDAX.

I'm not sure what to do. The only thing that you can do now is to accept the loss and not send them any more money as the only thing that will happen if you send them more money is that you will end up losing even more. Too bad that you didn't try the site with less money instead going immediately with 40k, but it is what it is now.",

The person you claim to be your friend might be in collaboration with that site, and they might have blocked your IP from accessing the site. There was a situation I had in the past where I was blocked out of the site, but I tried to use another device to see if the site could open, and it did. I just knew it was a total scam. I'm not sure you can actually get your money back, but I will advise that you should not trust people you met online only. Don't trust them with your funds.",
