  "content": "Dear fellow gamblers,I wanted to share my recent experience with a casino site called duelbits.com. As someone who gambles regularly and considers himself a high roller (and a degenerate), I thought it would be worth giving it a try. I'm not gonna lie, I was pretty lucky (Hit full screen VS in wanted 5 times, and got 5-6 times 2000X in pragmatic slots). My experience with the website was decent, the rewards were insanely attractive and most popular games were available. No complains there. I finally thought I had found a good alternative to the biggest casino out there (we all know which one it is). After about 3 weeks of gambling these were my stats: Deposits: 500kRewards (Rakeback, daily, weekly): 1mWager: 90mAvg bet size: 100 in hacksaw, 400 in pragmatic (Although it was a bit lower at the start)Profit: ~7mHowever, my happiness was short-lived as the operators of duelbits locked my account (5.5m balance) while I was spinning and informed me that I needed to perform KYC. I thought this was a logical thing to do, so I went ahead and successfully completed the KYC through a third-party provider link that they had provided. I informed the casino through the support window that the KYC was successful, and they told me they needed to do some additional checks and would let me know once they were done.Unfortunately, every day, when I asked for an update, they would provide the same generic response of \"No ETA, no update yet, etc.\" Seven days have passed, and there still hasn't been any update or explanation. I never played from restricted countries, never created multiple accounts and never broke any rule mentioned in TOS. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but after a week I realized that this is possibly an attempt from the casino to take away my winnings from me (especially considering that this process took 10 minutes on other sites), so I decided to report this on the forum to warn other users not to fall into the same trap.I mean, what's the point of gambling if being lucky is a bad thing? Of course I don't play to win money, but if I'm lucky enough to come out on top I want to be able to take the win (Not that I won't give them back eventually)I would advise gamblers, or at least high rollers, to avoid duelbits, which is a shame because other than this it is a great site to play on. Maybe this is because they don't have the funds to pay out lucky high rollers, or maybe it's just greed. It is up to you to decide.Thanks for reading, and I hope my experience will help others avoid the same fate.Conversation & Account statusIf anyone wants to see some big wins, here are some replays that I had saved (I don't have them all as my account is still locked):(5VS - Wanted)(5VS - Wanted)(5VS Max win - Wanted)(5VS Max win - Wanted)(4800x - Wanted Dead Dead Dead)(5400x - Bloodthirst)(5500x - Rocket reels)(2700x - Itero)(8500x - Buffalo Stack 'n' Sync)(~2000x - Magician's Secrets)(~500x - Starlight base game)(~1000x - Sugar Rush)Bonus Incident:There was another incident may or may not be related to the whole situation. I have reasons to believe that it is possible that someone from the support team attempted to gain access to my account. At some point someone attempted to reset my passwordon duelbits. It is worth noting that nobody has access to my email address as that information is hidden. Another piece of information that might be important is that this occurred the first day that support contacted me. Some time later I received email from my email provider containing an opened ticket (and conversation) that was openedfrom someone using an gmail account (Which I will call Noe) and was attempting to gain access to my email. See below the conversation. I have redacted some fields for privacy.Noe first created the ticket using the below contents.QuoteOS: ****OS Version: ****Browser: ****Browser Version: ****Resolution: 752 × 1280Client: StaticClient Version: support-formUsername: ****Contact Email:****noe@gmail.comUser-Agent: ****Timestamp: ****Date: ****I forgot my password, and i have no recovery methods set. Please, I'm travelling abroad and don't have remember the password to access my account. I don't want my old emails, just please get me access to this account again.Support replied asking for some proof of ownership.QuoteHello, Thank you for contacting us. We can see that there is no account recovery method available for your account. Therefore, in order to assist you in setting a recovery method for the account with your chosen email and/or phone number, we must ask you to provide us with the following security information first: Precise time when you have last accessed your account:Did you use any of our mobile apps to login, or did you access your account through a web browser:The exact display name that you chose for your account:Some of the addresses to which you have sent your last messages:Some of the subject lines from the last sent messages: Do note that we require the requested information to be completely accurate if we are to proceed, otherwise, we may be forced to terminate the recovery process.Noe replied containing the display name of my duelbits account, and mentioned that the most recently received email must be from duelbits.QuotePrecise time i access my account: a while ago, i don't remember when.I have not used any mobile apps, mostly through browser.The exact display name: Once again, I don't access my email much, i use it mostly for my gambling sites registration and verifications, but it's Either FishermanTV or **<email name>**Some of the addresses to which i have sent messages to: i don't send out emails to anyone, but my most recent \"received\" email must be from (no-reply@duelbits.com)Some of the subject lines from from last sent messages: i don't send out emails to anyone.Afterwards I intervened and replied from my own email address in order to close the ticket.A few things are interesting here:1. Noe knew my email address was registered on duelbits even though that information is private and have not shared my email address with anyone.2. Noe knew my display name that I was using on duelbits. The display name is public, but it shows that the attack came for duelbits specifically. This is also confirmed by the fact that they said the most recently received email was from duelbits.3. I did not share the full gmail address of Noe, but it contained a name that \"coincidentally\" was the same name as the support agent that had contacted me. I always thought that the support agents use fake names but it was too uncanny to leave out (As it's not a common name).Thankfully they did not gain any access to my email or duelbits account but it still very scary that there is a possibility that someone from the inside was doing these things.",

Anyways, duelbit has been here for long and currently running a campaign not only that, the casino has never had any complaints from any member before neither has anyone accused the casino of scamming them but for the first time I am seeing this complaints. If I may ask do you use VPN when login? Because that might be another reason your account was suspended how ever, I would suggest you chat their representative here as to know what happened and why your account was suspended. I strongly recommend you make another complaint on their announcement thread or you make a post of this topic link on their announcement thread for the representative to look into in immediately.",

Paid out 7 figure sum, deposited $500,000 which is half a M, wanting to withdraw $7M (profit). It's all out of my league. Let's hope OP gets a justice, not excuse to keep his winnings. As a casino you have full right to investigate but for this kind of clients I am sure you have special departments, who will do things promptly, not like the cases where gambler deposited $100 and asking for $1k. $500k, $5M, $7M are life changing figure for any company or person.@fishermanTV, what are you? A big whale? How the fuck you decided to deposit $500k to an online casino and had the balls to continue gambling? I know there are crazy gamblers out there, they are not always visible.

Please see https://duelbits.com/tos and https://duelbits.com/aml  for further reference.on the page with your TOS about KYC and AML policy, there are more conditions. You would probably have to emphasize where exactly the problem arose.It is interesting that during the deposit (which is really huge in this case) there were no complaints about the violation of these rules. Shouldn't that be checked immediately, and not wait for a win? One can conclude that in the event of a total loss, the casino would not mind a certain violation of its policy.QuoteDuelbits would like it on the record that the user has already been paid out a seven figure sum prior to the commencement of the investigation.this is a good step forward, but it tells me that there are not too many reasons not to pay this win.I assume that such a big loss for the casino must force those responsible to start solving the bug that caused all this. otherwise, you lose any right to complain that the player abused the omission on your part.also, the whole thing in the second part of the OP's post about the potential attempt to take over the account and the very suspicious contact by Duelbits support seems worrying.",
