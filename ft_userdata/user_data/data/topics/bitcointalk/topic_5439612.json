  "content": "Greetings BitcoinTalk Community,Just in case for the Newbie, I want to share some precious information regarding Scam Crypto Projects and Legit. As you all know that there are many Scam projects introduced in the market and many new users become victims of those projects, So to avoid it you need to do the following:1)¬†¬†¬†Do Your Own Research (DYOR), instead of believing in the Project Team, Ads, Marketing, Hype, etc.2)¬†¬†¬†Avoid all the non-related users, who ask for payment or pretend to be a member of well-known projects, as actually, they are trying to Scam you by using different means, like:If a project has Telegram Community and there is an admin with the name ‚ÄúDan Joe‚Äù and you get a PM from the same name person, then don‚Äôt just believe him/her as they can use the same name but you have to verify the user from the community or by cross-check his username by clicking on the user name.3)¬†¬†¬†If a project guarantee 100x or 200x profit return, then avoid such projects in terms of investment, as this is also a trick to trap you.4)¬†¬†¬†Avoid Low grade, Less Secure, & have no proof of record on CMC, Coingecko, etc projects.5)¬†¬†¬†In terms of real investment select those projects whose aim is to be listed on the Top exchanges like Binance, etc.Please keep all the above basic points before involving any project. The most common and irritating Scam is the Telegram Scam, as each day you will have to avoid such users who claim to be a top manager or want to double your investment, etc.Happy Crypto Trading.",

Rug pulls can happen anytime with projects that can be seen there having decent volume. That's why just go back to the #1 tip you've mentioned and do it as much as you can.",

You do not need to diversify within the crypto space.Buy and hodl Bitcoin and avoid keeping altcoins in your stash and more so, do not risk your money on new projects.",

Even a well established project can fail just as the case with luna and so many other projects.

There is nothing wrong with telegram, it's one of the best chatting apps for business that I know, the problem is scammers will constantly use anything functional to scam innocent people, I have blocked over 100 scammers on telegram, they PM me first and that I don't like if all telegram users can adjust their telegram security settings to 'not allow PMs' they will be free. After so many blocking of strangers on telegram, the security settings saved me from a lot of headaches.",

Scamming cannot be completely eliminated from the market because it is growing every day, but investors and traders must be made aware of how scam ventures operate. There are many projects on the market that are frequently reported as scams, but there are also legitimate ones among them; however, it requires extensive investigation to understand the project's whole roadmap.
