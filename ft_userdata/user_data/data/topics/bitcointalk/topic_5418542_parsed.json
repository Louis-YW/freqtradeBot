It requires a bot which LoyceV, TryNinja, BPIP are doing. The OP is asking for such service as per my knowledge.

I too is not familiar with Facebook but for wordpress website there are many plugins which can scrap posts from another website and post automatically on a blog site. For Casino Critique we were planning such plugins for automatic news update for different sports but later removed it because this can eventually be penalized by search engine. Although we can disable the bot from robots.txt. We may consider such features later.",

This means that the scrapper will need to \"know\" each website's specifics.Then, as said, copying articles is very close to plagiarism. Even if OP will post on his website the original source/link, various websites and article writers will not be happy about that (some even prohibit it directly), since they lose revenue because of this kind of actions.",
