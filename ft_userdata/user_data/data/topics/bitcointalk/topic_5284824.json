  "content": "Recurrently, we discuss on methods to store our Bitcoins/Sats (et al), and how we would pass them on in case we kicked the bucket right now, on-the-spot. I’m not specifically interested here on discovering the different conceptual plans each one has, but rather to toy around with the scenario of suddenly passing away. Let’s be honest, people make plans in their minds, but many less actually have those contingency plans developed and tested, to the level that one is confident that their heirs will actually be able to access their Bitcoins. Another completely (yet related) question would be, whether they would not only manage to access them, but to keep them in custody, move them, sell them without messing-up, but I’m merely focusing on being able to access them here, staying in disposition to do whatever with them at a later stage.So the basic question in the poll is not about what you have in mind, but of what would really happen if you suddenly passed away right now…Note1: The proximity of Halloween retriggered the question in my mind today, alongside this thread:  What happens to my bitcoin if I die today?   Note2: select the closest percentage value from those available in the poll options.Results (Poll run for 15 days)",

Keep it there including my private key and wallets account that where my coins stored.I'd choose, 90%.  However, I didn't how this works but I will try to make such a plan. I think since digital currency or Bitcoin is a part that can be inherited just like a state, much better if we also consult an attorney to seek help and your estate plans.",

Looks like mission impossible for me when someone is not interested to learn or listen, and even harder to explain with instructions on paper or video.To conclude, If I go to 'sleep' today, my coins would go to 'sleep' with me.",

As for me, I always have regular trips (as the only person in our family that knows how to drive) and even how good and safety you are in the road, there are some sh*t that will put you on danger. Even at the moment, if I will now sleep for good (but damn, not now lol) I'm sure they can access my funds later on which is good. As for guidance just in case they are in trouble accessing my funds, they know some of my friends that is crypto-oriented. I will just hope none of my friends will do some sh*t to my family (I doubt there will be).",

This question came to my mind recently after I came into realization that my Bitcoin as well as other crypto holdings are no longer small.My mission this year has been to make my whole family as well as close friends learn about Bitcoin, a mission that I have failed to say the least due to COVID and some other complications. However, during next year, I will finish what I started.My plan is to give every one of them a hardware wallet with \"small amount\" of BTC for their birthdays and start from there. Then I'd teach them where to sell it as whole (hardware wallet included) and to check how much is it exactly worth so they do not get low-balled.After that, I'll probably start teaching them how software wallet works, how to send bitcoin, how to cash them out on exchanges and how to store them securely. Most of them are already aware of Bitcoin as it's been about 5 years since I started blabbering about it (and never stopped).However, as of right now, if I were to die (which I am already ready for in contrary to many here, even though I might be one of the younger here), all my BTC would be lost and that would be a waste to say, but at least I'd be happy laying in ground, knowing that I influenced a future price of BTC as there will be a bit less left in circulation .",
