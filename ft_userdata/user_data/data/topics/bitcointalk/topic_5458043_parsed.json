I would like to use/build something like this that could be offline but still send transactions in locations without good internet coverage.To my best knowledge   there are no  so far bitcoin wallets  with interfaces which allow them   to communicate  directly via LoRa net, but you can acquire relevant adapter  and connect literally any hardware wallet with USB port. Just a few examples of such adapters:  RangePi, PineDio.There are also LoRa NFC/RFID adapters (like this one), so using them you can connect HW capable to communicate via NFC protocol. DYOR.",
