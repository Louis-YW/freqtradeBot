  "content": "I have one of these posters lying around collecting dust. I'd say the condition of the poster is FAIR, because it has a few dents from storage. There are some white paint marks on the back of the poster too, as I've tried to cover brown/yellow spots.   (click each thumbnail to enlarge)Before I make an auction or sales thread, I want to know if there's interest in this poster. Otherwise, I'll keep it. Shipping only to US addresses at the moment. Thanks for looking.",
