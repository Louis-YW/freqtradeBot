  "content": "We talked a lot about most durable solutions for keeping seed words backup, using stainless steel washer or plates from strong metals like titanium, but we didn't about durability of hardware wallets.Jameson Lopp tested a lot of backup solutions, and there are people who are testing smartphones (JerryRigEverything), but I never saw anyone testing hardware wallets like this.Most hardware wallets are made of plastic but there are few exceptions that use more quality materials like metal and glass, that will have higher rating.I will divide hardware wallets in few basic categories based on the big list of hardware wallets we are maintaining in our local board.Hardware wallets are usually small electronic devices that usually have small display and few buttons, there are bigger devices that looks like phones and have more buttons, and third type of wallets  looks like a regular credit cards.Note that in some cases it might be a good idea to have hardware wallet that can be easily destroyed, to prevent anyone ever extracting any information from your device.What are my plans for this research?- I will try to contact hardware wallet developers and ask them if they conducted any testing on durability and if they can provide some information in public.- I will consider if device would survive drops to ground and hits with hammer.- Using common sense I will assume if wallet can easily be broken with hands (real testing is possible in future if manufacturers are willing to donate).- Water resistant and waterproof features will be rated higher.- Glass screen protection from scratches and breaks will be checked.What can you do?- You can post any public or private information you have about durability of hardware wallets.- You can perform your own tests and post results here.- Post videos and articles about destroying various hardware wallets.Videos and articles of destroying hardware wallets:- Destroying BitBox02 hardware wallet- Destroying Trezor One hardware wallet; Trezor One 2nd video; Trezor One 3rd video; Trezor One 4th video- Destroying Ellipal Titan Mini hardware wallet- Destroying Keystone hardware wallet with a hammer- Tangem HW tested in water; Tangem HW tested in ice coldQuote from: SFR10 on February 09, 2025, 09:44:36 AMLedger Crypto Wallets Are Being Destroyed - The most satisfying thing I've seen in a while.I Just DESTROYED My Keystone Pro Gen-3 Crypto Hardware Wallet!A manual for destroying Tangem Wallet - Drilling, torching, freezing, washing and shooting.This is work in progress, research will take time and rating for hardware wallets is not yet standardized, but I would like to see this improved and changed in future with your suggestions.",

      "body": "You touched on an important topic, because the quality of the physical performance of HW devices is often of poor quality. Information that allows you to understand which models of hardware wallets have a fragile body will be useful to buyers and allow them to choose a device for their needs.But I see a number of questionable points.Hardware wallet, this is not a device for extreme recreation and hiking, respectively, will not experience excessive load. I understand that it's not normal when plastic breaks in the hands, but the test with hammer blows will be too much. I can test any device in the world in this way and after I break it to smithereens, I will say that it is poorly made.  I think this is an extra check for HW devices. Whereas a drop test (not only on the ground, but on hard surfaces too) is necessary. Testing for water permeability is also a dubious test. Under normal circumstances, who will use the HW in the bathroom or at sea? You need to test under normal average conditions.I agree that such testing of devices is necessary, but it must be done within reason.It would be just great if you can get information about device testing from manufacturers and what loads it is designed for.Good luck in your endeavor.",

I understand that the trend is to get a physical device and test it until destruction in front of a camera, however, I am more of a fan of simulation approaches, in order to save money and not having to deal with the statistical problems that come with manufacture.One could carry an approximate study by importing a model of the cases of each HW and (knowing the material of them) test them under static loads and cyclical loads. Of course, that would mean an assumption of all the load being bore by the case only and would not say anything about the resistance against scratches, screen or inner components.Trezor's models are available on their repository so it is a matter of finding out what kind of plastic they use.",

If it breaks, you'll have to buy a new one, so it's not designed to be physically strong (just like phones).QuoteHardware wallet, this is not a device for extreme recreation and hiking, respectively, will not experience excessive load.My main concern is breaking the fragile small USB connector. Other than that, my hardware wallet doesn't get exposed to any force or moisture.Quote from: dkbit98 on March 10, 2023, 02:52:58 PMthey should be able to survive natural disasters.I'm thinking flooding, volcanos and forest fires. There's no need for any device to withstand that. Just keep your backup safe.QuoteAlmost every hardware wallet in format of credit card will score high in this test, and I know few wallets with screens that are using tempered glass, gorilla glass and metal instead of plastic.I can guarantee you I can destroy any credit card sized wallet by hitting it with a hammer once. Just hit it on the side.I don't think the type of glass matters, I just checked a phone video, and clearly the guy doesn't know how to use a hammer. This guy barely touches the glass with his hammer, and it scatters.QuoteI personally know examples of people who washed their clothes with hardware wallets or they dropped it in water like it happens with smartphones all the time.The only water damage from phones I've personally seen, is from using them in the rain with wet hands. I don't do that with my hardware wallets, and I don't risk washing them because I never carry them in my pocket. I always keep drinks away from my hardware, and designed my coffee table in such a way that spilled drinks won't reach the electronics under it.QuoteFloods are very common in some parts in the worlds, even my friends old house was totally flooded few years ago. In that case I wouldn't worry about the $80 hardware wallet, and worry much more about the $50,000 damage to the rest of my stuff. Replacing a hardware wallet is easy.Quote from: m2017 on March 11, 2023, 05:06:19 AMIt seems that none of the existing HW devices is designed to survive natural disasters.Just like phones, TVs, furniture and cars For my phone, I use a rubber case.

      "body": "We'll probably see certifications being put on the packaging for hardware wallets soon, and hopefully the companies release videos of their tests that they put their hardware through. Some of the phones, and laptops I've had in the past (toughbooks etc) release videos of their products being put through the tests, i.e drop test, water test, and heat test. I'd like to see this being tested, and some recognized certifications being handed out, rather than just stating their product is durable. At the moment, hardware wallets aren't being developed with this in mind, but I do expect durable will be a selling point in the near future. Drop test should be a standard in hardware wallets, since that's probably one of the biggest risks that comes with a hardware wallet. Also, if they include any buttons, they should probably be tested, and given some sort of life span, similar to what mice, and keyboards are given. I haven't put my hardware wallets through any tests, I do technically have a spare Trezor T model lying around, which I could test if anyone would be interested in it. However, I think we as a community should come up with a certain standard to test too, so that our results are somewhat cohesive. While, also bearing in mind these aren't currently built to last the various tests that are used for other hardware like military standard laptops. The thing is; these tests would ideally be tested at least 1000 times in each catagory to get any sort of reliable idea how which are the best, but even then you're relying on the fairness of all tests.",

The same goes for replacing the screen, connector or keys.

That makes it scratch resistant but still less likely to scatter. But, unlike my phones, I've never put a screen protector on a hardware wallet. It's not a \"travel item\" for me.Another factor in toughness is the weight: phones break when you drop them because they're heavy. USB-sticks usually survive a drop, because the lower weight puts much less strain on the corner that hits the ground. Extreme example: take a TV, if it drops, it's much more likely to break compared to dropping a phone.Quote from: Welsh on March 13, 2023, 11:59:39 PMlaptops I've had in the past (toughbooks etc)Good stuff:(source)But only if you need it for certain environments.

Of course, the wallet should not have a \"Chinese\" quality, but it does not need extra strength either.I somewhat agree, however there may be a way to do it. I've got laptops which are waterproof, and have clip in batteries which are hot swapable also. Whether or not that could be achieved on a small device remains to be seen, but there's definitely ways about it. However, for most users they'll probably want longevity via swapping the battery rather than durability, but what's the point of having a device that has a battery that can easily be replaced, when the device doesn't last longer than the initial battery dying.  Quote from: NotATether on March 14, 2023, 08:16:59 AMActually, I think that hardware wallets should be made disposable.

Then, you can go the traditional route of smashing it to pieces to be sure. However, I'm not sure how many users would want this sort of feature let alone use it.

If I could choose between a hardware wallet that's 5 times more expensive and looks like a brick, or just replace my hardware wallet if I ever break it, I choose the latter.Yeah, I've mainly used them for work, but have even incorporated them into my personal life simply because of the things I get up too outside of work. They've never failed me, however I've broken several traditional laptops, even by just picking them, albeit incorrectly. I don't know how many screens I've broken simply by picking them up by the lid . Although, the water resistance is very much needed for the things I do, and where I take it. I do a lot of my work outside. Which, I think a drop test, and a water resistant test to these devices are probably all that's needed.",

I think common sense is enough in some cases to evaluate how durable one wallet is, we don't have to test something 1000 times.Combined with reports from customers we can have rough estimates about hardware wallets even now, without some big scale tests.It would be interesting to hear if manufacturers (other than Foundation Passports) are doing any internal testing at all.I am working on my own rating system right now, that is far from perfect.Quote from: tenant48 on March 14, 2023, 07:34:07 AMWhat's the point of having a super-durable and sealed wallet that won't have the ability to change the battery?First of all, hardware wallet doesn't need to have battery and it doesn't have to be sealed at all, but that is probably better for security and it can protect from tampering.Quote from: LoyceV on March 14, 2023, 11:34:21 AMMakes sense: if you get used to tough laptops, you'll break the weak normal ones because you no longer consider them delicate.If you use tough quality laptops (like Thinkpap), tough phones, shoes, jackets, socks (Darn Tough socks for example have lifetime warranty) etc. than you probably like tough stuff in general, including hardware wallets.Buying cheap stuff all the time you are probably wasting more money and creating more junk, with false idea that you are saving money.",

But, it survived having a cup of coffee spilled all over it. I dried it off, rinsed it with some alcohol / contact cleaner and it still works fine. Had I dropped it on the floor and ran it over with my office chair, which was what I did to something else which was how the entire coffee thing started, I would probably have destroyed it. -Dave",

      "body": "The idea to test hardware wallets for durability isn't bad in itself. But I don't agree with the notion that a hardware wallet is supposed to be designed to survive fires, water, crashing buildings, and the like. I don't expect that of my laptops, my phones, or my hardware wallets.I wouldn't buy a hardware wallet for $800 because it can survive being thrown down the stairs. If you asked 1000 people, very few would think that's a good idea and something they expect. The other thing is, this is completely subjective to the kind of person you are generally and how you take care of your belongings. You posted a picture of a Nano S with a cracked case. That could mean the device uses low quality materials in the building process and/or that you are clumsy and can't keep your stuff in order. That's your HW, do you want to see mine? You can check it in my Show off your hardware wallet thread. It still looks new after several years of usage. My Trezor One is a few months old but in a few years from now, it's still going to look brand-new. Because that's the type of person I am. I don't drop my stuff or hit it with a hammer. Maybe an electronic component will break in one of them despite me being careful (that's out of my control) but It's not going to have a cracked case like yours. Stop breaking your shit, and the shit will last.",
