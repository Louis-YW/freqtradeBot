  "content": "Counting from day four of the Hero World Challenge at the Albany Golf Club in the Bahamas Tiger Woods had a mixed final round on his return to professional golf at the Hero World Challenge, finishing even par for the tournament with a level-par 72 on Sunday, as Scottie Scheffler took home a three-shot victory.He sunk five birdies in his final round but a double bogey, plus three more bogeys, put a dent in any attempt at moving up the leaderboard.After starting the day on even par, Woods got off to a difficult start to his final round with a double bogey at the par-three second and dropped down to 18th.He drains the birdie putt from 34 feet out on the par-three fifth at the Hero World Challenge. However, he recovered well on his opening nine, a sensational 34-foot birdie at par-three fifth plus three more birdies taking him to one-under.A bogey on the eighth set him back but he entered the back nine on even par, hitting four out of six fairways on the way.Woods had struggled on the back nine throughout the week and again his highlights were rendered redundant as birdies on the 14th and 15th were matched by bogeys on the 11th and 16th to see him finish the day where he started it on even par.He said it was great to be competing again and is looking to play one tournament a month in 2024.Scheffler entered the final round as the clear favourite and never took a backwards step, four birdies and a bogey-free round helping him seal the win.Completing on 20 under, the world No 1's closest rival ended up being Sepp Straka who also carded a bogey-free round, eight birdies taking him to 17 under for the day.Scottie Scheffler gives his thoughts after winning the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas.Justin Thomas found some form to finish third a shot behind, with Tony Finau and Matt Fitzpatrick finishing 15 under in fourth.Jordan Speith rounded out the top five, two late bogeys denting his challenge.Prediction. Who will win the Â next coming Golf Hero World Challenge?",
