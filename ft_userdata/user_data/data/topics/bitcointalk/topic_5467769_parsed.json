I believe there are a lot of funny posts that you can contribute to and have fun doing. Just like you said here, your comment might be deleted if they discover that they are not in line with what's being discussed in the thread. There are ways of being light and also being on the same page with the OP. You can always say a meaningful thing in a jokeful manner, but if you overdo it on different occasions and places where such comments are not needed, it could be considered that you are just using that means to complete your weekly post quota. Considering the fact that you are wearing a signature, you can be suspected of such.",

So you think, since it's about making money from signature campaigns, it should be serious? shouldn't we discuss for fun? or because most people think this forum is a place to work?",

As a grown up adult, some people don't find conversation interesting if it is not a serious discussion and it is not worth discussing. If you want to joke or troll, you can still do that in the forum as well but not under serious discussions so you won't deviate from the main topic of discussion.Deviating from topic of discussion is actually against Forum ethics and that's why there's a board for off topic discussion. If you are more concern about humor then Twitter (now X) or Facebook are perfect place for you to have that. The Forum is trying to maintain orderliness by restricting certain things to avoid bullies and threat that might arise from troll and expensive jokes.",

I am of the opinion that in some boards a certain amount of seriousness should be maintained if we are discussing serious matters, but even then I do not see anything wrong if someone writes something that is slightly off topic and I would never report such a post.",
