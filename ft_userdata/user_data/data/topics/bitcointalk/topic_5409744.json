Let's take banks for example: I don't trust them, but they're regulated and government guarantees they'll pay back deposits up to â‚¬100,000 if they go bankrupt. That government guarantee means it doesn't really matter if the bank is stable or not. As a consumer, that's easy, and I already know I have no privacy with banks anyway.QuoteIf there were 2 major players say DaveExcange 1 and DaveExchnange 2 the 1st operated in most states / countries the 2nd was avoiding the ones that required more licensing and financial checks. But outside of that they were both around for years had a good reputation and so on.Would you feel safer using one over the other?I wouldn't trust an exchange that can't spell \"Exchange\", so both are disqualified.Jokes aside: I do use regulated exchanges that have been around for years, and I feel pretty safe doing so. I'd love to see a totally anonymous exchange with only a .onion domain and a very good reputation, but unfortunately I don't know any of those. The \"less regulated\" exchanges I know usually don't have a very good reputation, and worse, many anonymous exchange sites still ask people for their documents, which makes them much worse than the regulated exchange.",

It will be like Coinbase versus Binance, one that you know where it operates and where it is located and the other one operates either from Malta or Bahamas or somewhere where CZ seems fit to run. Which answers the second row of questions about feeling safer and usage as a simple poll between the two of them here will probably come with 99% for Binance as it's SAFU! I'm pretty sure an overall majority of users don't care about that, they've never read the ToS, they actually don't know anything about the company before depositing money but they go with the wave.As for myself, I won't trust any exchange no matter the licenses it has with more than a few bucks and I still feel uneasiness when I'm forced to send a larger sum to exchange to either sell or buy coins, a feeling that goes away only when the coins are in my pocket and yeah when the fiat is in my bank account as at least that's, as Loycev covered. The money or coins on an exchange are not covered by anything, no matter the age and the reputation.",

No point giving up all the benefits of decentralization and yet receiving none of the benefits of fiat bank regulation/insurance/etc. Just look at how that turned out for Celsius, Voyager, and others.",

I think a lot of these places like to brag how much they do / how large they are and it's not 100% true.The question is highly subjective depending upon the location of the user. I am from India and as of now, there is no specific law for the crypto exchanges here. They are working in the status of ambiguity, fulfilling the general rules laid down by the central bank for the companies involved in financial services. So, for me the reputation and user-trustworthiness play more importance than number of license or pan-US approval in determining the genuinity of the exchange. I am fine using the international exchanges working from the small-island countries or not providing services in certain locations to avoid stringent regulations as long as I know that they are not explicitly illegal in my country and users put great trust in those.",

Do you think the 'larger well known' exchanges that don't go for the more stringent checks are lazy, or are they lying about something or something else?Exchanges want to make money. They do that by attracting more customers. The more places they operate in, the more customers they can attract. So to choose not to operate in some jurisdictions they must have come to the conclusion that either 1) it would cost them more (time, money, effort, staffing, infrastructure, etc.) to meet all the regulations required than they would gain back from users in that jurisdiction, or 2) they cannot comply with the necessary regulations at all. Number 1 is fine - lots of companies don't operate in lots of places for this exact reason. Number 2 is less fine, and suggests that at best there is something they are doing which is less than ideal, and at worst outright illegal in that jurisdiction.Quote from: DireWolfM14 on August 15, 2022, 04:48:21 PMDo I trust governments?Â  No, I don't.I don't either for most things.

Look at Binance, the most licensed crypto exchange in the world. I guess they're also the most investigated and also the most that is ordered to stop operating. It seems they try to negotiate but if the other party is too stern, they pack up and leave, go to other countries and strike a deal.In terms of business, it oftentimes takes two to tango. Too tight regulatory policies would discourage and keep investors away. Instead of them trying to comply, they'd rather not. So the authorities will have to loosen up a bit and attract them.",

The most recent one that comes to my mind is the regulations on gambling, and the obligation for licensed houses to offer responsible gambling features. Does anyone believe that the gambling industry would regulate itself in a way that would be beneficial to society if the authorities were not on its back? I don't think so, and in general I am not very much in favor of regulations and taxes, which usually go hand in hand.But going back a little further, not too far in historical times, the regulations that banned child labor or those that legalized the right to strike seem to me to be good examples.",

Which is why many times they will step in and close a bank that to outsiders DOES look like all is well and they have enough financial backing. But in reality it was all smoke and mirrors. If enough major banks fail then yes it would be a shitshow, Something like that already happened not long ago in 2008 but they had bailout, that is like putting dead patient on ventilator and keeping him alive artificially.They won't and can't keep doing things like this anymore, so it's just a matter of them for history to repeat itself but with much worse results. Quote from: LoyceV on August 19, 2022, 06:55:02 AMI assume it will be the same as the bailouts: if tax payers can't pay for it, government debt will just go up and printer goes BRRR. That just means the value of your fiat drops more, but you'll get back the same amount.Or they will just take away all your property.Combination of money printing, huge inflation or hyperinflation and rising prices will make paying taxes, debt and everything else much harder for regular people. I don't know why else would IRS hire 87000 new IRS agents and teach them to user deadly force",

People complained, so I don't think they'll do that again. Instead, they just went full BRRR and now take much more money through inflation than they ever could from a bail-in.QuoteCombination of money printing, huge inflation or hyperinflation and rising prices will make paying taxes, debt and everything else much harder for regular people.It more and more feels like fiat money itself is a scam.",
