      "body": "The importance of saving is often overlooked, especially when it comes to promoting advocacy and awareness. Saving serves various purposes, such as investment, entrepreneurial endeavors, making purchases, or funding education. Unfortunately, in certain countries, certain saving methods do not provide adequate returns. We need emphasis on the purpose of saving also",

I mean, have you seen the price of a cup of coffee lately? By the time I save up enough for retirement, I'll be sipping on a $20 latte and reminiscing about the good old days when a cup of joe was affordable.",

Because working like normal humans usually doesn't let you save tons of money that's why you need to care about additional income. =)",
