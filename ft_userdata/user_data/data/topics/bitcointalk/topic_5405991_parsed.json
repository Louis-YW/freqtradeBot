Hey guys, I made a deal with Mariowot on the 23rd for the encyclopedia.Contacted MJ to escrow and set everything up, MJ replied to both of us with all details, I paid what was discussed into escrow, and Mariowot has not replied to myself or MJ since making the deal.The only reason I am posting this info here is because although he has not replied to us, he is still active on the forums.Is it a scammer in place of a once trusted member? I don't know, but it is odd that he hasn't replied since the escrow deal was setup.I'd like to get to the bottom of this. If you re making any deals with Mariowot, especially for the encyclopedia, please let it be known here. Hopefully someone with some integrity can shed some light on this situation. Thanks.",

      "body": "Well guys I can confirm that Mariowot has reneged on our deal. I have to admit I went fully scorched earth on him in PM which is out of character for me, but justified to anyone who values their time.Since the OP did not contain any identifying details and he stopped responding once escrow was set up, I rightfully assumed it could be a scammer.Mariowot confirmed to me they had received a better offer after we made a deal, and said \"there is too much pms about that book. I will have to hold on with that sale\"I did not trust he even had the book at this point. I made him send me a picture of the encyclopedia with date and nick included, or I was going to neg him for being a scammer and wasting my time. He provided the image and I can confirm he is not a scammer, just lacking integrity. How does integrity here rank -vs- being in need of money to survive, not a simple answer, so I will not be leaving any bad feedback for Mariowot.But this sets a very bad precedent here. What is the point of wasting time messaging someone and working to make a deal, only to have them back out after all the work is done.Also, I posted here, \"hoping for someone to shed light on the situation\", meaning the person who offered more should have the integrity to stand up and let it be know, especially considering all the details I stated, but that did not happen!This is another bad precedent, do we really no longer have any integrity here?It doesn't bother anyone else that not one person came forward and admitted to making a deal with or talking with mario about buying the encyclopedia? Really?Now we are operating on no reliability, no transparency, no integrity, and greed is the only motive? I'm sure this will work out great for us",

This is true out there in the real world and outside of collectibles here, but this place is special, we hold ourselves to a higher standard here.Quote from: Mariowot on July 28, 2022, 06:08:28 PMAll sorted out with ZipReg, encyclopedia sold to him.Thanks mate!Yes! I am happy to confirm that Mario and I have worked this out, honestly and fairly, as it should be done. Mario didn't actively seek better offers, he was only receiving them based off of this thread. He wasn't truly satisfied with our original deal, and was uncertain how to go about renegotiating after we had already made a deal. I explained how it should be handled and he now knows this, and how to handle things when a deal is made, so I encourage you all to help him out here by purchasing his remaining offerings.There is a reason we hold ourselves to a higher standard here, this is a tight knit community and having these standards only enriches everyone's experience.I would have also purchased the beautiful #2 set of papersafe notes he has available, but I can't afford them along with the book, so here is your chance at them and the other remaining pieces here guys! Thanks again Mariowot, I wish you all the best buddy, and good luck with the remainder of your sales!",
