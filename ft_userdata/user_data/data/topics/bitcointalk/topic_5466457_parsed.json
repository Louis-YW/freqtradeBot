There are 15+ various altcoin wallets ( mobile, desktop ) already, look here https://cryptolinks.com/altcoin-wallet. Plus new altcoins also can have own wallets with time. So altcoins are market trend in whole crypto market, and altcoin wallets too.",

Besides,  most altcoin wallets are not like popular bitcoin wallets, which are just designed to support bitcoin alone. They always appear to be multi-wallet options. So leaving them in the altcoin discussion board is, to me, the best thing to do and not flooding the forum with boards that will merely make a difference.",

That tells you all you need to know about how \"important\" that coin is.You have totally right and in fact I'm among those people who keep most of his altcoins in exchanges rather than installing their wallet software and withdrawing the coins into those wallets. I don't think that there is any need to withdraw altcoins to a personal custodial wallet. I love to keep them on exchanges instead. I actually bought those coins as a mistake and in order to fix my mistake I'm holding those useless coins. I don't think that I will get my money back that I invested in those altcoins, but still I will hold those on custodial wallet of the exchange rather than withdrawing them on my own wallet.I also don't agree with the @OP and I must say that most of the forum members are not using altcoins more than Bitcoin and I must tell you to do proper research before saying something like that. This is Bitcointalk forum and here most of the members are interested in Bitcoin and things related to Bitcoin.",

Most shitcoin altcoin holders don't actually go for wallets based on how secure they are instead they go for popular and easy to use type of wallet that's why you'll see that majority of them use trust wallet or metamask, you can carry out a quick survey to figure it out yourself. As long as they can import their token into that wallet they are okay with it. Only a few of them know their shit there.",

Bitcointalk is likely the only popular forum that has a generalized board for any and all altcoin discussion. I agree that the board shouldn't be expanded more than it already is. Newer altcoins just needs to create their own dedicated forum for their users. Bitcointalk used to serve as an avenue to bootstrap community for altcoin projects  <= 2018.",
