I'm confused.  Are you saying you have $170,200 but you want to borrow €500?  Why not just convert those dollars to euros and use your own money?Or, are you saying that your \"collateral\" (web domains and NFTs) are worth $170,200?  If it's the latter, you are unlikely to get a loan here.  Domains are not valid collateral, and NFTs are notoriously over valued.",

I just added the nft because its at least something also",

You offering $200 to get 500€?Do you really understand what collateral is and its purpose?QuoteI just added the nft because its at least something alsoit's not worth anything. and you are also aware of that, because you would surely have already sold them if you had any buyer for it.you bought those domains (20days ago) without any idea what to do with them, you were only guided by the story of how someone sold something similar for 50-100k. I would advise you not to get carried away with easy money, and also don't expect a complete stranger to give you 500€.also, you invested money lightly in buying a domain, without a plan of what to do with that investment, which only increases the risk that you will spend the borrowed 500e on wrong way. So advice is spend only what you have in your pocket.Quote from: Debilsumda on January 18, 2023, 11:11:17 PMAlso these 2 other domains, and some creepy Al, posting mainly for the first web3 domain. Any ideas what i can make of them? Saw some have been sold for 50k 100k $ because they had 4 characters..",

One last thing, are nebeus legit for example? Or can i receive some recommendations. Btw my collater is mixed crypto, polkadot, chainlink, matic, and idk whats the reason i i have 150$ xrp in coinbase, but they're frozen since 8 hours, no idea whyThe domains were 50$ airdrop.And im not planning to invest, i need to catch a flight, so i can resolve some problems with the bank i use, unfortunately if i want to resolve them fast, i can't lose much time, and the earliest cheapest flights are like 600€.Thank yall anyway for explaining me how this things works, im not familiar how collateral play role, but i still do overpay, just many things troubling my mind and etc..i do know now",

You can't get a loan with what you have to offer as collateral, unless someone sees something I don't in your offerings. You would probably be able to get one locally at one of those small bank like institutions as long as you have a job, their rate is a killer tho so you might be expected to pay double of what you're taking.",
