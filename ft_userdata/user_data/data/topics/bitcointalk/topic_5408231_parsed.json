      "body": "Hehe so miners are now switching to ETC since they can no longer take huge profits from POW mining ETH. Not a bad move for the manufacturer in answering the request of customers.

You must take a look at the price is still very stable and steadily going up. So, i didn't even think it will be going down again since miners will be also pumping it very soon. The impact from ethereum is real.",
