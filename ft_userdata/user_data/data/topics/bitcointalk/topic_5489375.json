Go around town, many people hold bitcoin, and there are several outlets willing to accept bitcoin, but still, customers prefer to pay with fiat, and keep their bitcoin as investment for future profit.And personally, I would rather sell a small part of my bitcoin, convert it to fiat and pay for what ever I want to purchase, than spend bitcoin to buy it, yeah, the white paper said \"electronic peer to peer cash system\", but bitcoin as achieved and surpassed that.",

Adding trash data to the Blockchain makes no sense especially provided that there's no monetary value attached to these transactions, instead they act as a pointer to an artificial \"token\" or image file, which is a gross abuse of a distributed ledger. Some things like image storage make much more sense with more centralized infrastructure. On the one hand Core developers have been very slow to quell this abuse of bugs and overlooked features that are prone to abuse. Because not only is adding trash data on the Blockchain with OPcode abuse a bug,  but the Taproot update also gives them a discount... For now, if you are a miner, you can transfer your hash on ocean.xyz and support a pool that doesn't mine ordinal and such transactions. Hopefully the core devs also listen to the community's needs sooner or later.",

But Bitcoin was built is something open, decentralized, something that gives freedom. And building up other things is arguably a part of that freedom. As for the point that Bitcoin was made as electronic cash and should thus stay this way, some can correctly point out that most people probably don't use Bitcoin as electronic cash. People are interested in Bitcoin as a safe haven, as an investment opportunity or as something similar. So with new uses come new transformations.",
