You can check them directly on any block explorer or this link below- https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/2066ac05110d63d85c0df347e3627f1fe8535cd9d4d74f5b913a9785e81fc5b7You paid 5 sat fee which is enough to confirm your transaction in a few minutes and according to that transaction it was made 9 minutes ago.",

Even if the transaction is successfully added, sometimes it is necessary to wait for several hours for Via to find the block, so all this should be taken into account.",
