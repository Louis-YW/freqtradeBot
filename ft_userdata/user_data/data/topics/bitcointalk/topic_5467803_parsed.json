And again you’re not the first user who have mistakenly sent more than the amount of merit they want to send to a post, so when next you want to send merit just make sure you check what you typed again before you click “send” it takes less than 30 seconds to do so, so next time do not be in a hurry to release your merit.",

      "body": "This kind of mistake is actually kind of rude to make, as what was expected was to delete the first zero there and add your two there, and everything will be all right. The kind of mistake that I also think someone can make is a place where the person might try to send 1–5 merit and they add the number before the zero without remembering to delete the 0 and they end up sending 10, instead of 1, and 20 instead of 2, just like that, used 1–50 since someone can't send more than 50 merit at once. In your own line of mistake, you clicked on the merit page, deleted the zero, and added 2 twice. Maybe this was a result of a little distraction or a keyboard malfunction. Your suggestion is nice; it's just as similar as . Ignore user confirmation before ignoring . This is where someone mistakenly adds another user to his ignore list without his knowledge, which leads him to make a suggestion for confirmation notification before approving the ignore list. If there is any chance that they can give this a second thought and consider it, then there will be possibilities of your suggesting to also be added to the to-do list of the admin, but I doubt that will happen anytime soon.",

While being in this forum for a few months now, I haven't seen anyone creating a post. Such issues on the forum happen rarely, it is not common to see some of the legendary members distributing a big chunk of sMerits. I cannot go and find those users now, nor do I think it is good to post links to such posts. Coming back to your question about whether a patch can be added or the admin can agree with that patch. The question from me to you is why? We are already using outdated forum software, the admin is least interested in upgrading it. I doubt your request would be accepted, it would be wise on your part to not commit such a mistake in the future.

I don't have access to theymos' modifications to SMF 1.1.19, so there are things (merit system, trust system, etc.) that I'm unable to patch. Maybe one day theymos and I will come to an arrangement that broadens my reach, but for now, my hands are pretty much tied.I could see making some tweaks to the merit-sending UI (e.g. a passive notice when you're about to send merit to a banned user), but a confirmation dialog designed to prevent accidental over-spending is likely to annoy more people than it helps (I suppose it could be a profile setting that's off by default), and adding the ability to undo/edit merit transactions is inadvisable, IMO (I guess something like 180 seconds of \"grace period\" might be workable, but in general: I think it would be opening up a can of worms in exchange for very little upside, and it would confuse/break a lot of third-party tools).I'm sorry you accidentally drained your sMerit balance: be more careful in the future, yo.",

So why?If you are a merit source or you get a lot of merit for your posts, then 22 or any other number of mistakenly sent merits does not mean anything - but if you are an average non-MS user or you get a few merits here and there, then such errors are not very pleasant. The OP would certainly distribute those merits to several users, just as I do with my sMerits, although I would much prefer to be able to reward some posts with more than 1 merit.",
