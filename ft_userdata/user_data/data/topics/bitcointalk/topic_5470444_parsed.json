  "content": "There are two options in my mind, now that I think about creating a new multisig wallet for personal usage. I will be the one to take care of the cosigners. I have been thinking a 2-of-3 or a 2-of-2 set up. I already own a 2-of-3 wallet and I need another one, but perhaps I could change the set up a little bit.Option A (2-of-3):Cosigners A, B, C (Seed A, Seed B, Seed C, XPUB A, XPUB B, XPUB C)Backup (each item in different locations):Seed A, XPUB BSeed B, XPUB CSeed C, XPUB AOption A (2-of-2):Cosigners A, B (Seed A, Seed B, XPUB A, XPUB B)Backup (each item in different locations):Seed A, XPUB BSeed A, XPUB BSeed B, XPUB ASeed B, XPUB AQuestions:1. Is it cheaper to have less total cosigners to define the wallet? In that case, would a 2-of-2 be cheaper than a 2-of-3?2. Is my backup set ups above optimal? 3. Any other thoughts?",

So according to what you say, both numbers n and m are important in fee calculation. I thought that perhaps since 2 cosigners are needed, then the fee would be the same. But, the fact that one wallet has 3 total signers (xpubs) makes a difference too.Quote from: apogio on October 15, 2023, 05:02:35 PM2. Is my backup set ups above optimal? Well, I will answer to myself here, but I have just realised that my backup in the second case is not optional. If an attacker steals one of my packets, they can spy on my wallet since they have a seed and the other xpub. However on the first scenario, if an attacker steals one packet, they can't spy on my wallet. As far as losing funds is concerned, then I am safe in both occasions if I lose one packet.",

But, the fact that one wallet has 3 total signers (xpubs) makes a difference too.The unlocking script must include all the public keys which make up the multi-sig, so while both 2-of-2 and 2-of-3 will contain 2 signatures, the latter will contain one extra public key.Here's a transaction which pays from a 2-of-2 P2WSH multi-sig: https://mempool.space/tx/25cf07056425e639bcbd3897c86e80011b83530a5c07feefb579c855574667dcIf you click on \"Details\", you'll see the witness has three parts to it. The first two are the signatures, and the third is the script for the 2-of-2 multi-sig as follows:52   -   OP_221   -   Push 33 bytes03...34 - Public key 121   -   Push 33 bytes02...a6 - Public key 252   -   OP_2ae   -   OP_CHECKMULTISIGNow, here's a transaction which pays from a 2-of-3 P2WSH multi-sig: https://mempool.space/tx/87afd959dbdc95a3c052d49c8b0bd3795b8210f5644a0cc6640b2a76a5101938Again, if you click on \"Details\" you'll see three parts to the witness. The first two - the signatures - are the same size. The third one this time is bigger, since it is now a 2-of-3 script as follows:52   -   OP_221   -   Push 33 bytes02...f1 - Public key 121   -   Push 33 bytes03...02 - Public key 221   -   Push 33 bytes02...74 - Public key 353   -   OP_3ae   -   OP_CHECKMULTISIGSo the difference in size is 34 bytes (0x21 header byte followed by the 33 byte public key). But since those bytes are witness bytes, then the difference in size for any transaction is only 8.5 vbytes. So I wouldn't let that affect your choice too much, since the different is negligible unless you are consolidating hundreds of small inputs.",

If you have lost both seed A back ups, then having xpub A backed up alongside seed B isn't going to help you - your funds are lost at that point. In any scenario where you have recovered both seed A and seed B, then by definition you will also have access to xpub A and xpub B since you can derive them. And so if you simply back up the seed phrases on their own, then an attacker compromising one seed phrase cannot spy on your wallets.",

So, in your opinion, what would be the contributing factor that would make you choose one of them? The obvious difference is that 2-of-3 requires 3 safe locations, whereas the 2-of-2 requires 4.",

But if you are creating two back ups of each component in your 2-of-2, then you have removed that risk.At that point it probably becomes personal preference, assuming you have enough separate secure devices and separate secure locations to similarly create each multi-sig and store each back up. The only real benefit I can see of a 2-of-2 if you don't back up the xpubs as we've just discussed is that you could plausibly deny any one of your back ups has anything to do with a multi-sig at all, and could claim it is simply a seed phrase for a single sig wallet (and indeed, could put a small amount of coins on each individual seed phrase to corroborate this story). A seed phrase backed up alongside an xpub is pretty obviously part of a multi-sig to anyone who understands bitcoin.",

A seed phrase backed up alongside an xpub is pretty obviously part of a multi-sig to anyone who understands bitcoin.That's indeed a good advantage of the 2-of-2.About the text I put in red color, I want to say something. I generally tend to use my signing devices to maintain a \"non-persistent memory\". That said, none of my devices hold any keys and after I create a wallet and back it up properly, I perform factory reset on the device. If I need to sign, I have to manually import my seed phrase again, or scan a QR code if I have exported my seed in QR format. I was introduced to this technique by Seed Signer (https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner#seedqr-printable-templates) and I kinda loved it. So, I don't backup my devices, but only the piece of paper where I have written my seed phrase (and my QR code).",

Both would require an attacker to compromise two separate back ups. Both would require you to ideally have four back ups in total, with one back up from pair A and one back up from pair B required to recover your wallet.In terms of creating the wallets or spending the coins is where the difference comes. As I said above, one of the benefits of multi-sig is you can avoid a single point of failure. With a 2-of-2 multi-sig you can always keep your seed phrases on entirely separate devices, and never have one device which contains both seed phrases, either during the creation phase or during the signing a transaction phase. With a single sig plus passphrase wallet, that is not possible. You must bring both seed phrase and passphrase together on the same device when you create the wallet and when you want to sign any transactions, and so if that device is compromised your funds are lost.Whether or not that single point of failure concerns you is up to your specific threat model. Are you using a hot wallet? Very concerning. Are you using a permanently airgapped device running a live amnesic OS such as Tails? Far less concerning.",
