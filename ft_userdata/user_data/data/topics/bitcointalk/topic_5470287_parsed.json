  "content": "You don observe say most people when de shout say job no de for this country na this two set of people?. it's either them no get skill or them get but no wan make use of the skill.Even most of the graduate when de complain say work no de or government no gree employ them, if you look them well you go observe say them be people when no too take there studies serious or them just focus on there studies and no add a single skill to wetin them go study for school.The society don really change a lot, and to be successful now, you need to be skilled at something and to also make the best out of your skill.I know some persons when de very good at writing but them know no say that one too na skill when de fit use get one or two money, there own na to use am for Facebook comment section take complain about how work no de for we country.There are others that are good at graphics, maths, hair dreasing and so on but they are not willing to develop it and will just keep criticizing and dictating errors from people doing those jobs.There was a time someone needed a tiller for his house and told me to bring in some guys for the job, I contacted some of my school friend that are into tilling and when I took them there and found out the amount they charged the man for the job eh, my brain burst. That was when I give big thumbs up to all skilled individual.The truth is that no skill becomes well refined when you've not started practicing it that much but ones you continue using it the right way, you will start improving on it and with time, people will see you as a lord in the craft.No let any person deceive you, being skilled at a trade in today's world is the key to your success. Village people don de almost die finish and majority of the chances of you being successful is in your hands, so make the best out of any little thing you are good at before sapa will make mess of you.",

Some skills are no longer worth learning because their profit margin is now so small that you financial situation will not change even after you struggle to learn it. So you must be very selective in choosing a skill to learn. Also do not be afraid to pay a huge sum of money to learn a skill, the benefit of a good skill far outweigh the cost in acquiring the skill.",

It also has to be something that can earn a good income and is sustainable.E no get watin I want talk now, wey pass this one o, because na so America take develop to watin e be today o!Unless you also like taking orders or being told what to do always, then please do learn a skill.",

Getting a skill a lot needs to be considered,  the world is changing everyday when searching for a skill to learn people needs to look for relevant skill, and needs to look into what the world really needs because this the best way to make money from the skill acquired.  Their are skill that are trending that will last very long and people will still be in need of it. The money which can be used to learn good skill shouldn't make people to change their mind not to go for it, no money in learning skill is a waste.  People need to understand that they will still make good money from the skill they learn.",

Sorry to say but people are deceived by the name engineer because of that name they feel they don't need a skill which is a very poor mentality because i noticed something school is not even about learning a particular skill but its about learning how to survive and making your life better.

      "body": "These days, the rate at which unemployment increases should be clear enough to send a signal to people, and the rate at which graduates are churned out of the university is enough to tell one to go get a skill. I stumbled upon a video in the past where a former president of the US was saying something related to this. If he, as president, could say such, then you should know that, in time, skilled people are going to take over the economy and workforce. That is why it is advised that one gets a skill—not just a skill but a skill—in line with the trend of development, which would be of good benefit and profit for them in the near future.Currently, the economy of the nation does not warrant one to start looking for a job and staying idle. At least it would be nice and beneficial if you had a skill at hand to help you sustain yourself in the long run. So to remain relevant, it is nice to get engaged by learning a meaningful skill that you will not regret doing in the future.",

In addition to wetting you dey talk@Hewlet. Truck drivers like tipper, selfloader, trailer, forklift, thanker or heavy duty mechanic.My friend wey dey do selfloader work no too sabi book, him learn 5 to 6 different machine and him dey get work steady because him get connection now. Na work dey even posure am. Him dey see money wella. him money in a day go pay white collar job man 1 month salary. Him come later sabi book by this adult school teaching. So one thing wey dey affect us as Nigerians be say if we go school e dey be like say we don arrive. And we deserve better Dan those wey no go.  Life is all about creativity. If you check out most people wey invent wetting we dey use today, na school drup out some self no even aquire the kind educational qualification like you.   So I think school na just a place to learn how to read and write and also be creative and to communicate vividly. So make we no dey decive ourselves. Morover if you check this forum very well, you fit discover say most highly rank up member here are not really educated like the way you think. But because they can communicate through reading and writing. So creativity is the best.",

Waiting for the government to employ you for a job is something that cannot be guaranteed because of the tribalistic sentiment involved in the whole process of the recruitment exercise. Even the government would tell you that they can not employ everybody at the same time and in some instances, they would say there are not enough funds to pay so therefore the employment volume is limited and there is nothing you could do about it So in this case, being self-employed is the only option and to do that, one would need to go for a skill and perfect it so as to attain mastery in the craft.",
