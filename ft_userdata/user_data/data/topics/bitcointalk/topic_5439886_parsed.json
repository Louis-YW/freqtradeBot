  "content": "QuoteTurkish financial watchdog stretched rules to allow crypto donations to help with disaster relief on Feb. 7. The crypto community donated over $4.5 million in seven days to help Turkey with disaster relief.Three wallets were created to collect donations on Feb. 7. Total amount donated sits at slightly over $4.5 million at the time of writing.DonationsAvalanche (AVAX), which Turkish professor Emin Gün Sirer founded, donated $1 million, while Waves (WAVES) founder Sasha.waves donated $50,000 on the first day.Crypto exchange platforms operating in the region Icrypex, Bitget Turkey, Bitci, MexC Turkey, Bitfinex Turkey, OKX, and Gate.io collectively donated $371,499, which equates to 7 million Turkish Lira.Turkish and global crypto influencers and many others also contributed thousands of dollars in crypto to help with disaster relief in the region.BackgroundAfter three significant earthquakes struck Turkey, a Turkish singer Haluk Levent persuaded the country’s financial watchdog (MASAK) to allow collecting crypto donations, which is currently illegal in the country.MASAK allowed three crypto wallets to collect donations for a week. Wallets belong to Levent, who publishes all significant contributions and expenses on his Twitter account.https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-aids-for-turkey-exceed-4-5m-in-one-week/....Interesting.QuoteAfter three significant earthquakes struck Turkey, a Turkish singer Haluk Levent persuaded the country’s financial watchdog (MASAK) to allow collecting crypto donations, which is currently illegal in the country.MASAK allowed three crypto wallets to collect donations for a week. Wallets belong to Levent, who publishes all significant contributions and expenses on his Twitter account.Is it possible that crypto based donations carry a significant advantage over gofundme and other platforms which denominate only in single currencies of fiat? Not everyone in the world has access to digital dollars to donate on US based platforms. National currencies can be limiting in terms of them expressly being used inside the borders of the nation which issues them. The US dollar losing its position as an international reserve currency can only accelerate this process for the USA.Global cryptocurrencies by contrast, can be commonly held and used by residents of all nations. Which could give crypto based donation services a distinct advantage over the digital dollar, yuan, ruple and other assorted national currencies.While I'm not 100% familiar with what happened to the unfortunate residents in turkey's recent earthquake zones. AFAIK it seems a major fault line in turkey ruptured producing more chaos and unfortunate events than we see from most quakes. Real estate located on fault lines are higher risk for earthquake and tsunami damage as indicated by the fukushima disaster which was also constructed on a fault line.The advantage of purchasing and developing real estate located on fault lines is lower cost land. Real estate located on fault lines being cheaper and more affordable in contrast to more stable and reliable land masses. The disadvantages however are greater probability of sink holes, earthquakes, tsunamis and similar natural disasters. For real estate development purposes, living purposes and survival purposes. It can be well worth it to check and see if land that is being developed, lived upon or invested in is located along a fault line.",

The donations might have some impact on the views of government, after all, cryptos are being an useful tool to help turkish citizens and authorities may want to be thankful for that, finally accepting the positive potential they can have in a society, including during crisis times like the one Turkey is suffering right now.",

There are many people that would have wanted to participate in donations all around the world, but the high fee and inaccessibility of a preferred payment method would prevent them from doing so.Bitcoin and other cryptos have put an end to that, and within a few minutes, they can make their donations, and this comes with a ridiculously low transaction fee.So, expect more soon.",

To change the policy, I think they will still follow the procedure especially measuring how much ability they have to handle the risk side.",

There is believe that some buildings could have not collapsed if at all the urban transformation by the government of having buildings earthquake safe had been adhered to. According to the news the law wasn’t compulsory and people without funds for rebuilding were not compelled to do so. Thus so many buildings collapsed even estates that were supposed to be standard. Another surprising thing in the turkey earthquakes was the collapse of some new government buildings and schools. According to AlJazeera reports even countries Disaster and Emergency Management Authority building collapsed. So even the new buildings are still been constructed with sub par materials.",

This disastrous event has led to wide spread devastation, with over 4000 buildings destroyed and numerous casualties. The effort to provide rapid aid to those affected is crucial, it is equally important to make sure that distribution of aid is free from any kind of bias or discrimination. We should also take resumes to ensure that funds are utilized appropriately and reach all those who in need, regardless of any demographic or social distinctions.",

Of the many advantages, the most forefront is tax savings, this will benefit the donor or the recipient of the donation.Any government must open their eyes to the convenience offered by blockchain technology, when a disaster strikes a country it will make it easier for any party around the world to send aid directly without using intermediaries.",
