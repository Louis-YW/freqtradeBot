Quote from: Obari on December 09, 2022, 03:50:48 PM~why do you think people still start making losses on real accounts after long time trading demo successfully A newbie can also lost on demo account.If the profit was more while using demo account, but losses was more while using real money to trade, it is because of emotion, but lack of good strategies can also be part of the reasons. Like today, I won little amount of money, I close the trade, but knowing that the market will still go up, the market when up and I am not that excited. If it is demo account, that emotion will not exist during profit and losses, and making the trade not to be a real one.",

Like in demo trading, you may wait for your sl to hit before exiting a trade, but you would make silly mistakes with real account and try to exit way before the sl is taken (thinking about minimizing loss) then take opposite trade to get back those smaller losses, but they catch you naked in the end. You can forget a fake trade, but you'll never forget the real one. And remember, The more you stare on your open trade, the more the chances become of making mistakes!",

Because you are can be considered as a pro trader if your demo trading portfolio has high win rate since you can only experience consistency on trading if you have a strategy. The only factor that I know that will make a successful trader on demo that will lose on actual game is when he is trading money that he can't afford to lose.",

Demo account is just like a trial and error phase for you, and the real challenge here is that when you finally deposit real money and start trading with it. Many trader loses their money instantly because they failed to analyze and they forget not to focus too much with their emotion.

But then again, this entails real money so just a simple mistake will make you lose money. So we shouldn't compare the two, at least take advantage of the demo account. But it doesn't mean that you can replicate it to real trading account so we have to get that on our mind when we go on real accounts.",

Because there are a lot of changes when you start trading on real accounts, the orders, buy walls, sell walls are all real now compared to demo accounts. You still can't guarantee it here.And also, even if you are in demo accounts, you still can't always do 100%.2. It's part of the trading, you will lose sometimes. That's why some people are using real accounts to practice so they are more aware but this is risky though.Also with proper risk management, it will help you especially in real accounts because you know that it's really so you need to preserve your capital.",

Although, in trading, it is better to practice with small amount of money like $10 to $15 with a less volatile market. Demo is to test how trading works. After you check that, you can use small money to practice, while increasing it after some months if the profit is getting bigger and much more than the loss. I remember when I saw an IQ option trading online, I downloaded an app for it, tried the demo and I lost all the whole fake money given me and I did not bother to use money to trade at that time. In crypto, no even better deme when I started, I just use video guides that the exchanges provided and I used small amount of money instead of demo, but I can easily first just start with demo and use it for like 30 minutes to see how the trading works and move to use small amount of money. I too do not see demo to be necessary, but not useless to be seen to demonstrate how trading works, but I wonder why people turn to it as a means to help during trading, which is not, small amount of money should be used for that, not demo, but demo can be used for testing how trading works.",

I am not using demo at all, but I have a friend that has no money to trade few months ago and use demo to take just $500 to $45000 in just one week, that fake profit is huge, but when he has money, he is only making few profit and he has never yet gotten to that amount, he was even broke from trading and he has not even gotten close that that profit before in real trading. He told me one thing, that in demo, when he is gaining, he still leave the fake fund profit and money grows to bigger amount, but in real trading which is with real money, emotion set, if he has won little, he close the position he opened.
