  "content": "I am a member of Bitcointalk forum since 2018 but never found the need to write until today!BC.GAME is trying to SCAM ME. I deposited about 2k usdt, I took 2 bets in live sports and now they are refusing to payout. Live chat does not answer, no reply on emails either. Discord link doesn't allow to get in!Unbelievable! They requested KYC documents but when I go there it says \"All information are submitted\"  (sic) even though i DID NOT UPLOAD DOCUMENTS, I JUST STARTED FILLING MY INFORMATION AND THE NEXT TIME IT SAYS THAT! There is no option to upload my documents!I am going to complain to Curacao Gambling Authorities and in all other betting forums IF THEY  don't restore access to my account. Below are the screenshotsUPDATE : Case was solved after 80 days of my funds being frozen, after lots of KYC documents, emails back and forth and too much emotional disstress.",

Game. Ops need to, first of all, move the thread to the causation board and also make sure to include all the necessary evidence that will make the case clearer to understand.",

This is just my opinion, they hold the remaining balance you still didn’t complete the wagering requirements for your total balance while you are withdrawing the rest already.Also, Your screenshot shows that you didn’t reply right the live support became online.
