Sorry to tell you OP that consider it as a loss as no one will be able to help you to recover it. One big thing that you can do is to tell us what's the website for everyone's awareness and how did you ended up depositing big amount on that website.",

Thanks Just consider the money gone, this is what has become your reality at this time and why should you invest in a third-party platform when you can also just hold your Bitcoin in your wallet rather than trusting a third party with your funds?You can see what is happening with the Bitcoin market at the moment and if you have not lost your funds to scammers all in the name of investment then, we have a hard to deal with several such issues of scams all in the name of investments.",

First explain why you invest your money on that website and why that amount of money, what was the return on your investment.

This is a lesson for us or beginners who begin to invest, Even if your story is true or fake, but your kind of story is often to hear. I don't know what the function of the basic study is if we don't implement it in our real life. In a basic study, the teacher told us or the student to have to research 1st before creating the answer, do not rush to give a decision because the test results will determine your future. It's the same case as our life on investment. A million fake investments out there give enticement to new investors, they bring them to deposit money and give high returns in a short time, it's like the impossible, but still, we often to hear many people get scammed because don't implement in what they learn.",

Thanks If you had said that you lost $200, which is a large sum in my country, your story would have been more believable, but your account is without a record of trust. Quite the contrary, there are some lies and attempts to obtain money through deception, so I advise you not to waste your time by creating more of these topics because no one cares about donating. You may get negative trust that makes your account useless.",

Can someone help me to recovery or with donation i dont have more money i need money back. Thanks OP, I was looking at the scam aspect of your complaints though. If we are to go by you following the right procedures, this board is not the right place for this post  as there is a scam accusations board for such complaints and if you want the process of recovering it, it possibility would be narrow but it would be nice you mention the name and details of the said scam Crypto you invested so that we could know and have idea about it in other for members to be conscious about them.You can relocate this thread to the scam accusations board here.Lastly, begging is not allowed on this platform as it is a no no here. It is against the forum policies and therefore might cost you your account if care is not taken OP. Come to talk of it, you have no reputation here and barely no activities to prove your commitment to this platform and here you are soliciting for assistance. Nobody would listen to you but rather you face the risk of being tagged a scammer too.",

It's likely you have been scammed and sadly you are not going to get your money back but you can help save someone from being a victim by giving more detailed information regarding what happened, like the name of the platform, how you got to know about them. Quote from: pmemorex on June 21, 2023, 09:08:19 PMCan someone help me to recovery or with donation i dont have more money i need money back. Are you asking for donations? Are we running charity here? This is not wise at all and I'm beginning to question the authenticity of your story. How are we sure you truly got scammed or you are not the one try to scam others?",

If you cannot withdraw your money and get an error, I assume you invested in an HYIP website or Ponzi scheme website which is already identified as scammers business. It would be best if you did your own research before investing in any online platform. Never trust platforms that offer you money just from investment without doing anything. Some legit platforms might look for investments, but you have to choose a platform that has existed for a long time and not go away with your money.",

Why are you begging for money by asking donation?OP said that he have been scammed by some website and he still not clarified about the website or websites . So he is probably here to take our sympathy and trying to scam some funds by asking donations.
