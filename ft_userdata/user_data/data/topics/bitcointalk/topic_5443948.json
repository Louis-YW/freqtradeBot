I usually play slots for 0.20 a spin, recently I didn't realise and the default amount was â‚¬1.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on February 26, 2023, 07:00:06 PM<...> I, who always bet â‚¬0.20, in the last slot I didn't notice it, I bet â‚¬1 a couple of times, which was the default amount, I got some free spins and I won â‚¬20. So I was lucky that time.The bad thing about it is that you've run out of money in the casino to bet now unless you deposit.",

I had a similar experience with YOLOdice in terms of losses where I intentionally wagered my remaining balance without hesitation. In just one roll of the dice, two weeks' worth of signature payments were gone in an instant. After that moment, my entire week was filled with distractions, leaving me unproductive.So yeah, hope that it would makes you feel lighter.",

We aren't double checking of triple checking the amount of Bitcoins or whatever currency it is that we are putting in. I learned that lesson already because in the past, I don't often double check the amount of Bitcoin that I'm putting. Not all of them are losses though because there are times where I put a wrong bet, and I got lucky and won, but most of the time when I'm experiencing that I'm losing. Right now, I'm not encountering that kind of problem anymore because I'm always triple checking all of my bets.I hope you will learn from that mistake OP. Don't think too much about that as well. What's important is you learned something from it.",

Losing a bet is a different thing but accidentally placing more than you wanted to is just carelessness. Next time keep your mind free and stay calm before placing any bets. I agree with you when you said losing a bet is a different thing but accidentally placing more than wanted to is just carelessness. Now if someone accidentally placed more than or below the amount he/she wanted is just a little mistake everyone does, for example, if he won the bet he will be happier ðŸ˜Š and he might bet another. What causes such a mistake is when a bet wants to start and it only has 5 seconds to start.",

You should not rush to bet and check the amount first then you might not have lost so much. I have never made such a mistake while gambling but I have made two mistakes in my life1. I accidentally sent a valuable token to the contract address while transferring a token to another wallet. And in this case I lost these tokens of mine2. I sent 0.1 bitcoin to a friend while sending 0.01 bitcoin. Â In this case my friend returned the remaining bitcoins to meI am very careful when gambling which is why I have never done anything like you thought gambling",

I'm quite sure you are not the one who did such mistake but luckily I have never experienced it with big amount. Maybe I did it few times in the past but it was just a matter of few thousands satoshis. Since there is a system where Stake can show our balance into fiat, it is a better option to use to minimize such mistake because the value of our bet in fiat is easier to be recognized if we put the wrong amount. Double checking our bet amount is highly recommended before we click the bet button.",

Iâ€™m just lucky to win the bet before I notice that Iâ€™m making a terrible mistake. After that, Iâ€™m always making sure of the unit and use stablecoin as much as possible to avoid committing this error again.
