      "body": "Did you just read the reply from Oshosondy?. I think you don't mind to buy an account that is very risky to use because if roobet detects that it is a bought account then it will surely be frozen and a frozen balance in an account is not playable or in short it is useless to have an account that is frozen. Why not just create an account to avoid such situation rather than buying which is very risky.Quote from: jocash777 on August 27, 2022, 04:40:05 PMCan you send here or via PM your email? I have accounts you are looking for. It's still risky for the buyer. I'd suggest op to not buy.",

I agree with you if not any KYC had been completed, the casino won't be able to lock the account except if the former owner reports a hack and can prove his ownership with emails or crypto addresses he has used for example. But why someone would buy an account without KYC instead of creating one himself? An account with a KYC already fulfilled is risky because if the casino asks proofs one day the buyer won't be able to give them, but it could be the only solution for people banned from a casino because of their location or because of individual restrictions.",

Is that what you meant?Just wait for it it will probably there will someone who left you a negative tag in your profile because of this behavior.That is why it is not ideal to buy an account, it is risky for the buyer and I think only an idiot person will do this because everyone could make an account not unless your country banned the casino.",

As soon as possible after purchasing the account, should be reset the security pass code of that particular email account.",
