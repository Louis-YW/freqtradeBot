More like some mashup of gambling and taking wild guesses on where prices are headed in the near future.  For sure it can be fun, but luck's got more to do with it than any real trading strategy.  And getting an edge over the casino? Ha! Theyre the house for a reason - odds are stacked in their favor.  So yeah, gonna say that's a nope!",

The difference here is that if you predict the price of the currency pair you choose to gamble with to be in a particular state at your selected time, and when the time is off checking the price list and you happen to have a little price difference, either more than expected or not, won't the game be lost? Price repeats most times, but we can't always expect it to happen that way, because that will make it very simple to predict and the gamblers will have a higher winning chance, which the casino won't allow as it will stop them from making a gain and the gamblers winning all the time. The currency price seems to be hard to predict sometimes as not what we expect is always an end result.",

But from your explanation,  what you describe is still gambling as long as you are just taking part in the coin price predictions,  and not engaging in those coin exchanges at some point let's say we have some level of freedom to speculate the directions the price of that coin we go and it works in our favour,  you win.",

On the other hand, taking into account that the current users of crypto casinos are already familiar with cryptos (obvious) and many of them also like trading, I think that this hybrid can be successful, so chances are that we see this kind of games soon in other betting platforms too.",

I don’t see any advantage knowing the price going up and down if you don’t know exactly when will it happened. Also there’s a lot of wild price swing on crypto market so it’s impossible to take advantage on it. It’s still gambling as far I know. Casino will not offer this kind of game if they don’t have an edge over it.We are still guessing what will be the next move of the price so we are not really on advantage here.",

I do think it's a bit comparable to trading, since it's all about price action but it's still different, predicting on what Bitcoin value will be in the next 24 hours is not the same thing with using charts to follow price actions, you have the chart and the tools available, it's why gambling is a bit comparable to trading too but not exactly the same, since they don't work the same way. Gambling requires your luck more than your skills and trading requires analysis and skills to beat the market and make money, I will always choose trading over gambling for this exact reason anytime.",

It’s actually a type of trading which called options trading or binary trading that you bet on the price of something at the given time duration. I believe the closest game to this is the bull/bear game on pancake swap which user place a side long/short based on the mark price.This game is really exhilarating because you win or lose even on the final seconds due to the volatility of crypto. This very rewarding if you place bet on a side that had few bets on it due to increased of multiplier. I’m not sure exactly how rollbit payout but the pcs bull/bear game has dynamic odds.",

There's really no buffer space like people usually have in high leveraged trading.That being said. I don't hate it. But even crash gives better feeling on what leverage trading is like. 1000x is just too much for anything but luck. Hence the casino hosting it.",

I should take a look at it hoping the odds will be right for good potential winning. I believe it will be gambling and not trading, you just have to analyze and bet normally like other games but predicting the direction of price, whether down or up based on the price mark",

I don't know much about these trading features as I haven't tried them, but I'd rather play my normal game with a random seed than bet on something like this, but some people feel like since this has ties to real life prices of currencies or stocks, it's more predictable and less prone to cheating.",
