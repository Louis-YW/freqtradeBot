I'll add by saying, that another tips is to ask or seek for the experience of those that have been in the business long before you. Learn from their mistakes and build on them too. For it would really go a long way to helping anyone in his decision making while wanting to invest in any way.",

However, I'd like to add that holding may not apply to altcoins other than a few popular ones, such as Ethereum or Binance. Generally, we've seen quite a few altcoins involved in scams, scandals, rug pulls, you name it, such as Celsius, Luna, or FTT. I'm not saying that you can't hold altcoins, but personally, I don't feel comfortable doing so. The only coin I trust holding for long periods is Bitcoin. If you're planning to invest in altcoins, the least you should do is diversify your portfolio.",

You have missed more BTC in your portfolio. You could have increased 4 times of your BTC bag if you would have sold at the peak. Some will say do DCA then but doing DCA in a bear market is another bad idea. So just wait for BTC to find a bottom and then start DCA again till the next bull run.",

Like I have mentioned.Don't use the exchanges to keep your cryptocurrencies yes you should use only for trade or exchange.

Moreover, it is not right to invest without some of the top ranked cryptocurrencies of the cryptocurrency market. Then let's discuss about holding. If you have invested in bullmarket and decide to hold then you have to hold for a long time i.e. long term.¬† Again if you have invested in bear market and decide to hold then you can decide to sell as soon as profit comes in the market.¬† In both cases you have to invest by understanding the market conditions and as usual you have to sell the profit in the market.¬† Under no circumstances should you overindulge.¬† Because excessive greed in the cryptocurrency market must lead to losses instead of profits.",
