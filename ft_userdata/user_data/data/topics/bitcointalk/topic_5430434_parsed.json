Thats a really big amount for most of the average working people.Quote from: Dimi Neutron on December 20, 2022, 07:42:59 AMIt is (was) a paper wallet I generated in bitaddress.org. I generated it online, in my workThats the problem. If you generated it online, you cant say it as a paper wallet. Its an online web-wallet and your keys can be stolen if you have trojen/malware in your pc, as simple as that.

Put it on a USB stick.Offline and running without hard drive storage:Get a Linux LIVE DVD. Use Knoppix or Tails for instance, or any other distribution that comes with Electrum pre-installed.Unplug your internet cable. Close the curtains. Reboot your computer and start up from that DVD. Don't enter any wireless connection password. Keep it offline.Start Electrum. Import your private key.Copy your unsigned transaction from the USB stick, load it into Electrum.CHECK the transaction in Electrum. Check the fees, check the amount, check all destination addresses (character by character).If all is okay, sign the transaction. Copy it back to your USB stick.Turn off the computer. That wipes the Live LINUX from memory and all traces are gone.Online:Use your normal online Electrum to (check again and) broadcast the transaction.",

If anyone else copied the private key, he could steal your money.A paper wallet as you've done it is a private key and an address. Those can be kept on paper, but some keep it (wrongly!) in e-mail or cloud storage, giving others the chance to steal.Plus if your computer has malware, for example, it was open to the internet.These are the first possibilities coming into my mind.Quote from: Dimi Neutron on December 20, 2022, 07:42:59 AMAnother thing is your opinion about one method I'm thinking for generate a paper wallet in bitaddress.org.

If people say it's OK, fine, but such a tool can easily generate the keys even by a certain rule and make it easy to recover by the site owner. I would use a wallet to generate the private key.Apart of the first step and using a paper wallet generator, the rest of the steps look pretty good (although booting from an USB stick with a live OS with no persistence would achieve that easier).I would use Bitcoin core (offline, without downloading blockchain) or Electrum (offline) at first step and, as a later step, I would recover the wallet from the private key and make sure the address is the one expected (so you avoid surprises there too).Later edit: if you invest into amounts like 0.4 BTC, is it so difficult to invest in a hardware wallet? It would be safer and easier even for making yourself some sort of paper wallets, if you still want those.",

Everybody tells that the bitaddress' website is safe. Is that so?It is (so far) been as safe as a website can be. But be aware that websites are generally a poor choice to generate private keys in the first place, and other paper wallet websites which were perfectly legitimate for years suddenly turned in to scams and resulted in lots of people having their coins stolen. I would agree with the advice above to generate your keys using Core or Electrum instead.Quote from: Dimi Neutron on December 20, 2022, 07:42:59 AMThe idea is to enter in the website and switch off the internet. The next steps will all be done without any internet:Turning off the internet for 5 minutes on a computer which has had frequent or constant internet access prior to this achieves almost nothing. The process needs to be done on a dedicated airgapped computer - that is one which has never had any internet access since you last formatted it and installed an open source Linux distro, and will never have any internet access again. You also need to connect that airgapped computer directly to an old fashioned dumb printer which does not have any internal memory or WiFi capabilities.",

Disconnecting from the internet and wiping the hard drive before generating the wallet can help to reduce the risk of interception or compromise.

When he started printing wallets the powers that be educated themselves as well or led OP to a trap.I think this scenario more likely than bitaddress.org being compromised I don't rule it out though.And to be fair on a newbie's behalf, bitaddress.org doesn't really elaborate that much on security, Air gapping, or anything commonsense really,A byproduct singular person coding without UX consultation.The information's portrayed to a more advanced person that probably knows how to generate their own wallet as if they can use PGP and checksums and things of this nature.They don't tell you anything until after you've made the wallet causing you to react uninformed.Not a guy who heard about it on his smoke break at his 8-5.Quote from: https://www.bitaddress.org/A Bitcoin wallet is as simple as a single pairing of a Bitcoin address with its corresponding Bitcoin private key. Such a wallet has been generated for you in your web browser and is displayed above.To safeguard this wallet you must print or otherwise record the Bitcoin address and private key. It is important to make a backup copy of the private key and store it in a safe location. This site does not have knowledge of your private key. If you are familiar with PGP you can download this all-in-one HTML page and check that you have an authentic version from the author of this site by matching the SHA256 hash of this HTML with the SHA256 hash available in the signed version history document linked on the footer of this site. If you leave/refresh the site or press the \"Generate New Address\" button then a new private key will be generated and the previously displayed private key will not be retrievable. Your Bitcoin private key should be kept a secret. Whomever you share the private key with has access to spend all the bitcoins associated with that address. If you print your wallet then store it in a zip lock bag to keep it safe from water. Treat a paper wallet like cash.Add funds to this wallet by instructing others to send bitcoins to your Bitcoin address.Check your balance by going to blockchain.info or blockexplorer.com and entering your Bitcoin address.Spend your bitcoins by going to blockchain.info and sweep the full balance of your private key into your account at their website. You can also spend your funds by downloading one of the popular bitcoin p2p clients and importing your private key to the p2p client wallet. Keep in mind when you import your single key to a bitcoin p2p client and spend funds your key will be bundled with other private keys in the p2p client wallet. When you perform a transaction your change will be sent to another bitcoin address within the p2p client wallet. You must then backup the p2p client wallet and keep it safe as your remaining bitcoins will be stored there. Satoshi advised that one should never delete a wallet.",

I always suggest people should use Core or Electrum over bitaddress or any other website in order to generate wallets.There are plenty of other explanations for the pattern of transactions see though. Perhaps several other people at OP's company also generated paper wallets using bitaddress, which were then stored on some server or printer memory bank or similar. This was hacked or otherwise accessed, and therefore the attacker accessed all the wallets at the same time and swept them all at once. Or perhaps OP also uploaded a copy of his paper wallet to his email or cloud storage, and again, a hack or rogue employee or similar then discovered his wallet at the same time as several other wallets, seed phrase back ups, or similar.",

It might not have even been someone at that company. A lot of places use external MSPs for things.It's a somewhat simple task for most of the software that is placed on corporate PCs for monitoring / remote service and things to generate an alert when something happens / someone goes to a specific site and so on.So if it's an external 3rd party that has access for legitimate reasons, and one of their staff has setup and alert to send an email to them when users go to a specific site and then record all actions done then, they could easily get 5 private keys from 5 people in different parts of the world. Then you delete the alert and data as part of the 'monthly database clean' or whatever and tan you take the BTC and run.Now 5 people who never met each other, some of them who do not even know what the name of the MSP their company uses is have missing coins. Good luck tracking that down. In theory figuring it out is very simple. Since the MSP is the common link. In reality since if they did it with a bit of thought, everyone worked for a different company and every company has a no private work on the work PC it's even better. Do you eat the loss or report it and risk loosing your job. -Dave",
