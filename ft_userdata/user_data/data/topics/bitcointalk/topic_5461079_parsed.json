I would say this is similar to adding passphrase or 2FA to a wallet that has passcode already. But just like Charles-Tim said, it is not secure when the device is faced by malware through phishing, example can be the clipboard malware. Just get a Wallet and back up it’s recovery seeds well",

Mind you that this feature wouldn't even protect you from a targeted local attack, because it is a very popular feature and the attacker would surey know about it, so you should always encrypt your wallet file.Needless to say that your wallet isn't safe from hack if you use this feature because any wallet that is online is prone to hack, and your wallet is online. If you want your wallet to be safe from hack you'll have to use it on a completely air-gapped device, or just get a hardware wallet.",

A phone password, finger print or pin only protects unauthorized access of people to your device, it does not protect the wallet and keys you have in that device. Take note that BTC is not stored in wallets, but on the network, so as long as you have your keys in any online wallet and use that device to browse and do many stuffs online, the wallet in that device is prone to hack and is not safe.",

I have also read someone said using biometric is bad because if it's faulty you need to go phone repair shop which is a risk.

I know there is encryption of the memory that holds sensitive apps, but I don't know how it works and that's why I kept mentioning the difficulty level.A secure folder is basically an isolated virtual environment for your apps that makes it much easier to separate sensitive-related applications and those that don't need any secret keys to perform their functions. There is a special secure mechanism in each Android or iPhone that encrypts passwords and private keys, stores them in a protected area, and sends decrypted data back to the apps that have a right to access certain parts of information. What's interesting is that apps using secret keys don't actually know what the values of these keys are since all sensitive information remains inside the protected area. So far, so good. But for cryptocurrency applications such as software wallets, it is necessary to have access to private keys in plain text in order to be able to sign messages and produce signatures. In other words, the information you keep inside the secure folder remains private as long as you don't touch a software wallet sitting inside it to send or receive funds. Once the wallet is unlocked, all seed phrases and private keys that belong to the given wallet become much easier to steal because the wallet stores and manipulates them in plaintext.",

If your biometric data is stolen or lost, it could be permanently compromised.Duplication: In some ways, biometric credentials are easier to obtain and duplicate than access cards or keys, because we quite literally leave our biometric footprints and fingerprints everywhere we go. Criminals are learning to copy biometric details by lifting fingerprints off glass, or even capturing voice recordings.When your biometric are stolen, data base is compromised, you are done. Because simply said, you can change your passwords billion of times if you want but you can not change your biometric.It sounds seriously but I am against Fingerprint Biometrics for kids. We as parents should not leak our kids biometrics easily like this.",

It is just not feasible to bruteforce passwords in this manner, especially when you need the file as well. Malware will just steal the password.Android phones and IOS usually operate their apps within their own sandbox which makes it more secure than other OSes in a sense. However, because they are such an attractive target, malwares are often catered to attack the zero days on the platform. Samsung Knox goes a step above the vanilla Android OS and does hardware level isolation and theoretically it should be more secure.Regardless, I wouldn't consider anything that you're moving around with and having the potential of misplacing as being secure.",
