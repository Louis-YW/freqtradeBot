  "content": "Hi Guys!As we move into 2023, there are  https://cryptoticker.io/en/best-crypto-vcs/ several VCs that stand out as particularly promising. These firms have a strong track record of investing in successful cryptocurrency projects and have demonstrated an ability to navigate the constantly evolving landscape of the crypto market. What I want to know here is What do you think are the most important qualities for a VC to have when investing in cryptocurrency projects? and who do you think are the top VCs in the cryptocurrency space, and why?",

      "body": "Three arrows capital used to be my best VC pick out of the 100's of them in the space but after their blow-up, I come to the conclusion that these guys are not better than any of us, it is just that they have the privilege of sitting at the decision table. Can you name one of these VCs that do not dump on retailers or take advantage of private information because they are very close to the team? If Alamada and 3AC can blow up then any of them can, so do not base your investment thesis on any of these guys they are not their friend but you are their sheep",

      "body": "I have worked with multiple VC's in my crypto life, both worked as a customer and also worked as an employee at the same time. I can guarantee you that they are not looking at what makes you the most money, they look at what makes them the most money. If that aligns and them making profit means you making profit, they will do their best to pick the best one, they could of course be wrong, they are humans after all, but they would be legit in that case and work hard to make you money since that means money in their pockets too.However, if there is a method where they could make a profit while you do not make a profit, they would take that too, hence why I stay away from all VC's as much as I can.",
