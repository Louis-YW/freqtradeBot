In fact this happened a couple of years ago under the name \"stress test\". In one of the steps of this attack the attackers released a large number of private keys and then started funding them. That meant not only the mempool was spammed with pointless transactions but also it was spammed with competing double spend transactions increasing the burden on full nodes.This will not solve anything either. For starters these keys are publicly known so technically the attacker can know this is fake as well!Additionally when someone is physically attacked they are not going to hesitate giving up their possessions to save themselves. As @Jawhead999 pointed out the attacker may hurt the victim more after seeing such an active wallet with so much money changing hand to force them to give up their money.The only way to prevent that is to find a way not to be under attack!The better solution is using the extended seed phrase. That is where you add an extra word to your own seed phrase, the seed phrase without that extra word is the decoy that can contain a small amount of coins.The lack of activity is not as big a problem as you say because most bitcoin wallets aren't as active as you'd think and most importantly they are NOT empty.To top if all, the biggest flaw in your idea is that every single coin received in these wallets are spent immediately which is shouting \"fake wallet\"!!!",

In case a serious criminal is asking for your bitcoins , he will likely just rip out one of your fingernails before he even starts talking to you, just to make sure you fully undertstand the situation........ so maybe have a wallet with a decent amount of bitcoins available to hand over and avoid additional health issues....",

      "body": "The most effective and highly workable way is to use multiple wallets to store your Bitcoin. Multiple wallets with multiple seed phrases will always be helpful in such situations. Don't store all your Bitcoin in a single wallets as that can give clear clue to attackers that how much Bitcoin you have but if you set multiple wallets and store 0.05 Bitcoin or more in each wallet then you'll be safe in long term.Even if you face those attackers then you can give them one of your wallets and save rest of your wallets from such attackers. In fact it's way better than using any kind of decoy wallets and it's also safe. That's why people prefer privacy and if you really want to be safe from such attacks then you should never share with anyone that how much Bitcoin you have. That way you'll be much safe than any other way.",

Are you worried about the risk of a physical attack to steal your assets?To be more careful after being fearful about risk, reading those Bitcoin physical attack stories can help.QuoteYou can protect yourself by setting up fake wallets using the following seed phrases. These seeds have already been used and have a history, making them suitable for creating decoy wallets.I will not apply this because I don't believe criminals who want to kidnap me, will not learn basic about Bitcoin and wallets.They kidnap me and ask me to show them my wallet, I am sure they will want to see its balance. If the balance is empty or very small, they will not satisfy.If I am a criminal, I will send bitcoins in the victim wallet or ask the victim to make a transaction to complete my attack. I would become very angry if knowing the victim tries to fool me with a decoy wallet. So you can imagine what will happen next, the victim can be killed.I will decentralize my fund to different wallet and only store small wallet on my mobile. So if I get kidnapped, I will give this wallet to criminals with hope that I can save my life. My life is more important than a small wallet and if I can sacrifice it to save my ass, I will do it.Using a decoy wallet and risk my life, no.",

You can or cannot use this, Its a free service2. If you want to use it, use the wallet that align best with your real wallet3. A Small Transactions happening weekly wont hurt anything4. Also for instantly spending money, you can always make up story of putting funds in a exchange or a trading website.5. I am getting few projects on board, websites and scripts that accept regular bitcoin payments, we will lot more wallets and transactions The best way to avoid these attacks isto let him think you lost it all while trading - If he doesn't believe ( lets say 50-50)you might have 300$ in exchange or a temporary wallet you made ( You actual decoy wallet or stake.com or a exchange )Give him 300$, and walk home safely The point is having a decoy wallet doesn't hurt, also this is free service ofcourse you can use your brain to have a better alternative, i did not cater this service towards experienced or expert bitcoin users, its for general massesGood Luck Thanks For Pointing out, the waiting between factor, we will see something with time lock or something else, as service grows",
