I have no idea what to do with it or how to use it.Divide your money into three parts, use some part of your winning to invest on bitcoin and follow the DCA purchasing pattern, keep your coins on the wallet and not centralized exchanges, use another portion for your intended stake affiliate book and the last portion into another physical form of asset that can be visible to you and accessible, a good example is gold or real estate.",

He has a good chance of doubling that amount  I find it a little unrealistic that someone with 2.2 million in a casino account, comes here for advice. considering that it is about a giveaway and throwing away that money, I would rather say that he wants to make \"new friends\" who will be good to him and ask for some money.",

You can start by dividing the amount to any amount you desire like you will use 10% for giveaways, 25% savings,  25% investments if you plan to invest, 15%-30% for business and the rest will be for daily needs. That's only an example on what you will do with that money. Anyway, what are you planning with the forum?. What do you really mean about how to navigate? Do you mean navigate in this forum?

Damn it..this is money can change your life you know,withdraw it then you can sit down relax and think on how to invest with the money. I will advice you to buy Bitcoin with half of the money since Bitcoin price is down so you will be having enough btc and when Bitcoin hits the bull market, man it will be like you gamble you just won so much big profit.You can use share the other part into two and use one part to invest in a business to back up your Bitcoin holdings and the last part of the money,can be used for any purpose of yours.",

If thats a yes bro use that money to start a business and invest some in crypto like Bitcoin and few others.Just because you won that 2.2m doesn't mean stake website will be alive like Bitcoin.If your hands are itching then write something about Bitcoin, build books about Bitcoin, not a gambling website that could ruin your rep in future.",

At that point, I had around 300k in the bank, Was down around 200k in total, Felt lucky and I said fuck it what could go wrong  I knew in my head that a lot of things could go wrong but I went with it. I also opened a Twitter account to share my wins and start that affiliate thing I mentioned before. https://twitter.com/StakeDegen That's my Twitter. I already cashed everything out, around 1.8M to the bank and I have some crypto left. I'm starting to like the forum a lot, I also thank all of you who took the time to respond to me  Wish everyone good luck in their betting, and have a good day.",

I am in the crypto space since 2017 but never win as much money as you can right (it makes me jealous lol). with that much winnings, you should be able to invest the majority of the money into bitcoin, the future price of bitcoin will rise high, and now is a good opportunity to buy and multiply.I'm sure you are too busy with your take account so you rarely spend more time on this forum, you have to learn slowly, keep doing what is in accordance with the rules given, and don't do things that are prohibited in this forum (cheating, plagiarism and begging for merit).",

I'm not saying it's impossible to win this much money, but it makes it difficult for people to accept it when you ask what to do with and how to spend the $2.2 million you earned. Only happiness alone will give you the right sense to buy hundreds of bitcoin, housing estates, skyscrapers, etc. If you actually won that amount, you will be well-known throughout your nation. I can't win that much money and remain silent.",
