According to CryptoAPIs[1] (which seem to offer what you're looking for):QuoteWallet as a Service (WaaS) is a highly secure and scalable crypto wallet infrastructure, offering flexible options for digital assets management for businesses and institutions of all sizes. If this is the service you're referring to, besides the solution provided by bitmover, I also found another named Blockcypher[2].[1]https://cryptoapis.io/products/wallet-as-a-service[2]https://www.blockcypher.com/dev/bitcoin/#introduction",

And how did you end up using block.io if you can do it manually with your wallet unless you want them to automate withdrawal in your own website where your users requesting for withdrawal or payout so BTCpayserver is the right choice for this and they do support LTC.",
