  "content": "Hi everyone:I should admit that I haven't been up to speed on crypto-mining lately. I built my rig a few years back and had it running and do its thing in my basement. Here's my setup:- I have 4 (genuine) GeForce GTX 1060 cards, each with 6GB of video RAM. (Bought them on newegg, so I'm assuming it's not a Chinese knockoff.)- Mobo: ASUS PRIME Z270-A LGA 1151 Intel Z270 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.1 ATX Motherboards - Intel- CPU is: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6100 CPU @ 3.70GHz- RAM: 8 GB - Single DDR4 2666 MT/s (PC4-21300) SR x8 DIMM 288-Pin Memory- Drive: SSD -- 128 GB -- ADATA SU800 M.2 2280 128GB Ultimate 3D NAND- Power supply: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000 G3, 80 Plus Gold 1000WI was using the open-source ethminer to mine ETH for a couple years or so. Through the following command line:Code:ethminer.exe -P stratum://0xmy_eth_id.my_mining_rig:x@us2.ethermine.org:14444So a few days back I got a notification from the mining pool that it hasn't received any good hashes. I checked my mining rig, rebooted it, and it was showing the following errors upon the start of the ethminer:Code:ethminer 0.19.0-alpha.0Build: windows/release/msvcNo OpenCL platforms found i 06:27:07 main     Configured pool us2.ethermine.org:14444 i 06:27:07 <unknown> Selected pool us2.ethermine.org:14444 i 06:27:07 <unknown> Negotiation of EthereumStratum/2.0.0 failed.

So I did that as well, raised it to 50GB:rebooted, but the miner was still showing the same error.Any idea what is going on there?",

On older video cards, ethminer works fine.",
