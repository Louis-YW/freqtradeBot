  "content": "Just happened across this article about Antpool offering to refund someone their over paid transactionfees of $3,000,000.https://unchainedcrypto.com/bitcoin-mining-firm-antpool-offers-refund-for-3-million-record-transfer-fee/QuoteOn Nov. 23, a Bitcoin wallet address attempted to transfer 139.42 BTC to another address, but ended up spending 83.7 BTC on transaction fees, which was captured by Antpool on block 818087.From the article its clear that the mining pool was able to automatically freeze the transaction, this is agood news story, any abnormal transactions like this one are able to be flagged, massively ver bought feesare able to be refunded and it proves that Antpool are not scammers, they appear to be doing the right thing,This creates a good vibe and says a lot for the Bitcoin community in general.Thought I would post here to share with everyone rather than the Mining Board.The user had until yesterday to confirm \"their identity\"QuoteThe team behind the mining pool asked the user to verify his or her personal identity either by preparing Electrum or Bitcoin Core signing tool, rousing the private keys of the address associated with the transaction to sign the message “AntPool.” The user will have until Dec. 10 to prove their identity.",

      "body": "I think I have come across this similar post on the forum, where the possibility of the original owner not being able to receive this money was being discussed as the transaction that was executed was done by some hackers who have made their way to the original owner's wallet. So now there is also a higher possibility of the hackers signing in the message and making sure that the fund could also be refunded to the original wallet where it left, and if that's done, the hackers will still make away with the money just under the nose of the original owner. If ownership has not yet been proven over the past few days and suggestions in respect to how just the original owners could be able to verify and claim ownership have been made, I will suggest they either use an old address that has interacted with the address before for such verification, and if that's possible and ownership has been proven, then they can decide on which wallet they want the refund to be sent to, because returning to the original address is not safe at all.",

Miners confirm your tx and earn whatever tx fee you attach to the tx, you have to ensure you pay an appropriate fee, and not overpay, because the mining pool may not be kind enough to return it to you.F2pool refunded Paxos 19.8 BTC after they overpaid in tx fees some months ago and now this case, i hope it does not set a precedent and when one mining pool decides not to refund someone for an overpayment in fees, they begin to cry 'scam', when it surely is not.",

We cant really be able to tell if they are really just that honest or what but since everything could really be seen on chain then if a certainMiner or pool would be able to recieve out such huge fees then it would be normal that everyone on this world or crypto space would be aware of their name on which on the  time that they would be decidingon not to give out those fees then it would really be creating that kind of buzz and would really be ending up on tainting up their reputation and would really be getting tons of negative impressionstowards them and this is something that they dont really like. So they would really be choosing instead on giving back those fees back rather than on trying to mess up their reputation.",

I did some research, as a result of which I received the seed phrase of the wallet from which 139 BTC were stolen. I have evidence that this seed phrase was not generated by chance. if the owner did not create it himself, and this seed phrase was generated for him by some wallet, then I can provide evidence of non-random generation, as a result of which the owner will be able to go to court and recover lost funds from the creators of the wallet. In return I ask for a reward of 10%. I ask the owner of the lost funds to contact me. telegram @Crypto_Validator https://i.postimg.cc/5yy2yzWw/139btc.jpg]",
