  "content": "Hello guys. Greetings from Agbe.Life is full with Irony and anyone says he or she has not faced Irony in life that person is not truthful. Just like the HOLY BOOK (Bible), Jesus Christ says, anyone says that he/she had not sin, that person is a lier. Irony is the opposite of what one's thinks and act. Even in this forum must newbies, Jr. Members, Members + etc gave up to participate Because they could not realized their ambition. Most people are here for Bounty Hunting, Signature campaign, Merit, etc. Most of them got Irony at the end of it. Now the decreasing rate of bitcoin is an IRONY to a lot of BITCONNERS in the world. I am composing this thread because a neighbor of mine was crying very seriously yesterday and when I asked him the reason he said, he sold his golds and other properties worth ($1800) to buy bitcoin in the month of March when bitcoin was still high but Ironically bitcoin drastically come down to $22,525.77 and now he needs money to pay his bills but he can't sell his coins because of the price. I just encouraged him not gave up. He should have faith that bitcoin will go up again. And also in the month of April when bitcoin was coming down, some users in this forum predicted that it would rise up by the 22nd of May, 2022 and that also became an Irony.What you expect does not come to pass means it is an Irony. Therefore human life is full with Irony.Many people killed themselves (suicide) because of Irony. There are some people registered last month but they are not active again because of one issue to the other.FinallyIn any platform, forum, organization, institution company etc what the staff or the masses need is not what the leaders need and that causes Irony among them. If I continue, I would not stop so let me drop my tintinbabulation golden pen here.",

There's no irony here unless you treat Bitcoin as a safe scheme to get rich overnight. But if you consider Bitcoin as a risky investment, as a volatile asset, then you'd certainly be expecting that there will be times when the price falls. There's nothing ironic really. Bitcoin never promised to make poor people rich.",

If Bitcoin needs the government's and the Central Bank's protection to grow. If Bitcoin requires the participation of banks or other financial intermediaries for transactions. If Bitcoin becomes highly centralized as opposed to its goal of decentralization.It would be nice if you can share these points with your friend.1) Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme.2) Bitcoin is an investment. And just like every investment it has it's own risks attached.3) Invest only what you can afford to loose.4) DYOR -  Always do your own research.5) The market doesn't care about your feelings.",

If bitcoin promised people that they might get wealthy merely by buying or investing, I may consider it ironic. However, this is not the case, as price fluctuation has nothing to do with bitcoin's speculative nature. It's just that people end up crying because they don't have a financial plan or didn't bother to ask or understand bitcoin beforehand Apart from that, the only irony I can see is about centralizing a crypto exchange and wallets out of a decentralised technology.",

What's even the point of crying when he is only having an unrealized loss, you don't lose in bitcoin investment until you sell.

Investing in something you don't understand, at a time when we're obviously on a downward trajectory and at a time when the whole world is exposed to inflation and on the brink of recession, can only result in a loss. In addition to all of the above, how can someone invest the money they use to pay their bills into something as volatile as Bitcoin?

I personally thought we weren’t going to go this low a couple of months ago, but I was wrong like some others who thought we avoided crypto winter. I would not call all this irony, but only a cruel reality that slaps us from time to time to remind us that life is not a flat road but a road with many holes and humps.",

Showing and telling people about bitcoin is one thing, but I don't think it's a good idea to help them invest. Prior to this, I believe a person must himself come to an understanding of the future loss, and thus after, the absence of the guilty, except for himself.I have never met analysts who could confidently predict the next move in the price of bitcoin. And no matter how much I read that everything is about to recover, bitcoin exists on its own separate system.But if your neighbor begins to draw conclusions, then he will certainly be experienced in further steps towards various kinds of financial transactions.And yes, this story does not look like irony; it is too painful for such people.
