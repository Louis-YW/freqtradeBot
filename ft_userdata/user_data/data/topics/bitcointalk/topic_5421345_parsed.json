      "body": "This is the biggest discount so far among the hardware wallet brands. Their web shop seems quite slow at the moment. Maybe it's getting more attention than usual because people are taking advantage of discounted prices.It seems the prices will be further decreased. When you open the main page, you are welcomed with a huge banner that says there will be a 40% discount starting from tomorrow. It takes you to their Twitter feed and from there you need to join their Discord server to get more info.",

Sounds like good value to me, but I'd have to try it for myself.I'll think about it and maybe order one..",

Sounds like good value to me, but I'd have to try it for myself.That is a good price, but few bucks more for Pro version is absolutely worth it, battery is much better and rechargeable, there is fingerprint sensor, and it has Anti-Tamper Self-Destruct Mechanism.I am not sure how good that anti-tamper mechanism is, but it's better to have it if you can, and Essential version doesn't have it at all.Now they started with even bigger 40% discount, but you need to do some twitter activity and join their discord, maybe you can even write few words about Passport wallet https://nitter.poast.org/KeystoneWallet/status/1593272854887378944#m",

Right now, you get an automatic 30% discount as soon as you add one of their hardware wallets to your cart. When I went to check out and applied the CUSTODY1 discount code, the price dropped some more, the site seems to have accepted the code, but I got a pop-up notice saying \"Enter a valid discount code\". Removing the code and adding it again got rid of the error message, but it makes me wonder whether or not it will work or not. There must be a reason why it popped up in the first place.",
