  "content": "While going through the service board. I found an ANN on LocalMonero/AgoraDesk! I know sometime back @pakhitheboss created a topic - Sell your Bitcoin for INR or Buy Bitcoin using INR anonymously on localmonero a few months back.I went ahead and registered on that platform. While registering I found they do not do email verification. I found it very interesting. The next step for me was to understand the layout. The dashboard is easy to understand. DASHBOARD Creating your own AD for either buying/selling BTC is available. Otherwise, you can click the trade icon and see the offers. The buying offers are also good with multiple payment options. The selling options are the same with again multiple paying options. Â  BUYING BITCOIN WITH INRSELLING BITCOIN FOR INRWALLETFor selling Bitcoin they provide users with an online wallet. It is very simple to understand as it is similar to a normal wallet. I would go ahead and make a small transaction to test it. I would certainly update this topic. If you are using this platform. I won't recommend you to store Bitcoin on this platform wallet. Always remember \"Not your key. Not your wallet\".Thanks.",

      "body": "It would be better if anyone planning to use this platform secure thier platform wallets with 2FA. They do allow that 2FA integration and do recommend new users for doing it. It is a P2P exchange so always trade with extreme caution. You can also find reviews about the buyer or seller if you click on his/her ID.",

      "body": "I use binance instead, because there 0 fee for exchanging p2p and also sending from binance to other wallets charge very low fee.I one time bought bitcoin worth 1000INR from local p2p like localbitcoin, paxful , and got bitcoin worth ~900INR and after sending from paxful wallet to other wallet, they charges very high fee and my amount became 650INR.because i trade low amount so my all money or crypto goes into fee.",
