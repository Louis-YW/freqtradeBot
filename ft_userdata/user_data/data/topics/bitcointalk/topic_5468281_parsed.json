If you have a skill or a really good, outgoing personality you can earn just as much, if not more money than somebody is much more intelligent than you. I know lots of people who went to college & ended up being teachers. I didn’t go to college & I am far more financially successful than all of them.

The students have to pay absurd tuition fees and get into student debt only to find out that's it's hard for them to get a good job after they graduate. Having a university degree makes sense only if you want to pursue a career as a government clerk, lawyer or doctor. If you want to work in other industries(in the private sector) having skills and experience are more important than a diploma.",

May be not so much, but I would confidently tell you you can easily attract many chicks with high education background, because being highly educated still make you very high value compare and standout compare to 99% of the losers on the street.

I am sure that effort and hard work will ultimately bring goodness. In fact, there is no guarantee that economic and financial conditions will be better if we have a good academic degree, but those who have a good academic degree have a greater chance of getting a good job with a high salary. Life is about contestation and opportunities, whoever can take advantage of opportunities and work hard, I am sure he will get maximum results somedaySo as long as there is still time and opportunity, I think there is no harm in studying and seeking an academic degree for the future. Even though we don't know what will happen in the future, we still have to try hard",

If you are looking at financial wealth or probably wants to get so rich, i would say degrees doesn’t offer that, if you look at the list of the world most wealthiest people you wouldn’t find any professors there but rather entrepreneurs because this are things that actually bring direct profits. Even if you are educated and you are employed under someone and never have your own personally built source of income or have a share in someone’s business then you can’t get that super rich. Although they are jobs that pay you to be decently balanced and most people are comfortable about it, this isn’t also bad either because that’s your passion. The People in countries where jobs are scarce and they go for more degrees are trying everything possible to up their chances in getting those few jobs available. Example is when an opening of job of graduates are open and not multiple positions are available then the recruitment team narrow their search by giving edge to those with added certifications like post graduates studies. This is part of the reason why most people go further in education. Another reason again is some go for specialized courses like in Tech probably because the courses they studied seems to have lots of unemployed graduates and specializing in an area gives you edge when that area is soothed after. So it is not bad to get more degrees if you plan to practice your profession but when it is totally about been wealthy then only business provide you that and not multiple degrees",

People that only go for more degrees in a stare with high unemployment rate are they doing right thing by putting all their focus on academic because this is the only thing they can do best. To get many and high degrees is certainly not an easy thing and requires quite a long process. Most people want to get lots of degrees because they want to improve their career or position in an agency such as a government agency, where when someone wants to improve they also have to get the highest degree they previously got because in government agencies there are work groups which determine the amount of wages. work at the agency.However, if you ask whether having many degrees can change their lives financially or not, this depends on themselves. If the results of this education can change their thinking into someone who is visionary and continues to think forward in the future. So I am sure that the results of the education they have received so far will not be in vain and can change their lives financially to become someone who is more financially stable. However, if the results of this education are not able to change their thoughts and behavior then no matter how many degrees they get will not be able to change anything.",

I had to acknowledge the fact that having many academic degrees by going to masteral and doctorate could give you the upper hand in getting accepted for a certain high paying position. But I do not think that is the case anymore in today’s era. In our family, I am the underdog despite the eldest of the siblings. My married sister has a masteral degree and my youngest has a high paying managerial position due to her outstanding college grades. As for me? I had a guy who almost got kicked out twice by the university due to many failing grades. My transcript of records were ugly. But I didn’t give up. Still I am fortunate to have decent freelance jobs for years until I got into crypto that changed my life where I had more opportunities than ever not really caring about my academic performance or so.",

Do think people who read in a region with slim job opportunities are doing the right thing? IMHO, that depends on the degree that you're getting as an addition on top of your first degree. But for some reasons, there is satisfying feeling when you attain these achievements like having two degrees at the same time. But if it's about looking for more opportunities, you really have to move where there's a demand for that degree you own if ever you want to pursue that.Quote from: Y3shot on September 27, 2023, 09:56:53 AMMost people who go for more degrees believe they can get better job at the end of the day.

Unemployment these days is high but that doesn't mean that there's not that much opportunity globally. Yes, the metric that I am using is globally so if ever there's not that much opportunity in your area with that degree you have, you have to move somewhere else where you can use it.For higher incomes, it's like having one degree + masters is more than enough and will cause you lesser time.",

Do think people who read in a region with slim job opportunities are doing the right thing? Depends on location, have you asked the question why Asians and Africans run to Canada and UK for school and work, that is because in those places, there is demand for white-collar jobs, as long as you are a smart, dedicated person and know your job, you will always find a way to be called for a job most especially nurses and medical doctors, these discipline are in high demands but in places where the number of graduates in a particular discipline outnumbers the required people, then expect many graduates to roam about the street without any jobs after graduation.The world is also moving from the traditional ways of education and school, there is this common notion back in the days when society believed that we are the leaders of tomorrow, you wake up and go to school, put in your best and come out with best grades but as time goes on, this are no longer the same anymore, we have successful people today in our society that didn't have certificates from class but today, they are earning millions in second from sports, from the entertainment industry like movies, music, entrepreneurship, and content creating as skill, these are all ways society has evolved to and its working and this is why some people don't value having standard school certificates to make it in life.QuoteMost people who go for more degrees believe they can get better job at the end of the day. People that only go for more degrees in a stare with high unemployment rate are they doing right thing by putting all their focus on academic because this is the only thing they can do best. Not because they believe, it is the standard of society that you must pass through academics before you can make it in life but haven't we seen the number of people that have invalidated that, how many of Ronaldo's childhood friends can come out and say they have more money than him, players like Neymar and many more all went to football and turn to good leaves that society cherishes the most. Should we go into the music industry like Beyonce, Rihanna and Jay Z, a degree is not the only way to make it in life but if you do it while chasing other dreams is the best, you can be chasing the degree while still pursuing your football or music journey, kill two birds with one hand is better.",

Currently, a degree doesn't guarantee a high-paying job. Days at gone when immediately you graduate from college there is a job waiting for you. Currently what matters is the demand of the labor market. You don't need to have any certificate to get a job, all you need is the skill in high demand. If you have a skill that an organization needs nobody cares about your college certificate. Anybody that is depending on his certificate for a job might be disappointed.
