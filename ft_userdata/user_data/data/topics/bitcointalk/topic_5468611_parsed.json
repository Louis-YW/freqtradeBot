  "content": "I have been considering locking change since I've learned about Loaded's legendary fuckup where he mixed his change with another transaction. For sure, I always use Coin Control enabled on each tx, but what I would like is to lock change addresses by default. Change coins generate new addresses (at least that's how i've set it up) but you could still make the mistake of including it in a transaction. I think locking change addresses by default and unlocking them manually when needed would be pretty useful if you want to keep any privacy, because on a long enough timeline one may end up doing that mistake. It took him 8 years. Granted the guy was getting drunk often and so on but still, it would be a good thing to have enabled if possible.",

When you make a transaction, Electrum will still send your change back to the next unused change address, even if it is frozen. You'll have to unfreeze specific change addresses in order to spend those outputs.A good habit to get in to is to never make a transaction without using coin control. You will never be in the situation of your wallet including UTXOs you didn't want included if you select precisely which UTXOs to include 100% of the time. It's also a good habit to label your change output to remind you exactly where each one came from and so you can decide which ones it would be acceptable to consolidate together in one transaction. Or even better, avoid creating change altogether if possible.",

From that point on, you can select any of those spent change and use them in several coinjoins. The alternative, probably more expensive approach is to send change to a mixer. Sparrow creates change from coinjoins, so it doesn't help OP's problem: Quote from: Kruw on April 11, 2023, 11:47:39 AMQuote from: o_e_l_e_o on April 11, 2023, 06:08:42 AMQuote from: Kruw on April 10, 2023, 08:30:20 PMPost the tx ID of any Whirlpool transaction and I will show you the tx0 transaction that was created by each of the new entrants.Ok, here's one: https://mempool.space/tx/ed3131b544fbf00a71709942e483b55e629312ecb181e6e819409f419ee0d226Where exactly is the privacy loss for new entrants, splitting a single UTXO in to multiple UTXOs to join the pool?Okay, here's all the payments that can be tracked from the two new participants of the Whirlpool coinjoin transaction:Entrant 1: bc1q03c0443ausjjdxl2h6ud5m8c0dux0zyg3dqdj7 created 0.00170417 BTC in unmixed change sent to bc1q3fduld0l3r8nclyt5p3r7ak675tekurstn55tl.  Since this UTXO is not private, the sats were marked as unspendable and have not been recovered by the wallet owner    Entrant 2: bc1qzc8zku26ej337huw5dlt390cy2r9kgnq7dhtys created 0.00191247 BTC in unmixed change sent to bc1qjlltxr443uy236wl4xhpxlr6dgsu0zltlv3m44.

If you use Wasabi, it's clear to anyone looking at your transaction history that you participated in a coinjoin.  The coinjoin simply prevents those people from knowing where the coins ultimately ended up.",
