Obviously, don’t perform it as is, if you’ve already moved any crypto of yours onto the device itself. Remember though that the most important thing to do is to make sure that you yourself select the pin code, and that recovery phrase is provided by the device itself after performing the reset, phrase that you need to write down and store safely.Note: The classical scam consists in providing a user a device alongsidea pre-filled 24 word seed (i.e. printed or hand-written on the recovery sheet) and/or pin not of your own choosing. Moving any crypto on to the device under these circumstances, will result in the seller having access to it (say good riddance to it then).",
