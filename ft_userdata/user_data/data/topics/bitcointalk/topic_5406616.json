  "content": "In Turkey, the cryptocurrency usage has been getting more common in the recent years. While many countries in the world have been tussling with high inflation this situation has been happening much more dramatically in Turkey. Markets didn't welcome the president Erdogan's applying pressure over the Central Bank and decreasing interests. And the official inflation rate has been published as 78.6% in Turkey. However the academicians who are doing an independent research are thinking that the real inflation rate in Turkey is 175.55%. https://twitter.com/ENAGRUP/status/1543841563935219712?s=20&t=G41fycRj4g3t7a_Ije4P6AIn a country that has this much high inflation rate, people have to make investments to be able to keep the worth of their money. And in Turkey that there is a high population of young people, investments into cryptocurrencies have been quite high in the recent years. For example, local cryptocurrency exchanges have grown big that they can even sponsor the national team comfortably from now on.https://www.btcturk.com/bilgi-platformu/btcturk-becomes-sponsor-of-womens-and-mens-national-teams/People are talking about Bitcoin everywhere in daily life from now on. And the number of businesses that are accepting Bitcoin is increasing in Turkey day by day.The goverment of Turkey stated that they were looking at cryptocurrencies positively in their statements in the past. However the president Erdogan said in the statement he made on May 19, 2022 that he wasn't leaning towards cryptocurrencies. And he added that there was going to be some actions to be taken about this.What do you think about the bigger interest from the people of a country that has a big inflation rate? Do you think that it stems from the desire that people want to keep the values of things they have? Or is it easier to take risks for these people in countries like this?",

Or is it easier to take risks for these people in countries like this?There is no great mystery here, people are just looking for a way to try to outsmart inflation in any way, and Bitcoin is offered as an alternative. Regardless of its volatility, it is still a much better option for some than what the Turkish lira currently offers. Of course, it's always easier to take a risk if you have no other choice, but for those who believe in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter if they live in Turkey, the US or India - each of them believes in Bitcoin more than in their national currency.",

Just because people are talking about Bitcoin, it does not mean that they will invest. This is if we define people and how much they are compared to the percentage of the population and the percentage to the GDP.Inflation is a problem in Turkey, Bitcoin is one of the solutions, but not the only solution and not everyone will use it. This does not negate that growth in Turkey and around the world is an upward function.",

      "body": "Bitcoin might be a solution if faced with 50%+ inflation but I still think the value fluctuations are problematic with it - they'll probably be less likely to panic sell and more likely to hold though given how their native currency loses value too. It might be disliked by their president because stablecoins can pay a good interest to people too (and in usd).I've heard quite a lot of proposals that have come out since the inflation rate hit and stayed around 50% for a few years.One of them was to top up accounts with the amount the currency had inflated so the value remains the same (this would worsen inflation and those on lower domestic salaries - unless they rise more than inflation).Apparently a lot of Turkish bank accounts also accept dollars to be deposited (but don't offer interest on them). It's an odd situation to see an economy manage to survive on such high inflation rates and do well - it'd be better if they educated people on how to invest in companies (either on a national level or and inter atonal one) as I think they'd see a lot of demand for their currency over the long term on the forex market too (maybe initially a drop further in the value of their currency though).",

Adhering to an Erdoganomic economic system that does not refer to an increase in interest rates. As a result, they experienced 2x greater inflation. Correct me if I'm wrong, when Turkey's inflation continues to swell there is a positive side where Turkish stock prices soar while western stocks experience drastic declines when interest rate hikes are announced. One of them is Turkey BIST100 which is up by 30%. https://www.investing.com/indices/ise-100-30",

I like that they like bitcoin but due to the situation of the country they had some problems, at least that is what I saw. On the other hand, decreasing the value of their fiat currency because of the inflation rate increases the interest in this market.",

They indeed grew bigger and bigger.   I read yesterday that Turkey is number one or second with the highest inflation. I am surprised, to be honest. I knew Lira continues to slide down since the 2016 failed coup but 78.6% is very very high. Is the Turkish government printing a lot of money too? I think Turkey is one of few countries that is benefitting from the current war in Ukraine. They are exporting a lot of weapons for that war. West Europe's winter is coming and they will be needing more supplies of gas from Azerbaijan where Turkey gets passage fees. More Russian businesses are also in Turkey and who knows maybe laundering money too.

Companies that provide crypto trading services can sponsor anyone as long as they make payments in fiat and not in cryptocurrencies. I'll just repeat that no country can be considered crypto-friendly if it bans Bitcoin as a means of payment, although most people don't consider it too negative considering that their reasons for owning Bitcoin are far from using it as a currency.",

Decreasing interest rate for producers of scarce goods/services esp rather than for consumers is one of the most important ways to encourage production and drive down inflation. In this case, people from countries that earn Bitcoin either by selling goods or services, or from its price appreciation would also help drive inflation down as long as they use their earnings more for production. I actually prefer a mutual or symbiotic relationship between Bitcoin and world's economies, hence the need to make sure things are not too difficult for producers in Bitcoin world... Bitcoin also benefits when producers are doing well. It's important to start building a safe system that grooms independent producers & help them to thrive on some sort of decentralized Bitcoin economy to benefit their economies and Bitcoin",
