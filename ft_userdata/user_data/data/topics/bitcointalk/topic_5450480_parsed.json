But that's not all: by purchasing a Poop, you're not only supporting the artists, but also contributing to urban cleanliness and recycling in the city that inspired the creation of the Poop.And here's the best part: we're practically giving away Poop NFTs to the community at the incredible price of 1 Matic each! That's right, for just 1 Matic you can own an original and exclusive piece of pixel art, while also contributing to a good cause. Our project is not only about art, but also about social and environmental responsibility.Join the Poop movement today, get your hands on the most original and sustainable pixel art NFT collection, and show your support for art and sustainability.https://pooverse.io/",
