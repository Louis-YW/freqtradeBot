Most of the coins deposited by users should be moved to cold wallets. They known how their customers are depositing and withdraw which can be used to make this work accurately.Quote from: robelneo on September 05, 2023, 10:29:32 AMWhen they assured that users are safe do you believe it or is it just a way to keep their status in the industry intactI can never believe that. Only when I know that my coins are safe is when I protect it myself. Quote from: robelneo on September 05, 2023, 10:29:32 AMWhen top casinos are hacked and they still operate and still  into their business without interruption do you believe thatI will still not believe it.Quote from: robelneo on September 05, 2023, 10:29:32 AMTop casinos should be our priority because small casinos cannot operate normally after the hacking.Yes but top casinos are mostly the main target. Quote from: robelneo on September 05, 2023, 10:29:32 AMDo you believe that there will be more hacking after the top casinos?They are using hot wallets, what are you expecting. Yes. Quote from: robelneo on September 05, 2023, 10:29:32 AM - Do you think gamblers will stop playing for the time being after this is all settled?Gamblers will continue to gamble. Only what they can later do is to move to another casino. About Stake, this is what they do not want and make withdrawal continue even after the hack.",

I believe that stake hacking won't be the last since hacking attacks won't seize to exist as bad actors in the industry,  but more also I will rather gamble on a casino that I know can survive even if the wallets are hacked rather than play on a small casino that will park up operation if there are hit by hackers and losing my entire fund.",

That's also what I'm thinking right now, gamblers will be more lenient on stable casinos, or the small or medium-level casinos should assure the gambling community that they are employing top-level security and assure their players that their funds are secure.",

Not your keys, not your coin, however I'm not sure if we centralized exchanges are not any difference from gambling platform but the challenges is that you can't bet without your fund on theor hot wallets which makes it prone to attacks.-Depends on how the Casino had itself plan, if there is an insurance that will cover the loss, they can come back but will take time before they become active or where they left before the hack. But, $41M is really a lot, I wonder if there is ab insurance company that can cover that loss without involving there loss.-When casino says users fund are safe, I believe they are doing that to best of the ability but then, you can never tell, there are somethings that are beyond measures or unforseen circumstances where insiders member sell out the team for cheap share of the theft.-It depends on the solid background and backers. Stake for example has a lot of people behind them, drake is there Ambassador and many other sport companies, if they are making millions from the company, they will support it throughout the trying times till they come back fully.-skipped-If hackers could break into a company like stake and they were able to milk them $41M, I expected more hackers to try other gambling platforms.-Gamblers might change playing ground, they will avoid stake even the players that weren't affect, they will go to another platforms.

That means 1 billion dollars wagered. On a 4% house edge which is the average of all their games, they make $40 million. They also give half their profit back to the players in terms of affiliate commission, level up bonuses, weekly bonus, daily reload, rakeback and monthly bonus. And after paying for everything such as servers and their workers, I’d say definitely over 15 million a week.So I think the amount stolen isn't huge enough to disrupt their operation.",

They would be making a lot of money consistently, so while it will hurt the owner to lose these vast sums, potentially if they are able to weather any storm and pay out every cent by skittish customers in the short term, they may be able to survive longer term. There probably won't be any bonuses to the staff this year though. However this attack could have been very targeted, even by state funded actors like North Korea, who are very patient and will work their way in - knowing there are no criminal consequences to their behaviour but bit reward from their government for the cash.",

Yes, hacks will happen again and there will probably be more. For this reason, the security team from the casino must work as well as possible to protect the casino from hacking. And this incident will increase the vigilance of each casino to be even more careful.Quote from: robelneo on September 05, 2023, 10:29:32 AM - Do you think gamblers will stop playing for the time being after this is all settled?Gamblers will not stop gambling because they still have other casinos on their favorite list.
