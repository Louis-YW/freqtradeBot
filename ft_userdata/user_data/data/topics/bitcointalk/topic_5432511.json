For example, many of our friends have experienced losses, such as investing in altcoins such as ftx, Luna, and so on. so by investing in bitcoin even though short term trading I feel safe.",

Those green signals are an indication that you will lose if you join these currencies, and there is no clear way to determine when these currencies will rise.It is better to search for projects that may have a future and invest in them for periods of a few days to a few months, while withdrawing your profits whenever they are generated.",

Where the returns are high the risk also comes along with it.",

I will make bitcoin a long term investment.",

It is either a job or in case of altcoins it is mostly a gamble.In any case, 50% is too high if you ask me specially if you are (or for anyone who is) new to the market. I personally set that amount to what I can afford to lose and based on the time I can dedicate to trading since I am usually too busy to spend time in the market. The most important factor to consider is of course the market situation itself. There are times that the market is more predictable than other times and those times are the best for trading. Otherwise when the market is extremely hard to predict (like these days) I prefer staying away.",

It's better to use that it as an investment since you don't need to wasting your time to every time check the graph for make a little profit.This is why leverage trading exists. You can trade majors while amplifying the mostly-small movements with a certain amount of leverage the trader is comfortable with.",

Maybe your trading activity will be somewhat routine during this sideways trend if you take 1 to 3% profit.(Experience based advice) You don't mention analysis at all, if you don't use it then don't trade more than 20% of capital.",

As low as 1x margin ratio, the percentage is not still advisable, but can be advisable for 0.2x or lower margin ratio, and also depending if the amount is big or not.Generally advisable to minimize the amount placed on trading. Even if not thinking about trading, another thing to think about is if it is worth leaving the 50% on an exchange, it does not worth it.

If you have open trades for some days to many weeks, it is still swing trading.",
