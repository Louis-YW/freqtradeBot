So for holders, better discard it while you can, because later on, I don't think it can still fetch a price in the market. And in terms of LUNA, I don't think this can recover even if the CEO is saying he will revive this project. No one will trust them anymore.",

It took a long time before most of the exchanges have already removed it. This time, it's all about traders that as long as there's volume and it is liquid.They don't mind getting in and they're aware of the risk. But it's better for them to just find another coin and pair to trade and not with this scam coin.",

I am not sure why some people still trade Squid Game tokens, since I would never invest in such worthless meme coins, but at least a new rug pull from the developer side is no longer possible.When it comes to the exchanges, they will list anything since their only goal is to earn from trading fees.",

It doens't matter whether that has proven to be a scam token or not as long as pumpers and dumpers can make money from there and they will always try to buy the scam token. I know that if you are ever loosing in the squid game and that would be a very painful for you but this is crypto when everything that is still in the blockchain can be manipulated easily. It's pretty similar like when you are buying worthless token but again squid game is not yet erased from the blockchain",

So obviously they will survived that way. Nevertheless it doesn't mean it is not a scam or will not do a rug pull. What if suddenly their investors withdraw and move to the next hype? So there is still danger here, so it's better to be very cautious about this kind of token with no real use case whatsoever but pure pump and dump scheme that might harm investors, specially beginners in cryptoverse.",

Why? it's still listed on the decentralized exchange site but look at how some centralized exchange site didn't even care about the case that happened with this token. There's also new probability of squid already taken by the new developers. Those dumb people will always buy the dead token from the market. You must not be surprised with it. That's only a shit token that is still being bought by dumb people who used it as pump and dump token in the market. I would like to call this people as gambling instead investing as they bought scam token",

Yeah squid game was a scam token but you must also analyze the total supply that owned by both. This time luna has almost 7 trillions on its total supply while squid game was around 800 millions. There are huge gaps between both and it think that's a common thing to see that squid has more price than luna coin. The total supply was even different and don't you aware about this? As long as the token is still actively traded even with the small volume and this will make listing site will not to delist it",

The best they can do is set up certain reasonable criteria and parameters for the project to meet, and then allow the free market to pick winners and losers, and warn each other of potential scam projects.When $DOGE first launched, it was done as a joke. Some may have considered that a \"scam\" by some estimates. But over time the joke started to take itself more seriously, and is now a top 20 project.Who can say for certain where the ultimate value lies in each different protocol or project.

If you mean, this squid rise means they're going to bounce back I think that's wrong, because there's still a chance it's an inducement for people to start getting in there to get stuck there.

It's only used for trading, not actual use, for sure. The sad part about it is that many people have lost money in LUNA and are probably affected by their living or quality of life, and it's still being used as an asset that has almost 0 value. I saw some portfolio that had $1M on Luna and is now valued at $1000, so it's scary.The exchange is still benefitting from the trading transactions, so that is probably why it's still not out.",

They aren't scamming directly yes but, most of the listed altcoins right now in either Coingecko and Coinmarketcap are pretty useless TBH. One thing more is that comparing these 2 coins are kinda irrelevant. If the UST incident didn't happen, will you compare these 2 coins?? Another one is Squid Game only has 800 MIL total supply with a price of 1 cent whereas LUNA's supply has 7 Trillion. Why comparing these 2 at first place BTW?",
