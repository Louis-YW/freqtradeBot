Happy for your reply and interest. This scheme I can't recognize this as ponzi, because ponzi is endless hierarchy, when people, that comes later will always lose, if not invite someone.This scheme and result depends on hash of transaction, that ends, when only two persons bet.Also ponzi scheme guarantees profit when next user comes. In this scheme on of two users will lose.1st tx |2nd tx |3rd tx |4th tx |Winner 1st |Loser 1st |Loser 2nd |Winner 2nd |1st Bet (0.1Matic) |(withdraw for previous winner) |2nd Bet (0.1Matic) |(withdrawal Dev fee 0.01) |1st Bet (0.1Matic) |(0.19Matic withdrawal to 1st Winner) |2nd Bet (0.1Matic) |(withdrawal dev fee 0.01) |2nd Winner will receive funds in 5th transaction.Simple graph in this posthttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5463202.msg62698515#msg62698515You need to wait two transactions after yours to get payout, if blockchain choose you as a winner.In short words in this scheme can play two players never inviting someone else. One player is also possible (in this case dev fee only losed).The contract source code will 100% be published! The only thing I propose is to make a little stress test before. We can decide with community when exactly its better to do.0.1Matic to test it - is good enough, I think.Every second transaction contract should be empty (its NOT accumulates Matic), because its withdraws all balance to winner between two users with fee.For now I propose to see results on blockchain.",

Are you planning to audit your source code to a trusted smart contract auditor?I may provide Testnet contract with test transactions to try gameplay. I know that the project is crude right now, that's why I start from smart contract with simple interaction. As described in Roadmap of starter post User Interface will be developed on next stages. I have experience in web development, so will do this by myself, if interest will be on forum. Regarding audit - Dev fee will be used for next stages developing and grow project, so to buy trusted smart contract auditor service is good proposal. You may propose which is good.Regarding difficulty - need only three users with 0.1 Matic (sum 0.21$) to start the process and paste here three tx ids, where third withdraw reward to First winner. (Not sure, that is really difficult). Moreover contract will refuse transaction if amount will be more or less than 0.1 Matic, that's why need to send exact amount (Two players should bet same amount).Seems, I'll create video how to interact on this week.",

As I understand you trust Bitcoin and is ok. Anyway its not possible to create decentralized game on bitcoin blockchain, because its not supported smart contracts (As I know, that Omni network as second layer of Bitcoin supported smart contracts, but I'm not familiar with it at this moment. Let me know if you meant Omni.).I understand, that double profit sounds like old scams. That Scams controlled by its owner and it was centralized and code can be modified at any moment in most cases it was ponzi. This contract don't, because its not controlled by me after its publishing (Source code will be published after some time! And its simple - its chooses winner between two last transactions and send \"double\" amount to the winner in next block. There is no scam here) As I wrote in post before contract don't accumulates coins, so even if possibility to scam exist - it exist only for two transactions - then review on forum can be made.About bigger or smaller bugs. Smart contracts provides for us possibility to make decentralized exchanges between two tokens in one block and this opportunity for creation new decentralized apps, not only coins, but also services need to be in the future! Decentralized exchanges works good enough, and its written on smart contracts. That's why I'm interested in it. My path is to simplify code to minimal, where no place to bug, so this game is first version of this simple code, and even bug will be, it can be fixed and created new contract with these new implementation. Bugs exists everywhere in code, and when it finds we modificate code to a better one - all programs written in such manner. And after some time we got programs like Linux, Bitcoin, what next...?About test - you really can't test if you don't have Matic or BNB, as I understand its lack of trust to it. But exist testnet with free tokens to try it, its good experience.",

So own platform needed just for User Interface in our case and not for manipulations with choosing winner, that's main point, Block timestamp in seconds chose who is winner (As i hope that its fair random number, the only risk I see, that the miners can manipulate with Timestamp, but not sure that is easy). Hope its really unique idea and will be interesting for players.Bitcoin not need website to use bitcoin as a Smart Contract not requires. Anyway in next stages it can and seems will be, if will be enough attention and interest.Regarding test discussion: I'm not recognize it as a test, because Contract published on mainnet of Polygon. In same way we all can agree, that all Blockchain projects including Bitcoin is an our Global test... but we using it as value since 2009, until new bugs find to fix the code. Contract code - is simple, but can be not perfect, to fix disadvantages in new versions. The thing that it has bugs can be also covered from other side with thing, that is too good (and works like a clock), and attracts enough attention to slow down blockchain like it was with some other games. That's why I planning to show source code on next stage, when attention will be enough, or community decides, that is better to publish it earlier, than later.",
