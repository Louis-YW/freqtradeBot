  "content": "Hey Everyone,I work for a telemarketing coin company that specializes in gold, silver, and other precious metals in all shapes and sizes. Recently my boss has employed Chat GPT to be utilized within our internal systems to make our jobs easier for coin research, script writing, as an assistant, email checking, basically for whatever I want that can help me in my sales efforts. This has been extremely helpful for developing great pitches on limited or one of a kind coins to be used as a reference as needed, seeing as he has many of those types for sale and oftentimes it can be difficult to make someone understand the true uniqueness and rare qualities that make something a great growth asset, that is, something that someone will buy in the hopes that it appreciates in value. I have to always be thinking out of the box because you cannot legally say the word \"investment\" over the phone for direct consumer telemarketing sales unless you hold a Series 7 license, which I do not. Anyhow this tech has been really helpful in the writing of the pitches that I use only for eye reference when I am literally in the middle of a call with a prospect, or need to answer some question from a numismatic perspective on the fly, etc. Pretty cool fun toy, most sales professionals today don't have this, yet. But I do, and i'm loving it and honestly Chat GPT is so flipping cool!!!! Anyways, my boss's vision is to utilize the tech to help us sell gold and silver coins via telemarketing, but honestly he has not held back in telling us that these robots can and will replace our jobs if we are not in the top 10% of all the employees lol. This is the stat we are all seeing, and frankly my boss isn't the only one looking at this, I feel like any good company would and should be looking into how this can benefit your business by generating higher profits, but these higher profits come at a cost, and honestly are they even ethical? I mean he isn't the first person to have this idea, this is already literally being done and i've received numerous calls. The tech just isn't there yet, we can detect when a robot is calling us. His intentions with this technology have been made known, and he is working with the AI to literally be used to become the new \"account opener\" for those not in sales this is simply any new business development. Opening new accounts open new profit funnels to new prospects through qualified paid leads, at least that is how he does it. In this case it is for high value, graded, rare coins. I mean it is literally man vs machine now I feel like, and I have been thinking this or some time. It is scary and weird, but also slightly cool still I guess IDK LOL. A lot of jobs are at risk here. Its not a matter of if but when. In my opinion you can never replace the pure genuine qualities that only a human can possess. The ability to react with true emotion and feeling and express that in a form of gratitude or empathy towards another and fully understand, based off of their stimulus to you their emotional state and form an appropriate, and true response. This isn't just for sales but any job that needs to be replaced by some mindless and feelingless electric being that is both systematically created and computationally exact. I mean that is valuable but I honestly can foresee a future where these jobs have been replaced but after all is said and done I feel that some companies and people will literally pay a fee to get the human interaction, to get something real and genuine. After all, who can create a meaning relationship with a robot that can take a client golfing or treat out to dinner when conducting such business? This is only a mere example and sort of a niche one at that but you get my point. These are very odd times, indeed. Can't wait to get some feedback on all this. Okay so the breakdown and what I would love feedback on recap: What do you think of using chat GPT for business and also for phone sales, is it ethical if the end prospect doesn't know they are a robot? Also, will robots replace human jobs to the point that it will put entire industry class professionals out of business? Do you think that the human emotional connection can be replaced by robots?",

But who knows...someday I can see that it might and will.   So speaking from an employees point of view...I do hope not. If I was the employer and looking to save money, then AI would be the way to go if the company is to save money...At the end of the day, lots of these businesses I think don't give a damn except for their bottom line.   Have we reached that stage with AI to be better or equivalent to a human, I cant really say as I have no way in knowing.   Are we headed that way...I think we are....scary indeed lots of ways. Lots of pros and cons.   I would suggest you read this book recommended to me by Lesbo in 2017...Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era       https://www.amazon.com/Our-Final-Invention-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0312622376    It opened up my eyes years ago....I am excited about the possibilities of what AI can deliver...but yet at the same time...the possible dark side as well.",

That is where it becomes scary, because at that point who is to blame when things go wrong? The makers? The governments? They will just blame an error on tech when really whatever happened is probably part of some larger grand scheme or plotting, or worse the AI takes over humanity. On the plotting / scenario 1 I infer is exactly what a power hungry elite would want. Remove all blame on or any trace back to the original source and profit like 7 different ways out of it, I mean thats exactly what they did with the Covid Scam, isn't it?  And scenario 2 well that is just a grim looking future, we might need to gear up in order to fight back. Do you want your Iron man suit in Hot Rod Red or Matte Black? hahhahahh Soon all of what you stated will definitely come to pass, and much more. I mean it will literally change everything, and even the televisions of the future won't even come close to the TVs of today. There actually won't be TVs at all it'll be called a light box or something and be a hologram lol.",

I've seen chatgpt using more empathy then ton of humans out there. Empathy oesn't need to be feel based, it's just seeing things from other's perspective and it can be faked. If you are only using it for phone or email sales, i don't see much issues. Ai could just identify itself being an AI. people would most likely like to talk with it just to see what it says. And obviously companies would need to prepare for prompt hacking as it could be used against the company too.ChatGPT and other AI:s are tools that people won't just stop using now that they are out of the bag. In fact people will assume it's been used just like google in every situation it's needed.However situations that i don't think it's ethical to use chatGPT are those where chatgpt or any other AI makes decisions for humans. As they are black boxes and we have no way of knowing how AI makes it's conclusions. It could be biased against ethnic groups and when the main goal of the company is to make money we don't have a way to verify what other biases it could have.",

But the justification on our end as humans having the common sense & emotional intelligence is definitely a justification to keep our jobs. If we wan't to keep those jobs in the future though eventually there will be AI that has better emotional intelligence as well. So now we really are leading up to man vs machine. This future where AI can take all our jobs is not far off.

Humans tend to avoid to do any emotional labor to the point of breaking point and mass shootings. AI:s would work though emotional problems way easier, and they don't need even sympathy to figure our problems out. Just empathy, and that doesn't need to be for humans only, as you don't need much feelings to believe what the other person is going trough. Humans have problems with empathy all the time as they confuse it with sympathy. In fact humans are in overall pretty mess with their suppressed feelings.Quote from: Iadegbola34 on May 09, 2023, 03:29:53 PM-cut-In terms of the human emotional connection, while robots can simulate empathy and understanding to some extent, they cannot fully replace the nuances of human emotion and the value of authentic human interaction.This is very human centric thought pattern where we need to see ourselves more important then other lifeforms (i am counting in self aware AI from the future as well). We need to see ourselves as essential part of the universe to avoid accepting our own insignificance in it. But for now if it helps, humans are the best ones to solve human problems as experts by experience. It doesn't need to be so in the future.Edit: now i sound so much against humans and pro AI that i fear this message will get flagged as generated by an evil AI",
