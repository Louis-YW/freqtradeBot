  "content": "QuoteThe Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at historically low levels, when there are still many supply uncertaintiesBrace for impact: The U.S. is running out of a cushion reserved for oil shocks.The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve declined by nearly 7 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 16, leaving it at roughly 427 million barrels—the lowest since 1984. For the first time since 1983, the SPR now holds less oil than commercial storage.The U.S. has been drawing from the reserve at a rapid pace this year. The Energy Department on Monday said it has released roughly 155 million barrels of crude oil since President Biden authorized a draw of up to 180 million barrels on March 31. That implies a draw of slightly less than 900,000 barrels a day, or nearly 1% of global oil demand. The DOE on Monday said it plans to sell up to 10 million barrels from the SPR in November, extending the SPR draw beyond the initial October target. That would leave only about 15 million barrels that could be sold under the emergency authorization.Image link:  https://i.ibb.co/vBhwFf5/spr-million-barrels.pngFor Mr. Biden, who was looking to use the emergency authorization to lower pump prices, the move has been a near-term success, at least in the critical time leading up to the November midterm elections. Gasoline prices have declined steadily in the past three months and average $3.66 a gallon, down from a high of $5.03 in mid-June, according to GasBuddy.Arguably, though, the release didn’t turn out to be necessary for energy security—the SPR’s stated purpose. The International Energy Agency initially thought Russia’s oil production would be cut by 3 million barrels a day after its invasion of Ukraine. Back then, there was at least a “perceived supply emergency” posed by Russia, said Bob McNally, president of the energy-consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group. That turned out to be a wild overestimate. As of August, Russia’s exports were down just 400,000 to 450,000 barrels a day from prewar levels, according to the latest IEA report. As Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, puts it, “High prices are inconvenient. Lack of availability is a crisis.”Depleted SPR levels leave the U.S. with fewer options in case of supply disruptions, which remain possible. To begin with, Russia’s oil exports will become a real wild card after Dec. 5, when the European Union’s import ban on Russian oil takes effect. By February 2023, the IEA expects Russia’s daily oil output to be 1.9 million barrels below preinvasion levels. While the Group of Seven nations agree on some form of price cap on Russian oil, what that mechanism will actually look like and how it will affect Russian supply are uncertain. On top of that, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has repeatedly signaled that it will cut output if prices fall. It already did so—albeit in a symbolic way—earlier this month, pulling back 100,000 barrels a day. And then there are also demand-side risks in the form of a potential recession and further lockdowns in China.With so many hazards just around the bend, the U.S. needs a fully functioning air bag. Alas, this one comes with diminished cushioning capacity. Though the president can technically authorize more SPR drawdowns, there will be a limit, given that the IEA has a minimum stockholding obligation for participating members. RBC Capital Markets previously pegged that number for the U.S. at roughly 315 million barrels. And the DOE will eventually have to replenish the SPR by the same amount that it drew this year, increasing future oil demand. A DOE spokesperson said replenishment won’t likely occur until September 2023.Besides the short-term political gain, the SPR draw could turn out to have been a losing strategy however the supply-demand balance shakes out. If there is an actual oil shock and not enough oil in the SPR to cushion it, it would be a painful lesson on why the reserve exists in the first place. If there is no such shock, this year’s SPR draw might have set a precedent for politicized use in the future.https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-has-lost-its-oil-buffer-11663821015....This could signal a prelude to gasoline prices trending upwards in the states. SPR injection into america's fossil fuel industry was the only thing keeping prices at a maintainable level.I'm curious to know what effect this might have upon china's exports to the USA. Large US retailers like amazon might also experience difficulties with their free shipping contracts, over the long term. The following is an interesting point.QuoteRussia’s oil exports will become a real wild card after Dec. 5, when the European Union’s import ban on Russian oil takes effect.

And the DOE will eventually have to replenish the SPR by the same amount that it drew this year, increasing future oil demand. A DOE spokesperson said replenishment won’t likely occur until September 2023.I wonder how long these trends will affect mainstream consciousness. Will people want to remember all these events that are happening. Or would they prefer to simply forget.",

Germany had also tried repairing thier relationship with countries they were quarreling hoping to make a deal with oil, it's proof that we are really not prepared for what is coming. The electricity we use today is produced thru these fossil fuels we get from OPEC countries where we also plug the EVs. A few week ago, it's funny because they were restricting EVs to be recharged. But it's still too unbelievable for US to have a low reserve because there are sources still like Syria, Canada or Venezuela.",

I don't know what that number is, and I doubt private corporations would be willing to divulge such analytics of their business to be picked apart by the climate radicals. Any profit is too much for these folks.Oil production cut by millions of barrels due to unprovoked war, energy prices begin to sky rocket. Is this some sort of corporate conspiracy or the probable result of supply and demand?",

I imagine you haven't seen as dramatic as I do believe you generate a lot of your fossil fuels, apart from maybe oil? As pointed out above by pooya87.The UK for example, have significantly seen the effects. We're paying around 1.80-1.90 for one litre of diesel, while some states in the US are paying something like 4/5 dollars per GALLON. The difference being we heavily relied on imports which have been effected by the war.  Quote from: pooya87 on September 29, 2022, 06:05:24 AMThe worst part is that the Americans have already fucked with anybody who has a lot of oil: Russia, Venezuela, Iran, ... Even the Saudis (aka the 51st US state) is shifting to the East.The coming year or two will be very interesting in global politics to see if or how they are going to manage it this time.You can compare it to the empires of old. They basically took over land, stole from the local resources, until either they exhausted it at that time or were so big they couldn't handle internal conflict, since they were constantly at war they needed to tax the people or steal (what ever you prefer to call it) to be able to keep that war effort going. Similarly, the USA has basically attacked several nations, and have basically stuck their nose in every single conflict in the world, and looked to make it a benefit for them, which if you look at tactically, in the short term was a good idea. However, as you rightly point out, they're now struggling because they've started to push a lot the countries that were previously friendly away from them. I hate to say it, but I can't see anything, but war in the long term. America likes to get what they want, and they've shown multiple times they don't care at what expense that might be. I think part of their downfall now, and in the medium term is that people have become aware of how much damage they actually did by invading the middle east, and surrounding countries. So, the locals aren't actually that friendly towards American troops despite the position they might be in.",

But as time went on they kept sanctioning more countries; eventually the number of sanctioned countries became more than the countries that enforced those sanctions!In a way, today it is US/EU that are under sanctions not the other way around.The funniest part is that Iran alone could solve all the oil and gas problems that the West is facing. If Iranians decided to remove their sanctions on Europe, 100 million barrels of oil in the storages could be dumped on the European market right away crashing the price below $40 and the production could increase to about 4 million barrels per day ensuring price stays low.It's not going to happen though since today sanctions against Iran is at an all time high (I believe more than 6000 at this point) while the foreign trade and government revenue is also at an ATH (in at least past 10 years).So in this new world order, there are two sides.

On top of the existing inflation and recession in US, if more countries distance themselves from US, like for example if Germany or the Balkans go to the Eastern bloc and significantly decrease their relations with the West, those benefits start looking like nothing.Not to mention all the capital that exits US for the destination of other countries with cheap energy and labor like India for example. That could significantly increase unemployment and turn more cities/states into Detroit.",

Because the EU's rejection of Russian oil will lead to a further drop in oil prices, which has already passed the psychological border, and it will only get cheaper further.

Biden has made so many mistakes already The wore of all the Removal of armed force form AfghanistanYou seem to have forgotten that one of the reasons why Trump was elected was that he promised to pull out of Afghanistan (and similar wars they were losing). Not to mention that Biden didn't remove armed forces from Afghanistan, they were kicked out. They had to even donate $100 billion worth of weapons and equipment to the cavemen known as Taliban to buy their safe passage while they were escaping. Biden is an old man who falls asleep, greets unseen interlocutors, and does many other things that a US president shouldn't do. Perhaps he has no chance for the next term, but all the failures in the country's politics can be blamed on him.",
