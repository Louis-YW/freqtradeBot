The whales and wall Street can get everthing cheaper again.War isn't FUD, it's happening, it's real and it's affecting prices. It doesn't need fear on top of it to do so. Fear just happens naturally.But i am pretty sure we have seen the bottom of this bear market. At least my portfolio and charts seem to think so. So far i've been just growing my bags whole year of 2023 (in usd value). And i have been definitely buying some cheap cryptos even though i am far from a whale. My fiat money stashes are very limited because of the recent bear and expensive electricity, but i've been stacking sats and portfolio starting to look very much like green again. Maybe putler falls down from a window next or something else positive happens and my bags can rocket back to ath. I am very hopeful about the future atm.",

      "body": "My question is about the US dollar. The US borrowed $billions from the Federal Reserve Bank to give to Ukraine. Some European countries borrowed a lot of Euros from Germany for the same thing... Ukraine. What will happen when it all filters back to our respective countries? Inflation!Governments aren't going to help the people out with handouts of money that will match inflation growth. They did a little for Covid, but they won't for the Ukraine war. But if they did, it would make the inflation worse.I see hard times coming. I see the present letup as something the Dems are doing so they can get their guy in as president in 2024. And there is talk of the Reset. Think of the people that will be hurt in that.",
