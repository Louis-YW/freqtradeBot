      "body": "Thanks for the incentive of another pool.And where the GTD is, at least we should have a base prize + registrations, and incidentally the 4th and 5th places also come from the registrations and then such positions are not guaranteed.50% is fine, but I think that the 4th and 5th place should be guaranteed and in fact put a percentage on it as well.I don't know! I feel that there is distrust and I don't understand it with so many posters in the soccer mega threads, anyway...I repeat well for betnomi that motivates another pool, but I think that to publish in the mega soccer threads you should have at least one pool of experience.   I think that instead of having the minimum entry rule(20), we should have the maximum entry rule, that is, a guaranteed first place that makes you pay the entry fee before the entrys run out.I would sign up if they have a guaranteed prize for the first place, I understand that there is a weekly prize and I want to win every week, but the important \"juice\" is the ITM in the top 3, so the fifth should have 5% of the total pot and so far they have it at 1x.-Betnomi.com German Bundesliga Football Pool- have guaranteed success with these two reliable users in charge of this pool and betnomi as sponsor, but let's go a GTD (Yes!!) , anyway...success in this pool, I hope to be inside.⚽fM⚽",
