There are always naive people who think they can get rich because someone knows more than they do, but the only ones who win in this game are those who sell trading signals.Besides that, 2 days ago you opened a thread in which you offer your service and wrote a similar post - then why this thread?",

He only want to scam people, just like those high yield return scam. If you are not a trader or know the basics, do not worry, other traders would reply soon and see the nonsense he has been posting. He is a newbie trader that knows nothing yet and claiming he is good, talking about 50 to 100x leverage for altcoins while volatile than bitcoin. Let me make bitcoin liquidation price for you for 100x leverage at $20000If you go long, the liquidation price is $19800.If you go short, the liquidation price is $20200. If talking about altcoins, see how dangerous it is. People should avoid him, he only wants to scam and he knows nothing about trading, he is a gambler.",

Not our advice never use 100x leverage. Yes we know a lot we been doing trading about 20 years now ITS time to expanding our knowledge and find team members who want to do it right way.Teamwork IS key !! Remember this! Ar the current Market conditions its also good to short becouse we see the instutions short long orders they dont support btc price at the current price 19k they support when btc much lower.Everything i say i can proof you will see soon about btc.Btw, here is our team topic here to introduce our team.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5417575.0",
