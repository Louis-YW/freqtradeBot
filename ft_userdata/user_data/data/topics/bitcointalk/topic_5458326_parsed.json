  "content": "Anyone who has played here for awhile and is familiar with coin flip would you say the game is playing differently now then how it was a week ago? For me and others, it seems that they have stepped up the level of rigging to where it is actually changing the outcome of the game in real time. I know ppl will claim \"probably fair\" but that's a load of bull just to make games seem fair to attract users. This game is literally doing the exact opposite of what I do. It's learning and predicting my moves and doing what I just did right after I did it. It's messed up because for us not familiar with developing and all the complex technical stuff it's hard for us to even describe the situation. And that's nothing new. Ppl in tech always abuse their power and knowledge and take advantage of the uninformed and I'm positive BC is not the \"fair and transparent\" casino they claim to be.  Another user told me they even changed the algo for crash back in April. They supposedly announced it and told people but I didn't hear about it until now. That too caused me to suffer massive losses. I just think it's fucked up how they do this shit without making sure people know. I get that if the game is too easy and too many people are profiting off it they will go out of business and so they need to make changes to make it profitable for themselves.But the level of rigging involved now with coin flip is absurd. Typically a game gets harder as a player moves further into profit the algo gets harder that is understandable. The way BC has coin flip now is it just rapes the fuck out of your bankroll and doesn't allow the slightest profit. If you still manage to come up a few bucks it will literally go crazy and not let you get a single win at all whatsoever. It's like they got greedier and want to make more money or something but it's fucked. Anyone relate?",

It’s very hard to prove if the game is rigged and the only thing we are relying is just the reputation of the casino.Can you provide proof for the change of algo?No I have yet to find the announcement BC supposedly made in April about the algo change for crash. All I can say is that I was making a decent profit on crash back at the start of April then in mid-late April I noticed something changed and the game was acting differently. The same now with coin flip. For a while I was actually in profit at this casino now I am deep in loss due to these changes. Like you said, it's difficult to prove and they definitely know that and use it to their advantage. There's no way these games are truly random because RNG is not truly random since they are comouter generated there is a visible pattern always and after playing a game for some time and getting used to said pattern, for them to change the algorithm and change the pattern without telling people is such a dirty thing to do. Many people agree with me too and are all upset.  The game was never a cake walk. It always presented a challenge but now it's just impossible and it sucks because in my mind it's programmed to think it will play like before so I kept trying like an idiot and kept losing and losing and now I've lost so damned much it's crazy. I blame myself for that if course but these bastards need to tell people when they change a game like this it isn't right. And it's obvious it's rigged when you play it. It will go on these streaks out of nowhere and only switch when you choose the other side. It happens way too much to be a coincidence. Not only that, but it will allow you to get a high multiplier only when your bet is low enough so that it won't be profitable. Like I got 2000x with minimum bet. As soon I raised it it went back to the fucked shit and drained my bankroll. Fucked up dirty tactics from someone I thought I could trust.",

Ofcourse many people will agree to you since many of them are those who lose in the casino which is very common since this game is pure random. BC.game has a solid reputation here so accusing them without a solid proof will just look like that you are just whining because you are already losing on the casino after your early winning.If you really feel BC.game is not honest with their game. Just report them to the license provider so that they can check the probably fair system of the casino. BC.game will not allow anyone to look on it except to license provider. That’s your only way to prove that their games is rigged instead of creating scam accusation against them using your intuition as proof.",

[...] Unfortunately the more you gamble the more you are likely to encounter a long losing streak one day, as you are likely to encounter a winning one. But because of the nature of the gambling games and their house edge, you are more likely to lose money than to earn some at the end. If you really think an AI or an algorithm is learning how you are playing why don't you just try to thwart it?",

If anything, statistics, as long as you have very large sample sizes, would be a very good method to prove that the casino is indeed doing something unbecoming, like changing their algorithm in their own favor. But that sample size would have to be extremely large. So technically it would be possible, just extremely expensive to prove OP's theory. And since OP is going on a whim, based completely on his feeling that something is \"off\", I do not think its worthwhile to test his theory...I sometimes get the feeling that I am being cheated, as well, when I am on a losing streak. But that is my own subjective view, based on my emotional state at the time.",

My comments were removed mostly one comment was kept but most were removed and I was disabled from commenting further after a mod replied to me and gave me the whole talk about gambling being risky etc when that was completely irrelevant to what I was saying. If they truly had nothing to hide then why remove my comments and other people's comments too who have pointed out that the game's game play has changed recently and it seems to be very rigged now??Why would the mod reply to my comment then disable me from commenting so I can not reply back? That is some shady tactics. Yes I might have used bad language in some comments but not in all I just mainly tried to point out and explain how the coin seems to be manipulated somehow that is really it. Other comments were more vulgar I think saying \"fuck bc\" etc. but some others were also saying \"this is rigged\" and stuff. I also have made comments about it in chat. I contacted my VIP host who after I lost over 15K on this game due to this issue gave me a total of about $90 lossback. I also messaged support many times trying to ask them if the algo was ever changed for this game or any other game and finally one did respond the other day and said no changed were ever made which isn't true because for crash the hash was changed in April.",

I have tried many other casinos and BC is the one I liked the best. It has the nicest, smoothest UI with decent bonuses etc. so it's a major bummer that they did this and I really just don't get it as long term I can't imagine it will be as profitable for them in the long term. Well, same reason I said what I said, \"one thing that is constant is change\" is a common saying which I believe you've heard or read countless times, and I also use that phrase quite frequently here..I have been on the internet long enough to never feel disappointed anymore when a platform I've so gotten used to, turns around and make some major changes which greatly affects my experience with them, there is no system any where in the world that stays the same way it was built for so so long time, even a computer, motor car wears down as time pass, due to constant usage..Since bc games have decided to make some changes which I believe you are not happy about, you have two choices, either to ignore and continue playing there, or move on to another casino.",
