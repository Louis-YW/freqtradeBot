We had a lot of rumors but now they finally pull it, what ya think?How should this boost other coins, is it because it's coming from Amazon or because you have overated it ahead other coins for having maximum potentials to rise, am not underating the potential this coin could offer but always consider the risk first with altcoins before any further actions or steps on it, but am not having much conviction if this is actually coming from Amazon except an official link is being offered well stated from their official page.",

We had a lot of rumors but now they finally pull it, what ya think?This is a scam. And OP is most likely involved in it.I couldn't find any other reference for the said token and the site linked by OP \"cointelegraphfeed\" seems to copy cointelegraph theme but is not the real cointelegraph site.A search on original cointelegraph site doesn't yield the linked article and the formation of the article is poorer than what a real article would look like.The article about the said AMZT66 token is on the homepage of the site cointelegraphfeed and the site doesn't consist of any other pages while every other links there goes to real cointelegraph website.",

      "body": "Amazon isn't creating any tokens and they do not have a plan to step into crypto businesses. No official post from Amazon is out in the market. Also Coin Telegraph and Coin Telegraph Feed are not same. It is most likely a scam attempt so proceed with extreme caution. If Amazon ever decides to launch its own token, you will probably come to know about it from time square billboards or TV commercials.",

      "body": "This looks very much like a scam. First of all, such large-scale projects would never be launched through selling tokens on some website, and secondly, there is no information about this sale on Amazon's official website. I would refrain from any investment until a clear connection between Amazon itself and this site and their token sale is proven.",

I see their article includes a link to the fake sale of the AMZ token - it’s very likely a scam or it’s trying to register your IP for whatever reasons.",
