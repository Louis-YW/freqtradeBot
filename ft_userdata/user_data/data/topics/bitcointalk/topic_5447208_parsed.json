Last year The Sceptical Chymist was The Pharmacist, and I remember he wrote the first reply when theymos came up with the IQ score thing. Back then, I wouldn't say I liked how The Sceptical Chymist asked in which timezone theymos lived in because I didn't get the term he used. Last year, almost 75% of forum users were fooled because of the IQ score prank.But if you compare it to this year. I won't say it was successful enough. People started creating threads on 30th March (Like seriously?) about the April fool. So, most forum members already know something is coming up. If you didn't get fooled, It's okay; let others. But, People are creating more and more topic and letting everyone knows, \"Guys, it's April Fool, Guys, It's April Fools.\" WTF man? What is the point? Catching some merits? I would say we ruined it.",

No, but it was ok for the day.I tried to play for a while but couldn't get any points.  My bird died repeatedly. However, even after not playing the game, 5 points were reduced once through the post, but later it was seen that 40/50 points were increased.  If you post again after that, you will get 3/4 point reduction again. It was not possible to reduce the points to 0 in any way.  And I've seen reputable members get warnings as spam too. It was really fun.  And it was a pleasure to have Theymos organize it too. But last year's April Fool's Day was more realistic than this year. this time everyone can easily understand that it was April Fools.",

I wasn't bothered because I knew it was about the joke. But when I wanted to make a post, I saw a pop up notification. I was shocked how ads have started running on bitcointalk like other websites.
