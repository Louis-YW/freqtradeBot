Because the economic recession itself is closely related to an increase in the unemployment rate, a decrease in retail selling prices, to a slowdown in economic activity. And of course it can affect the bitcoin market. because the decline in people who invest will be felt when this economic recession lasts. so that people will spend more money to meet the needs of their daily life. and there will be little left for investment. even on a worse scale can make people no longer able to invest and even withdraw their investment. But that's if the real economic review occurs. and it can be said very close to the possibility of happening because the economic review itself is a period of weakening the economy that lasted for two consecutive quarters.",

Now if a recession come it will be first for bitcoin. I believe during recession many companies layoff their best people. I believe such people will engage themselves in web 3.0, for money. There will be expansion of blockchain ecosystem, the bitcoin will surge and once again people who are critic will say its all imaginary, but bitcoin will go to moon.",

Whatever happens, plan yourself on how long you're willing to stay holding bitcoin. Long term is still the best decision while holding it just to avoid being worried with the current world events. Also, there's the China-Taiwan tension and that's also something that we don't want to happen and sure the economy of most countries ties to the both of it will definitely be affected too.",

You say it as if it will be a very different thing from what is there now, and it is not. A recession is defined as GDP falling two quarters in a row and we are on our way, we are not far off. So, recession will simply be the realization of what we are seeing.Monetary policy, energy prices and inflation have already affected the price of Bitcoin. That the recession will be confirmed is not going to affect it much more. Quote from: Abiky on June 27, 2022, 12:32:39 AMIt's most probably Bitcoin will decline well below $10k, as the global economy comes to a halt.I doubt very much that it will halt, and if that happens, the S&P will drop below 2,000 points, etc. It won't be bitcoin alone that will continue to go down and it would be a disaster. But I see that as unlikely.",

The Federal Reserve increasing the interest rates might add more value to the US dollar.2. Everyone is talking about recession, but the recession might not come. There might be a negative net economic growth, which means bigger inflation and lower economic growth. Stagflation is also an option, but we don't know if the Saudi Arabians won't decide to increase oil production. The disruption of the supply chains is something that creates problems right now, but the global economy will adapt and new supply chains will be created.3. The Bitcoin price might go down or it might do up. Nobody knows what will happen so all the opinions here are mostly guessing and fantasizing.  If the global economy starts growing with a faster temp, the Bitcoin price will go up. If there's recession/stagflation, the crypto winter will continue.",

The fear of an economic slowdown is what send all the risky assets crashing down this year, crypto currencies are part of these assets. A recession now would make exeything worse because economies would contract, leaving the consumers struggling even more. One the one side we have rising inflation which makes living expenses rise and on the other side we have worse outlooks for the  future. I would expect asset prices to drop future as investors are heading for save investment. The problem is that safe investment don't work during high inflation times, their return is not enough to cover the rise in prices. That's why I think we will see more demand crypto currencies the higher inflation rises. The independence of crypto currencies is what makes them protect us against inflation and losing value in fiat money.",

      "body": "best way to view it..use the \"bread loaf\" valueimagine there was no bitcoin trade at all. no volatility due to people wanting bitcoin or not and bitcoin got pegged to a fixed value.. like a loaf of bread being $2 so the price at the moment is about 11,000 loaves of bread..in 5-10 years imagine bread was $10the fiat value of common things would be 5x more also. meaning people would sell bitcoin for over $100k. just to stay at same value. now add back in the inconsistencies of the market.electric prices are going up. meaning miners costs are going up. this means they wont sell for less value than this years lowalso those small hobby miners with higher residential electric wont mine. and instead they would buy, because its cheaper to buy coin right now compared to paying their electrical provider to mine bitcoinso even more push up of the bitcoin market price. then there are the FIAT bank savers. realising if they held onto $10k. they cn buy 5k loaves today but only 1k loaves of bread if they just kept their fiat as fiat. so they are in dire need to spend their fiat now on things they may want in 10 years time. because its cheaper to buy them now. or they will invest their savings in a store of value that hedges against inflation if they dont have real world things to buy and instead want to safeguard their savings.... and yep, bitcoin springs to their mind.so even more buyers. meaning more support for a price rise.what you are seeing this month. is not an expectation of long term trends of a down action of bitcoin price.what is happening is those that were considering to save up for a mortgage in 10 years or buy a car. are rushing now to do so now by converting their stored value to spend it all now. so that in 10 years time they are not having to have a price ticket of 5x if they waited to buy later. right now. the temp holders/ the short term investors are exiting. but those that hold will reap the rewards for holding over the long term. in short if you dont need to buy anything expensive in the next couple years hoard your coin. if you NEED to buy expensive things in the next year or so. spend your fiat now, get it while its cheap. because your fiat wont buy it all in a few years. it will cost you more fiat later",
