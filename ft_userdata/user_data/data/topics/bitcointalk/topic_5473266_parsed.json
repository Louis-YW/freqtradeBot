  "content": "Hi all ! this is my second time on bitcointalk , first time i wrote on the forum was couple weeks ago when i got scammed by a guy i trust ( for 300$ ) , but now things are going bad for my friend and i want to help him somehow, so here i am looking for your help in this wide forum.Basically the mom of my friend had some btc on coinbase, and a guy ( he called her months ago and started gaining her trust , she is alone , no man to her side if not her son ( my friend) , and somehow he installed an app that he can do whatever he wants from her phone . And yesterday he sended from her account on coinbase from the phone all the money she had ,here is the Tx Hash : .  Here is the wallet address he sended all to :  In your opinion is possible to understand where the guy and if he cashed out? using /ww w. blockchain. c om( dont know if i can post links here) i saw that he sended the ammount to 9 different wallets a specific ammount and  18 different wallets another ammount, starting sending in date 03/11/2023 till yesterday 06/11/2023... I saw that he used BINANCE 4 in some wallets to get out the money , but i cant understand well if he sended it or received it from there, im not good at reading the blockchain txs im sorry, thats why im here . Obviously tommorrow we go together to tge police with her , but i think its normal to bring them some proofs , so we can eventually block his future transactions on binance or other centralized exchanges he used to get the money out . Could you guys helpp me to have more informations as possible about this person ? i have his phone nr , he used a dutch tel. number to call her , obviusly i tried to call him but not an answer and i got blocked fast... I just want to help my friend and his mom, if you guys would help me out by reading better between txs and obtaining some info, i thank you a lot in advance , God bless .",

The total ammount is 7.3k$ , he started to send from 03/11/2023 , so the 0.089 btc is jjust a part of the last transaction he made. Because she discovered she is without funds only tuesday 6 in the evening. Is there anyway to understand where all those money gone ? i cant understand much ,, the only thing i know is that the transaction hash i pasted here is the one showing the money getting out from the moms wallet.

Metamask is not a bitcoin wallet. So, that's not Metamask. Exchanges usually move the fund to their hot wallet from user's deposit address after someone makes a deposit. Since the fund has not been moved yet, I don't think the address belongs to an exchange.It's more likely that the address belongs to the scammer's personal wallet and he/she has full control over that.",

Unfortunately, I agree with hosseinimr93, I don't think that's binance hot wallet, that's the scammer's personal wallet, so there's no way we can ask binance or other custodial wallet provider to freeze the fund.Best path to chase right now is to file a police report, though I personally think that'll lead to a dead end, given the only evidence is a dutch phone number [with high probability of being a disposible number]. Other way is to closely monitor the fund in that address and wait for it to move, hoping that it moves to a centralized exchange or a custodial wallet provider, then ask them to froze it.",

Since the address of the scammer and the transaction ID is now posted here, the scammer is now aware that you are now following his action, because this discussion shows up when you Google the address, its better if you cloak the address and the transaction ID so it will not get indexed by the search engine, the scammer will now plan to move the funds without being traced.I hope you can eventually trace the address and the scammer do not have the expertise to anonymize the transaction you mentioned that he used Binance that will be your lead expect a lot of movement from this funds, we all know scammers they will find a way to cash it out or to get it somewhere untraceable.",

I saw that he used BINANCE 4 in some wallets to get out the money , but i cant understand well if he sended it or received it from there, im not good at reading the blockchain txs im sorry, thats why im here . Obviously tommorrow we go together to tge police with her , but i think its normal to bring them some proofs , so we can eventually block his future transactions on binance or other centralized exchanges he used to get the money out . Could you guys helpp me to have more informations as possible about this person ? i have his phone nr , he used a dutch tel. number to call her , obviusly i tried to call him but not an answer and i got blocked fast... I just want to help my friend and his mom, if you guys would help me out by reading better between txs and obtaining some info, i thank you a lot in advance , God bless . This is beyond something you can do. First, the woman needs to secure her phone, computer, and other means of communication she used with the scammer.You guys ought to report the issue to the authorities so that Binance can freeze the scammer's account but you can still give it a try and also record the scammer's wallet on here.Ok, got it. I said her already to uninstall the app and have get a new password to her accounts. However, what you mean by mix the coin ? thanksCryptocurrency mixing is also known as crypto tumbler and it's the process of tainting crypto transactions which will make it impossible or almost impossible to know the initial wallet where the BTC was sent from. In other words, it's a privacy enhancement in crypto.",

I have come to realise that mostly mischievous act been perpetrated are very closed allies who we least or less expect it from. This is the reason why one needs to be careful of their engagement. I believe the woman trusted that boy to have known those details means that they were beyond just friendship but it was unfortunate that she was scammed the same person she trusted.If truly binance wallet address was discovered in the process of transferring the coin, I think you should assist her to email binance stating the problem and how it went about so they could commence their investigation by blocking activities on that account and tracing the owner of the accounts as they have KYC and every other thin to put that young man and in I think this would help more.",
