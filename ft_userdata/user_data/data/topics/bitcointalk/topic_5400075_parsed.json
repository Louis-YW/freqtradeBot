  "content": "Hey Guys,We just launched a new product, that can use crypto currency as the down payment, and you can obtain a full mortgage for the remainder of the amount.  This is for the United States only.This is the first product that allows you to use your crypto currency for a down payment, without having to pledge for the entire amount.This can be used for primary residences, second homes, investment properties, etc.Ask me any question, or PM me directly with questions.Thanks.  Pat",

I don't know if it's my impression, but I sense a certain scepticism in what you say, and I agree. Advertising such a product in this way seems shoddy and unprofessional. Creating an account on this forum and writing a post like that can be done by anyone at 0 cost. One would expect something more from a company that deals in mortgages.",

For this type of service which untenably has to be linked up and cooperating with several banks and lenders, it looks pretty bad on you without a website. You literally cannot manage this type of business without one, even if it's just a few pages with some application forms to fill, and the rest of support is handled via email & telephone.",
