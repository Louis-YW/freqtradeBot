In which case, those popular memes spreading around social media in which one cartoon figure, obviously representing Kamala, says \"Bitcoin is money is for criminals\", and another figure, apparently alluding to Trump, saying \"I support Bitcoin\", and finally one on the opposite of Trump's saying \"You got my vote\" is apparently oversimplification.",

An example is what happened to Former President Donald Trump recently gave a keynote address at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, in which he expressed strong support for Bitcoin.The market is buy the rumor, sell the news. People invest money because of their belief in something that in their opinion, after doing due diligent research or not, is it is safe, good and potential asset for investment. It's purely depended on their belief on it and politicians are very good at building up hype and belief in community on their words in speeches.With strong belief, that can be right or not right, people can stick with it and do many things.QuoteThe speech gave a lot of buzz and the price of Bitcoin surged above $67,000 (do you think this is the reason?)Do you think these political endorsements will help the politician to win the elections, or they will help Bitcoin's price increase?Politicians know that if they can make good speeches, say things that their people want to hear and want to achieve in future, they will get more support. Winning an election or not, there is nothing to be sure about an election result but politicians have to do everything they can to get as many votes as they can, to win an election.Price of Bitcoin has good show after some months of correction in April and June this year. Recent heat from Donald Trump only can help to boost the process of accumulation and bull run a little bit.https://cryptorank.io/price/bitcoin",

      "body": "Trump has been taking his plans for Bitcoin seriously and at the conference , you could hear him make strong statements like \"Bitcoin and crypto will skyrocket like never before if I'm elected president\" and that sounds like what a typical politician will do because it's like a bargaining chip. With how prices rose sharply since he started campaigning and after the attempted assassination that was foiled, he feels he can take it up a notch by making such bold declarations but I doubt those declarations alone cause Bitcoin price to spike. Honestly, the words of these guys should be taken with a grain of salt because there's no assurance he'd be able to strengthen Bitcoin over the dollar in the US without facing great opposition and knowing how he seldom delivers on his promises, it's best to just take it as you see it.",

And they've always had a negligible, if any, direct impact on markets. Even if you perceive the shift, not beyond a day. We've all got to understand by now market is influenced by so many factors. Nothing beats the supply/demand dynamics for me. Investor sentiment, sure, but investors really couldn't give a rat's arse about US presidents anymore. They're more concerned with the macros and corporate regulations. If one statement can shift supply/demand globally, or is related to regulations, perhaps. Not anything I've heard from either camp, though.",

I'm not from the state and might not have key figures on the extent of Bitcoin adoption in the state but I'm interested to know the number of eligible voters that are Bitcoin enthusiast in the United state and how important thier voting quarter will contribute to making Donald Trump become the president of the USA. Political periods are mostly moments when you hear tons of talks and statement you ordinarily wouldn't see from politicians on the normal and most of them aren't to be taken seriously.Whatever statement trump made at the Bitcoin 2024 conference is just a normal political statement and I doubt it was what led to any increase in the price of Bitcoin. The statement would only send a small signal to current HODLers to keep on holding thier Bitcoin which doesn't play a serious role in Bitcoin becoming more bullish. I feel this is rather too early to start expecting a direct effect on Bitcoin, maybe it would be okay to talk about this when trump eventually wins and sets out a policy that's going to encourage more big whales to consider Bitcoin a source of reserve.",

Because the people of his country only have the power to become the president for the political person they vote for. But in this case, the price of Bitcoin touched 67k dollars because of this speech.

You can relate to this news, because there is no logic here. Because we are currently in the pre-bull run period, it is normal for Bitcoin price to be dumping and pumping during this time. If the price of Bitcoin is dumping it creates an opportunity for investors to invest, and I think such dumping is normal before it is pumped to the maximum.",
