      "body": "Although something must have prompted/inspired Satoshi Nakamoto into building blockchain technology into the financial system. The disparity of the financial flows across the globe is part of it. No one could say emphatically that this or that was the inspiration except Satoshi, and many theories have made their points earlier, some would still come forward with fresh ideas too.However, my disposition on this is that if anything must have inspired Satoshi, it must have been the discovery made in 1991 by two prominent scientists Scott Stornetta and Stuart Haber 1991. They invented blockchain, but it was for benefit of the \"integrity of digital records\" only without advancing on it for further useful purposes.You might want to read: Inspiration of blockchain technology",

The problems that were and still exist in the old banking system (inflation, centralization, government control, violation of privacy...etc.) inspired Satoshi to invent something new that includes a solution to all these problems...a decentralized system that is not linked to any government or economic system...or ....This new invention was Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Milton Friedman has the vision of internet money, where the transactions is p2p and anonymous. Maybe satoshi took the inspiration and built the perfect bitcoin we see today. No doubt many tried this before satoshi but did not get the end result like Satoshi produced bitcoin. The increasingly growing monopoly of banks and government led us to use something that can't be controlled by the government, and someone has to invent a currency that can't be controlled or centralized by syndicates. So here we are, Satoshi stepped up and made a perfect one for the world to avoid the banks and centralization, now the choice is ours whether we choose to be controlled by banks or not.",

Man was genius. https://youtu.be/DPzNArH8lFMI wouldn't be surprised if Satoshi was actually inspired by this. There are no known relationship between Milton Friedman inspiration and Satoshi's discovery and invention. Many people could have the same worries or problems at the same time. Like in my country there are diverse research currently on how to combat poor internet connections because it is a concern to the populace. For a long time now a lot of people have been concerned with privacy issues and excessive  government controls. While one might keep discussing or complaining about these problems, another would be busy trying to solve the problem. It is also possible that Milton had no technological skills to create this invention, while Satoshi was fortunate to be exposed to them. Nevertheless, it's quite interesting to see that some person's were also having the same thinking pattern like Satoshi.",

Satoshi wasn't the only one with the vision of creating a global digital currency, but he seems to have been the quickest to develop something that really works and is attractive for the end-users on a greater scale.  Indeed, Satoshi had to have been influenced by lots of people, way of thinking and previous projects and the concepts behind them.Milton Friedman must have been one of them. He certainly had all the credentials.Credit can go to these people who laid the foundations for Satoshi, but to be able tobuild on these ideas with the vision of Bitcoin and bring it to life deserves greater credit.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_FriedmanQuoteMilton Friedman (/ˈfriːdmən/ (listen); July 31, 1912 – November 16, 2006) was an American economist and statistician who received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his research on consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and the complexity of stabilization policy.Anyone interested in reading a bit about the Cypherpunks who also certainly influenced Satoshican visit an old thread of mine below >https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5217348.msg53597623#msg53597623",

Satoshi may not have had the thought to create a form of digital currency first, but history remembers him because he was the one who acted on the idea and made it work into a reality. They say ideas travel from one person to another until it is used. If you have an idea that you are slow to implement or do not implement, in some little time after you had the idea without use, you may be surprised to see that same idea been applied or used by another person. Ideas come to you to be used, not to be kept cold. History mostly remembers the doers, people who made things work, not the people who did not even try at all but had the intentions. This is why Satoshi is remembered because he made things work digitally with bitcoins.",

We haven't come into this era directly; we have passed all the steps one by one and developed ourselves every day. There was something called digital cash which have been developed long ago, the idea of e-currency wasn't new of course.
