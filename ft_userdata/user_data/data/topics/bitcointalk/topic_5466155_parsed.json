  "content": "It wasn’t enough for Ron Paul to dedicate his life to defending American liberty. The old bean went beyond the call of duty by giving us Dr. Rand Paul as well.It’s oddly fitting that an ophthalmologist would help our country stay focused on what actually matters. As a libertarian conservative senator, Dr. Paul has fought for limiting the powers of one of the most vile things ever to exist: the American government. Dr. Paul is an advocate for low taxes, which is good because we like our money and don’t want the government to have it. He is for reduced government spending, which has made him rather unpopular among Americans who passionately believe that forever wars, domestic spying and the Pentagon’s $22 million lobster tail budget are the only things separating us from … honestly, we don’t know what the hell they believe. We don’t subject ourselves to mainstream propaganda. Just like his dear old dad, Dr. Paul is a fierce opponent of the Federal Reserve’s vice-like grip on our country’s money supply and interest rates. Dr. Paul actually wants – get this – a free market! He’s also one of very few politicians with the stones to admit that he can’t understand why anyone would need three bathrooms. We need more men like that in office.You may have arrived at this webpage with mixed or ambivalent feelings about Dr. Paul. Now that you’ve read all that stuff we wrote, you’re no doubt his biggest supporter. Prove it by ordering this piece of high-quality merchandise. Declare your (completely platonic) love for Dr. Paul to the world!Check out the Rand Paul collection by Libertas Bella!",

      "body": "Regarding basic politics and fixing America, Rand Paul isn't any better than the rest of them. Why not? Because he isn't fixing the basic problem in America.Sure, Rand has some of the basic fundamentals of a good, Christian home in view. But the basic problem is the Federal Reserve Bank. Ron Paul, Rand's dad, spoke and wrote about the Fed. But is Rand teaching about the Fed even more than his dad, considering he had his dad's groundwork top build on? Maybe. But it isn't coming out into the open, is it?What's wrong with the Federal Reserve Bank? Here it is. Money that the banks loan are NOT loans of depositors' 'savings' funds to the borrower. Rather, they are creations of new money.When the bank does a loan, it takes the promissory note and monetizes it and sells it. MONETIZES it. Turns it into money. More money devalues the existing supply. The outcome of this is inflation.Biden borrows money from the Fed to send to Ukraine. It's a creation of new money by government and the Fed. Big inflation. The repayment is through IRS tax money. But the inflation cuts into the paycheck of everyone.When the money is repaid by the borrower, since the bank monetized the promissory note, the repayment money goes into the pockets of the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank... ultimately the British Crown.https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=tom+schauf+bank+freedom&ia=webThe promissory note becomes a negotiable instrument to the bank - https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=promissory+note%2C+negotiable+instrument&ia=web.The whole thing is stealing from the American people. Does Rand know this? Is he talking about it? Is he pushing legislation to bring banking back under the US Treasury? Does Ron Paul ever talk about this in any of his books?",
