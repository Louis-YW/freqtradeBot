      "body": "Addresses are not linked to websites, unless the website has made an effort to have it labelled on-chain (usually not the case on the Bitcoin blockchain) and unless the address is published with the website URL somewhere, which would be unlikely in this circumstance.Your best bet is to go through all of the gambling websites that you have visited or deposited to and looking through your deposit history for the transaction that matches this address (in the event that the deposit wasn't credited to your balance anyway). You should be able to match the time of your deposit with the transaction quite easily if you are able to login to all of your accounts with no problem.In the worst case scenario that the above fails, contact the support of all casinos that you remember using and ask them if the address belongs to them. However, I don't see why you should need to do this if you are only using one account as per the rules of all casinos. You should definitely be keeping your login information handy as well.",

      "body": "The balance hasn't been swept and only has 2 imput txs from you, if it belongs to a centralized service wallet then it will be swept a moment later. It looks like you're sent it to a private wallet (yours, a friend's, or a decentralized service). Worst case scenario, you're sent it to a random address that no one generated yet.",

Like the other user said, it's not possible to find a website's information just by having their Bitcoin wallet address. The famous wallet addresses are somehow saved by others to show that the address belong to xyz company but I haven't seen anyone liking wallet addresses to any of the gambling sites and that's why it may not be possible for anyone to find more information about the wallet address.Maybe someone with chainanalysis can get information about the wallet address but still it's not going to be an easy task for a normal user to find details about the website with a wallet address only. I would also suggest you to visit all of the gambling sites that you use and check the deposit address manually yourself to see the address belongs to which platform and in case if you're not able to find about it yourself then you should most probably try to take some help from the support team of the casinos that you use regularly. That's the only possible way to gather information about that wallet address.",

You should probably check your email addresses, and see if you can find anything there (successful deposit, or confirmation email from gambling sites..)I'm curious though, what makes you so sure it's a gambling platform? It's been a very long time. Did you label the transaction or the address on your wallet?",

I mean when you deposit a certain amount of bitcoins into a gambling establishment and save the deposit address so that you now recall even if it was 2 transactions 11 months and 9 months.Usually if the gambling is centralized then the funds will be swept automatically while this wallet does not move after you deposit, but I just suspect that you sent it to a private wallet but you forgot to put the seed phrase.",
