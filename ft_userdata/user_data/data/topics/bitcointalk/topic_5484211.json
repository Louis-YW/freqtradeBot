  "content": "Day 1I've been watching the entirety of the Crypto Open Patient Alliance -v- Dr Craig Steven Wright trial down in London which started today and plan to watch as much of it as I possibly can. Decided to start a thread for daily updates and discussion. Not much has happened so far and just seems to be the opening statements. COPA briefly went through a handful of the forged documents including the LaTeX whitepaper and Craig's defence seemed to consist of just letting the court know about Craig's autism and previous suicide attempt due to the stress of trying and failing to prove he's Satoshi. I guess they know they're probably not going to win this so are going for the sympathy route or at least bracing themselves for inevitable failure and using Craig's autism as an excuse for the lies and forged documents.Timeline:For those not in the know: https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240205-uk-trial-opens-into-bitcoin-inventor-claimsQuoteWright, 53, says he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of bitcoin's creator and author of a white paper that introduced the cryptocurrency to the world in 2008.Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a non-profit organisation set up to keep cryptocurrency technology free from patents, is suing Wright over his claims first made in 2016.The trial at London's High Court, presided over by judge James Mellor, is expected to last until mid-March.\"Over a period of nearly 10 years... (Wright had) the strongest incentive to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto -- but single handedly failed,\" said COPA lawyer Jonathan Hough in opening remarks.Documents provided by Wright were not written in the same software code as the original 2008 white paper, according to Hough.\"COPA's case is, simply, that Dr Wright's claim to be Satoshi is a lie, founded on an elaborate false narrative and backed by forgery of documents on an industrial scale,\" the lawyer added in a written submission.\"As his false documents and inconsistencies have been exposed, he has resorted to further forgery and ever more implausible excuses.\"COPA wants the High Court to rule that Wright -- who is expected to face questioning on Tuesday -- is not Satoshi.The enigmatic programmer describes himself as \"Creator of Bitcoin\" on social media platform X.\"I conceived bitcoin, and I unveiled it to the world,\" he wrote last month in a posting on X, formerly known as Twitter.Wright, who on his website describes himself also as a businessman, has been involved in a number of lawsuits brought by himself but this time around is being asked to defend himself.COPA brings together heavyweights in the industry, including cryptocurrency platform Coinbase and Block, which specialises in digital payments.It accuses Wright, nicknamed 'Faketoshi' by his detractors, of lying about his identity and of forging and manipulating documents presented to try and prove his claims.The outcome of the case could determine that of another pitting Wright against 26 developers -- including Coinbase -- for allegedly infringing upon his intellectual property rights.Or just watch the Dr Bitcoin podcast on COPA vs. Craig Wright: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e0cAqs-0ngIf anyone has any questions feel free to ask.Updates:Day 2: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63623032#msg63623032Day 3: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63630400#msg63630400Day 4: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63633942#msg63633942Day 5: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63639614#msg63639614Day 6: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63652331#msg63652331Day 7: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63659056#msg63659056Days 8-11: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63688503#msg63688503Day 12: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63693964#msg63693964Day 13: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63698891#msg63698891Day 14: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63707433#msg63707433Day 15: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63709690#msg63709690Day 16: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63723561#msg63723561Day 17-18: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.msg63739261#msg63739261Day 19: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5484211.new#newDr Bitcoin Podcast updates:Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e0cAqs-0ng&tPart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VZE-oc8cEAPart 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYibVsBxid0Part 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aproxaMcFL4Part 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS9_GQkMAicPart 6: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ieqSOUCaBMPart 7: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWiLW_ASbOk",

His lawyer seems clueless. Not even sure why his suicide attempt is relevant. It's entirely possible that he faked that too and until I see anything concrete I'm going to assume that's what happened or at least it was a half-assed attempt.Quote from: Learn Bitcoin on February 05, 2024, 05:24:10 PMWho know's what this person want?

Maybe he would be sucessfully able to scam people by start selling shitcoins? Well he's trying to use the courts to hijack bitcoin. He can't prove he's satoshi any other way so he's hoping he can con a court into naming him Satoshi based on some forged documents.

He is quite clearly a charlatan and does seem to crave recognition and validation through things he quite clearly hasn't achieved but maybe his motives are purely financial, but I suspect it's both financial and for the kudos to bolster his own ego. Not only did he obviously not create bitcoin but he's also been caught plagiarising content for his degrees. https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2020/05/11/craig-wrights-doctoral-thesis-being-investigated-for-plagiarisI don't know whether he fakes his qualifications and employment history merely for validation or just to help further his frauds of which there are many. My only hope is that he ends up in jail because I doubt he will stop otherwise. Hopefully this court holds him in contempt for knowingly providing fraudulent evidence.",

It is time  for the COPA members to produce the real Satoshi Nakamoto.  As his barrister has stated, no body is claiming except CSW.  It that correct ?  The rea Satoshi is out there and reading the news and laughing.  Any one can claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto and claim he or she has written the Bitcoin White Paper.  Suppose Dorian Nakamoto come forward and admit that he is the man who is behind the Bitcoin and Blockchain.  What can happen ?  Will the Bitcoin community accept it ?  May be or may be not but the truth is the real Satoshi Nakamoto knows what is going on and on over the last decade. Why the real Satoshi Nakamoto need to come forward in public to claim that it he who is the inventor of Bitcoin ? According to the Bitcoin Protocol Private Key is the proof of evidence of ownership of Bitcoin. Why this gentleman suing anyone who des not believe that he is Satoshi Nakamoto ?  What is his intention ?  If he is the inventor then he has lots of Bitcoin.  So why he has to make so much story , hey guys , it is me, I am Dr Craig Steven Wright.  I invented the Bitcoin.  Why did he then published the bloody Bitcoin White Paper under a Japanese pseudonym ?   I am an economic  journalist by profession.  I will be happy to interview him with 1000 questions and dig out the truth.",

Right from the very start the man is obviously fake and I am even wondering why the media is letting the man play his claims to the roof. Now, am not against anybody's autism and we should be kind to people who are autistic though in the case of Craig I think it is quite funny that his defense his using his condition - that is assuming this is not just another lie - to his advantage. I am sure the court would be ruling eventually against him and COPA will win the case.",

      "body": "Day 2.Craig has finally been sworn in this morning and is now being cross-examined. Several forgeries have been presented to him already and he usually just has some BS excuse to try explain them away. One of the highlights was a forged document where it was clear the date was altered as it was in a different font. His excuse was maybe the printer that printed it out was misaligned and hence why the date is a bit wonky  . Funny how it was only the date that was effected. The judge has barred Craig providing any further 'new' evidence stating his history of providing forgeries, so that's a plus. Craig is very confident in his excuses and I hope COPAs defence push him a little more on these as it's 50/50 when they do, but I guess that's where the con in conman stems from. They've adjourned for lunch now and the trial will resume shortly at 2pm GMT. Quote from: Upgrade00 on February 05, 2024, 09:28:40 PMQuote from: hilariousetc on February 05, 2024, 09:24:37 PMWell that's what COPA have asked for but earlier today Craig's council asked that if they lose for that to be rejected under \"human rights\" grounds. Hopefully they don't grant that because otherwise this trial is mostly useless. I do hope they throw out that request.Well I hope so too. Otherwise the trial is useless and he is free to continue his fraud. Quote from: LeezHamilton on February 06, 2024, 05:58:05 AMHe is very smart. playing a big drama.Who knows, what is his real intention ?  May be he just want to get attention and fame. May be he just want to make money out of this saga.  He knows, what he is doing.  I read news report about the opening of the case.  His barrister clearly stated that if there is some one else who is the real Satoshi Nakamoto then why he is not claiming ? It is time  for the COPA members to produce the real Satoshi Nakamoto.  As his barrister has stated, no body is claiming except CSW.  It that correct ?  The rea Satoshi is out there and reading the news and laughing.  Any one can claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto and claim he or she has written the Bitcoin White Paper.  Suppose Dorian Nakamoto come forward and admit that he is the man who is behind the Bitcoin and Blockchain.  What can happen ?  Will the Bitcoin community accept it ?  May be or may be not but the truth is the real Satoshi Nakamoto knows what is going on and on over the last decade. Why the real Satoshi Nakamoto need to come forward in public to claim that it he who is the inventor of Bitcoin ? According to the Bitcoin Protocol Private Key is the proof of evidence of ownership of Bitcoin. Why this gentleman suing anyone who des not believe that he is Satoshi Nakamoto ?  What is his intention ?  If he is the inventor then he has lots of Bitcoin.  So why he has to make so much story , hey guys , it is me, I am Dr Craig Steven Wright.  I invented the Bitcoin.  Why did he then published the bloody Bitcoin White Paper under a Japanese pseudonym ?   I am an economic  journalist by profession.  I will be happy to interview him with 1000 questions and dig out the truth.  His intention is clear: For the courts to pronounce him as Satoshi and heir to his fortune. It is correct that one of his defence's opening arguments was COPA have provided no alternatives to Satoshi and why hasn't Satoshi already come forward, so he must be Satoshi, or at least he is the most likely candidate, like that's a viable excuse. Stuff like that shouldn't even be allowed in court. Nobody has provided any evidence of being god, so maybe Craig is god too.Quote from: DapanasFruit on February 06, 2024, 09:56:54 AMQuote from: hilariousetc on February 05, 2024, 04:54:10 PM...and Craig's defence seemed to consist of just letting the court know about Craig's autism and previous suicide attempt due to the stress of trying and failing to prove he's Satoshi. I guess they know they're probably not going to win this so are going for the sympathy route or at least bracing themselves for inevitable failure and using Craig's autism as an excuse for the lies and forged documents.I am not following this case as I don't have the time for anything related to Craig Wrong...I mean Wright but his saga is really interesting and even angered many people who are the supporters and enthusiasts of Bitcoin. Right from the very start the man is obviously fake and I am even wondering why the media is letting the man play his claims to the roof. Now, am not against anybody's autism and we should be kind to people who are autistic though in the case of Craig I think it is quite funny that his defence his using his condition - that is assuming this is not just another lie - to his advantage. I am sure the court would be ruling eventually against him and COPA will win the case. Maybe it's a case of the boy who cried wolf but I don't really believe Craig is autistic, or is certainly using it to his advantage. Craig was known to be shopping around for a doctor to give him such a diagnosis and you'll be able to find one to do so. It's not like it isn't hard to fake or feign such a condition either, as with any mental disorder. It's similar to criminals who try get a diagnosis of insanity or other such mental illness to either garner sympathy or explain away their behaviour. Craig has basically got himself a get out of court free pass which allows him to just have a break whenever he wants by feigning a hissy fit or just claiming 'muh autism' if he can't handle the heat. Shame he's resorted to this but what can you do? There's no depths too low that he won't stoop to to further his fraud.Quote from: tbct_mt2 on February 06, 2024, 11:36:57 AMI can not understand why the Faketoshi man needs to go seriously like this.

Shame!He probably has very little ultimately, hence why he's trying to hijack bitcoin to try claim Satoshi's fortune. He can't provide anything concrete so he just has to rely on forgeries and other such nonsense hoping he can just con a court into 'legally' pronouncing him as Satoshi, or at the very least sew enough doubt for the verdict to be inconclusive, which he will obviously spin into a win. The trail has now resumed. I will provide another update this evening.",
