But Im thinking its because a newbie might become jr member already by making 30 posts, but that was before everything was change after merit implementation[2].If you want to send PMs like with a member restrictions, probably can send with shorter time limit than newbie and jr member, then paying for copper membership is your option[3].[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2728840.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2818350.0[3] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2385104Edit: Merit sent to experience jr member restrictions",

Usually, they then start pumping out some decent or at least passable content that gets them a few merits to rank up. Very common of alt farmers, although I'm not exactly accusing the OP here of that. Although, most of the super low quality posts have been removed. Hopefully, they'll take that as a warning, and improve.
