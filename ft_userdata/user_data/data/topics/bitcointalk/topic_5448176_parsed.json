  "content": "in your opinion what are the benefits and major differences.. is it way better for mining beginners to go for nicehash? Do you think that elite miners sometimes may also giveup physical farms and buy huge amount of EH/s on nicehash? Do they deduct the tax or you pay it on your own, etc?",

If you have enough amount of money to have a mining farm, it is better and you can get it to the point of having a mining pool. If you do not have enough to set up a farm, just buy one or two miners or have a mining rig and join a mining pool.",
