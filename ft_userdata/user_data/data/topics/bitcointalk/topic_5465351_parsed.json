Take note that there may be some differences between mobile and desktop versions of wallets. For example, unlike what is shown in the table, electrum allow you to generate a 24 word seed phrase in its desktop version using console.",

But if the websites are yours and you have shared them to take some suggestions then my suggestion is to put an information icon on top of every tab or at least show some information of the heading if we take cursor on it as it will be more helpful for newbies like me to know what we are looking at. Overall, websites seem good and fast too. Plus as hosseinimr93 has indicated that the desktop version allows us to generate 24-word seed phrases for Electrum wallet but you mentioned NO in the comparison. I think you must be talking about the mobile version as the comparison is also about the mobile version but you should also write somewhere that the comparison is only for the wallets which are running on smart phone or Android. I found writing this statement only in the URL other than that I did not find any. Maybe I might have missed it but it will be good if the heading is more visible.",

Also it is having inheritance plan and online seed phrase backup which I can not recommend.Pay-to-taproot (P2TR)Indicated in yellow for partially supported wallets like Bluewallet, Samourai and Specter. These wallets are not supporting pay-to-taproot. What did you mean by partially supported?Replace-by-fee (RBF)You indicated that Wasabi wallet supports it. Yes, but you can not replace transaction on Wasabi wallet. You will have to export the seed phrase on a wallet that support RBF to be able to use RBF for the unconfirmed transaction.Passphrases support (BIP-38)It supposed to be BIP39 passphrase. The wallet you are referring to are BIP39 wallets that make use of BIP39 seed phrase, and BIP39 passphrase which is called extended word, not BIP38 passphrase/password that is used to encrypt a private key for paper wallet. You need to correct that.
