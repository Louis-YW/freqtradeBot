  "content": "Welcome to the Pasino Provably Fair Seeding Event for Fortune Wheel!This will reuse the idea posted by Ryan and used for Bustabit v1﻿.   A chain of 10 million (1e7) sha256 hashes was generated, starting with a Server Secret that has been repeatedly fed the output of sha256 hash back into itself 10 million times.The final hash in the chain is: 172cb498b3df5f017c3763b6685f8b8e972054ab5101075413b1fb9d1ca58b15, by publicizing it here we are preventing any ability to pick an alternate sha256 chain.Pasino.com will play through that chain of hashes, in reverse order, and use the hashes to determine the crash point.To avoid criticism that the Server Secret used in step 1 was carefully chosen to generate lots of \"bad\" crash points, each hash in the chain will be salted with a client seed, which we have no control of.The client seed will be the block hash of a Bitcoin block that hasn't yet been mined: block 736013Using our chosen starting serverSeed, the hash terminating the chain is 172cb498b3df5f017c3763b6685f8b8e972054ab5101075413b1fb9d1ca58b15. That is to say, the first game's hash played under the new provably fair scheme, when hashed will be 172cb498b3df5f017c3763b6685f8b8e972054ab5101075413b1fb9d1ca58b15.",

Really would be helpful if you can explain a bit clearer what this is all about so we know if it's something we can hop on and benefit from.",

List the already existing one if there is any After the announcement comes the 'events' and 'promotional games'. What OP is trying to state is they are having a big event concerned with the fortune wheel. But it would be very wise if you can explain it in better words. Also considering hash, how much would a person be depositing etc? There are a lot of things that are left unanswered. Best of luck!",
