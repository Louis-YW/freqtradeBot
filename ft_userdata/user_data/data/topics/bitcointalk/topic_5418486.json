I think it was much higher than \"1$ dollars\" Quote from: _act_ on October 27, 2022, 08:06:26 AMQuoteThe anticipation of the next Bitcoin halving will spark a crypto rally in 2023 regardless of the grim macroeconomic picture, according to hedge fund manager Mark Yusko.1st halving was important. It reduced monetary inflation from 25% to 12%. Thats a big deal. Second halving decreased monetary inflation from 9% to 4,5%. Now we are getting closer and closer to the 4th halving that will reduce bitcoin monetary inflation from like 1.5% to 0.7%. Both numbers are negligible compared to 8% official CPI in US, 10% in EU or 80% in countries like Turkey. So my bet is that halvings fundamental impact on bitcoin price is getting lower and lower with every next halving in oppose to macro data, FED decisions, interest rates, recessions etc. Bitcoin will be more like an asset that act sometimes like gold on steroids sometimes like sp500 on steroids rather than it will fallow \"bubble x days before each halving scheme\"",

I believe more in 2024, what do you think?The difference is two weeks for 2020 rally when bitcoin was still $4,000 before halving at the peak of covid-19 and Mark Yusko prediction for rally early enough in Q2 of 2023. IMO it may not be early because June is still in Q2 of next year and 2014 will be around soon. Remember this time more investors are waiting so early hodling can shoot the price up and sustained.Quote from: _act_ on October 27, 2022, 08:06:26 AMI am thinking that Q2 of 2023 is still early to decide if the 2024 rally that we are expecting, that any price rise at the time may still be followed by bear market. I believe more in 2024, what do you think?The micro and macroeconomics have changed and what you now assume as early may be wrong like many factors have been changing and continue to change even for next year. The inflation can increase more by December and fomo can push more investors into hodling finance in bitcoin. This can keep to sustain the bull with little drops until halving.",

That's because Bitcoin price prediction isn't a matter of science, it's not something that is precise enough to predict when the next bull run hits. It can be in the second half of 2023, it can be at the end of 2023, and it can be at the very beginning of 2023. All of these are reasonable. There's some likeliness of events, of course. For example, it's likely that the price will be betweeen $19k and below $21k tomorrow, and it's unlikely that it will be $25k tomorrow, but even more unlikely that it will be $10k tomorrow. That's just things derived from how Bitcoin has behaved over a long period of time and how big of an increase or decrease it normally experiences within a matter of a day. But a bull run is something different, less certain, especially in the question of when it can happen.",

Well, it’s not wrong to believe that a possible bullish market will appear by next year since everything could happen in a blast with this unpredictable market. No need to wait for halving, if there are events that will eventually make the market highly bullish, then why not? At the end of the day, we only share the same goal, and that is to make good profits and lucky are those who have been into long term hodling as it’s very close for them.

There is still a decent amount of uncertainty ahead, this end-of-October rally may seem like a kickstart but the volatility of the market had already disappointed many just today. While there is yet no halving, the ride will still be bumpy til the end of 2023 which is why I don't see rallies in the coming months to be the kind that is lasting.",

In the last 2 bull runs of it, the bull run started after the halving happened and if we will follow what happened in the past and apply it in the future, most probably we will see a bull run at 2024 particularly after March 2024 where the halving is expected to happen. Now that alone can negate what he said that we will see a bull run in Q2 of 2023. I believe in market cycles, and I've seen it twice already. Another thing is that there is no sign as of right now that we will see the market make a trend reversal. As of this moment, markets are still on a downward trend even though we are seeing crypto market a slight upwards movement but in a longer time perspective, it is still moving downwards. Also add the problems that the world is facing right now. Inflation, Russia-Ukraine war, Fed increasing rates, lacking commodities like oil and many more. I disagree with what he is saying.",
