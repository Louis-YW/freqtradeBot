  "content": "Dear all These days i am researching about blockchain techknowlodgy and BTC transactions.AS per my knowledgeHow BTC blockchain Works(mining)IF a transaction happen first come to the Mem Pool , then after Broadcast to the other nods on the BTC network. After the validation it goes to candidate block. Then miners run the SHA256 HASH algo to find the Nonce. The more hashpower will win the nouce number.Â  Thats called mining. Noramlly on a block consist of Block height , Nounce ,Data ,previous Hash and Current hash.After Nounce number calculated Block is mined then put the block right after the current block.Data includes (Sender ,Receiver , Amount)How BTC transaction worksSender Encrypt transaction with private key (sha256) then Decrypt with public key (receiver)",

Noramlly on a block consist of Block height , Nounce ,Data ,previous Hash and Current hash.A block contains a header that has version, previous block hash, merkle root, time, target (4 byte), nonce. In other words there is no height or \"data\" in it.The block itself contains at least one transaction which is called coinbase and in the signature script of that transaction there has to be a data pushed to the stack that is the block height.QuoteSender Encrypt transaction with private key (sha256) then Decrypt with public key (receiver)There is no encryption/decryption in Bitcoin protocol.We have digital signatures and hashes. When spending an output once usually has to provide a digital signature using ECDSA or ECSDSA (for Taproot).",
