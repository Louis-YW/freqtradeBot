Dispatches of stablecoins: there are no comments here, after the UST case, everyone knows that stablecoins are not so stable.3. Protection of NFT and wallets in development.AndRisk underwriting and claims coverage are at the heart of any risk protection business. However, all existing Decentralized Finance RPPs (\"DeFi\") have faced a critical resiliency issue with respect to risk underwriting and claims coverage.Amulet is creating an industry-first approach to risk protection based on protocol-controlled reserves (\"PCR\") in which Amulet will build reserves and implement a claims structure that incorporates a unique yield justification method (\"YBC\"). This is a significant change from the existing model of simply raising underwriters' capital directly to pay claims.Social network:Twitter - https://twitter.com/AmuletProtocolWebsite - https://amulet.org/If you are interested, then here is a complete guide - https://teletype.in/@metisovich/hhB6jjZ9wuD",

The project will initially run on the Solana blockchain and provide an insurance solution for everyone in Web3.As Solana has become the primary Tier 1 solution, Amulet anticipates the need for insurance and other risk management solutions in Solana and broader Rust-based ecosystems to soon see their own boom.This presents Amulet with a huge opportunity to meet the market’s growing need for security. The project is also backed by Solana Ventures, which is also an investor in the project.What’s special about Amulet?Some of Amulet’s key features areA planned ecosystem with multiple tokens.Users can protect the blockchain in multiple ways with a protocol that protects investors and secures payments using a protocol-controlled underwriting value (PCUV) unique to Amulet.Provide smart contract assurance and cancel stablenecking of stablenecking. Soon we will provide real estate insurance for NFT, Metaverse and fi game.A multi-chain and scalable strategy focused on the Rust ecosystem.PCUV summary.Underwriting and claims are at the heart of any insurance business. However, all existing Decentralized Finance Insurance (DeFi) protocols face a major sustainability challenge in terms of underwriting and claims.Amulet is creating the industry’s first PCUV approach. In it, Amulet will create its own underwriting capability and present a claims structure that includes multiple levels of completion. This is a significant departure from established underwriting outsourcing models from capital providers to a more sustainable underwriting structure and protocol-based claims.PCUV accumulates a pool of secured income claims — a pool of earnings claims, treasuries and other classes of reserves to mitigate losses from deposit capital. In other words, the protocol develops and manages risk on both sides of the bilateral insurance market (for users and creators).Thus, a larger asset base generates more platform income, which is loaded to users -> This attracts more capital -> All while balancing the needs of platform users one by one in a sustainable manner.AMT TokenomicsKey Metrics.Ticker: AMT.Blockchain: Solana.Standard token: SPL.Token type: utility, management.Total supply: 1,000,000,000 XNUMX AMD.Example of token usage.Contribute to the protocol management of development initiatives, including use of funds, reward distribution plans, plans, etc.Revenue Sharing: Amulet will share the revenue generated with the AMT token holder.

      "body": "AMUNATIONTo begin with a short introduction to refresh your memory, literally in the abstract:The DeFi sector grew over 27 times in 1.5–2 years ( from $9.7 billion to $261.2 billion)The massive growth of this sector provokes numerous losses due to hacking, market volatility, holes in smart contracts, etc.Accordingly, there is a strong demand for risk hedging, the most popular of which is insurance.A factor such as the total volume of TVL for networks, for example, TVL on Solana grows 5 times faster than on ETH, forges demand on risks hedging.And that’s where a project called Amulet Protocol comes on the scene — it’s a DeFi insurance protocol for the Rust-based ecosystem with an initial deployment on Solana.Amulet is being built with the prospect of simple, reliable insurance for all in Web3. The solution will be the first to be built on the Solana network and has been backed by Solana Ventures, which is also an investor in the project.Amulet uses Solana’s proof-of-stake network to provide stable returns and insurance services through a unique Protocol Controlled Underwriting and Future Yield Backed Claim mechanism that minimizes risk to capital providers for underwriting.In 2021, more than $10 billion was lost in the cryptocurrency space due to various hacks and frauds, including $2.6 billion due to DeFi protocol exploits, according to an Immunefi report.The market needs better insurance solutions, and before the launch of Amulet, DeFi investors did not have that option. Amulet will be DeFi’s first Rust-based insurance protocol, originally deployed on the Solana network and built to meet this high market demand.Amulet will adopt a cross-chain strategy and deploy it to other ecosystems not based on the Ethereum virtual machine along the way.But most importantly, Amulet gives users the opportunity to help protect the blockchain by participating in liquid betting and insurance, which will again be done through a single protocol. Thus, Amulet will be designed with transparency in mind, with a focus on developing the project in collaboration with the security community.If you know English well, you can carefully read the infographic below, which schematically explains the structure of the protocol process.Positively, we can distinguish 3 main areas of the protocol, these are:Insurance — the ability to protect the value of your assets with: smart contract insurance, stable coin depeg insurance and NFT insurance.Steering — the ability to put your assets in Amulet with peace of mind. Amulet is the only insurance protocol that includes 3 levels of protection between claims and your assets.Earnings — Hybrid claim management: automatic payouts when you depeg stable coins and claim management when you confirm DAO.",

      "body": "An effective product protection solution in Web3.Amulet Protocol is a decentralized insurance protocol designed for DeFi, NFT insurance based on Rust. Decentralized risk protection protocols provide financial security for all users interacting with Web3 financial products. They typically cover smart-contract risk, Stablecoin deprivation risk, reduction risk, oracle failures, economic exploits, etc. Smart contract risk is particularly significant because more than $3 billion was lost in 2021 due to smart contract hacks. By offering protection against these more common types of DeFi risk, as well as offerings related to NFT and the meta-universe, users and developers can enjoy a more secure Web3 through Amulet.Existing DeFi risk protection protocols rely on outside underwriters to provide capital for claims and capacity coverage, creating unique and complex business resiliency issues. Amulet is creating the risk protection industry’s first protocol-controlled underwriting (PCU) approach. This is a significant change from the current underwriting capital lease model.Weekly reports, frequent AMAs, bounty campaigns and more come together in Amulet Protocol. The project already has many successful partners and investors on its list, you can see many of them below, but this list is updated and added to every day.Amulet Protocol’s current roadmap is focused on launching a core network.Q2–2022:Announcing the project to the public — 20/4 in Amsterdam ✅Defining the application process and how it will work ✅Developing mechanics to automate with the Stablecoin Depeg proposal ✅Q3–2022:Completing the cover design ✅Conducting code audits and threat analysis, Kudelski Security is doing this ⏳Launch of TestNet (expected September 1, 2022) ⏳Launching V1 MainNet (expected late September 2022) ⏳Completion of risk assessment process ⏳Q4–2022:Launching the Center for Analytics and Governance 🔜Launching the Bug Bounty program 🔜Q1–2023:Additional offerings (initial offerings in September — smart contract vulnerabilities and Stablecoin Depeg) 🔜Enabling Amulet notifications in our app 🔜Launching Amulet Stable Asset Pools 🔜Right now, Amulet Protocol is running its bounty campaign, the AmuNation App. The AmuNation App was created to promote and popularize the project.

This shows that the overall risk profile of the application at the time of this assessment is low.The following are the major themes and issues identified during the testing period. These, along with other items, within the findings section, should be prioritized for remediation to reduce the risk they pose.Safe math was used often, but should be used more consistently throughout the code to prevent potential vulnerabilities from being introduced in future updates.Insurance policy coverage duration, claim expiration dates and claim payout dates may be affected by a lack of precision when dev Epochs are used in place of UNIX time.Single administrator accounts have significant capabilities. These functions should be limited by requiring multiple signers to prevent collusion. We have been informed that this is currently occurring off-chain, but this should occur on-chain in the future for transparency.During the test, the following positive observations were noted regarding the scope of the engagement:The code is well organized.Client contacts were very amenable to conducting joint secure code reviews with the Kudelski Security smart contract auditing team.Anchor framework usage is very consistent and follows the recommended syntax.Critical issues in architecture or code logic were discussed immediately via teleconference.Access the report here: https://files.amulet.org/public/AmuletGlobalMTRLabs.pdf",

      "body": "Hi all. Saw the news that Amulet Protocol announced their roadmap. Let’s see what this amazing project has in store for us!If anyone doesn’t know, Amulet is a decentralized insurance protocol that aims to protect investors’ assets from incidents such as:Smart Contract Vulnerability: A smart contract failure if the covered protocol is exploited or fails to function as intended.Stablecoin Depeg: The risk that a stable coin will trade below its peg for an extended period of time. This is currently only available for dollar-based stablecoins.Slashing: Slashing penalties are not currently implemented in Solana, but the project intends to offer this coverage when this part of the protocol goes live.NFT, Metaverse, and wallet protection are all in development!Amulet’s decentralized coverage protocol provides financial security for all users interacting with Web3 financial products.It currently includes the risks of smart contracts, stabelcoin depeg, slashing, oracle failures, economic exploits, etc.Of all of these risks, smart contract exploits were one of the most significant contributors to the loss of nearly $3B in 2021. By securing these initial types of risks and expanding Amulet’s reach, Amulet aims to create a more secure Web3.DeFi has not stopped its development since the summer of 2020. As the market volume grows, the demand for risk hedging is also going through its growth phase. Despite the dominance of Ethereum and its associated EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) ecosystem in DeFi, other Rust-based public chains are growing rapidly, with Solana leading the way.Along with the growth of Solana as the primary Tier 1 solution, the project predicts that the demand for risk management solutions on Solana and broader Rust-based ecosystems will soon experience its own boom.However, they are still lacking on Solana and few in the Rust-based space. This represents a unique blue ocean opportunity that Amulet immediately exploits to meet the growing market demand for security.As you can see from the picture above, there are 3 main points about Amulet’s operations, these are:Coverage — Only 2% of digital assets in our industry are protected. Amulet Protocol offers additional protection for your digital assets with a range of solutions, including smart contract vulnerability, Stablecoin depeg and NFT coverage options.Steaking — Make steaking in Amulet Protocol easy and worry-free. Amulet Protocol has 3 levels of protection between claims and assets. Doing steaking is easy and, more importantly, it has the highest level of security behind it.Earnings — Amulet Protocol is built on advanced technology. Hybrid claim management will be fully automated in situations such as a Stablecoin de-peg trigger, resulting in payouts. Amulet Protocol also manages claim payouts through its DAO model.In fact, if you go into details, there is a certain underwriting mechanism, in general it’s a little bit another level, so I won’t talk about it in this article. But the idea of the project is very, very cool!So, now let’s talk about the road map of the project.

      "body": "Amulet protocol is an insurance protocol that will secure our assets in the web3 space.What problems can Amulet solve?1. Smart contract vulnerability: smart contract hacking is a trend of 21 and 22.2. Stablecoin depgs: no comment here, after the UST case, everyone knows that stablecoins are not that stable.3. Protection of nft and wallets is also in development.The project raised $6,000,000 during Seed-Round.And you can find Animoca Brands, Solana Ventures, DeFiance Capital, NGC Ventures, Signum Capital and others as investors.What should we do?1. Get on Diskord.2. Start to be active and do work for the project (translations, infographics, guides, etc.).Since in the near future will be given out the role of OH, which will be eligible for awards, that’s what all activity is for!Risk.0/5.Thoughts.I suggest getting active to get OG, as the project is more than relevant, amid Solana’s recent problems, so it’s potentially a gem!",

      "body": "Amulet Protocol (hereafter referred to as Amulet) is a decentralized insurance protocol built for the Rust-based ecosystem, starting with the Solana blockchain. Amulet has designed an innovative and open insurance model, which not only effectively addresses the common challenges of existing decentralized insurance protocols, but also creates a new paradigm shift for the whole insurance sector. Risk underwriting and insurance claim lies at the core of any insurance business; however, all existing decentralized finance (DeFi) insurance protocols have been facing a critical sustainability challenge for risk underwriting and claims. Amulet is creating the industry?s first Protocol-Controlled Underwriting (PCU) approach, in which Amulet will build up its own underwriting capabilities and introduce a claim structure involving a unique Yield Backed Claim (YBC) method. This is a significant deviation from the incumbent insurance models of renting underwriting capability from capital providers to a more sustainable underwriting and claim structure controlled by the protocol. The vision of Amulet is to offer simple, reliable insurance for everyone in Web3. With the addition of Amulet, users in the entire Rust-based ecosystem will gain access to a new way to hedge various risks with insurance product offerings.https://amulet.org/",
