Why not? don't you even learn from what happened with sand and mana? These projects were coming during the bearish trend that happened around 2018 but last year both were giving investors very big return. That needs the time to develop the product and it can't be done in a short time.

That needs years for mana to develop its metaverse but at the end of the story you would be see how many oldest investors who have been farming huge money from this project.",

Metaverse is a very broad term and it is not restricted to cryptocurrency. It has more than a gaming world and is more broadly like VR etc.Even if you don't connect cryptocurrency with Metaverse, financial incentives with Metaverse, it is still a very young industry and need more time to develop and grow.Beta phase or official launch and run, it must have good finance and motivation behind. Motivation is something people are ready to explore, to play without financial incentives. Finance means the economy should be strong and sustainable.VR, arts, graphics are only components on top of Metaverse, not foundations.",

The potential is very good for long term. You know about crypto and how long bitcoin can growth from zero to the almost 70k as its ATH?

After Metaverse, the world will change completely and there will be a revolution in every sphere of life. In my opinion, Metaverse has not even started properly yet. There is still a lot to see and a lot of work to be done. The only thing in this technology What we're seeing right now is just the basics and this is a great time to get into this market to understand it and to invest.",

Metaverse only started their good run here in crypto market and they are far from over so for sure those good projects can survive this bear market and in the next two years, they will become more expensive. So its good to have some metaverse token now, they will rise again and in time you can see more good projects to continue coming because many will start to adopt Metaverse again.",

You can't just think that those projects built in hyped as metaverse will survive in the long run. If we could imagine what happen to some ICO and Defi projects, they went close to dying several months after their launch. Thus, if you are going to make an investment in crypto better not to choose them. During this bear season, old projects like BTC, ETH, and BNB (and some of the leading altcoins) are to be called reliable projects that we know will be able to survive the dip. It was just a slim chance for new and hyped projects just like Metahero.",

I can't be wrong with this as I can compare them in the past projects as only a reliable project will be able to stay and be recognized by the investors while the other just be rejected and lose their value. ICO, IEO, Def, and NFT, many of them are absolutely out of the market already, and this will also happen to metaverse projects.

Just a waste of time, we don't need to take it seriously. We need to focus on more massive Bitcoin adoption and don't let ourselves miss the train quickly. metaverse will only be a wishful thinking that can not be felt by all parties. So it would be a waste of time to have that kind of belief in the metaverse. It took more than 10 years to make Metaverse more friendly and effectively accessible.",

There are many projects that are building their games and if you are looking at the token price then there wont be that much after the market collapse but just look for the project roadmap and the team behind the project and take your decision as there are a few promising projects in the space that delivered with big NFT signings and hopefully they will deliver with the metaverse as well.",

You already said it yourself, the hype is still there so meaning may investors are still going to flock and invest on them whether we are in a bear market.So for now, I would say chances are they are to survived. But its survival rate does not depend on themselves, it depends on whether we will see another hype in the future. If something new comes along they obviously, some investors might get out of metaverse and then go on the latest craze. That's how everything works in crypto unfortunately.",
