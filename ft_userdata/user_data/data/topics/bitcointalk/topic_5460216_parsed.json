That is what it seems to me if bitcoin can go below $29200.What do you about this?I think there's a broader context here. On July 14, the market was hit with positive news about ripple and the fact that sec was unable to prove something that looks like security is a security (XRP can meet all points of the HOWEY test - should be easy to prove it if you have the judge on your side and present some facts properly - ICO to gain funds to conduct business, the investor buys to earn profits from the functioning of the business. And if SEC failed in the case of ripple, which seemed easy, what about other cryptos, including the sued BUSD which is a f*king product that people use to invest in other stuff ... not a securitu that people buy to earn! So the traders went shopping. Or rather, retail investors rushed to buy, because the big fish probably knew about the decision much earlier. And since they knew before, now they are taking profits by pulling retail investors under the stoploss, which everyone probably has in the area of 29.5-29k from where there will probably be a false breakout and we will return to old trend which is up. All that to deceive the largest number of investors as Jesse Livermore once said - \"The stock market is never obvious. It is designed to fool most of the people, most of the time\"",

But if this time the support in the $30k area is still strong, then the possibility of going up will be even greater. This will be the determination of whether Bitcoin will continue its rise, or will correct and head for the Flip Trend area at $28k.Time Frame 1D",

Nevertheless, we will see if this is going to hold on not.I mean $30k has been the support for quite sometime now, so now the ball is on the side of the bulls to keep it, otherwise, the bears are going to succeed and so $28k and then $25k is the next obvious support line. Not sure though why it went below, maybe there is negative news in the market again.",

And in my opinion that's the best speculation we can have since the market is uncertain. Only that the chances of a drop is decreasing every day.Also if you see the charts, the level from 30-33K is a key level that acted as strong support in the bull market as the price of bitcoin dumped from above 60K to 30K before going again to above 60K to make all time high. Now this level is acting as a strong resistance in the bear market.I think when the price of Bitcoin will surpass 33K, then we will officially be in a bull season, but it may take some time as we may get rejected from this level a few times before we actually surpass this price level.",

What so far that I understand in this year, since January we have been in bull season, followed by mild bear market, but still bitcoin has been above $30000 for a long time this year. We may have bull season but I am just speculating what could happen in short term. What I noticed recently is that the bears may win before they will become the bulls which might lead to another bull market. But as for now, bear market seems what to be coming. Let us see as what the market will turn out to be, I may not be right. It is just a speculation.",

The best traders basically traded the daily wicks and will do so until we get a clear break.With respect to Bitcoin, usually when it consolidates and trades in a tight range like this on resistance, it will most likely break and head higher. However nobody knows when that will happen. We might get the wick taken out at the lows around $29400 before we head higher. I would wait for confirmation first before going long.",

This looks more like bitcoin may decrease more? That is what it seems to me if bitcoin can go below $29200.What do you about this?The recent price movement of Bitcoin, with fluctuations around the $30,000 level, has indeed been notable. It's not uncommon for Bitcoin to encounter support and resistance levels as buyers (bulls) and sellers (bears) influence the market dynamics.While past trends can provide some insight into potential future movements, it's essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market can be highly unpredictable and influenced by a myriad of factors. Predicting short-term price movements with certainty can be challenging.If Bitcoin's price remains below $30,000 and approaches the $29,200 level, it could be seen as a critical juncture for the market. Breaking below that level might signal further bearish sentiment, potentially leading to a deeper correction. However, it's crucial to be cautious about drawing definitive conclusions solely based on short-term price movements.Investors should consider a broader perspective, conduct in-depth research, and assess various indicators and market sentiments before making any decisions. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and it's essential to approach it with a long-term mindset and risk management strategies in place.As always, seeking advice from financial experts and staying updated with reliable sources can aid in making more informed decisions. Remember that any investment carries inherent risks, and diversification can be an effective strategy to manage potential fluctuations in the market.Ultimately, it's best to focus on the fundamentals of the cryptocurrency you are investing in and consider your investment goals and risk tolerance when navigating the ever-changing landscape of the crypto market.",

I do not think we are going to see a 'bull run' that soon. But I do think we can stay at price point of $30k and 30-30k is going to be a big test for future resistance.",

Bitcoin might probably drop below 30k$ because there are some short-term investors that are going to sell their Bitcoin for sure, and they might want some quick profit, and it's a small percentage drop so some might get afraid of HODL.The market is looking great in my opinion and the price today doesn't really matter a lot since I'm not planning to sell my Bitcoin yet, I'm aiming for the bull run and well on the right track from 15k$ to 30k$ this day and we still have the Bitcoin halving event I think it could easily skyrocket the market price triggering the Bullrun for sure.",
