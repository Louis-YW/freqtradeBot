  "content": "I read this article last year and stumbled upon it again today. I find the article quite relevant in 2023, as bitcoin awareness spreads across the world. I feel there will be a positive correlation between its awareness and adoption. Supporters and believers in bitcoin would want to go the extra mile to show their belief in Satoshi's project. Let's talk about retirement. I have provided a snippet of the article below, along with some questions for discussion. I hope we can engage with it.QuoteSome investors may soon be able to add cryptocurrencies to their 401(k) accounts. Fidelity Investments announced Tuesday it will begin allowing investors to put cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in 401(k) retirement accounts, making it the first provider to do so. The offering will be available midyear for the 23,000 companies that use Fidelity for their retirement accounts. (Of course, your employer, as the plan sponsor, has to agree to it.) Some investors may be wondering if cryptocurrencies have a place in their retirement savings. Many financial advisors say it can be part of a well-balanced investment portfolio, and have noted that clients have already been adding it to their investments outside of employer-sponsored retirement savings.As a bitcoin supporter, would you consider adding bitcoin to your retirement savings, or do you prefer the traditional 401(K) or IRA? If yes, to what degree? 100%, 75 %, 50%? Also, do you think that accepting bitcoin into your retirement savings account is a form of the DCA method?",

If possible I can use the retirement plan for buying assets like bitcoin and gold, I will prefer that. I m not having the fiat mentality because fiat value will always get to reduce. I am not a type that have to depend on anything like government or anything that have to do with retire plan because I work for myself. I prefer my savings for the future not to be in fiat, it is better if I have asset instead. During a massive bear market, it is another good sign that I should save in bitcoin.",

Also, do you think that accepting bitcoin into your retirement savings account is a form of the DCA method?I do not really look after my retirement plan and not having any plans of adding bitcoin as such. I am more or less trying to put up more money in Fixed Deposits with long tenures as well as Mutual Funds. As far as the two concerned, they will bring me vital amount of profitability over the period of time and the same returns I can use for my future. I would love to enjoy my life right now as it is and have as much fun as I could out of it. This does not mean I am going to be broke in my old age, because FD and MF will take care of that. QuoteAlso, do you think that accepting bitcoin into your retirement savings account is a form of the DCA method?I dont think so. Bitcoin's volatility is really high and that makes it genuinely risky asset to hold for next 40-60 years. That is considering a retirement age by that time. It could go upto 1 million a btc in next 10 years but who has seen the future thereafter? It could reverse itself and be at 500 bucks? That scares me and that's I dont think its potential companion for my retirement plans.",

There's no need to go through a fund management from a third party company or a financial institution that do uses it. If someone doesn't have the full knowledge on how to keep his bitcoins as a retirement fund, that's where I think such service is needed.

But among things like gold, stocks and so forth, the best one in my mind is crypto. Of course you need to be careful what you pick, most of my money is in bitcoin and its there until I retire 30 years from now, which means that I can hold my coins for another 30 years if I do not need to cash it out.

Anything above 30% is way to risky to invest in bitcoin as retirement investments. I already have bitcoin as part of my plans with the idea of doing DCA biweekly and saving the rest retirement funds in fiat and possibly other assets. Although Fiat is risky due to inflation but we are yet to reach a stage where bitcoin should be 100% investment funds.",

If you've been successful throughout your life, or even just invested wisely every month for a long period of time, then it is wise to have a small chunk - more like 5% and below - diversified in these \"fun\" side holdings. Crypto simply doesn't compare to where people usually keep their retirement savings and has not grown a long enough record to be considered a safe asset like the companies that most people own in the pension schemes. Companies make products or sell services, if you own a share of them and they generate profit, that's how you get an income in retirement but crypto doesn't offer the same predictability. It is simply a gamble that you'll be able to sell it for higher without it producing anything of tangible value.",

Unlike with bank savings wherein it will always be there unless your bank will be subjected for bankruptcy but that's another story I guess.

Also, do you think that accepting bitcoin into your retirement savings account is a form of the DCA method?I think 401k, IRA and crypto are retirement methods for married men with children. For those who have their families depending on them. It becomes harder to accept risky ventures, which might be more profitable. 401Ks and IRA's are often funded by investments in stock markets based on the assumption of long term growth. In eras where inflation, recession or economic contraction are prevalent, they generally become less satisfying as investment vehicles due to reduced growth.Youth who are single and do not have families could do better with higher risk retirement investments. They do not have families or children relying on them. Making it easier to learn, explore and develop knowledge and skill base.Personally, I like dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP) as there are documented cases of people earning enough to retire early using them. They depend more upon profits than long term growth. Which could make them more attractive over the long term than 401ks or IRA. Due to profits being (IMO) an easier goal to achieve than consistent growth.I love bitcoin. It has always resembled something not unlike a warzone with no shortage of controversy and conflicting opinions. If anyone is relying upon BTC for their retirement I hope they diversify and have 2nd and 3rd options. Whatever BTC I have for HODL purposes, I'm complimenting with as many other things as I can find.",
