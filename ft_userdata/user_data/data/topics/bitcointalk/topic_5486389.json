I don't know, if anyone can help me I would really appreciate it!None of those centralized exchanges are safe to hold your Bitcoin or ETH. But, if you are a day trader who trades every day, you may use those platforms. But, Binance is more popular than OKX. But when it comes to safety and security, all of those centralized exchanges are the same. It's never advised to use that website to hold large amounts of money.You may keep a hundred dollars or two hundred dollars just for trading purposes. Actually, it depends on how much you can afford to lose. If $200 is a big amount of money for you, do not keep it on those exchanges. But, if $500 is nothing for you, you may keep it there.",

That's probably the worst thing that you've done, futures trading is already difficult when it's with bitcoin and you're doing it with altcoins? You've got some balls bro!Don't use exchanges for long-term bitcoin storage because you're going to be regretting it when they get attacked by hackers and your funds get stolen, it's not recommended that you store your bitcoins on an exchange even if it's a decentralized one, you're better off using Electrum wallet or any cold wallets to store your bitcoin for the long-term.",

Second,¬† future trading is highly risky even if you're doing the trading on Bitcoin and the safe side is still the long term holding. According to your knowledge I will advise you to do for long term holding and if you want to diversify your holding make sure you have concrete portfolio management knowledge.¬† In addition to, make BTC your investment priority.",

      "body": "I am not so familiar with OKX Exchange, but from what I have heard from others who use it, it seems they have good service. I do my futures trading on Digifinex, but if I want to cash out to my bank account, I usually use Binance Exchange. The Binance Exchange does have futures trading, but I don't quite like it compared to the other exchange I mentioned. If I get you right, you said you want to give up on future trading and be dedicated to investing and holding alone, so you don't need to store your coins on those CEX if you want to start holding. Take the advice of mk4 and get a hardware wallet that is the best for storing your crypto asset for a long holding period. If you cannot afford a hardware wallet, then you can use the best software wallets, which are the Electrum or Exodus wallets. If you are using a software wallet, make sure to generate your address on an air gap device, then extract your private keys.",
