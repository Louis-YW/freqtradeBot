What this forum will do is help the government create blockchain software that will only help the government and not the crypto community. This is what i was able to deduce from the article.",

You are right at your place that forum doesn't always have to be a web forum, it can certainly be an offline forum as well.But I was just looking for their website and that didn't necessarily mean it has to be a web forum too.By the way, I just found the website and here it is https://www.indiablockchainforum.in/",

Great, i just checked the website but i didn't recognise those influencers listed on the home page. Kind of a new to understand what they meant as influencers. My understanding was that they might be social media influencers. Most of them are into government based projects or involved in decision making when i checked their linkedin profile.",
