I've not used this wallet before but right now I cant find any that supports kusama, Astr and Azero out of the box, Azero official wallet works through website and I don't like the idea of keeping my coins in a website like a wallet and bookmark it, any past experience with Nova?.",

At least, they have a public repo on GitHub: https://github.com/nova-wallethttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.novawallet.android this Nova wallet is \"a decentralized wallet compatible with BTC and VSOL\" and according to https://walletscrutiny.com/android/net.novawallet.android/ it is neither open nor closed source, it is \"under development\", which means its status still needs to be evaluated.https://novawallet.net/ is a web wallet but it has a version for iOS which can be found here: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nova-wallet/id1592044359#see-all/reviews In the description it is said that this wallet is \"non-custodial\" but it doesn't necessarily mean this wallet is open source.

Novaexchange seems to be a shady exchange since many people complaining on their thread.I think with the 2 years gap, it might from the same people who create this nova wallet.If you worried to use web wallet, you can use Ledger since AFAIK Ledger support those 3 coins you mentioned above.",
