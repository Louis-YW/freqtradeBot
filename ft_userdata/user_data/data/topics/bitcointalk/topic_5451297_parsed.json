Notbecause his a president elect and awaiting to swear in to seat, but as a government officials not just that but a Governor in that case. Okay just take a look at PO, he can be invited to commission bridge and flyover yet he would pull more crowd than BAT so I don't see anything bad to what he did.Please note that I am not a fan of PDP or APC neither LP. I just answered this questions without a bias mind. But what also made me angry was indefinite (unannounced) public holiday he took just because they wanna commission bridge and flyover.",

The thing tire me because shenanigans just dey look for favour up and down to be relevant.Chairman no dey over stress yourself, nobi today wey wike dey run matters as him like. Right from time Wike sabi use anyhow politicians use launch him project and how wetin state government do carry become federal project. All the flyovers wey wike dey commission, na different politicians him dey use and nobody dey talk anything as na him own politics be dat but why when e reach jagaban turn everybody come dey para para. Wike can decide to use the former president to commission a project wey be goodluck Jonathan and nothing bad there. We wey dey this area dey see them steady bases on flyover commissioning.As for the holidays matter, Governor Wike is the governor of Rivers States and he'll qualified to give a public holiday in his state. If you noticed the holiday only affects affair of the state ran by rivers state and e no affect federal, government establishments like schools as dem been get normal lectures as I hear for radio. Wike been dun invite Buhari him own even when him no dey there party as well as invited opposition politicians to commission one or two things for the state as well. Wike dey fight for himself to dey at peace with everybody and at the same time the state go dey at peace with every political party so we fit benefits as na so Nigeria politics dey.",

Na wrong mentality to dey use emotions for politics because in politics there is no place for emotions or religion and the only language in politics is that, politics is a game of interest, so let it be and as the seating governor he has the right. Todelare work free day for the workers in the state. Even Governor El Rufia did the same by declaring a public holiday for the state workers on a couple of times now and it is still cool, it's not only the seating president that has the constitutional right to commission projects, and even outside that Woke worked so much for Tinubu presidency and just like the president Elect said he holds port Harcourt to heart and you know what that means for the state I'm term of interest protection against the next administrativenon. Wike is building and expanding his political tentacles and from his current political permutations, he may likely secure a place for himself in the elit cycle in the next administrations.",

I am not siding anybody but let the truth be told in accordance with the law, Tinubu has every Presidential power ever since he won and was issued a return certificate. He assumes the right to the Presidency pending his official handover he even has the right to attend FEC meetings and advise the President but does not have much right to signatory until it is handover. So therefore, it is not wrong as the governor himself is a lawyer and he fully knows the law that was why he went ahead to invite Tinubu to commission the projects.In terms of these categories mate, it is not lawless and neither is it politics here. It is part of the obligatory duties as a President elect.",

It is a state project and Wike the governor of the state has the right to invite anyone he likes.Exactly. And also the Federal government can also send anyone who is dim fit to commission project. And the project in queation was build by the state government so there should be no argument here. The project was not build by a minister but a governor so he has all the right to choose who would commmitission his projects. So there is nothing to talk about it.If the project was build by Minister and Tinubu who is the President Elect was called to come and commission the bridge then the incumbent president would have angry but reverse is the cause here.
