  "content": "A decentralized autonomous organization is not possible when depending on a centralized energy system.The dependence of cryptomining on an energy company makes the DAO meaningless.If the DAO creates electricity generation itself and does not buy electricity from an energy company, then we can talk about complete independence from energy companies and decentralization of the organization.If the DAO depends on the electricity of an energy company, then energy companies influence prices by setting rules.  1. Increase in the price of electricity.  2. Electricity consumption quotas for 1 person (house)This is not the case now. But in conditions when in the USA all power grids and generation are worn out by 80%. Governments will establish new laws to regulate electricity prices and consumption for the reconstruction of power grids and generators",

I don't think there was much cohesion in the industry before then but now there'll be even less.The USA isn't the only country that mines in PoW and I think it'd be easier to compete with from other countries if it was as someone in another country could likely negotiate a better rate. Some PoS implementations suffer from selecting nodes based on proximity which is worse for decentralisation (as in they favour bandwidth and ping speeds, which is essentially the same thing as a bunch of nodes in the same datacentre are going to be preferred over ones scattered about).",

But 5th generation fighters are produced by Russia and sold to China.US food prices rise, political crisis between Biden and TrumpIs everything bad in the USA?",

I'm not in the US so I wouldn't know what the problem actually is (if there is one).",

      "body": "Its impossible to influence energy markets as a middle man or energy reseller.The true nature of decentralized energy could describe a format where consumers coordinate and organize to generate their own electricity. We already see this occurring to a degree with the trend towards off grid sustainable living. To achieve a true decentralized energy market, the offgrid trend would only need to expand to encompass a wider segment of the population.Cities are the area where it would be difficult to achieve decentralized energy of any type. Due to space, regulation and constraint limits. City energy generation will always be centralized in nature. The high population density could not accommodate any other format. It is possible that hydrogen power could decentralize city based energy markets to a degree. This would involve the use of portable hydrogen fuel containers and fuel cells. Which would be plug and play to avoid use of the grid. Similar to existing propane energy markets. Its an old concept that has been around for more than 10 years. The only thing that might make it feasible now is the high cost of fossil fuels.We never suffer from a shortage of good ideas. At least we have that going for us.",

You could literally be a company and work towards being like a group of developers who build things, like websites and games and what not and then you could have a DAO structure for it so that everyone would get a fair share, just like a company with stocks, and the people who get paid would get paid based on how many they have.So, electricity doesn't \"really\" matter in that case, mining is not always regarding DAO, hence it means that we shouldn't really consider them all the same things and people with all the same aims.",
