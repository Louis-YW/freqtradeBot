You will see them in the comment section of Luna twitter Handle about their story of Luna.Because it becomes normal in crypto seeing prices of shitcoins going from $more than $50 to $1 and in next few months it goes up a bit again.  Seem very hopeful for the Lunatics to expect its pump again. Not realizing that Luna will have to gain trust again before going up  and its the hardest to do now that we  learn Do  Kwon was also the developer of Basis Cash that was also the failed stablecoin.If I was a holder, I will gladly receive those token but I'm not going to be hopeful about it.",

UST was down less than 75% because of the attack, it dropped a further 50%+ because no recovery plan was actually created from what I can tell (we could arge the whole 86% was due to a bad recover plan and a very overconfident ceo). I'm not too sure on how they operate but could this not make bridges and liquidity pools incur losses?I'm not sure how much was on other chains but I saw wrapped ust tradable on uniswap?Regardless of the rollback, I'm not sure luna can really recover from this point. If they took the current chain, found the $12bn+ to back up at least the ust that was owned then it'd be more possible for it to \"feel\" like a blip.",

I do not dislike Luna at all but according to what I see, all of the saving or rollback efforts might lead to no result. I mean, if you are giving a new coin that is more valuable than your latest Luna or UST funds (which is around 0), would you choose to hold it? And in trading, you must only trade the amount you afford to lose. It is your choice to trade Luna, go all or nothing in Luna",

All these new token ideas comes from the fact that creators want some more money, they will do a new one, hope that people will jump in, and they will take that money too.There is a big chaos going on, even the smaller names inside the token lost a huge chunk of money, only one that earned anything from it is Do Kwon and that is why everyone is looking for a solution to it as quickly as possible.",
