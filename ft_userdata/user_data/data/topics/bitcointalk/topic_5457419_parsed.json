  "content": "QuoteWhile a few countries have completely banned crypto assets given their risks, this approach may not be effective on the long run. The region should instead focus on addressing the drivers of crypto demands, including citizen's unmet digital payment needs, and on improving transparency, by recording crypto asset transactions in national statistics.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) after standing firm on it's position all this while on the need for countries to ban cryptocurrency makes a u-turn. This is coming as a result of the widespread usage of digital assets and CBDCs in latin America and the Caribbean. IMF is coming to terms with reality of the benefits of digital assets and feels cryptocurrency should not be outrightly banned but should be regulated. I wonder what could really be responsible for the sudden change of IMF's position on the subject matter but I still think it's a win for the crypto community.SOURCE: https://cointelegraph.com/news/imf-banning-crypto-not-effective-in-long-run/",

Source to 9 pointsYeah, i totally agree, but it will be a win for crypto only if those countries who banned it and will unban crypto. And provide some legal ways too. This will streamline the adoption of crypto and thus it will be considered as a win. But yeah it do have good impact on the market and it will help market to go beyond its limitations.",

Is it new or not predictable?No. Because IMF with pressure from big nations, will not allow totally freedom in finance and cryptocurrency if they see threats. They did not touch on this market years ago when it was like infant and very small. When this market becomes big enough, governments, IMF will pay more attention on it and do more regulations. It is very predictable.Is it coincidence that after hype news with Bitcoin ETF, we have bad news from IMF?",

It would have been better if it had been managed without any sacrifice or disadvantage, but I doubt they could have managed it better without wanting to profit from it. However, regulation would be slightly better than completely banning cryptocurrencies, moreover the use of cryptocurrencies and CBDCs almost look the same at a glance so that the IMF knows that cryptocurrencies will be much better if there are specific regulations for them.QuoteI wonder what could really be responsible for the sudden change of IMF's position on the subject matter but I still think it's a win for the crypto community.Hopefully this can actually be a victory for the crypto community, so that crypto can grow more widely in this world and also doesn't make people in the crypto community hesitate to continue to be in crypto. But if the goal of the IMF itself is to make crypto grow and also get better for the future, I think this really needs to be well supported by everyone in the crypto community.",

But this can also be seen as a win for crypto as the World Monetary Fund has also called for cryptocurrency regulation instead of banning it. I think it will affect some countries that are still hostile to bitcoin, they may not like bitcoin, but they also can't be against the IMF if in the future, IMF openly supports bitcoin. I don't like regulation, but we would rather have regulation than outright ban, and regulation will have both positive and negative effects on the market.",

Government is at war with these privacy coins and it will only take the strength of the blockchain for the privacy coins to win this battle. So many of these coins have not gained popularity and large user base, so if any country bans such coins, it is always a fast lane to extinction of such coin.Meanwhile as you said above, your data is important for the government and they will want to control you. So the battle between the government and crypto will continue and the settling ground will only be regulation.",

      "body": "Normally, for humans to exercise their full rights, there should be freedom of choice, just like the government is supposed to allow citizens of their individual counties to decide whether to use crypto or not. The ban on crypto in those countries where it is banned is not right, in my opinion. Since the IMF realizes that its users should rather address rather than ban, They may see crypto as a bad asset, but the truth is that these same crypto have made some people millionaires and billionaires. An example is Bitcoin, which has made so many people billionaires. As such, it has also contributed to the economies of those nations because instead of those citizens complaining to the government or relaying on government jobs, Bitcoin has made them archive a great Wealth that has made them wealthy and build other businesses, even to the extent of employing others.

They can easily pinpoint who those users are and can collect enormous taxes for those users. Still strange to see IMF taking a big turn and then calling for its regulation like they realized crypto is not going to die. It could be planned because of the institutions that are coming to crypto like Blackrock. Unbelievable that they are trying to urge countries like El Salvador not to use BTC.",

I don't see how cryptocurrency is interfering in their obligations so they don't even need to gag the crypto community that is already creating investment and financial freedom for good numbers of youths across. Countries who have created CBDC are seeing need for catching their market audience online , IMF need to understand the current rhythms of the time.",
