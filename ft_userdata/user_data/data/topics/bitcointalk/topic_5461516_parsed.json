The Lightning node and which is also the core of the App is however open source: We call it lipa-lightning-lib and it is open source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/getlipa/lipa-lightning-libIt is responsible for all Bitcoin things, including the cryptography and key management needed for a non-custodial Wallet. The lipa-lightning-lib heavily relies on the Lightning Dev Kit: https://lightningdevkit.org/A couple of helper libraries are also open source (https://github.com/getlipa/wild and https://github.com/getlipa/perro). We've also got the open-sourcing of the mobile wrappers (UI) on our roadmap, which is the last missing piece for the App to be fully open source.  We are aware that transparency (also through disclosing our source code) is a key factor for wallet security and privacy and are working hard to build the lipa Wallet the right way, following the Bitcoin ethos.Please note that the sending functionality is not actually banned by region. What happened here was just a unfortunate mistake regarding the wording we chose for a feature that is yet to be delievered. For that reason, the send Button has been removed entirely in the current version to prevent confusion: Instead you can use the pay button to send Sats to any other wallet of your choosing.",

Regarding fees, your website states:QuoteWith Lipa there are no fees for the use of the app and for receiving transactions. We only charge 0.98% for the exchange of Bitcoin into your currency (EUR, CHF)https://lipa.swiss/en/for-business.htmlBut then on the FAQ we have this:QuoteHow much will it cost me to use lipa?There are no basic fees. Costs are incurred through the use of lipa. We charge the minimum fee of 0.98% of the invoice amount of each transaction.https://lipa.swiss/en/faq.htmlIn the first example, it sounds like all wallet operations are free, and users only pay when exchanging BTC into fiat. But in the second example, you say you charge a minimum fee of 0.98% from the invoiced amount. That also means that the fees can be higher. How much higher? How exactly does your fee system work?The business version of your app is available for Android, while the regular one still isn't. Could Android users (if they wanted) use the Business version in the meantime, and what pros/cons would there be for doing that?If you claim certain parts of your code is open-source, I think there should be a link on your website to the GitHub page. I don't see it among the social media buttons or elsewhere. I see that you posted a link in one of your previous posts, but you should link to it on the website as well.",
