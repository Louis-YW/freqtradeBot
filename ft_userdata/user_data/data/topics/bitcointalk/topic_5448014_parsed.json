  "content": "What is your thought on Carbon NFTs? How could NFT technology stop or reduce climate change? Our proposal:We buy a high-pollution car, scrape, and mint NFTs. The number of NFTs minted will be based on the estimate of the car's future 10-year carbon emissions if that car drives around. 1 NFT equals 1 ton of carbon reduced. How do we calculate car carbon footprint: Calculating a car's carbon footprint involves taking into account its age, mileage, and average fuel consumption. This data allows for the determination of the CO2 emissions that the car will produce over the next 10 years. By purchasing and scrapping cars, we can reduce future carbon emissions.Moreover, each NFT is linked to a specific vehicle using its VIN number, which facilitates the verification of the car's age and mileage, and the computation of future CO2 emissions.One liter of fuel burned emits 2,3 kilo of carbon emissions. Why do we need to do it?According to the data, air pollution is responsible estimated 4,5 million deaths globally, and in city areas, up to 80% of the air pollution is caused by cars.Leave your comments below.",
