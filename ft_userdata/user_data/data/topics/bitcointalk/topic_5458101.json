After I have all the hardware installed I will need to download the wallet for the coin I'm mining. I want to use my ledger X if thats possible but not sure. once I pick a coin I cn download everything I need to stat mining. I'm not sure what coin I should mine,definitely not Bitcoin but I was thinking about Monero.Monero has a mining pool that is not the regular style minimg pools. I heard Ravencoin ,vertcoin ,bitcoin ,grin ,haven protocol (XHV) , bitcoin gold ,dogecoin ,Zcash ,etc.... Just not sure which one would be the best for ease to mine for a beginner and which coin would be the most profitable? Amy help would be greatly appreciated. if there is another coin that is easy and profitable I am open to any suggestions. Thank you very much!!!",

This can change, it's not something \"standard\" during time because there are several factors to be taking in account.https://whattomine.com/I find very useful this website that show clear \"what to mine\".

I think Kadena and bitcoin cash will be more profitable than other altcoins. My suggestion is to mine Bitcoin as much as possible.Eg: 1. Kadena2. Bitcoin Cash3. Iron Fish4. Horizen",

      "body": "you made an investment of at least $3000 and you didn't even check what you will be mining? You probably haven't checked the profitability either and you probably don't even know what the price of electricity is at home? It probably couldn't have been worse. Most of the coins you listed are not even mined with gpu (only ascic). In 2022 there was a merge on eth (POW to POS) and thus the entire GPU that was mining ETH (90% of all GPUs) for a last year desperately looking for a use. The market is probably saturated by now. By checking https://whattomine.com/ and pasting my local electricity prices, I lose money on every coin.",

HorizenI recognized Kadena before and maybe it was hot back in time but I don't know about now since it's been a long time that I haven't seen this coin or being talked about in the forum while as for Bitcoincash, the coin was pumping recently though I doubt if it will last a long time as many are saying that it was only being manipulated.Your suggestion of mining Bitcoin is still going to be the best option but but, that is you have a real passion about mining since it wasn't easy and it isn't cheap. There were lots of stuffs to be considered first like location, space, weather conditions in the area and so on.. before one can effectively make Bitcoin mining a somewhat profitable activity.",

Sir, i am also new in Bitcoin actually still i didn't started but i'm interested in mining. If you could share some ideas in details with me like as, how much money i need to buy equipments (hardware/software), and weather and space which you said that.",

There is never an answer for this question that stays static, everyday it can change.  Some people already posted here but whattomine is a great website to monitor.  If you are in it for straight profitability that's your site, but other people are into a project and just want to accumulate a particular coin, that's fine as well.",
