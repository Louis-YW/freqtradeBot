Last month’s estimates are also far larger than central banks’ official reported figures, sparking speculation in the industry over the identity of the buyers and their motivations.The last time this level of buying was seen marked a historical turning point for the global monetary system. In 1967, European central banks bought massive volumes of gold from the US, leading to a run on the price and the collapse of the London Gold Pool of reserves. That hastened the eventual demise of the Bretton Woods System that tied the value of the US dollar to the precious metal.Last month the WCG estimated the world’s official financial institutions have bought 673 tonnes. And in the third quarter alone central banks bought almost 400 tonnes of gold, the largest three-month binge since quarterly records began in 2000.“The message these central banks are sending by putting a larger share of their reserves in gold is that they don’t want to be reliant on the US dollar as their main reserve asset,” Menke said.Some in the industry speculate Middle Eastern governments are using fossil fuel export revenues to buy gold, most likely through sovereign wealth funds.The world continues dumping US dollar, I've already talked about India buying gold and many times about Iran accumulating gold over the past couple of years. Now we have evidence of the other Eastern powers buying large amounts of gold. Many other smaller countries that don't fall into the global geopolitics like Qatar, Turkey, Uzbekistan, some African countries, etc. are also accumulating more gold. This is the New World Order that is forming in front of our eyes, the old Dollar standard is slowly but surely going away which is causing high inflation in US as all the unbacked dollars they'd printed all these years are being dumped on USA itself and even higher inflation is seen in any country that is importing US inflation like Europe. Experts suggest that if US wasn't exporting its inflation, the real US inflation would have been somewhere north of 450% and that's where it's headed as the dollar dumping continues.I recently watched an analyst who suggested that this is World War 3 which will be fought (at least for now) economically. The East vs. West as the East dumps US dollar that strains US economy. China suddenly lets loose COVID on the world (this past 2 weeks) that is already showing an increase in EU and US. Oil price ends the year with the 2nd straight annual gain and the general high energy prices among other things is slowly rendering EU useless as an economy and industrial power.Although economy is not the only battlefield (we have energy, food and actual armed conflict between proxies) but it is affecting us the most. It is even affecting bitcoin price as it has successfully prevented its rise to higher ATH last year and even changed its bull trend and crashed the price below the previous (2017) ATH for the first time in bitcoin history.With that said, 2023 outlook is already bad economically speaking.How much of the points I raised do you agree with and how do you see 2023 specially when dollar dumping continues?",

All you've presented is a chart of gold purchases and you have just made up an entirely unsupported narrative, aka a lie. It makes you look quite naive and foolish, or just a sad propaganda puppet. There could be all sorts of reasons why gold trades are happening, Russia may have a lot and simply need to sell it off because they don't have access to trade via the world banking system, other countries like India might be taking advantage of the situation while it is available and buying up large quantities far under market value. Neither of these mean what you have suggested in the title and you're conspiracy crap like New World Order shows your ridiculous slant on the story.",

The biggest example that was made public is Russia that started selling its energy for their own currency effectively replacing US dollar as \"international medium of exchange\".There are a lot of other examples like Iran selling fuel to other countries for gold and basically a lot of countries in BRICS and SCO trading using their national currencies.Quote from: davis196 on January 01, 2023, 11:12:17 AMI'm curious about the Russian-Chinese alternative to the US dominated financial system.So far I have seen a lot of solutions including but not limited to gold, each country's national currency, a new currency created by BRICS and even bitcoin.

In has happened in the past, before US introduced Petrodollar and saved its economy US dollar dumped more than 50% in 6 months.Quote from: Leviathan.007 on January 01, 2023, 07:33:50 PMI would replace some words and say the world is dumping fiat currencyUnfortunately that will never happen in our lifetime. It is the replacement of one centralized currency with another centralized currency. When these countries buy gold one of the reasons is to back their centralized limitless fiat to try and strengthen it and create a strong incentive for others to use it for trades.On top of that with the new era of CBDCs we are seeing even more centralized fiat (in digital form).",

The growing interest in gold is a consequence of the deteriorating economic situation around the world, and not distrust of the US dollar. Rising inflation is observed in all countries, so it is quite reasonable that against this background, the governments of some states are now buying up gold. The dollar is going through a difficult period, like any currency of states.In addition, uncertainty about the future also comes from the current political situation, and primarily because of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine. Russia has started a war that it is not able to win, and now the threat of collapse hangs over it. In any case, Russia will no longer be able to influence world processes, as before. Therefore, big shifts in spheres of influence are coming.",

So it's not uncommon for people to choose gold over bitcoin.In my opinion, bitcoin is now just a tool to manipulate the profits of tycoons, not a real asset. It's true that bitcoin has advantages over gold and fiat money, but it's too small to assume it can replace a thousand-year-old recognized asset like gold. In 2022, the stock market alone had evaporated more than 20 trillion due to the crisis, while the entire capitalization of cryptocurrencies is around 800 billion.

Still remembering my grandparents telling me that gold is the best investment when the world is in trouble, but when the Russia Ukraine war started and we reached double digit inflation rates nothing happened to gold. The price of gold doesn't move spontaneously, it isn't a volatile asset and that is why it is relatively safe and prolly the most perfect hedge to inflation. Your grandparents are correct because gold is a store of value/safe haven asset, so what they meant by it is a great investment when the world is in trouble is that it can retain its value for a very long time, even amidst crisis and wars, it doesn't mean it 'multiplies' the value anyway.Quote from: Mauser on January 02, 2023, 09:25:18 AMMaybe we going to see gold become the number currency for international trade again if the Dollar dumping continues.

Tbh i sincerely don't think we'd see that, some countries may be dumping dollar, but i disagree that it would be completely replaced by gold as the currency of international trade. Crypto doesn't technically protect people's money, a whole lot of them are scam/fake coins; Bitcoin is different though, and it can be a hedge to devaluation, but it is quite volatile in short term.",

A lot of countries with resources are starting to realize that they had all the power all this time not the colonizers who starve for those resources.And what weakens the US can of course be seen from the fact that the alliance of Asian countries is more supportive of the programs offered to the Middle East. So in general the US feels left out because what the US has been doing so far is taking or more precisely seizing the sources of wealth. It's a different story if cooperation between the Middle East and Asian countries, even though their interests are different, is able to provide mutual benefits. So this is where the thread for 2023 points to US transparency.

Unfortunately, Saudi Arabia can no longer be dictated to because it has abundant oil wealth as capital to stand tall.I don't think so. This has been a trend not something that happened over night. The plans to make EU addicted to Russian gas has been going on for decades, the plans to invade Ukraine has also been going on for at least 10 years.Same with Saudis, you have to look at the bigger picture. Saudi family did exactly what Russia is doing for the past 8 years but with the help of US. They invaded their neighbor, the poorest Arab country called Yemen to steal their vast energy sources and gain a strong geopolitical status. During during Trump administration the US military proved its inability to protect them against the country they've been invading. So when the invadees started retaliating and hit Saudi oil infrastructure, Saudi military bases and US military bases successfully the Saudi family realized US is too weak to ensure their future survival in the war ordered by US; so they slowly started changing their position and shifted toward East. This is why you see China in Saudi Arabia selling them crap while US complains and expresses \"concerns\" from afar without doing anything.All these changes would have happened regardless of who the POTUS is and will continue after sleepy Joe goes away.",

      "body": "Russia is known to focus on gold purchases because they're trying to basically temporarily return to the gold standard since the start of the full-scale war, and I must say this strategy worked pretty well, helping to stabilize ruble after it fell a lot from the sanctions and general panic. Relying on one fiat as a safeguard for another fiat is riskier than relying on something that's been historically more stable and is at least different from fiat. That being said, I think that dollar will remain the main global reserve, at least when it comes to a top fiat currency which is a global reserve. The rise of gold is IMO a temporary thing, especially since it has its own issues. People didn't move away from the gold standard without reason, after all. And gold caused issues historically if suddently too much of it appeared somewhere.",
