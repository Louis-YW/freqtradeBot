      "body": "It depends on the seriousness of what the protesters were protesting about, and whether some of them who were shot deserved to be shot/killed. It may be ok to block roads if you are trying to save lives or trying to prevent others from dying or from getting seriously harmed. The only time it may be ok for a civilian to do what the old man did is if he was under attack with deadly things: weapons, objects, etc The blocking of roads by the climate protesters could be justified if there is really serious danger ahead especially life threatening ones.I just hope people tolerate people like that alittle bit more, they could simply be trying to serve the role they were created to serve, although they tend to do it in worldly way. If they were outside of system they could be prophets,watchmen, evangelists warning about coming wrath from the GOD on inhabitants of Earth. You don't touch them if they are genuine because they move with great power and authority... Those who kill or harm them are seriously punished",

Actually, I know this thread does not have anything to do with it, but this makes me wonder how constructive it would be to perform psychological annual check of those people who bear arms and have passed some age threshold. Under this societal and economical conditions I would not be surprised those in their golden years are stressed to the point of getting their mental health to erode quickly. May the family of the victims to find peace on this tragic event of Senseless violence, by the way.Also, OP. It would be helpful of you shared the link or source of the news.",

There are reports that these demonstration or protest has caused untold hardship to the people and economy of Panama. It is estimated that it is causing businesses a daily loss of close to $80 million and it has also led to the disruption of academic activities. But all these effects are not genuine reasons to kill peaceful protesters. I am a big-time supporter of gun control because I believe that the reason why people are killed indiscriminately is because some persons have access to guns. The killer is a lawyer and a professor so he is not ignorant of his actions and the consequences. The law should take its cause and is fortunate that Panama is not a proponent of the death penalty he might just get a life sentence.",

Dude, no need to consider murdering someone, murder is such a deplorable thing to do and if you ever were to do that is because you are cornered and you are out of options like going to war and also murder is something that someone will never be able to come back to so be ready that you will never be the same when you do it. If it's a no contest litigation, he will probably serve the normal sentencing for murder but if this evil piece of shit fights the court the there's a chance that this piece of shit will probably get a lighter sentence.",

Also, this man could have going though a lot in his life, a bunch of negative things happening at the same time and those protestors blocking his way probably was the last thing that pushed him over the edge, lashing out at them. I am not sure how law in that country works, but I believe they will likely put him in prison for the rest of his life, if his health condition starts to degenerate, I would expect the judge to allow him to get house arrest, so can spend some time with his family.",

They block highways, stop people going to work, stop ambulances, they are a pain in the ass. The guy in the US that killed two people was too far though, killing them was not the answer. I think these protesters should do jail time, it might stop them then. Either that or tell them to do & do it in China or Russia, see what happens to them doing it there.",
