  "content": "I am writing here as Raptoreum core is made at least it says by the same developers of Bitcoin core when I click on About tab at the wallet.My problem is this,I have been using 1.2.15.3 which is an old one in Linux for several months and yesterday I downloaded 1.3.17 new version.I extracted in a new folder and run the raptoreum-qt as root in Linux,it start synchronizing and it was recognizing my old transactions about 2700 Raptoreums that I have got from mining got corrupted,however when I shut it down and restarted it,it started synchronizing again now up to the end but showing 0 Raptoreum.Luckily I still have the folder 1.2.15.3 and have some wallet backups of earlier dates in the backups folder,is there a way to add them to the 1.3.17 version,I know the copy and paste but is any other way?I have not deleted anything from either folder,the folders are in the same hard disk,they are not merged or anything,they are different ones.",
