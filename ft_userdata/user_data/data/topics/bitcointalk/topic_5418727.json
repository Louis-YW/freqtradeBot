I am not able to post anything in his thread.Very quickly you give money to a beginner that you don't know in detail, does he really have an invite to cinemageddon.net.• Did you ever ask @LimboAngel to show him the cinemageddon.net invite, sebum sent him money.• Why don't you use a third party/Escrow in dealing with buying and selling invitations/items.• You don't think twice, immediately sending 60 EUR sucks, you are not careful in trading.Try PM @LimboAngel, and ask for the invitation, because you have sent money for him, you know in this forum fraud is not moderated, aka users who trade buy/sell must be careful and use Escrow for security.If, you have sent a PM, he doesn't respond to you, create a flag for @LimboAngel, DT members here will tag that user and support your flag.",

Also, can you please use this report format and present as much evidence as possible, like screenshots of your conversation so we can act on it and tag him (and support your flag if you create one).Quote from: Extrarakeback on October 29, 2022, 02:54:35 PMThat user have 1 post . In the forum even you more than him. According to ninjastic.space that user wrote 82 posts so he had much more prior to OP dealing business with him and now is probably trying to cover his tracks. I am just not sure why he is doing that since he can easily ditch that newbie account and create new one.",

Please help!Thank you very much!judging by what SFR10 have shared, I don't think you'll get your money back. also, it seems like the scammer has been doing this for a while now(based on his banned alt account). I hope this incident will be a lesson for you to be more cautious when making a transaction with someone online.Quote from: Extrarakeback on October 29, 2022, 02:54:35 PMAlso he deleted his post why would you trust a newbie ?a moderator deleted that thread. since thread creators cannot delete their own thread even if they made it a self-moderated thread.",

      "body": "@robelneo, one such measure would prevent people from creating profiles just to scam someone, because even though 1 merit might be easy to get (not for anyone), it would still take some time and effort to get to Jr. Member. After all, this is a forum for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, not a forum where various things that have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies are sold - prove that you are worthy and only then will you get the opportunity to offer your services.I think that many warnings are simply not something that most people pay attention to, and some simply do not understand them due to their poor knowledge of the English language. However, if people applied a little logic from real life, they would prevent a lot of bad situations for themselves - if you are not going to give a complete stranger on the street $50 because he promised you something, is there any logic in doing it online?",
