Irresponsible gambling will make us have bad conditions. I don't hope we will experience something like that because after all gambling is fun and full of challengesBut let's imagine, what kind of conditions might make you stop gambling.Sincerely I have never heard the thought of what can make me stop gambling since I am not gambling on a large scale but only gamble for the fun of it and nothing more than that,  so most time those around don't know that I gamble and some of which are either novice on what gambling is and also have less concerns about it,  like my wife,  she knows I gamble because I don't hide it from her. But the sure thing is that she knows I am a responsible gambler and I don't gamble every day and only take it as a lesser activity that may not have any known effect on my well-being at some point so I worry less and don't even have the thought of stopping. But at some point, if I discover that I am uncontrollably losing money without any result then I will consider quitting or taking a break.",

Not that I'm addicted to gambling but I tralised there was no point quitting because I have made seriius adjustments in my gambling such that it does not affect me much. As a personal rule, whenever I experience series of losses, o go on a break. I have learnt never to chase losses because it only lead to more losses. It is possible I will stop when I play over a long range of time and realised winning isn't coming as I expected. While this is possibility, I don't see it happening so soon.",

I think a piling up debts and no food in the table to be offered will surely make me quit it. For me having so many debts will discourage a gambler not to gamble or slow it down at least, it may not be that easy but if you really wanted to quit it's your responsibility to take action for yourself. Moreover, in reality we experience that one first before totally regretting it.",

The only one right now on my mind would be if I loss my phone or get disconnected from the internet for a long period of time.maybe then I will stop gambling till I can get another phone. My parents won't know if I gamble, not until I start showing symptoms of addiction. If they get to know they definitely will force me to stop. But u don't live with them so it's not even possible for them to know.",

First is self explanatory, some might say a gambling addict would be seeking for ways just to gamble but in my case I’d probably stop; depends on your personality by the way. Another is loss of function; if I wouldn’t be able to interact with my friends, do chores, finish my tasks then this would be the time to stop. Of course it won’t be easy in such state but knowing myself I would do things to cope up with the situation. As much as possible never allow yourself to be in such debt before realization knocks on your head ‘coz that would be a different level of struggle.",

I stopped gambling because I spent all my savings on gambling. Maybe I should have stopped gambling after losing continuously but I realized it too late so I stopped gambling because the situation made it impossible to continue gambling. At that time I wanted to continue gambling and chase my losses but when I had no more money the situation forced me to stop.Since then I began to realize that gambling must be done responsibly because gambling is full of risks and we can spend a lot of money gambling. If we are in an emotionally and financially unstable condition, it is better to avoid gambling because it will make the situation worse",

I do not think my future partner or my family would have a problem with my gambling, because I can be mostly a casual or social gambler, so in my opinion, there is s very slim possibility my personal situation could degenerate into me lossing control of what I do and how much I wager at the time. Some very religious friends could try to convince me to get out of it completely, but I am not that easily affected by others opinions of the stuff I like to do for fun.",

In fact this year I have had stops for weeks, days, due to different circumstances but one of them is that I really don't feel like it, I don't bet out of necessity.In other more specific areas of the world of bettingAbandoning the game is common among poker players, in fact there is documentation about it, complete books, exceptionally successful guys, but they lost the desire to play overnight and never touched a felt again, neither virtual nor in person. Sometimes there is no specifically dark reason, it just happens.#TBT Topic",

But although for me I don't think there is something that would cause me to stop gambling because from the first place I'm not a gambling addict and i no when to call it day if I feel I have gambled too much, so I don't even need something to happen to me before I could stop.",

I know that many might still continue to gamble if that happens because that's how it is going to be and you've got a lot of resource on your hand so that you can keep gambling. But for someone who's set for life and has seen the hardship of it, I might just stop when I am already rich like I own a bunch of businesses and they're making a lot of money. That means that I have no time anymore for doing such things because I need to focus on several things and if there will be some recreational activities that I wanna do then that couldn't be gambling but in some sports maybe like what the rich are doing on their pastime. Some may go back to gambling through their older forms that's what it's like to me.And in a negative point of view, just like what everyone is saying about having no money. You couldn't gamble anymore when you have nothing although some have the demo modes but there is no fun with those. Yes, you gamble and play but you don't stake real money so there's no fun with that unless you are literally having fun with that. Those men that have been scolded by their wives and threatened to end their relationships. Salute to all of you that have chosen to lie low in gambling and chose your wife so that she'll not worry about anymore if you are a spender and you can't control yourself but at least, your partners or wives managed to control you and helped you with that.",
