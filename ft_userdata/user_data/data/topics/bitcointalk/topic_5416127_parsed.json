When bed news hits market and price is not hitting new lows, in fact it bounce back to pre-news levels ... it means that weak hands are gone.Called the bottom in 2019Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on May 09, 2019, 01:45:22 PMI'm very bullish for bitcoin since finally it is bad news resistant. That's the first indicator of the end of bear marketWe had CBOE delisting news without any dump (i know its not bad news but look at it from lambo investor perspective. All of them was waiting for bakkt and btc etf and ... bum bitcoin is being delisted from cboe) It was, in my opinion, fud producing news and should dump bitcoin).We had \"bitfinex print 850 MM\" news and only 3% dump? Under resistance? We should see dump at least 10% without this news simply from TA (fighting with very strong resistance, resting from 60% pump) had we had 3% dump with this news.We had binance 40MM hack and next day we have break 6k resistance.",

For trending market i prefer combining trend lines and SMA then RSI. For accurate check on market volatility on a certain trend Bollinger band does the job perfectly. Before now my candle stick does the main analysis this indicators serves only as confirmation to whatever analysis done with candle stick.RSI are really good to know when to wait for a trend so as to avoid trading an overbought or oversold region. Sometimes SMAs give wrong signals especially the 20 Day-SMA during consolidation at overbought and oversold regions. Knowing how to combine this indicators can be helpful if the are properly read and understood.",
