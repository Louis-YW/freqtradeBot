They also stated that serious institutional, political, economic instability and social crises are the reasons responsible for the coup that they tagged, ‘necessary’ for the progress of the West African country.My question now is, do you think military regime is better and should be the way forward?",

If the civilian government or democratic government have become a pain in the flesh of the people the why not stay in military regime.Many African government are corrupt and will rig and force themselves into power. So if they are forcing themselves into power without the will of the people being allowed then it is as good as military rule. African leadership is corrupt and they won't allow for free and fair election but to manipulate themselves into power. Like in Nigeria, the presidential election conducted on 25th of February is still in tribunal court , so the legimacy of the present government in Nigeria is still in question in court.",

Military coups have become the only approved means of transferring power in some countries.As for Gabon, there was a big lie called “democracy of civilian rule” only because elections were held every 7 years. But in reality, the post-independence period of power was shared in the 1960s between Omar Bengu for 42 years (six consecutive election cycles) and his son Ali Omar Bengu for 14 years (two election cycles) before he was overthrown after his recent victory for a third presidential term. . In effect, it is a dictatorial rule with a democratic cover.",

Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema Gabon's new military leader was close to the Bongo family. He was the aide-de-camp for the deposed president's father, the late President Omar Bongo. Restructuring the military is not the solution to the wave of coups sweeping Africa. Africans want good governance and better economic conditions. Africans don't care who is in government, just give them good living conditions. Paul Kagame the president of Rwanda has ordered the retirement of 12 military generals and 1,013 military officers. The 90-year-old Cameroon President Paul Biya has ordered a major reform in the defense military. These changes will only postpone the doomsday and they should not also forget that retired generals can orchestrate a coup.",

      "body": "Whilst military regime may claim to offer stability and progress, the broader ramifications must be considered. Military takeovers are frequently associated with the suspension of democratic procedures and the restriction of civil liberties. In the case of Gabon, it is a lack of transparency in the democratic electoral system that brings in successive governments. As a result, it is critical to prioritise transparent and credible elections that respect the decision of the people. Gabonese citizens are tired of the status quo, as well as the little country's economic underdevelopment.",

However in Africa, it seems like both the civilian government and military government are the same and having the same characteristics only that the civilian still retain legislature who they gag to become the stooge or puppet to the president. The civilian also allow the judiciary as camouflage and never obey their judgement. So if the military after taking over would ensure that while returning the country back into a new democratically elected president would ensure he doesn't continue flagrant abuse of power, that would better. Africa needs working institutions and that is how military regime would stop .",

There are many bots and trolls sending biased messages confusing progress with dictatorships which is actually proven wrong by history.I completely agree with you. It is like people in Africa and around the world have forgotten what history of dictatorships in Africa was supposed to teach all of us about African authoritarians; they are not saviors who are going to defeat corruption and under development, they will further sink the country into ignorance and poverty when start to fall into corrupt practices.Also, it is not a coincidence we are seeing so many posts and publications around internet which are favorable to the military juntas and amplify the apparent anti-french sentiment in those African countries, it has been proven in these latest years how efficient the Russian government and their farms are when comes to spread their propaganda in social media to distort the view people have on such important political matters. Someone who may not aware of it and gets bombarded with those posts, eventually could even believe that the junta and an hypothetical Russian-African alliance is the solution to get those Republics out poverty.",

That's what African countries really want as it stands now because the level of corruption in African countries is not something to write good of since the African countries started to practice a democratic system of government no longer military government. At least seven of the African countries(Niger, Sudan, Gabon, Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, and Mali) from West African countries have set themselves free through military coups. The next African country to set itself free soon is the giant of Africa(Nigeria). That will only happen if the judiciary doesn't make the right verdict that will favor the masses.",
