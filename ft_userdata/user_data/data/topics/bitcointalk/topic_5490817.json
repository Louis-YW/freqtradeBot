      "body": "The process of mining Bitcoin by burning Flared Gas is not simply that there is an energy source and you insert the plug of the mining device into that source, as the gas is not burned if there is the possibility of storing it and selling it to the markets. Burning the gas can either be a temporary process, as happens in flowback, where it is burned as a temporary measure to remove hydrostatic pressure, which is a stage before the well starts producing gas or as a temporary measure when problems occur. Bitcoin mining resulting from this process is not a continuous thing, and therefore there will not be separate units in mining companies to exploit it, but rather a temporary thing.If someone has more experience or knowledge, please add more links. Moving the topic to the mining board will give you better replies.",

Apart from them, in the context of flared gas-mining Bitcoin, Saudi Aramco was also mentioned even before (2021).If we read this post from @fillippone, it seems that ExxonMobil has expanded such a mining method outside the US. I don't know how successful it was and whether it's still there, but I have no doubt that those who advocate the idea that Bitcoin pollutes the environment will also find something negative in that.",

And so with that, it's a good news as we have been under the radar for years as supposedly bitcoin mining is \"hurting the environment\".This is the argument that has been used so far, but has been debunked already.So it's a win-win for Exxon is they are still mining bitcoin, they can have extra funds from those flared gas for mining operations.",

In communities that are close to these flaring, the health implications are terrible for people leaving there. If there is proper concern about the health of the people there, and also concern for global warming, these projects aimed at stopping flaring will be hastened.Quote from: Zlantann on March 30, 2024, 06:33:56 PMExxonMobil is a multi-billion-dollar business that can afford the cost of experimenting, buying the necessary equipment and hiring the best manpower to make the project successful.

If they don’t do anything with the excessive oil/gas it will go to a waste. They will be burning that unwanted oil anyway so why not make profits from it instead? It is free money. Being rich already doesn’t change a thing. Even Warren Buffett would pick a $100 from the ground. Elon is rich too and yet he is still dealing with crypto. I find your logic flawed.

I have had a former colleague who worked for the EGTL projects which is Escravos Gas To Liquid projects across some African countries and it involved the process of converting the flared gas to liquid which is reused. It was more to save the environment and the ozone layer and if ExxonMobil is considering using this wasted flared gas to power mining plants and save cost, it would obviously be serving to provide employment, save the ozone layer, as well as be profit for the company and to the miners who will pay less as compared to electricity bills.",
