      "body": "It means the coins you're trying to spend haven't been confirmed yet in the first place. Kinda like trying to spend your bank's account money before you actually receive your salary.You can use a high fee so miners include both transactions (\"your salary payment\" and your \"spending\") at once, or you can just wait until the parent transaction is confirmed, and then yours can also be (assuming the fee is enough).The first option is called Child-Pay-For-Parent (CPFP)",

But on some wallets (like Electrum), you will be able to spend the coin, but the parent transaction will first get confirmed or be included in the same block the child transaction would be included so that both are confirmed at once.Parent transaction is the coin with unconfirmed transaction that you spent that has not yet been confirmed. The child transaction is the transaction you make by spending the unconfirmed (parent) transaction.",

      "body": "The yellow icon means that parent transaction which the input is coming fromis yet to be confirmed. This could probably be as a result of low transaction fee you set for the parent transaction. You need to set a high transaction fee that would be able to confirm both. Other colors you might encounter on electrum are 3 gray gears for unconfirmed transactions Small Blue computer for transactions that were not broadcasted and needed to be broadcasted",

It is enabled by default, but you disabled it, which you might not know until now.Know that if the parent transaction is not confirmed, your transaction (child transaction) will not be confirmed unless you use higher fee that is enough to get both child and parent transactions confirmed.",

I am using version 4.4.6 and the \"Spend unconfirmed\" is still there but switching it on and off doesn't change anything. Whether spend unconfirmed is turned on or off if, for example, you chose to spend the max amount, the whole amount will be sent including unconfirmed coins.",

Is this the option you are talking about? If you check the \"spend only confirmed coins\" option, your transaction wouldn't use unconfirmed coins.",
