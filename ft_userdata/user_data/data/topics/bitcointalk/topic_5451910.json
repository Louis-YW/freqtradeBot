Are you selling account too? Do not mind me, I am just kidding  . But actually we can not know if the price of Bitcointalk account is low or not if we are not selling, do not just judge. What I know is that account sales can lead to scam. Also that an account may have problem that can make the account to be useless later. We should discourage account sales.",

I contacted one (I think you exposed him here) he sent me a screenshot of the account with a blurred username, I still managed to find that account after the registration time. Through further conversation, it turned out that he doesn't know anything about that account, not even in any campaign.Unfortunately, that is not enough for any tag or any action against that account.Resellers who offer several Hero or Legendary accounts are certainly not the original owners. These are either hacked accounts or fake offers without real access to these accounts.",

Rule of thumb: when an offer is too good to be true, that means its a scam.The fact remains that the seller is not the original owner of the accounts and is therefore selling an identity to the highest bidder. Even if the seller was genuine and had all the accounts under his control, I think the account would still get a negative tag as an account seller because selling/buying bitcointalk accounts is perceived to be an activity done by people with malicious intent.There are two types of people who buy bitcointalk accounts; the first are those who concern themselves with joining signature campaigns; the second pose a serious risk to the forum and are those who buy high rank accounts to scam. One can imagine what could happen if a DT1 account is hacked and sold to a person with malicious intent.",

And even if you have stock of old Legendary account, one look at Services board and all those open signature campaigns should make you realize that Legendary account is worth much more. I am also curious about the real price, but I doubt that anyone would sell Legendary account for less than $1k dollars given how easy it is to earn that amout of money via signature campaign.

How will a novice buy an account that he cannot manage based on post quality? It will become clear that the account changed hands. I also think that most of these hacked accounts that are placed for sale have been abandoned by the owners. This is because the real owners should have reported the hack or when they observe that the account is now under another person's control. I will not even buy an account even if it is cheaper than what the seller is proposing because it is like buying stolen car. One can never be comfortable driving it.",
