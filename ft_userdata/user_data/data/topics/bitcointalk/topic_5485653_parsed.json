  "content": "Dear colleagues,I want to share a story with all of you that happened to me and may be of interest to everyone who uses cryptocurrencies and security technologies. My name is Igor, I am a resident of the city of Slavgorod in the Altai Krai, Russia.On July 12, 2023, I became a victim of cryptocurrency theft in the amount of 1.32605552 BTC. I had access to my wallet only on a paper medium, as well as through Kaspersky Password Manager, where 12 secret words were stored to access the wallet in the Trust Wallet application on my iPhone XS Max. Amazingly, my funds were transferred to another wallet, despite the fact that I did not receive any phishing or spam emails. Kaspersky suggested contacting the police to initiate an official investigation, which I did. A criminal case was opened, but, unfortunately, Kaspersky does not respond to police requests.I am convinced that employees of Kaspersky are involved in this case, as I have a similar wallet on another iPhone with the same secret words in Trust Wallet, but without using Kaspersky Password Manager, and my funds remain intact on it.It is very important to me that other users learn about this fraudulent scheme to avoid becoming its victims. The lost funds are of great value to me, so I appeal to you for support and advice. Perhaps someone among you has encountered a similar situation and can share their experience and advice.Thank you for your attention and understanding.Igor.Transaction hash: 81cfe97cc16a49398d6986032ec8f6970ea80df5aa0990dcf0164de87136f5bf",

There are some great open source password managers out there. Some are even free or very low cost. Password managers hold the most critical and sensitive private data of our lives. So I would never trust one that is not verifiably open source, with well-known history and great reputation. Again sorry for your loss.",

You store your seed phrase on a password manager. That is wrong. Having it stored on a paper is better. You can have like three copies of it stored in different locations. If you are afraid of those that can see it, then use passphrase with it.Another thing is that you are using a close source wallet. Use open source wallet instead although this is not about what you are talking about but close source wallets should be avoided.",

It's really surprising that it is from a trusted company like Kaspersky, but they are not guilty until it was proven so it's really important not to save anywhere online your private key the writing method is way more better than saving it or you can save it online but in an encrypted container.We really not sure how do they managed to get it and we are not sure whether your device is infected and they managed to go to your system without you noticing it. Now I was thinking that even though if you have hardware wallet, there's still risk if you have save your seeds online.",

But tell me, OP, if the doors in your house are simply closed but not locked, will someone be to blame for this? Storing your seed phrases in managers, on iPhones, or in places where viruses can penetrate is akin to walking on the edge of a knife.Why are you sure that your iPhone is virus-free? Do you think Apple products are invulnerable? I see you have created a complaint on the Kaspersky forum, so we can see what the answers are. https://forum.kasperskyclub.ru/topic/443489-preduprezhdenie-krazha-kriptovaljuty-s-prichastnostju-kaspersky-password-manager-moja-istorija/But Kaspersky itself gives recommendations, and since you are a Russian speaker, I don’t think you need a translator.https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2023_doublefinger-on-the-trigger-a-multi-stage-malware-targeting-cryptowalletshttps://vc.ru/crypto/727570-laboratoriya-kasperskogo-kriptokoshelki-podverglis-slozhnoy-mnogoetazhnoy-atake",

Unfortunately, I don't think that you will get back your Bitcoins.I have never used a password manager in my entire life. I don't store important passwords even in my browser's password manager.Why would you store your 12 word seed phrase in a centralized password manager? This is like giving your credit card details to a random stranger. Never trust anyone when it comes to your private keys/see phrase. Trust yourself and keep the private keys/see phrase in a piece of paper that is hidden in a good place. Maybe having several cold wallets and not keeping all eggs in on basket is another great advice, but I see that you already did this. I would totally freak out if I have all my BTC stored in only one cold wallet.",
