You can't expect the president tinubu to relinquish his sit on mere allegations with out tentative proof. Mind you he has all the power and all other people such as judiciary, military are all his people. No matter the efforts put all together by Atiku and Obi, it can never remove him (Tinubu) from presidential sit.As of todays news, it's a fresh/new allegation, CSU(Chicago State University) certificate presented by the president (Tinubu) was forged. My people wetin be wuna take on about this issues, do you people think there will still be upcoming allegations that will remove the present president from sit?",
