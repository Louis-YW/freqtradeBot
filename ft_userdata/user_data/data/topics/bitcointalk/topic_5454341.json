Don't bother with giveaways/contests not worth your time. Fraud idk, I haven't encountered so far, and even if there is, there are members here quick to point that out.",

Yes, yes, I just answered this yesterday on some topic. The guy talks about the numerous ways to earn money in Bitcoin. Seeing this topic, I to some extent saw the answer to my question. But still, sit and wait for the win? Can this be called work?In my environment, there is one eccentric who spends all his money on slot machines, hoping one day, at this moment, to become rich.I'll tell him to explain and reassure everyone who calls him a slacker that he's actually running a business.",

Well, sometimes, when I look past the altcoin board, I see some campaigns where payment is made with USDT, although it is a small allocation and very competitive. If anyone looking not to invest can luckily enter such campaigns, they can earn a few bucks too. But those bounty campaigns really require a lot, like Facebook accounts, Twitter accounts, and YouTube channels with significant number of followers and viwes. Very demanding tasks.",

This is also a way but its depend if you win right? But if not it cant generate you some bitcoins or crypto.

Many of the coins and tokens offered as bounty for the social media tasks are worthless or would be by the time they hit the exchanges, many of the users who participate never even get the worthless tokens and never get the opportunity to try and sell them, plus you put your social information on the forum which erodes your privacy and exposes you to scam attacks depending on how much information you give out.It's an net negative activity.

(even if I really like to try my luck on this board too! I even organize myself some games from time to time)But for those you have at least earned 5 merits in the last 120 days, and which are active in the forum, joeperry is proposing some good reward with is [RAFFLE] Utopia - P2P Ecosystem | Free Bitcoin Raffle Weekly 💎 Round 14. Sinbad.io is proposing to earn some sats each month, through their Bitcoin Price Prediction challenges, you just need to have at least 50 messages until the beggining of each game.Otherwise,if some of you want to participate in my forth BTC giveaway, the only condition to be able to participate is to have an account registered before the 1st of May 2023, you are all welcome. But eh, it is totally random and even if you win, it is only some satoshis, not a life changing amount lol, it is not even near the amount of the Raffles managed by joeperry haha, like 4 times less.",

If you treat it as a job, it probably yields a few cents per hour of work or something. Unless you live in the poorest country in the world, it's better to find an actual job and do invest your fiat money in Bitcoin. Not only it's more efficient, you will also get some skills that might help you in the long run instead of making you reliant on giveaways.",
