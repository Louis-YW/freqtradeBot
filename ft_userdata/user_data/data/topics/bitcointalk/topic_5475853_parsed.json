One thing you need to know isÂ  that it is not every educated person that thinks upright and education does not really change the characters of people's behaviour. Being educated does not have anything of making people to be scammer. If you think people who are educated are not supposed scammers you need to change your mindset so that you won't be disappointed.",

      "body": "If there is something I have learnt by following scams and their victims for a short period of time on the internet is that the level of education does not mean someone cannot be a scammer or a victim. Some years ago I thought that only someone with a low level of education could be scammed through a basic ponzi offering unrealistic returns, until I met people who I considered to be educated and still fell for it. In the end, if you send a bad person (who is capable of scamming) to a university they will continue to be a scammer in the making, but now with a diploma or a degree. A piece of paper won't change the character or the intentions of a person. Also, a rule of thumb I use to identify scammers is: they are either anonymous and hiding behind accounts with no real names in social media (while pulling the strings of their scam) or they appear to be as professional and legit as possible while offering unrealistic expectations to potential victims.",

Even most school that emphasizes that they teach there student I becomes won't in both character and I'm learning end up being too hard on these student thereby making them very wicked ones after their complete stay in school.Another angle to view this is that some of those people you see failing victims of scam are individual that are lazy and not willing to carry out their own personal research to ascertain the authenticity in the information the person is giving out. I think the we need to understand that the world is filled with of people that are so after their personal interest so much so that that if someone brings up an opportunity to you just like that, you should sit back and ask yourself some question, do some research before investing your funds in something you aren't sure of",

That's all is so funny People can claim to be anything on social media and you have no means to validate such claims. They could present fake academic qualifications and other documents to prove the claim. This is why you don't believe everything you see on the internet until you verify that they are true. Scammers don't need to get a higher university degree to be good criminals because they already have templates on how to scam people. The only education they need is how to read, write and speak. There are diverse scam software that could help an illiterate act like a university professor. Don't also be deceived by the academic qualifications of anybody, a professor can also be a scammer. For the past 16 years, my country has conducted some of the worst elections in the world. Our elections are filled with the highest form of corruption to the extent that results were already written and signed by bribed election returning officers even before the elections were conducted. It is sad to state that almost all the returning officers are university professors. Education cannot cure greed and lack of contentment.",

I've come to believe that it is often the individuals with extensive education who engage in scamming activities. This might seem counterintuitive at first, considering the societal expectation that education typically leads to respectable professions and ethical behavior. However, if we delve deeper into this matter, the reasons become apparent. Educated people usually possess a wide range of knowledge, strong analytical skills, and advanced problem-solving capabilities. In scamming, these intellectual abilities provide the tools necessary to devise intricate schemes designed to deceive others.These highly educated scammers can create elaborate tactics that manipulate others into falling for their scams. Their strategies may involve psychological manipulation, complex fraud schemes, or sophisticated digital scams. They can present their ploys convincingly, making them difficult to detect and resist.

The educated people people are even more likely to engage in fraudulent activities and scams because they know what people know, Â they know what people want to hear and they also know how to manipulate people into buying their ideas. Being educated does not in any way guarantee righteousness. Many youths this days don't want to stress themselves in getting legit jobs. They prefer to use the knowledge they have acquired in defrauding people and make quick money. I won't tag it laziness because this people invest their time in few cases money into their \"scam Â business \". The moral consciousness in people is declining rapidly and people can Â do anything now for money now.",

But there come the population explosion and market pie is getting smaller and smaller, people today are working toward survival, where not only husband working housewife too are required to work just to survive, why have things changed so dramatically in a span of just a few decades of strong economic growth of 10-20% annually??? Due to that create rich get richer and poor get poorer, very obvious highly educated guy notably middle classes today are resorting to scamming in life just for affording foods, they are usually a 500 dollar of shortfall away from totally broke, see most American can't afford a 500 dollar \"disposable income\", they often would have to beg the public for donation to make end meet!!So long story short why smart people are scamming today but not working hard for money like the good old day? They are living an animalistic wild life in real life, they live to survive, they would do all thing in life, going out and protest, overthrow the regime etc, they could do anything. But what can you do to save yourselves, idk you gotta find the answer on your own.",

It is even very easy for educated people to be scammers because they already know what to tell you that will make you fall for them with fake proves.A scammer must have educated himself and would have gone through some kind of training to make sure that he can be able to convince his victim easily and you shouldn't also forget that we are humans and can easily be deceived with things that we are desperate for or have zeal on and that is what this scammers learn and use it to take advantage on their victims.Â  Being educated doesn't mean that you will not be who you are but instead it will bring out the best of who you are.",

Finding a graduate to be a con artist is disheartening. We may all agree that there are lack of enough jobs in the nation, but educated people will inevitably fall victim to con artists as a result.

For someone who's willing to widen his horizon of thinking and accelerate his capacity to understand a diverse approach to life. This is what education gives you. Ordinarily, aquiring education, after all the above mentioned features, is supposed to put the learner into some shape of critical thinking, capacity to analyze and weigh things in more constructive way and the ability to solve realtime problems. Unfortunately, many have used the same knowledge they have acquired to harm peiple and negstively impart ofn the lives of people because of their ill-thinking.These corrupt minded individuals are mostly affected by societal vices, parental upbringing and the influence of peer groups.The Society have greatly influenced how we think overtime and one can category that as an external factor that either possitively or negatively influence the thinking faculty of people. Some people are naturally endowed with understanding and the ease of learning new things, instead of these positive attributes of the person to positively impact on them, due to the societal vices that the person is exposed to, it inversely and gradually become negative to them and their environment.Because of the bond and love that parents try to show to their kids since from childhood, some parents negatively impart on their thoughts and instead of the love and care to make the child a better person in the society, they become too ambitious and prodigal which then negatively affect their thinking and education. Likewise, parents who do are negligent in the proper upbringing of their wards.Last is the influence of peer groups which is also an external factor mostly gotten through the society. A wrong society breeds wrong association which now gives birth to wrong peer groups. Since education and knowledge is not a natural phenomenon but a decision that is taken by man and a proccess passed through, it doesnât stop one from being affected by bad friends and thatâs why the popular adage says, show me your friends and I will let you know of yourself. It is therefore imperative to associate and build relationship with good firends and progressive minds.",

Also, I would like to add an exception when comes to education and scammers. I agree that most of the times, scammers will end up being scammers, educated or not. But if someone who is a scammer get education in some branches like coding, economics, or administration, then they are very much likely to use those skills to develop scam viruses or Malware. In the other hand, if a scammer is uneducated, the most they can do is to try to scam in a very old fashioned way, like trying to fish someone on Telegram.In the end education and science are neutral things, which can be used either for good deeds or bad ones.",
