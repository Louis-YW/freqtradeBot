  "content": "I look for regular BTC buyers (I have BTC and I need bank transfers to India banks).Mode of contact: telegram; my telegram: @henmark5 .I accept UPI and IMPS/NEFT.Volume per transaction: $25 to $150Rates as per: https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INRPlease PM or contact on above telegram ID.From the experiences gained from Wazirx P2P, I have few guidelines to be followed by you and myself Â for safer P2P tx.1. Transferring Re 1.00 first to ensure about the smooth availability of payment method and correct info of account details.2. Ready to share screenshot in any image format and latest bank statement in PDF (with password if needed).3. Some times, banks may take 2 to 3 days to settle some deposits; hence being ready to wait up to 3 days in case of dispute is suggested. (Mean time my escrow will assure you about safety of your equivalent crypto funds).",
