But it will be impossible for them to realize the CCC because it's under the Power of a more Superior Entity who prefers to keep it decentralized. The only option left for them is to use Bitcoin the way it is, & that will mean using it like everyone else. Those who want government controlled currencies could modernize the existing fiat currencies, create new ones or adopt false \"cryptocurrencies\" like those based on PoS.",

What will always stay the issue is that it will more or less never be in the interest of the government to adopt bitcoin in any way. Remember that bitcoin was specifically designed to take away the power of the governments.What will be still interesting if there are new regulations or deregulations. Everything else will just stay the same I’m very shure.",

Nobody can stop bitcoin from dominating in the nearest future. I guess this news will also help to pump bitcoin price. That conclusion is too fast for the US to recognize bitcoin and adopt bitcoin openly like that, we know that the dollar they use is on the verge of inflation and they are still trying to suppress inflation and keep the dollar as its function in the global eye. If the US government adopts bitcoin and says that their dollar is no longer worth it then their economy will be on the verge of further instability, we all know that the US is strong because of its dollar hegemony if they change course they will no longer benefit from the hegemony they have run for a hundred plus years, that is the thing that made me doubt. I think what they did was their study of bitcoin which was intended to look for gaps in the advantages and disadvantages contained in bitcoin, and to be honest we don't know the results of that congress.Quote from: avikz on April 27, 2023, 04:36:25 PMI really do not have high hopes for such meetings to be honest.

I agree with you, from what we have seen, the SEC as a policy maker regarding the enforcement of cryptocurrency regulations cannot possibly remain silent, they will definitely lobby those who try to oppose what is the SEC's decision. And again, it's a normal thing that everyone can do, getting together and talking without any real action about adoption will only be a waste of time.",

The freedom of one's being the sole manager of the wealth generated and belonging to oneself. The banning of Bitcoin would be a very clear signal of the United States diving into the authoritarian system they critic so much on other nations, in my humble opinion.",

Yes, they are doing their job but they did not do it properly, neither the regulations were in place to have a desirable workflow within those banks, exchangers, or whatever financial institutes that were involved with the crypto directly. These kinds of meet-ups are surely welcoming for the Bitcoin maximalist. They must happen in a country like the US because they are the one who starts any reaction to the world. As we have already known the fact that, \"if America sneezes hen entire world gets the cold\". It's an old saying and it applies in the case of Bitcoin adoption as well. El-Salvador has done a good job keeping its Bitcoin infrastructure at the highest peak. They are definitely making a remarkable journey with Bitcoin already. It may happen that peeps are taking little time to understand or adopt it in the main circulation but it will happen slowly. If US congress meet-ups regarding Bitcoin are about \"how to control it for their own goods\" then we can safely say we are done. Most countries are already levying high-value taxes on Bitcoin transactions. Let us just hope that it's not about that!",

You are right sir, but so far the strength of the SEC is getting weaker, it have shown that many SEC agents lacks the knowledge about what they are up against, it has been proven that they are fighting crypto and lack the understanding about it, meaning they have wrongfully accused many projects of something they are not. It's the same reason that Coinbase dev want to leave the US is they don't set things straight within the organization, all I see now is straight calm down. They need to go and do some research and plan something meaningful that will help crypto on the long run.",
