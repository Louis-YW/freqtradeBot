BZminer is the only miner for real triple mining with 3 different pools, but the overall hashrates are to slow. But i use it for mining with iGPU´s (only for fun)  Hopefully the BZminer dev can improve his kernels or he get some kernels from wolf again  In my opinion triple mining over a Zil proxy and lolminer or teamredminer is the best choice",

      "body": "Triple mining seems like going too far, like too many blades on a razor.The original theory for dual mining was to choose a second algo that was complimemtary to the first in that they would demand different resourcesand increase total throughput. The typical example is an memory bound algo paired with a compute bound algo. Working together would increasethe GPU utilisation and theoretically increase revenue.Dual mining became a necessity with LHR. The secondary algo was used as a decoy to disable LHR increasing the hash rate of the primary algo aswell as producing its own revenue as a bonus.For dual mining to work in the original case both algos have to be worthy of mining on their own. It's less important for LHR because the maingoal was to unlock the primary algo.But I just don't see a case for 3 algos. All 3 would have to be somewhat profitable and not compete with each other for resources.",

Of course GPUs are more flexible specifically because they run software programs. An ASIC can only run one program.Also dual mining, when done right, should consume more power and produce more heat because it uses more of the GPU's resources.",
