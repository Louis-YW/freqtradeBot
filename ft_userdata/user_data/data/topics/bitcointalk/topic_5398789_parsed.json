  "content": "Hey everyone. I've been thinking for a long time of buying BitCoin as along term investment to diversify a bit. Been reading a lot the last couple of days and I'm kind of surprised at the fees. I'm used to Ameritrade type fees where it's a flat rate for a transaction.Do I have this correct? If I put in $10,000 through Coinbase or Paypal or similar platforms I am charged 1.5-2% immediately. That's $200, which is pretty steep. Is everyone surrendering 1.5%-2% with every trade? If so, I should invest in Coinbase instead of BitCoin. Maybe I'm missing something.For longer term holding is RobinHood the way to go or do their raised prices and spreads make it a worse alternative?Any input would be appreciated to help a Newbie understand the fee structure. Thanks in advance!",

I'll check those two options out.I was joking a bit when I said that Coinbase might be a good investment, but I am surprised that the transaction fees are so high on most of these platforms. I 100% want to buy BitCoin, just trying to understand the entry fees.I'll check out Coinbase Pro and also look at Crypto.com.",

Maybe, try the P2P in binance since you are dealing with fiat to buy crypto. Don't know how much your service provider will charge if you deposit fiat. But once you got a hold of your BTC, better transfer it to your own wallet and don't let it stay long in any trading platform.",

The goal is to find a platform which has a less fess but some on your list has known to have a high fees like bitcoin atm and exchanges. When you say exchanges I believe it means centralized exchanges because you also have dex or decentralized exchange in your list and we all know that most centralized exchange charge a high fee.Some in your list are also risky like chat bots, I supposed this can be found on telegram? Since, telegram is more crypto oriented right now but this platform is becoming a den of scammers lately. P2p is also risky but we are more sure in personal meeting because that is face to face. The low the fee the riskier it was. Are we really sure that we can sacrifice our security only to save fees?",

Lots of other exchanges do this, Bitpanda is one I can name rightaway. No commissions, no fees for swapping or withdrawals, but their spread's awful. You find the same with remittances. If they don't have a fee, their rate is poor. Simple as that.Try buying your Bitcoin p2p instead.",

In anyway one tries to get his money out from binance he will be paying. A better option could be p2p if you are ready to compromise your identity. When you convert from Btc to Usdt, you are first charged a conversion fee. Then if you withdraw with Usdt, you are also charged. Though not as high as bitcoin withdraw fee. What they are technically doing is pushing traders to BTC/BUSD pair to strengthen even their stable coin.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on May 15, 2022, 10:57:19 PMAlso keep in mind the risks of scams - they are low with more reputable exchanges and high with less obscure ones or some forms of p2p trading.

      "body": "Everything else mentioned above aside, since you mention your investment is long term here is my take.  If you have a holding of $10,000 worth of Bitcoin, you will not even notice this $200 fee.  It happens all the time that no matter what sum I choose to invest, it declines or increases in value by at LEAST 5 to 20 percent per day, sometimes even per hour.In consequence, I learned to simply not care as much about fees anymore.  In fact, whenever I tried my best to look for a cheaper alternative, something worse happened.  Account locked until KYC is completed.  Money frozen for 'suspicious' activity.  Trying to avoid an x% fee but before I get to the best option the market moves like crazy by more than the % I tried to avoid.  You should care about not spending on excessive fees but sometimes it is what it is and with Cryptocurrencies you sometimes can just not avoid it.  Wait until you decide to invest in random Altcoins and find out that during intense times of transaction volume Ethereum will ask hundreds for a basic transaction of a Token.Of course.  Not your keys, not your coins.  Try using less centralized, or even better, decentralized exchanges or Peer to Peer to purchase Bitcoin.  Never store your coins in custodial wallets.  These rules always apply for me and should always apply to everyone, maybe except active traders.-Regards,PrivacyG",
