  "content": "i sometimes wonder that we pay money for a just ledger entry, it seems so simple in this way, but seems very risky that just a ledger entry for michael saylor's billions of dollars.i think in this way because i don't have technical knowledge. but it has so many advantages also, like saving taxes, security, anonymity, profit, etc.",
