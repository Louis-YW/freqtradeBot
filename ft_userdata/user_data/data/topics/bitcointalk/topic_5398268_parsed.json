Yes. Then the number of confirmations start to grow.

I thought it was entirely different from what I asked earlier since the previous question was about after successfully mining a block while this does not has to do with that but only sending bitcoin to a new address.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on May 12, 2022, 08:41:18 AMQuote from: Asiska02 on May 12, 2022, 08:17:53 AMThis is mobile bitcoin wallet, transferring bitcoin to a new wallet.What is it called?

I only came across it when I was reading and was curious to know where the transaction fee goes to and it was written there as optional. What if one doesn’t include any transaction fee since it is optional, but thanks to @Hyphen(-), I know why it is written as optional now.Quote from: nc50lc on May 12, 2022, 10:20:37 AMCan you help with this as well or anyone:During transactions, the transaction fees is included to determine how fast your transaction will be added to the blockchain or processed very fast. The process of mining a block which already has a block header has to go through the SHA-256 hash function, the result has to be below the current target in order to successfully add it onto the blockchain. After have added a transaction fee to my transaction to make it faster and my transaction wasn’t added to the blockchain because the result was lower than the current target, won’t that be sad. Or am I missing out on something on how it works.Please I need clarity on how this works...Thanks.",

While it is still possible to make a transaction with no fee, you either have to mine it yourself or privately convince a miner to mine it for you. In reality, every transaction you make will include a fee, and if you don't include a fee then the network will not relay your transaction to other nodes.Quote from: Asiska02 on May 12, 2022, 01:07:03 PMCan you help with this as well or anyone:You are confusing two different concepts. The fee you pay for a transaction and the target for a miner to find when attempting to mine a block are too entirely separate things and are not directly related in any way. If your transaction is not selected to be included in the next block because its fee rate is too low, then it simply remains in the mempool for another miner to pick up in a subsequent block. Which block this happens to be depends on the fee rate of all the other transactions in the mempool.",

It means the miners goes for the transaction with higher fee to mine first before going for the ones with lower fee if am not wrong.Actually, miners will prioritize transactions which have higher fee rate (expressed in sat/vb) not higher fee. For example, if there are two transactions A and B:    transaction A pays 400 sats and its size is 200 vb (2 sat/vb)   transaction b pays 1000 sats and its size is 1000 vb (1 sat/vb)Miners will prioritize transaction A and include it first in their blocks because it pays higher fee rate.This might not always be the case depending on other factors, but miners will always prioritize transactions which will generate more profit.QuotePlease I still need clarity on the target for a miner to find when attempting to mine a block into the blockchain.

Each block has a limited amount of space, so it makes sense for miners to prioritize the transactions paying the highest fee rate so they can maximize their own profits. Quote from: Asiska02 on May 12, 2022, 01:53:32 PMPlease I still need clarity on the target for a miner to find when attempting to mine a block into the blockchain. Where does this comes into play, where is it used?First miners construct a candidate block, by picking all the transactions they want to try to include in their block, and then including some other data such as the previous block hash, the timestamp, and some other bits and pieces. They then perform a double SHA256 hash on the header of their block. If the output of that double hash isn't below the target, then they change something about their block (usually a field called the nonce or the extraNonce) and try again. They repeat this over and over (billions and billions of times each second) until they stumble across a result which is below the target. Once they find a configuration in which the output of the double hash is below the target, then their block is added to the blockchain.",
