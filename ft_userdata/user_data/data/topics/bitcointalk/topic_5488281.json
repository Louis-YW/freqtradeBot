And they also spent their resources for Bitcoin Spot ETF application against SEC. Finally they succeeded and they are buying a lot of bitcoin last 40 days. Already surpassed MicroStrategy as a biggest public company holds Bitcoin.https://bitcointreasuries.net/",

No one can control Bitcoin. They can directly or indirectly own bitcoins and choose to do with that as they please. But your bitcoins stored in your wallet cannot be influenced by any external factor, except you give access to them by handng over ownership.Blackrock, other ETFs, companies and businesses are factors that will always show interest in an asset like Bitcoin, and that interestbwll only continue to grow. As long as you keep your coins in your custody, you'll be all good.Quote from: Bellarg on March 10, 2024, 08:36:09 AMThey already can manipulate BTC price in any way.This is not true.",

The majority of the people do not see the danger or their judgement are clouded by greed, because they are \"invested\" in Bitcoin for the profits and not to promote Bitcoin as an alternative \"currency\" for the people. In any way, if one person or group control the majority of the coins, people will start to move over to other Alt coins with more available coins and companies like BlackRock will have to start buying the more popular coins for their investors.",

But also know that it can somehow lead to the concentration of power and cause Bitcoin to stray from its original purpose. The fact that many people participate in events such as bullish celebrations shows confidence and expectations in the potential of Bitcoin, the positivity shows the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin bringing capital inflows large flows into the market, driving BTC prices higher. But investing in any asset will have potential risks, dyor and evaluation before making a decision to invest in Bitcoin.",

Doesn't matter how much bitcoin Blackrock owns. Bitcoin isn't proof of stake, owning more bitcoin gives blackrock no control over Bitcoin.Also please realize that Blackrock only owns bitcoin on behalf of their clients. So while technically they own the bitcoin, they don't really own it because its all with clients money. This is not Blackrock's money. And as my first sentence says, it wouldn't matter anyway because it gives them no control over the bitcoin network.Lots of people have stated this same worry since last Summer, but it comes from simply not understanding how Bitcoin works, and apparently not understanding what ETFs are.",

I agree that everyone will not sell at once, but the market is capable of provoking people into panic sales, this has happened many times and I see no reason why it cannot happen again. Blackrock is always looking for opportunities to make money, and if they saw an opportunity in Bitcoin, that's a good sign.",

If you believe that bitcoin is not manipulated, can you explain to us why bitcoin price can fluctuate so much? Because if the value of an asset depends entirely on supply and demand, how can it fluctuate from 5-10% every day, even every hour? So far, no one can manipulate or control the bitcoin network but as for bitcoin price, I believe it is always manipulated.",

They have also infiltrated the culture a bit. Hodl to get rich is fiat mentality. To me, Bitcoin is still a tool for freedom & life raft for economic collapse, however the privacy by default is severely lacking (and we know most people are too lazy to acquire it). This may have been another thing that was infilitrated because Satoshi was clearly an anarchist cypher punk.  There's no freedom without privacy and that's why I'm personally supplementing Bitcoin with Monero.",

Interestingly, the iShares Bitcoin Trust by BlackRock holds a similar amount, which is almost close to 1% of the total supply. Going from 1% to controlling Bitcoin is a very big jump. They can accumulate more, and maybe this 1% will become 2-3%, which is still negligible in comparison with the circulating supply. So I don't think they're trying to control Bitcoin, and I don't think they'll ever accumulate enough to actually be considered as 'controlling BTC'.",
