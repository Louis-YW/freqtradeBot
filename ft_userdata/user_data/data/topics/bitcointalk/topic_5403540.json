Sync Bitcoin Core and unplug your internet. Then import the private key, without risking any online exposure. Create, verify and sign a transaction offline, copy it, and broadcast it online.Alternative: Import the pubkey, let Bitcoin Core sync until 2010 (that shouldn't take long), and if anything shows up, you can take it offline to import the privkey. Or let it sync completely to be sure the funds are still there.",

Rookie mistake on my end. Cheers.Bitcoin keys have only ever been 64 bytes (or 512 bit), plus the few variations on that for the different types of address types.-A few other things:Within parts of the bitcoin source code, you will find that 'setFloat' causes a double to be defined, rather than a float. In most programming languages, floats are 32 bits and doubles are 64 bits. Bitcoin plays it loose with the typical definition here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/univalue/include/univalue.h#L58The calculations for an address from a 64 byte key relies on mathematics where 32 and 64 bit would not be sufficient. I actually once programmed a search for any exceptions to the general Fermat conjecture (Fermat's last theorem with fewer constraints, also known as the Beal conjecture) using 32 bit as the first stage, then moving to 100+ bit after I thought there might be exceptions. After looking at the solutions with higher bit resolution, my exceptions turned out to not exist.",

If you are going to make a raw transaction through coinb.in you need any of these Address, WIF key, Redeem Script or Transaction ID. But I think your case about your private key will not work on Coinb.in unless if it's a WIF key.Can you post a sample of your private key(Not the original one) I receive a PM from you and you said you have the private key why not import it into electrum?You can use this link below as your reference for private key prefixes and copy the example from that link and paste it here.- https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_address_prefixes",

For your input you'd reference the receiving transaction ID and the output index (n).It is possible?That is possible but I don't know if coinb.in can check P2PK outputs, and to make it, you must know which UTXO to spend.One option is to create a watching-only wallet in bitcoin Core by importing those public key(s) into a non-descriptor wallet using the command importpubkeyAnd with that, you don't need coinb.in to create the raw transaction, you can use Bitcoin Core itself and sign it using your private key using signrawtransactionwithkey (if it's WIF).But before you get into finer details, what data do you actually have? Public Key(s)? Addresses?Please describe it without giving the actual data (e.g.: how many characters, give an example or edit all characters of the actual data but leave the first character correct).Because OP doesn't make sense and your reply didn't add anything, you just replied to the one that shows a possibility to spend it.You'll have to have the \"private key(s)\" for you to spend those coins and it should be the pair of your \"public key(s)\",without it, you're just wasting your time.Since that reply isn't in this topic, you must be the author of this reddit thread: /r/Bitcoin/comments/vhq21r/problems_with_bitcoins_mined_in_2009Please quote the message that isn't yours if you want to include it to your post, like I did above.",

If the funds or your balance become 0 after syncing there is a big possibility someone already has access to your wallet(Or you might be infected) and sent it to another address. In that case, you can't able to recover them because Bitcoin transaction is irreversible. If you talking about \"it syncing after a few blocks are downloaded the transaction history gone?\"It could be a bug if the wallet was started in 2009 and 2010 and has never been touched until you open the wallet and after syncing the wallet transaction under history is gone it could be a bug.What I would like you to do is to get the used address(es) under your wallet(If you can able to check the addresses tab) and check them one by one in the block explorer. If all addresses from your wallet do not have funds and one of your addresses has one transaction under history then it was already sent to someone and possible someone has access to your wallet or your PC is infected and you can't able to recover them.",
