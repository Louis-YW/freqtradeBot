Here's what I meanCode:Run without installing: tar -xvf Electrum-4.4.2.tar.gzpython3 Electrum-4.4.2/run_electrumSo you don't need to extract them just install the Python dependencies so that the command above will work.

But it's not like I'm going to run --help on the binary to see a list of options, because I know they're all bundled in the same way.If you ask me, the Linux desktop environments do allow you to click and run an AppImage, but they should also allow you to customize options like these in their Properties panels. Currently I don't know of any DE that implements this.",
