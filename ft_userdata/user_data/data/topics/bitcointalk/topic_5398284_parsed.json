  "content": "The current state of the crypto market may result in more unexpected suicides among crypto coin holders and investors.I'd like to use this medium to provide some motivation to my fellow cryptocurrency beginners. This is an unforeseen scenario that will be difficult to overcome, but let us remember how precious our lives are. If we lose our money but remain alive, let us have more hope because if there is life, there is hope; suicide is not an option; patience and commitment are the best options right now.I'm not sure how many people have committed themselves as a result of the current crypto market situation in different parts of the world, but suicide is never a good.Our lives matter to our society, families, and friends, so let's stay strong and bear with this predicament; I'm sure it will pass sooner or later.",

This rule is not for the world of crypto only, it's applicable in all spheres of life.This life is full of risk, the life itself is a risk. Being able to move from house to work, you have taken the risk of dying by road accident. Sleeping in your bed, you are taking a risk because the building could collapse. So, the risk we take should be calculated, the one with less severity.Let us therefore remove greed in this space and always understand what Isaac Newton said \"What ever goes up, will surely come down\"My regards to all affected by the red market, it will green soonest. The red is always a buy opportunity, and this might be the greatest we can witness.",

You shouldn't commit suicide because you lose money, if you are alive then you can still make more than the amount you lose, I don't think thier is anything worth killing yourself for.",

This is not the first time the market is falling and it still bounce back bigger most times. Many people need orientation on to what to expect when investing in cryptocurrency and should be ready to face the consequences rather than just persuading them to join while they’re expecting big profits at the end of the day which is maybe likely not to be so.It’s so sad people lost their lives because of this, I believe things will turn normal soon but one should “Only invest what they can lose”.",

Unfortunately, people commit suicide every day for a variety of reasons, and money is not always the main reason they do it. People need to be taught to stay away from projects like this, and those behind them need to be punished for doing something that was obviously unsustainable and may have cost some people their lives in the end.Let's not forget that there are people who want the best for themselves and the small circle of people around them and that they have a lot of money coming from projects like this - this Kwan or whatever his name is should be held accountable for his stupidity, and I hope South Korean authorities do something about it.",

Whether you can afford to lose the investment or not, the loss will still hurt you nonetheless. The degree of hurt may vary, some may feel so bad to the point of committing suicide. I wouldn’t be so eager to remind them of the “golden rule”",

Just keep pushing, you are strong, you are more powerful than you think.By the way, here's the link to the tweet : https://twitter.com/BlockchainBuk/status/1524406350209552387?t=VdN3c32-SKVL1AFy_Ylb4g&s=19",

That information is false, there haven't been confirmed cases of suicide due to the luna crash but that doesn't calm my mind because this fall was such a sudden shock and traumatic experience, I am afraid that more than hundreds of people will commit suicide.Sometimes I was visiting reddit to hear opinions about altcoins, new projects, etc and I understood that most people make extreme investment decisions, they take loans backed by property, truck, car, gold, etc. Some people have huge savings and invest all of them. That's why I assume that the real picture will be hell in the following days and months. Some people still have hope that it will return back.My message to all of you is:What does not kill you, makes you stronger! Every accident in your life is an experience, the more you learn, the wiser you are! Wise people always succeed in life, they change the world!REMEMBER!!! Billionaire Alibaba founder Jack Ma was rejected from every job he applied to after college, even KFC. YOU AREN'T REJECTED, YOU JUST LOSE SOME MONEY AND WHILE YOU ARE A HEALTHY YOUNG, YOU HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO SUCCEED!!!",

Always allow people to do their own research, and when they do, they should make up their mind, so that they bear the consequences of whatever action they take.

The media know which will be hot news.And I also realize with this news, we can remain each other about what you said, about how precious our life even though we lost many things, there are still our families that should be struggling.

That is why I always say that you should first know well what you are investing your money in, and be prepared for the fact that you can lose everything at any time. The tragedy in this latest scandal is that people lost money on something called stablecoin, and that should never have happened. I hope that people will start learning from the mistakes of others that have happened in the past, and that they will understand that cryptocurrencies are very slippery ground - doesn't anyone remember how Bitcoin lost 50% of its value in one day just over 2 years ago when was the pandemic declared?",
