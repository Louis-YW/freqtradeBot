  "content": "Don't Just Invest But Check Your Local Currency with the US dollar exchange rate first before investing.In the year 2023 when the new president came to the corridor of power, he changed many economic policies and it affect the dollar exchange rate in the country which made the dollar to rise and making the National Currency to devalued. And that made the early investors of bitcoin to made good profit coupled with the rise of Bitcoin from 2023 to 2024. The exchange rate of US dollar to NGN Naira as of 2013 to 2014 was $1 to N150 so those who invested or had bitcoin as of then made good profit as the price increase. In 2015 to 2022 the exchange rate of the US dollar with the local currency NGN Naira was $1 to N400 and N500 so those who had Bitcoin in the year 2013 to 2014 made good profit in the year 2015 to 2022. And in 2023 to 2024 US dollar to NGN Naira was $1 to N1,700 and those who invested in 2015 to 2022 made a maximum profit because the exchange rate was very high with US/NGN in 2023 to 2024. And those bitcoin investors were living good lives and helping people financially and materially to orphans and other needs. With that many people decided to invest in bitcoin at the time when the US/ NGN was high as $1- NGN1,700+ and many people invested in bitcoin and they were only looking at the bitcoin price to invest and not dollar to local currency. And those who invested at the time of $1 to NGN1,700+ is at the losing side because currently the exchange rate with the US dollar to the NGN Naira is $1 to N1,550 and it is coming down weekly so those who invested in 2024 will be at the losing side unless the dollar rise again. That is the risk.And why I create this thread is that don't only look at the price to invest in bitcoin but also the local exchange with the US dollar. These are some of the calculative risk involved in the bitcoin investment. It is good to know all these before venturing into the investment of bitcoin.DOLLAR VS NAIRA 1 USD = 150+ NGN in 20131 USD = 170+ NGN in 20141 USD = 199+ NGN in 20151 USD = 300+ NGN in 20161 USD = 359+ NGN in 20171 USD = 364+ NGN in 20181 USD = 363+ NGN in 20191 USD = 387+ NGN in 20201 USD = 411+ NGN in 20211 USD = 448+ NGN in 20221 USD = 773+ NGN in 20231 USD = 1,700+ NGN in 2024Image source: Here",

Even if we hold our asset on fiat currencies all have the inflation except the bitcoin.I will not say that there is no risk in Bitcoin investment, but I always say that investing a very small amount that will not have any impact on you if lost, But that should be regular and for the long term may 4,8,12years by making regular DCA. Of course, it would give you  back more when you will hold that for long term. And if it happens that you invest most of your income in Bitcoin for profit and do not keep anything for emergency situations later, then in your case the loss risk level will be high.But I just want to give an example. If we had been holding Bitcoin at the rate of 1 dollar per week since May 2013, the picture below shows what our current situation would be like:(I'm not talking about the future.)",

It sure seems to me that's what you postulate? Be rational in very thing it's both ways if you're advantageous to buy at the cheap rate per dollar and at higher cost in bitcoin then you're probably at loss too so you should buy bitcoin regardless of the circumstances as long as you have the capital this considerations will only result one to postpone their investments.",

That is the risk.I don’t think it they will be in loss except if you just did the calculations base on the fiat currencies but having them related to the asset they bought, in this case bitcoin they would be in profit considering how the market has grown since then. $1 getting to N1,700 was around the period where bitcoin it self wasn’t upto the six figure we have at the moment which actually makes for the dollar drop. As for this economically you aren’t actually losing when you’re correlating the local fiat currency to the international market currency because at the end of the day the products are mostly paired with the international currency which means the price of the product relatively on pair and moves base on how the international currency moves",

In the past 6 months the difference is much. That should be around 300 naria difference from 1800 to 1500 for the cost of USDT in Naira. Still using the same time frame an investor who started investing when it was N1800 and the one who started at N1500 all of them are profitable. It is not the rate that is the problem but the amount you were able to buy at that rate. If you buy 400$ Bitcoin at 1500 Naira you will not lose all your asset but imagine a case where the person bought 5$ of Bitcoin at N1800 of course if Bitcoin dips the value will be 0. But that is why i like Bitcoin investment, what goes down must surely come up. If your asset gets to zero it will come up back once the price of Bitcoin increases because you still have the fraction of Bitcoin in your wallet. I dont see rate to be a problem if we want to invest, i dont consider it a risk. Due to my investment strategy i rarely get to think about rate or the current pirce of Bitcoin. As long as i can spare my discretionary income, i accumulate no matter the rate.",

You don’t lose in that regard but gains the opposite even and that’ll be profit. It’s always better you have your money in a fairly stable or stronger currency as a way to hedge against inflation.

I guess that's true if you limit your profit calculation based on the USD value when you bought your Bitcoin. If not, It's hard to judge whether you made a profit or not if your local currency purchasing power decreases relative to USD or other fiat. I second the opinion above that if you want to move your wealth to Bitcoin it doesn't matter how much your local currency is worth, it's not like you can convert to USD to get more sats unless your country's economic power increases rapidly. I do enjoy some discounts when I buy stuff with Yen instead of USD because the exchange rate is better, but it's hard to do that in crypto because the market usually stays around the same price point.
