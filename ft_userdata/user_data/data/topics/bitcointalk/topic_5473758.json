What I'm saying is that, bitcoins are not meant to be staked for gambling, rather they're mainly utilized for trading and long-term investments. The bear market comprises of too many scammed and abandoned projects, I prepared using a stable coin to gamble because that's entirely how to earned in a stable proceeds. Stable coins like USDT or Trons, comparing them to Bitcoin is out of the picture.",

I was actually mad over it because what I predicted really came to pass and I was mad over everything why I couldn't make my deposit earlier than before I have the game, and someone like me don't like leaving money inside betting site maybe I could be tempted to bet unplanned games were I might waste that funds so what I mostly does is that whenever I am not sure of the game I won't deposit till I am well convinced about the out of the game though we knows that gambling are not 100 % correct but needs to be convinced about the outcome before placing bet.",

Although everyone has there own choice and the best coin they preferred to use when gambling online especially for the crypto casinos. Most time we tend to deposit our funds in Bitcoin but it could be converted to fiat just like few casino I have seen. They would convert your coin into fiat so that it will enable you to gamble in your local currency but withdrawal is still in cryptocurrency which the value is going to be converted to the same worth of any available coin you want to use to withdraw.",

Given that gambling is a popular and practical use of bitcoin, I'm interested to see what percentage of people still have it as their preferred funding method and perhaps for what reasons. I have only used the bitcoin payment method to fund my casino account a few times, and if I can think well, I can recall all the occasions that I did that. I have been making use of fait deposit, and most times I make use of altcoins like LTE and USDT on the tron network. This is due to the fast deposit this option allows me to make, and the confirmation doesn't take much of a time for it to arrive in my betting account, unlike a bitcoin deposit, which takes up to 2–3 confirmations depending on the casino being used. With the high rate on the bitcoin transaction fee, I will not even consider using it to fund my betting account unless I'm not ready to place a bet that very day, because for the transaction to proceed, I will either need to pay more of the fee or wait until the transaction gets confirmed, which means if one wants to bet on a particular sport game, the game might end up starting and at the same time ending before the deposit will arrive.",

And with those swings in fees, it makes you wonder if people are sticking with Bitcoin or maybe going back to credit cards more often.  Im curious to see which way the wind is blowing these days and  are the credit card companies stealing back some of the gambling transactions as folks get fed up with the unpredictable Bitcoin fees? Or are crypto die-hards sticking it out anyway since they love Bitcoin so much?",

It's for research purposes only. the majority of my gambling capital is USDT based on tron, that's because tron fees are quite cheap compared to btc fee, I've also been used to using it for a long time, apart from tron I also gamble quite often with Bitcoin Cash and dogecoin, I rarely use btc in my gambling because I invest with bitcoin and not using it until my target price is reached, in fact I often buy bitcoin when I win gambling. btw, I once wanted to try gambling using the Lightning Network, but I saw that not many crypto gambling sites accept it.",

      "body": "I use Litecoin to play, this is because it has very low fees and the withdrawal amount on stake.com has a low withdrawal amount. So it's really worth it to deposit $10, play and when or if I win something, I immediately withdraw it and as the withdrawal amount is very low and the fees are also very low, so it's worth it. in stake the minimum withdrawal for litecoin is 3$ while in the case of bitcoin the minimum withdrawal amount is 7$ and it will be subtracted 2.50$ this is if I exceed for my case that I bet with low amounts of money, but still these values are very low in stakein other casinos the minimum withdrawal amount is very high and has higher fees, which is why in my opinion playing at stake has many advantages, see that in the case of USDT the minimum withdrawal amount is 2.50 and has a fee of 1 USDT, in my opinion, pays off a lot. now when people deposit in cryptocurrencies in casinos while the market is rising, then it is necessary to be careful because when the market drops a lot then the bank's money will also reduce a lot, if the person plays with cryptocurrencies, the best option is to be playing when the market is falling and take advantage while the market is rising",

Although when you win and you receive bitcoin as winning, it gives you good value but to risk it away in gambling gives a second thought.Another factor to consider is the fee for transaction.

And you won't mind the quantity on how much it is especially if you're looking at the price and value of it based on USD. That's why it's easier for me if I'll use Bitcoin. But I am not closing doors in the use of other altcoins that doesn't have much value IMO.I'm done doing fiat gambling but my friends are encouraging me because they're not in crypto casinos and they are not interested on diving here. But the same feeling for me to them that I am no longer interested with it because it's harder to withdraw when you get tracked by the bank or the apps that you mostly use for withdrawals, I might even get a red flag from them because it's known that they don't like source from gambling or casinos.",

But in the other case, where the casino doesn’t change the Bitcoin into a currency sold and showing it like bitcoin or satoshies, I can’t calculate every time and sometimes you bet more or less than what you wanted.In conclusion, gambling has nothing to do with the type of crypto you deposit.

You're correct on this, I shifted to coins that will confirmed in seconds or minutes and with the lowest fees possible, Bitcoin transactions for the last two weeks have been quite annoying I have one transaction that took two days to confirm and I have to accelerate it with additional fees, but I always shift to using Bitcoin when things normalize in the blockchain, majority of gamblers preferred to use Bitcoin traditionally.But there should be a backup in case there's congestion on the network or you have to defer or delay playing and wait for things to get better, I never use credit cards in all my betting ventures for privacy, those who do I think have trusted the platform they are playing.",
