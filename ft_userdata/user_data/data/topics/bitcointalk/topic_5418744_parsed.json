  "content": "Of all the games in a casino, the only one I actually enjoy is Poker. \"Poque\" is one of the most popular games in the gambling industry. It has been around as we know it for around 100 years. It is said to have been brought from Eastern Europe onto the Americas by New World immigrants and since then has suffered several mutations; nowadays it has evolved into dozens of other gambling options and it is probably the most played online casino game in the world. Its history is quite interesting!Check below to read more about the History of Poker\"Where and when was poker invented? Poker's earliest ancestors came from Europe, the Middle East, and China. The game as we know it today finally took shape in the early 1800s in America. One of the earliest forms of poker called ‘poque' was played in gambling dens in New Orleans. The game spread from New Orleans, gained popularity among soldiers during the American Civil War, and eventually migrated to the western frontier. The rest, as they say, is history.\"",

I know it that because it is a gambling game that it spread will not be by missionaries since it is not evangelical in nature   The Americans spread this game through their military conquest. The soldiers carry this game across from what I read. This is interesting to know and I believe that more gambling games will be spread by soldiers just like the poker game.",

So, it's kind of new if we compare it with the old and original Poker Game. I would like to share some more information about the Hold 'em because the starting was really epic.QuoteIn 1967, a group of Texan gamblers and card players, including Crandell Addington, Doyle Brunson, and Amarillo Slim were playing in Las Vegas. This is when \"ace high\" was changed from the original form in which aces were low.
