Â This article was written few days ago, so it's not outdated before Atomic hack happened.",

      "body": "What are the criteria on which you based the classification? I can understand that referral links are the reason for the classification of hardware wallets, but many of the other options are very poor, or at least they were chosen randomly without explanation of the advantages or disadvantages or personal use experience. Bitpay, trust wallet and others, without even mentioning the good open source wallets. Ivankovac[1] is the one who wrote this article. I suggest that you contact him to create an account here, or try to find more than one writer, as some on the forum may help you improve the quality of posts for a small fee.[1] https://www.cada.news/author/ivankovac/",

Not sure why they're mixing the terms [e.g. this], but here's a perfect example of a real transaction accelerator: ViaBTC [refer to its \"How to use\" section]",

Primary focus should be open source wallets and the general security overview of the walletsHow wallets like Electrum, Sparrow wallet and unstoppable wallet are missing, and we have wallet with past issues like Exodus, Atomic wallet, trustwallet in the article is beyond my understanding. Amateur move.You are the people that keep feeding newbies with garbage.",
