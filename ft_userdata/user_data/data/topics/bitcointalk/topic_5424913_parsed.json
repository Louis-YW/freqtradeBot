And, over the previous weeks, many U.K. banks have resolved not to let their citizens use it in what they consider a high risk market.Starling bank, Santander bank and most recently, U.K. high Street banks have implemented some sort of restrictions on crypto related transactions.

I guess you mean the opposite: that it's your money and not theirs. Although theoretically it would be like that, it is not, because the money when you deposit it becomes just another accounting entry, which allows them to give credits for x times the amount. There are people who believe that when they deposit their money in the bank, it is as if it were kept in a box in their name, and it is not so.Quote from: _act_ on December 01, 2022, 06:29:08 AMThe problem people have is that they do not have to use any central platform like using bank directly to buy bitcoin or using centralized exchanges, there are decentralized exchanges that you can use to avoid restrictions, but most people prefer those centralized platforms but complaining about their money not being their money because of central control which makes their money not to be completely theirs, the freedom you need with money can not be provided by fiat.You mean they don't detect it because it is P2P?

So pull your money out of your bank and search for one that doesn't do this.The whole narrative that the money is yours so the bank must accept everything you want to do with your money is simply too true, they have rules, if you don't like them don't use that bank, nobody is forcing you to keep your money there nobody is forcing you to use their service. The simple comparison would be with exchanges that don't allow you to buy some shitcoins, it's your BTC in that exchange that they don't allow you to buy craptoken69, why don't they allow you to withdraw funds to a different bank and name, it's your money, right?Just ditch that bank and find another one, or stop using them altogether, wasn't that the whole thing about bitcoin?

      "body": "Hi guys,  Thanks for coming back to me.I have even tried to top up Coinbase account but they still blocked me.It looks like Coinbase in UK has changed. Before I sent money to the account on their name but now I send money to Coinbase under my name so they provide you a sub account (it looks like a SWIFT account)I think these new measures are because the economy is bad, people lost their jobs and \"the street\" is incentivized to gamble on the crypto markets to be able to pay rent and bills.I am not sure if the number of crypto scams have increased probably yes because since a lot of businesses went down you can assume there is more people self-employ themselves as scammers.In any case in my opinion from Internet-banking point of view the level of \"protection\" is an overkill but I reckon these security facilities are not immune to scammers who are in direct contact (over the phone) with the victim and instruct them to follow steps.So in this case it make sense - you can think some elders and/or pretty stupid people would fall for this.From the bank I know that they treat these transfers as cash transfers so no protection (I don't think this has changed in any way).Apparently the system is learning how much money usually enters and leaves the account so if there is \"an anomaly\" then they block it.I don't know what is the limit that helps to trigger these blocks. Perhaps I should send it in smaller amounts.A foreign bank account seems like a viable alternative to all the hassle but I would not be surprised that many EU banks are rolling in similar restrictions as we speak.The problem is they said all high street banks have the same facilities in place (believe me it didn't happened on its own but was rolled out in accord).If I don't use a high street bank but some small bank if any bigger problem I would have to drive like miles to get to their nearest branch. One bank didn't want to unlock my account over the phone and asked me to go to their branch and from there they called the fraud line.In any case it's from 30-1h process even over the phone it's like a proper 30min interview.Now they block the money leaving the account then they can put some restrictions on how much you can pay in to the account or at some point they block these exchanges from sending money altogether so P2P is going to be the only option.Quote from: jrrsparkles on December 01, 2022, 12:59:33 PMIs there any ban on place about crypto trading in UK banking system?

They have a list of all of them and you can tell they block it because of crypto not because of some other security concerns.I would call it a semi-ban in UK.If I knew the limits I would send below the limit. I reckon if they say \"the system is learning\" these limits change over time.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

Some countries in the past had similar issues from banks blocking the accounts only because of the funds used for buying and selling cryptocurrencies but later the court revoked their terms and made cryptocurrencies tradeable but implemented high tax rates.That is why I think this whole \"protection\" is bullshit. Of course these AntiFraud people working at the banks are legit and they want to do their job well but it reality it's more to do with what the so called elite wants.And such measures were not there last year and the economy was already bad so it looks to me more like an agenda being rolled out.The cryptos are low now and I reckon the establishment wants to create market for themselves, eventually buy cyptos in large volumes for cheap while discouraging regular people from cryptos and eventually forcing them into CBDC slavery.Like with the Plandemic they need something to back their measures back then it was the invisible virus now it is the invisible armies of scammers like there were no scammers before. It's all communist tactics: invisible Western spies and saboteurs etc.We can argue that they implemented this to protect \"the naive street\" but I think they don't give a shit about these people.Just so you know in UK around the Plandemic lockdowns they further discouraged cash transaction, cashing out from the bank. Now to take your cash money out you have to answer a set of questions.Again the motivation was that there is some criminal (or a bad family member, partner) who forced you to go to the bank and take money out. So HSBC (one of the biggest of criminal banks who facilitated opium trade in India in China back in the days) put billboards all over the country to warn people about domestic financial abusers.So again to me this looks like staged. They started with cash then next year crypto. It all supposed to well coincide with Bankman-Fried scandal but the technology was already in place so they only needed to stage some crypto false flags.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on December 01, 2022, 09:18:31 AMQuote from: JackBravo on December 01, 2022, 02:36:09 AMAre there any UK banks that don't do this shit?I am seriously considering moving somewhere else or cashing out completely.Probably none, an article[1] mention there's only one bank which accept their customer buying cryptocurrency. But a comment of that article mention that bank is also not cryptocurrency friendly. Your option is either opening bank account on bank outside UK or use another deposit method which supported by exchange you use. For example, Coinbase in UK also support SWIFT account, PayPal (which have history of anti-cryptocurrency) and 3 types of card (debit, credit and 3d secure credit card)[2].[1] https://www.indieinvestor.co.uk/what-uk-banks-are-banning-crypto-buying/[2] https://www.coinbase.com/places/united-kingdom Thanks for the links. I would stay away from these so called challenger banks. Monzo so Starling is a total invigilation - a fece-lifted fiat banking.I can tell you right now that Starling blocks transactions to crypto exchanges. We tried to transfer to Coinbase. It rejected by displaying some message that they don't deal with cryptocurrencies.In all the instances I talked about so far a bank transfer has been used not some debit or credit card top ups.So the options:1. look for some bank that is not on that list.2. use P2P[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

You can charge your Revolut account with your debit card without any fees and then proceed to deposit to Binance through Revolut, which is conducted almost instantly.
