  "content": "Many newbie start without rules and always lose all their funds,and many of you may want rules and tips for professional gambling you need to follow this rules like robots to be successful in gambling and if you are playing for enjoyment than you can enjoy without these rulesstart here :Gambling Lessons And TipsWhat most of the people that lose big do is that they do not understand the earning frequency. They try to do the same with what they have done with 0.0001 BTC to 0.001 BTC to 0.1 BTC and some even more than that. Which definitely at the end lead to losing it all.Here are some other things to keep in mind:1. Keep it reasonable. Do not try to earn too much and later busting it all in some bets.2. No earning is always better than losing it all.3. When its not going in your favor, stop immediately.4. Profiting daily is impossible. Do not lose all your balance just for the sake of it.5. All the games are totally random and anything can happen so its best to stop your bets when you get a win anywhere between the safe and the max losing streak.6. Do not wait for even one bet more than the max losing streak to cut of your bets you will lose 90% of the time and its best to completely avoid that big loss which happen at the end.7. So for example on 3x Payout , the safe losing streak is 18 and the max losing streak is 24. So if you get a losing streak above the safe losing streak followed by a win stop your bets immediately.8. Next time the long losing streak will be definitely more and you have no clue when it will cross the max losing streak.9. Do not wait for that big payoff at the end after a long losing streak cut it off before it breaks your bankroll. Any bet amount above or close to a quarter of your balance will most of the time be a losing one.Size your bets such that one or two wins will make you win more than what you have lost. Do not get too greedy.10. The house is waiting for you to leave your game plan and end up in their game plan which is designed to drain your funds in the shortest possible time.Stop immediately once your emotions get hold of you. Too much fear and too much greed are both equally dangerous.11. Aim for a reasonable profit daily and never chase loses.12. Hope this helps you in using the Player's Edge fully to your advantage to beat the house.13. Most of the people in gambling set unrealistic goals most of the time like 2X 3x and more in the shortest time span possible. This impatient nature make them lose more and more.14. No one has ever won by playing the chasing game. You will sink in more and more like getting yourself stuck in a quick sand.15. people with fresh mindset is easily able to follow this rules, if you are in revenge phase(losed and trying to recover)then you need  to take a break then you may try but you losed little amount then i suggest to forget everything about gambling and never ever come back at this it ruined many peoples life.this amazing site helped me a lot also my experience, i shared this because you don't need to waste you time reading all blogs: https://www.smartgamblingedge.com/sorry i am weak at english I am newbie on this forum only this doesn't determine my experience with gambling i tried but i m not going to play anymore than just for fun, never ever gamble for money it will eat you in long run .",

The issue at hand is not whether you have experienced something similar or not, but rather the fact that if you incorporate articles, paragraphs, sentences, or even inspiration from other sources into your post without providing proper attribution, you are committing plagiarism, which is prohibited on this forum.I just searched it up and it looks like CryptoHeadlineNews is right. Even though you might have tried to change some words around, there are still whole sentences that are exactly the same as some other stuff online. So, it's pretty obvious that you just copied someone else's work. You should add some references or something to make it right before you get in trouble.",

Hope this helps you in using the Player's Edge fully to your advantage to beat the house.Really some good set of rules mentioned by the OP, one thing with casino games is that, it is pretty difficult, or even impossible to beat the house, except on an occasion where the gambler hit a very big winning and decides to quit gambling, so for as long as he or she does not return to gambling, then we can consider this person to have beaten the house, and the house will sure later recover that money from other gamblers..But in the occasion again that the gambler later return again to continue gambling, at the end of it all, the house will always win back their money, this is just how casinos are designed to operate.",

Winning is never certain in this industry. The problem id; many of us were fascinated by the idea that there are really people who managed to win the jackpot but unfortunately, it happens by chance. Much better to play it safely and with restrictions to atleast enjoy playing.Also it would be much better to do so to prevent things on getting worse. Gambling is truely addictive simply because it involves money. This is an enough and obvious reason to atleast be cautious of your gambling habits. If you'd win then that's good, but if you won't, try to ease down and never push through.",

He provides a valid article that contains part of your content which is enough for plagiarism accusation.It’s not bad to attached the link he provided as source to play safe instead of insisting for a none source post. Also is there really a pro gambler aside from poker player and sportsbook? Most of the gambling games games is designed for the house advantage. I wonder if anyone can manage to have a consistent profit with this kind of disadvantage. The list above is simply just a bank roll management that just prolonged by some sweet word. But in general it’s simply how to control bets which in theory it’s easy to do while very hard in actual due to human behavior.",
