For these reasons, there's no way the price of BTC can be hardcore as the max supply.The market has been volatile is the reason why BTC presents extensive opportunities to investors and holders.",

No, you can't hard-code the price, because it's resulted from both supply and demand, and demand is naturally never fixed. Unless of course there is no populace. In that case, the price of bitcoin is fixed; 0.",

This doesn't mean that clones and copycats can't be created, but they still won't be the real thing. Someday Bitcoin may no longer be the most valuable cryptocurrency on the market, but for now, this is a real deal - a battle-tested digital currency that is worth our attention.",

Those are not real bitcoin just like you said. There is nothing that has changed the total supply of bitcoin.That's right, the maximum limit cannot be changed. The fakes or forks are not the original, you can hodl  another version, but it does not change the total supply of bitcoin. Currently +1 million Bitcoin are lost, because the owners no longer have their passwords and in the next 100 years, there will be more. I think all of us know the story of the rubbish dump and the Bitcoin on the hard drive.",

I've read that satoshi came up to it for some reasons and basically, that's a good idea that he had come up with. Well, he's a genius and we've got less to be mined around 2M in supply and that will end up for the next 100+ years. Currently, there's already 19.1M in circulation and who knows how many are forever gone and can no longer be recovered which adds to lessening the supply and retaining its value.",

In this sense, I would say that if it is possible to quantitize all the welth in the world, under all forms, then, we just need to divide that value by the totall Bitcoin still available to have in circulation (not counting with the lost Bitcoins).So, let's say there are 600 thousand trillion Euros of welth (completely random value) in the world, including real state, and all other forms of welth, we divide 600 000 000 000 000 000 / 100000000 and you get an estimate for what price Bitcoin could have in this scenario. Of course there is more to this, but without going into many details such asa money created from thin air, etc!",

Bitcoin core has some checks included later but the actual max supply is never hard-coded as part of the consensus rules, it is a value that is going to be enforced through math which exists in the block subsidy checks and the halving rules.As for price, it can never be fixed simply because what we measure bitcoin price in (ie. fiat) does not have a fixed value. For example these days that fiat currencies are dumping hard, bitcoin price is going up against them which wouldn't work if it were fixed (bitcoin would have dumped with inflation ridden fiat).",

Price of btc also can hard core same as to the bitcoin network?Quite confuse with the relation of price of btc to bitcoin network. If you are asking about btc price and it will be depend on law of supply and demand. Market affects depend on the buy and sell of it. Too much supply(seller) can lower the price and vice versa if there arr shortage of coins to buy  demand will likely to increase. The fact that 21million total supply is no longer intact is quite good since some btc are loss forever due to some human mistakes such as forgetting keys or other ways to loss access to the btc holding.",
