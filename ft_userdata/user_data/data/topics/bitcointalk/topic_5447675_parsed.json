However, their ability to change the way we handle money and own things depends on many factors such as user adoption and the evolution of technology.If users are massive and DeFi and NFT-related technologies flourish in the future, they could change the way we handle money and own things. These decentralized applications allow transactions to be performed quickly, cost-effectively, and ensure transparency, while minimizing the intervention of intermediaries. With a non-fungible token, users can own completely new digital assets, helping to create diversity in asset ownership.However, for now, there is still a small group of people using DeFi and NFT and that is still the reality. To achieve widespread adoption and adoption of these technologies, continued development and improvement, while increasing user awareness and deployment, is required.",

Government is an entity that would never go away, so in the end they will always go with the one that is controllable and can be restricted.

I strongly agree with you on this point, I also think that it will not be a complete change of the way the social system has existed before. Just look at the history to the present, although things have changed a lot, but in general, it is a development to harmonize with the current living context.And with the issue that OP mentioned here, I see that this issue needs to be viewed more positively with the cryptocurrency market or vice versa, however I strongly believe that this market is gradually bringing positive value. more extreme, and if the government really takes it seriously then there is a non-inhibitory approach.",

Of course, with DeFi and NFTs in our hands, we'll be more careful in making decisions and managing risks. It will not remain as it is that it will only be used by a small group of people. Just like hntil today when we are building crypto communities, DeFi and NFTs will be widely adopted as well by many people.",

So I don't actually think in any way that NFTS can change the way we handle money and other things of life. In as much as I like the idea of the private ownership nature of NFTs, I still strongly believe it's not worth changing how we view other currencies.The use of NFTs will always be limited to small firms and companies, most of which are specifically built for it. We can't use NFTs to make purchases on the open market the same way that we can easily use other generally accepted currencies like Bitcoin and USDT.",

Only very few survives if they are able to find a committed group of supporters. So don't rely on such things. Rather adopt coins like bitcoin or ETH which has a global base of supporters. If these coins crashes down, the entire crypto market will face the same fate. So these coin will be the last ones to get into existential problems. Only these coins have the power to change the way we handle money or own things. But that's something we are yet to see.",

Biggest problem i see for this system to overcome are the native tokens (or coins). As decentralized systems need them for incentives and any goverment could attack on them banning their trade against fiat pairs. That would lower the incentives and while doing so decrease number of people who would want to keep the chain secure.",

It also allows for greater transparency and security in transactions, since the decentralized nature of the network makes it less vulnerable to fraud. However, I do not share the same opinion about NFTs. I think that NFTs have their place in the world, but I do not think they will replace ownership as we know it anytime soon. While I think they have a lot of potential, I do not believe that they offer any tangible benefits to users, and until something changes or new features are added to them, they will remain a niche product for collectors only.",

With Defi you always have the full control over your funds because you are in control of the key of your wallet all the time. The only thing that can happen is that the project where you are having your yield farm is making a rug pull or is hacked or something. You don't have that kind of risk when you put your money in a traditional bank, that is also part of the truth.I think that Defi nowadays is already used by hundred thousands of people so in my personal definition, that is not a small group of people, but of course it is also not the broad masses.",

I personally do not feel obliged to anything like that, I think I do not have to move to defi, and that is good enough reason to not move there.There are millions of people who ended up not doing anything about the current situation and they just became a part of it and they will continue to do that as long as possible.
