In the meantime, we can confirm that LastPass products and services remain fully functional.https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/11/notice-of-recent-security-incident/So again, it's better to make sure that we will not be affected specially if we are user of this product, change your password specially on our crypto related wallets or our master password.",

Paper and multiple copies of passwords are still much safer for me, with of course the constant vigilance of not infecting the computer with a keylogger or becoming a victim of phishing.",

Today, they claim that the leak was due to the August events. Although in August they assured everyone that they double-checked everything.Will they tell clients what they lost this time, or will they come up with an excuse again, afraid that people will no longer trust them?",

It is all about the marketing.

Besides, read how LastPass works and what the \"Zero Knowledge\" architecture means. Neither the company nor any third party has access to your passwords. (Not that I condone any kind of data leakage from centralized services like this.)Honestly, I've been thinking about alternatives to LastPass for some time. KeePass is a logical choice. It's a free, open source password manager, and it has a lot of great features and security. But KeePass has some downsides too. It's not perfect and it's not as easy to use as LastPass. The interface is unintuitive, and I worry that it will take too much time to learn. It has basic support for syncing with a cloud service (with some caveats), but nothing as advanced as LastPass. But, you won't have to worry about being hacked by bad actors or losing access to your data if the company goes out of business.",

As they say, DYOR.Although, if someone does indeed want to use a password manager, please make sure it's a open source, verified, and offline password manager. The way Lastpass do it introduces additional risks compared to Keepass. That said, there are additional password managers out there that aren't Keepass, and satisfy the above criteria. I generally think password managers are good for specific needs, but not for storing everything that's for sure.",

There's been leaks where the tokens which allow users to bypass two factor authentication have been leaked. This is generally not a good security practice in general, but it has been known. As for two factor authentication, that also depends on how it's implemented. If you're relying on other online authentication methods, then you could be in the same boat if they were breached. Physical keys, which you can then use open source software to do a authentication request yourself is the way to go, but most services/websites don't support it.",

Logically, we should all be aware that all system can have their side which can be vulnerable for such attacks, so just like what we heard from a movie, \"No System is Safe\". Technology evolves. Security are becoming more secured. Meanwhile, hackers also becoming more skilled and knowledgeable.
