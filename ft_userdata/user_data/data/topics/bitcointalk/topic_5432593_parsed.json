Technically 2021 but so late in the year I wouldn't say it shouldn't or couldn't be included in 2022 review. 1/3 members involved reputations had been salvaged and I had hopes for the other 2 to do the same but that didn't happen.",

BitcoinGirl.Club vs JollyGood drama.It was started from Bitlucy case, but there's a heat between BitcoinGirl.Club and JollyGood since they have different opinion about it. First BitcoinGirl.Club leave red tag to JollyGood and then JollyGood leave red tag to BitcoinGirl.Club, since BitcoinGirl.Club think he doesn't deserve to get red tag, he open a thread to ask to the communities. However the result is JollyGood revised his feedback from negative to neutral while BitcoinGirl.Club still stand with his negative feedback.Nice collection Helena Yu so there's never a boring month on bitcointalk It never will be LOLThe feedback was given in wrong time but unfortunately that was the time when I noticed it too. If it's hard to justify then anyone can look at the feedback on the user starmyc. We had some PM conversation and it was clear that justice was not severed to starmyc. JollyGood was taking the advantage of the situation with the red tag he left. He even did not pay the guy for the work. Eventually starmyc decided to leave the forum and focus on the things he is good at. He is now a successful software engineer as far as I understand from the PMs he sent me.The kind of things JollyGood does on the forum is obviously not good for the growth of the community as well as for individual members who are still working to establish a position in the community. Talking about it here will be off-topic so we better skip details.Quote from: SatoPrincess on January 01, 2023, 03:39:20 PMDate| Story|Thread  March 26, 2020| The forum seem to littered with congratulatory threads marking success of attaining a new rank.
