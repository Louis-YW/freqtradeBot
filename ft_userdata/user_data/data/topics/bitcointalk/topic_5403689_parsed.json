Well, if there are investments, there's money that flows throughout the economy of a country.And that's helpful due to the money coming in and that's what most countries want, they want to have a flow of money inside the economy from other resources and as well as investors that go directly looking at the economy. It's a wide thing to invest with and in different sectors, they all contributes to the economy of a country.",

Accumulation of capital and investment of that capital to produce more. That was the case at least until about 50 years ago when the economy became too debt based and turned into a financial casino, but in general the countries where most progress is made is where most investment is made.Regarding crypto, I'm not sure. Countries that implement industry-friendly laws will attract investment and employment related to the industry, but the impact it may have on the country's economy in general depends on many factors.But in general, investment helps because it brings capital into the country, creates jobs and builds wealth.",

For example, the circulation of digital currencies in a country will not exceed 100k, so how will it change the economic situation in a country.Let's take the example of the Philippines. Foreign labor remittances are an important resource for the Philippine economyIf all these transfers are not made, the Philippine economy will be severely affected, and the same if it is done using digital currencies, it may contribute to increasing the income of individuals, especially since a lot of money is lost as transfer fees.",

Any capital investment into a country will strengthen their infrastructure or service delivery ....depending on where those funds are allocated.",

If you consider what most investment companies do with your investment, you get to find out that, after you make an investment, the money you invested is mostly used for business to make profit. When you make an investment, the money you invested is used to set things in motion, start a business or boost a business and that mostly is beneficial to the economy as others will benefit in the form of say employment opportunities, sales opportunity for vendors e.t.c and in general keeps money in circulation. Try to imagine an economy where no one is investing, things will barely be moving, business will collapse and good ideas that people who lack finance have will never see the light of day. So in general investment is good for the economy of the country.",

Once you do so it gets recorded as your income either primary or secondary based on how you put it on your taxation paper. Every year you pay the taxes and thus government gets paid from you. The money is collected in the national reserves, treasures etc and used for the nations development. Whether its street, wild life sanctuary, bridge, or development of national defence or services related to government, our taxes help build the nation. The same taxes which were the result of your investment into the crypto currencies or any other commodities out there.",

      "body": "Considering investments in cryptocurrencies. There are few things that can be done. The tax that the government takes from the investments in Bitcoins is quite high in certain countries. It can even go up to 31% in countries like Australia and Canada people can barely make profits since the government controls a lot of what they can afford. Other than that there are also tax free countries for crypto but still through investments you can increase the overall GDP. And investing won't be much big of a deal since the gains are not so accountable it's only accountable for the personal gains which also indirectly helps the whole economy.",

Investments in a purely speculative, quasi-product, this ... these are speculative risks! And, as we see now, very high! And real investments are assistance in financing (of course - not free) in the development of real sectors of the economy, if the state itself does not have enough money resources), for its development. A good example of investment is Singapore, Hong Kong - countries where there are no resources, no natural resources, but there is a desire to improve the economy. Large investors finance the construction of non-resource-dependent industries, the country gets a breakthrough in the economy, jobs, taxes. Of course, we do not forget about the obligations to investors!",

When we say investment mate, it refers a long time business.   Now, if your talking about cryptocurrency and you want to invest here, I guess that would be a very risky to do as   an investors especially if you are zero knowledge in this field of business industry. But if you have at least an idea   here I could say the risk is very minimal though its not 100% safe.- If one of the cryptocurrency is a private coins that means, obviously the coin is regulated and it is under control   by the government and has tax where in this way through tax they can give contribution in the economy of the country  if they build a huge community to their coin business.",

Perhaps few citizens might be involved into cryptocurrency trading and investing but nocturnally.However there are many ways investment could add value to a country's economy but that actually depends on what you are investing into.For example; investment into huge real estate (housing) company, such estate company ends up paying tax to the government and such tax is a benefit to the country.",
