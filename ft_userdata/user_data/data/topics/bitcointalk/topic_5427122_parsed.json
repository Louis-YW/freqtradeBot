The Industry leader announced it was opening crypto services in the coming days through its Luxemburg branch. PayPal users in the country will be able to buy and sell cryptos through their EU- Based PayPal accounts. \"The introduction of this service offers Luxembourgish customers a new way to explore cryptocurrency in the PayPal environment they know and trust and provides customers access to educational content to help answer commonly asked questions and better understand the opportunities and risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Once available, eligible customers will be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash in their PayPal accounts via the website or the mobile app. PayPal’s cryptocurrency services were first launched in the U.S. in 2020 and expanded to the U.K. in 2021.\"",

And it's just like integrated support to crypto with their services and as they launch, you can't send and receive and withdraw crypto directly on your PayPal but are only allowed to trade, buy and sell within their platform. But, this is good news then for those people that are in the UK. They're expanding and if so, PayPal is missing a lot of market on this one since Binance and other exchanges have been there.",

The small exchanges are even trying to compete and still got some customers, but they're already established and expanding more.Well, they should be worried if their competitors like Wise and other the same service that focuses more on fiat starts to get into crypto as well. That's a big competition there not just with the typical crypto exchanges but also with the usual payment processors that we used to know.",

This is a great time to begin testing some new ideas and ventures in cryptocurrency for existing establishments that have shown interest for a long time, and Paypal is a great name to lead this effort. Moreover, Luxembourg is also a small community to have a financial institution of this type, and I hope they can establish a long-term partnership in this area.",

Paypal knows that EU is a big market for crypto so why they do? take advantage of it by first offering it to Luxembourg.We all know how rich this nation is, so most probably they are looking for ways to invest their money and what way it could be for Paypal to give them this options and definitely Paypal will take profits as well on this \"Sell-and-Hold-Service\" that they are offering. So another expansion for them and who knows, maybe next is Asia or Africa which I think has the biggest users of crypto.",

We haven't got a big list of cryptocurrencies, but initially bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and Litecoin were availed for buying, selling and transferring through PayPal. Years back co-founder of PayPal Peter Thiel mentioned in an interview, if he have come to know about the existence of blockchain technology before PayPal, he would've used it in the PayPal. So, a good support from PayPal to crypto is not a new thing.",
