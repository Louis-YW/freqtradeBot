  "content": "Hello,I didn't see anything about the book \"Going Infinite\" on the forum. I would like to know what bitcointalkers think of this book by Michael Lewis. I'm not sure if the author is naive or has too much affection for SBF (whom he's known since 2021 I believe), but he gives him quite a few extenuating circumstances. What do you think? (translations are only arriving in bookshops and I don't have the mind, or the skills, to read a whole book in English... Nobody's perfect)PS : is it the right place to post this question ?",
