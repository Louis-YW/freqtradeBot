You will never be successful on your trading without the skills of doing it since you donâ€™t have any strategy that will make your profitability consistent. Consistency is the key to have a stable profit.Newbie usually just guess and place trade randomly which can be considered as gambling since they are relying on their luck to have a profit instead of their skills to increase their chance of profit. Skills is your main weapon to have an advantage against other traders since we are all competing to each other on when to buy and sell.",

On some exchanges, people do not have option than to use their spot trading orders. But most complex exchanges have lite version now which is called convert. Convert is very simple to use, even for newbies.Some exchanges are very simple to use and basic and they do not offer pro or complex trading. Example are Luno, Remitano and Quidax that are available in my region.In conclusion, I will say no.",

I think this question refers to the spot market, not everyone who enters the trading platform has to master technical skills because the value of their portfolio keeps on fluctuating just by \"investing\". What needs to be noted about profit here is when you manage to realize profit when the P&L indicator is green, all traders including newbies have this opportunity. The difference lies in the consistency of profits, with trading skills you have the upper hand in this regard.",

I am more the one that invests in Spot, Trading requires also a lot of mental health. On the other hand, you can find other ways to make profits with Pools or programs in Defi or Exchanges that generate passive incomes, it is slow but you can reinvest them and keep generating more and not have your assets idle. Some platforms also have events that are not that guaranteed but it can be profitable with low investment (I qualified, for example, to Aptos and Arbitrum ones)",

But I think to get an experience it can be done because it takes sacrifice to be able to get a knowledge, but it must be remembered that they cannot fully do the same thing.

What is your perspective on this topic?This is applicable to everything in general and not only trading. Whatever you are doing, if you lack the basic knowledge and skills you may likely fail. The statement above is exaggerated but it is not to discourage new traders but rather be encourage them to acquire some skills from pro traders before venturing into trading. Without the skills you can not even differentiate between short and long, candle stick, lots size and other terms related to trading. As a newbie, your chance to make profit without skills is 0.1%. It is therefore important for you to seek the knowledge first. QuoteGuys, I mean what other ways can newbies benefit from crypto investment without having to be a day trader or a professional trader. Because I believe there are other ways to earn aside from trading.Â  Crypto investment is quite different from Crypto trading. You are the one confusing yourself. You don't need to be trader before you earn from Crypto. Trading is one aspect of crypto that requires high skills if you want to go far and it's more riskier that investment. As a newbie and investor, you can buy and hold for prefer period of time and sell when you feel satisfied with the profit. You don't need to trade on daily basis and you may stake your coin as well to be receiving a little fraction on a fix period.",
