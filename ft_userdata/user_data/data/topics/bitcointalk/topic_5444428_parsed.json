Is it trustable?Any idea welcomed.Thank you.I never understood the monetization of your own data (which it seems to be doing). When at the same time you are giving it for free to ton of different companies via apps and tracking cookies. And now you would be able to sell that same data? Which anyone could get cheaper from huge companies selling it with millions of other users data with it with bulk prices. Implementation of this tech for any kind of adoption would need to be revolutionary and simple in order for it to work.",

I tried using Alex, his answer is a lot shorter than the answer from OpenAi. Not a very detailed answer by the way so it's kind of an unfinished product right now but because there are many of them already competing in this niche. Maybe choosing just one will be better.

They've got no actual originality because they're attaching to what's popular at the moment. I'm done with those projects copying or making their names close to the trendy things today like in the past about TV shows, AIs, meme coins, now we've got these popular AI made by OpenAi which is the chatgpt and now, a developer sees the opportunity of it trying to get some investors by just adding the name of the popular app to their project. The website was even made just this 2023, so what I am expecting about it? If the fade of chatgpt goes down, this project might also lie low.",

You will just be scammed once if you just pick one.Since they are using OpenAI models, it is likely that they try to minimize the answer to lower the cost of the API calls. I wonder, what is their point to integrate such kind of feature when the main idea of their project is data monetisation? Pure publicity, I suppose, nothing more. This is shady for me because it has no utilization for the project that they claimed trying to build. This project has too much hype and emphasis on AI, while doesn't address the true problem or concern that comes around within the AI ecosystem.",

So far the idea of balance staking to earn AI tool might be a good start and if this project goes along as planned maybe we can see more features.

What about the project you promoted in your signature space? the project is aiming to create their own network for DEFI, NFT and gaming, why does it's matter? there are a lot network they can use including the cheap one, your project doesn't help anything and only want to make money However I'm not defending the project about AI ChatGPT, but all of projects nowadays are only looking to make money where the solution has been found before the project created.",

AI projects is now on a trend on investors and \"gpt\" word is now being incorporated on projects because of the successful AI chatgpt. They can easily get identified as an ai project by an investors if they use \"gpt\" word in their project name. I personally don't like this clone type projects since it is usually made by a scammer. There have been a couple of instances already that they are cloning even project names then disappear with the money of their investors.

CryptoGPT is a risky investment like any altcoins, and I would say it's more risky yet, because it's plagiarizing the GPT sail to lure investors into believing it has something to do with ChatGPT.

Well sadly it's most likely bouncing soon as investors are idiots and there's GPT-4 openai developer livestream staring in 1 hour. This version will most likely create insane hype and people will buy in to every AI altcoin out there, and having a GTP in the name helps.
