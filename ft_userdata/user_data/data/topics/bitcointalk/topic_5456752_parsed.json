Is it just another memecoin like the majority of the market, does it intend to help the animal cause? he has! But this is not related to the technology itself, I have no intention of creating the next ETH. Honestly, I just wanted to see if someone without a lot of free time, without resources and without being famous could build something in the crypto market or if it really has become a game of marked cards and only with a lot of money to make the project work. And don't say that it's because there's nothing new in token technology that's going to fail. Day in and day out there's also one of those that becomes hype.Anyway, I appreciate your comment and thanks for the help friend I will research about SEO that you told me!",

To sell it though is another thing. You'd have to burn a hole in your funds,Â  a big one at that, to even see a bit of marketing be effective. And that effectiveness isn't even guaranteed to return whatever you spend. But hey, if your meme coin manages to become a big thing due to some external factor, then funds aren't an issue. The internet will 100% solve that issue for you since they'd do it for free.",

So you spent 5 minutes in the code (because that's enough to make a meme coin) and you would like us to help you sell it to investors?? You know that falls under the definition of fraud/stealing or at least exploiting the mentally ill? (you create something with zero value, not planning to add value in the future - with new use cases- and want to sell it) You don't have to be rich/elite to make money in crypto. Create something that everyone wants to use. a tool that peopel need. And then people will start using it and you can think about monetization. However, if you want to make a new scam coin \"AKA meme coin\" then don't count on our help.",

This ain't the last 5 years ago when many investors would waste their money on anything just for kicks or to play with the market and boost their investments more. There are too many created meme coins now, the question \"What makes you think yours is that special?\" should pop out. Because you cannot rely on just willpower to reach certain heights like \"There are projects who just used the hype.\" I don't think that is still how it works now unless you have that popular guy as your brother or father.",

Advertisement is everything on shitcoin industry. You should hire influencers and active shillers if you want to gather investors around your token since no one will trust you if you donât have anything while influencers can sell shit tokens with their follower since their opinion serves as financial advice.Just let it go if you donât have enough funds to continue the promotion. Itâs a waste of time. Tons of shit tokens being mint every seconds that same as you, day are dreaming for their token to pump.",

I'm surprised that I had 4 orders totaling 21 dollars in the presale hahaha anyway I'll keep trying until the fifth day when the presale ends and the tokens will go back to their owners for not reaching the goal.

I mean why even someone promotes their coin in the first place if it doesn't have use, it's like just telling people to give their money to the coin deployed and that doesn'treally seem like a good gesture honestly.also there are reasons why some meme coins always have some similar names, because they knew their coin have no use whatsoever and yet they still want it to be popular.so the naming definitely become their strategy to promote their coin without the need of spending massive amount of money.",
