I collect orders until I've reached a few and then ask my partner to print the shirts. Single shirts can be shipped relatively cheap as 2$ inside of Germany or 4$ outside of Germany.If wanted, I could also send one big batch with all the collected shirts as a package for the US and send to one single person who distributes there. Let me know what works best for you",
