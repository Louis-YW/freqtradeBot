In where and by whom?But answer to the question is that every couple is different and not every coulple have same answer to that question. But the question one would need to ask is: What has changed so that it would work this time?There's usually a very good reason for breakup and if something fundamental hasn't changed, like personal growth and attitude towards the partnership. Then same problems as last time will appear to deal with. And most likely they will be dealed with same way, by divorce.",

I need more idea on this People tend not to know the worth of their spouses until they lose them. Sometimes we think that another man or woman will treat us better than our spouse and we end up divorcing our current partners. After the divorce, it might become clear that we have made a very big mistake because our former partner is far better than the one we ran to. This will lead to regret and the drive to divorce again and return to our first love.But when the marriage ended on a bad note maybe due to domestic violence, adultery, or other unacceptable behavior, both parties might be glad the marriage ended. Nobody will be willing to go back to a relationship that was toxic or irresponsible. I have seen people that experienced the peace of mind after they divorced their partners. While some of them came back begging on their knees because they want their former spouse back.",

We have had our fair share of fights over the course of our relationship, but we always managed to work things out and have never broken up for more than a few days. Our principle is to fix things and not give up the moment a problem arises. Life is tough, and you'll have to work through your problems together. I believe in second chances; depending on the reason for the breakup, if it wasn't cheating, maybe I'd consider getting back together with someone.",

It was not like that before, marriage was taken more seriously, I think.Reunification is possible, but I would not bet on it happening often.",

I've seen stories of relationships that have gone through a lot and then still managed to break up, file for divorce, and then went silent for years. But in the end, they were still the ones that have feelings for each other. Sometimes the reasoning is about the shared responsibility towards their children and then that builds up the fire again for them to understand and reminisce the times that they've been together. And that's why I believe that even with break ups or divorce or worst, as long as there's a chance, a couple can still be back together again.",

Reasons will be, because they've had strong feelings for each other before now, they've understood their flaws, they are ready to make amends, they've known how to communicate with each other without saying a word, they can barely let go of the past they've had with each other, so they are constantly reminiscing the good old days, and lastly some partners feel those traits they enjoyed from their past partners cannot be gotten anywhere, So coming back together to start from where they stopped will be the best decision for them.",

I need more idea on this It is not forbidden for divorced individuals to reconcile and resume their relationship, but it's important to consider the reasons for the initial divorce and whether those issues have been resolved or addressed. Reconciling after a divorce can be difficult and requires open communication, forgiveness, and a willingness to work through any problems that may arise. It's also important to consider the feelings and emotions of any current partners or children involved. Ultimately, the decision to reconcile should be made carefully and with the well-being of all parties involved in mind.",

I need more idea on this It is an exaggeration to think that the re-marriage of two divorced partners may be prohibited under any legislation.Personally, I consider that divorce is a healthy option in all cases, whether to end an uncomfortable relationship for one of the partners or to review the mistakes of the relationship and rebuild it on solid foundations. Often the decision to divorce is final, so the cases of remarriage of two divorced partners are almost negligible. On the other hand, it is better for the marriage decision to be carefully considered to avoid the remnants of a failed marriage.",

I can't understand itand currently, society no longer gives more importance to marriage and fidelity, people get married, but when one of the parties has no money they get divorced, in europe, america marriages no longer last at least 1 year, these are very low cases, the most women in europe and america just want a rich man and have no interest in marriage",

But before that, what is the real reason first why they get to that point. If the reason is to heavy especially like cheating, I guess its really hard to make it work again. The trust that loses on one of them is hard to build again. On the other hand  One reason that make divorce couple reunite is because of their children. After realizing their faults they slowly accept and forgive each other. And I believe that is the best thing to do so the children will grow with a complete family.",
