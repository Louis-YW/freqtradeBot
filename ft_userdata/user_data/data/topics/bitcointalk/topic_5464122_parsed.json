It's possible that you have been infected with that malware and they changed your copied address into this address. Well, this is a possibility. It has happened with so many people.Regarding sportsbet, I really doubt they would apply such shady method to not pay legit winnings. They are one of the coolest casino out there. From the last few days experience, one thing I learnt is that they care the most for their customers. Anyway, anything can happen. I will PM SB representative here to have a look here.",

I think that since they are manual withdrawals, sometimes they cannot be 100% infallible, I repeat that I have no reason to falsely accuse them, since I was earning and receiving withdrawals very quickly from them, what I ask for is an investigation on their part in this manual paymenthttps://ibb.co/4KZvWb1https://ibb.co/wr8F7Yrhttps://ibb.co/YRTbSFMI am not an expert in cryptography, is there any way to find out at least from which exchange or billet company such LTC address comes from? I admit that it could not be infallible either, and although I have checked my devices for viruses and have not found them, this would be the only way to copy an LTC address wrongly, I mean, who could make a mistake copying an address and then not knowing where from? I copy it with a little research? In my case I have not been able to find the source of that address, I use coinbase, binance and my trezor cold wallet, and none of them have this LTC address on their list. If my problem is of any use, I hope that by reading this they will verify their addresses when charging and capture the withdrawal request to prove anything.",

I would like you to recommend a solution, Sportsbet has only washed its hands, and they probably believe that they are infallible by copying and pasting addresses, I only ask that they investigate it, Wait before your transaction was approved did you cross check the address before proceeding? Or you just copy and pasted it into your account and then requested for a withdrawal? I just want to know because they are malware that is capable of changing your copied address to a completely different address without you knowing while there are other that changes your address into a different one but it may still have the same digits that’s located at the ending and start of your address making it seem as if it’s your own address.Right now your money is sitting in that wallet without any transaction being made, it’s not possible to know if that address is an exchange address or a non-custodial wallet you’ll have to wait for a transaction to be made before you can know if it’s an exchange address. And for the recovering, the chance of you recovering your money back if indeed the error that happened was as a result of an error you made is less than 1%.Right now all you can do is hope that sportbets Carrie’s out the investigation and comes out with a result that shows that they were the cause and not you.",

To clarify once and for all.Are you sure you don't have a malware in your computer? Are you really sure that when you copied address, you saw that the pasted address was actually your address and not this one MTiJxudm8tTcCrLwwNsykcRaUGoHjMFaAs ? Btw this address has only one transaction of 38.3LTC received with 0 spends.As far as I know, casinos record absolutely every step. Ask their technical group to check which address you originally put when you asked for withdrawal.What is your real litecoin address?",

Do well to provide your withdrawal records via your dashboard profile so we can see if truly what you are saying is correct. We understand your frustrations hence you see the response and possible solutions coming forth but you will have to come up plane with full proof. Just as others have said, if you feel you did copy the right address but they paid to another wallet address then there is possibly something wrong with your device. Maybe it's been infiltrated with malware but if you have cross checked for your information properly you would have noticed it yourself before withdraw approval from your end. Anyways it's unfortunate but I do not think the casino would attend to your case as they have already made payment to the wallet address on your request.What I would advise you to do now is to run a check on your device to making sure it is safe so that you do not have such experience in the future again.",

But they can also verify that you are the one who made such mistake so expect that they will not send again since they already done with their obligation and you are the one who's to be blame for that situation.",

The transaction hash you provided shows that it was transferred to a different wallet but how can we trust that the wrong wallet is not what you input there. It could also be that you input the wrong address there while withdrawing those LTCs quickly.  A friend of mine sent along the contract address of the same token while doing a quick transfer to his own exchange deposit wallet and he lost them. So we cannot blame sportsbet without any clear evidence",
