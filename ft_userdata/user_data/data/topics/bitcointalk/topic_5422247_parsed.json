I think people who invest in Bitcoin didn't really care on the next year where there many rumor that economy will be in bad condition because they're looking for long term holding. Since Bitcoin's fundamental is really strong and Bitcoin has been declared \"dead\" for so many times, but in the end Bitcoin will comeback and recover. This make they're trust Bitcoin 100%, just accumulate every dip if you have idle money.",

So \"big losses are yet to come?\" Nah. Even with your prediction (dump to 13k) big losses are mostly behind us.Speaking of recession. BTC dumped from 69k to 16k in 2021/2022 evaluating harsh economic condition we have now and will have in near future. Thats how market works. It evaluate future, not present. So if you think that economy will start to recover in 2023/2024 (at least temporary relief) its good time to buy now. Even if we have possible another 20% dump ahead.",

It's better to wait for the market to be bullish again because you can be sure that after the bear market ends and the bull market comes back, even though it might take a long time.",

That means we are at a loss, but as long as you don't sell your crypto assets, the investment you see will definitely increase again after the bull market returns. You really have to be able to take care of your crypto assets and don't be lured in by negative news from out there because that can make you panic and sell your crypto assets right away. This is the time for us to become strong hands in holding our crypto assets so that when the bull market comes, we can get profits again.",

Do you feel that a bear market in risk assets mimicking the global financial crisis, big losses are yet to come?Why do you say the big loss is yet to come?For example, those who bought Bitcoin at the peak of last year's price and are still holding it until now, they must be said to have suffered a loss because they still haven't got the profit target they wanted and the price increase that many people are still expecting has not yet occurred in the market. And I also don't think that the bear market at the moment is imitating the global financial crisis, because what I saw after the bad case of the big FTX exchange, the market immediately looked bad with lots of simultaneous dips.",

In the previous bear cycles bitcoin also dropped 80%, 90% and there was no crisis or recession at that time. In short, this is just a bear cycle for bitcoin and there will always be a good reason for bitcoin to drop in price, FTX is also an example of bitcoin falling to $15k.",

As least for me I will brace for that price so that there will be no surprises on my end, and at least I will be prepared to buy at that prices.And so if others see it as bad or very negative, there could be investors who will take advantage if that situation arises.Of course, it's very tough, but if you where already alive during the financial crises in 2008-2009, or the effect of the Covid-19 in our market last March 2020 wherein the price nosedive to $3k, you should know what to do by this time and your mentally will be different.",

The market is volatile in nature simply because its market value is determined by demand. With demand, it is not constant because of factors affecting it. If you can endure no matter how low the market price gets, then continue holding. The losses, as long as you are not selling, are just temporary and you only have to wait for the recovery.

If anything, consensus is that we're going down more â€” it's not even an opposing opinion.Bitcoin goes below $14,000 and people make the obvious guess that it will go all the way down to the next 1000. It is not based on charts or patterns or any insight but reaction based on the current price going below the 1000. Other members are predicting $10,000 not based on anything but aiming for the next rounded ten thousand. I find most members here are reactionary and pull figures out of their ass",

If btc is still alive in 10-20 years it will definitely be worth more then it is now but whether or not it is still alive is the question that most people fear. That is why we have these headlines of Bitcoin will collapse if certain exchanges die but it is not true. When exchanges like ftx, mtgox or even Binance disappear new ones replace it. The short term (1-2 years) the price gets hit but it does normally recover just look at the past with mt gox.",

I feel like world started to solve problems caused in covid era. Every economy is getting on their feet. Right after inflation problem is solved everything will be better and that period we will see huge crypto bull. \"Hold your breath for couple more months and keep buying whenever bitcoin is low\" is my motto.I also think that if bitcoin has a reason to drop in the future, it could be due to the crash of FTX, things won't end so soon. Interest rate and war news have no longer affected the market in the latest month. Bitcoin stood firm during the November rate hike and if it weren't for the FTX crash we would probably have had a sizable rally.",

I do not think it will go down that low there is too much demand and as soon as btc reaches lower then 10k people will be buying it just to gamble on it returning to the numbers it has done in the last couple of years. I do not think btc will go down to $10,000 as that would require further drama from FTX and I think we are getting close to closure with that",
