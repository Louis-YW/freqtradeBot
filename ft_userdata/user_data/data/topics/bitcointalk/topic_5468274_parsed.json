This might be a new strategy for Binance to decentralize their operation and make it more difficult for regulators to crack them down or am I making an overextended assumption?The same is my speculation. If Binance was able to abide with western sanctions on Russia while continuously holding on to the Russian market when the invasion was at its peak, there's really no reason why it would let it go now. Binance earns a lot from the Russian market. If CZ risked operating in many countries illegally for the sake of money, why should he leave Russia when Moscow didn't even order him to?Yes, there's pressure, but I think the more valid reason why Binance is to exit Russia is that its operation is already significantly crippled by the sanctions as far as serving the Russian market is concerned. It would be much better to find an alternative by which it could fully operate and make the most of Russian customers. CommEx is the way to go.Binance has already been setting this event up. It has already floated the idea for months. I guess those were all preparatory PR moves so that once the exit finally happens, they won't look suspicious. However, the announcement having to emphasize that it is a full exit and that it doesn't have revenue split and that it doesn't even have the option to buy back shares sounds suspiciously defensive to me.",

Those other companies also didn't leave Russia. Not willingly anyway, they were forced to leave. After all Russia a huge market for them to make large amounts of money from. The point is that if you look at a lot of these companies, they never really left Russia. They did something similar to what Binance did, they remain in the Russian market through different means like proxies or different companies.For example the Auto Industry in Europe like in Germany stopped exporting cars directly to Russia, but they never stopped exporting to Russia! What they did was to find a third country (for example Armenia and if I'm not mistaken Georgia) to act as a proxy and exported their cars to that country which would then send them directly to Russia.This is why my theory is that Binance (which does care about sanctions) created this \"separate\" business so that when US sanctions it, they are forced to only sanction Commex not Binance ergo it wouldn't affect the main business.",

This denial of CZ having some power over CommEX is somehow similar to his friend Justin Sun's denial of his ownership of Huobi which has recently just rebranded to HTX, a decision which could be attributed to Justin himself. Anyway, if I may add additional curious information. CZ himself admitted that some CommEX team members are formerly team members of Binance itself. The design of CommEX, APIs, and others are \"similar to Binance.\"CommEX users who are BNB holders will continue to be given 25% discount on trading fees.",
