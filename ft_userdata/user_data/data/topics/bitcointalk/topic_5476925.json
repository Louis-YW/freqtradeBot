Bitcoin miners are an important component of the Bitcoin ecosystem, we should love and support them!You are right we should support miners but bruh we did not hire them we have to give them money (which we do give on every transaction) but I was more like talking about extra money like bonuses or in terms of support. They have chosen to become miners and believe me, those with big mining farms are the ones taking more benefit from this congestion. The chances for individual miners to earn a block reward have become a little rare maybe saying more rare would also be not wrong.A few days back I read a news that an individual with a lower-level mining system won a block reward and then I realized if this is being shared as news then it must be something rare that doesn't happen in the mining business.So, miners are making a hell lot of money from transaction fees and the block reward they get, and they don't only mine BTC, those with machines, also spend time on mining other coins too. But if you saying that we should take this period in a way that we are supporting them then it would be wrong because to make a transaction we are being forced as we don't have any other choice but to use LN.",

You are trying to pottery the picture in a way that miners only realy on transaction fees. They get the block rewards and that's the main source of their earning. If Bitcoin cannot stay competitive it will be phased out from the market. In order for Bitcoin to stay competitive the transaction fees must be reduced. The problem here is with the ordinals who are spamming the network with nonsense transactions. The current level of fees is just too high and not sustainable. This needs to stop.",

Those who weren't there transactions to get filled quickly will pay the higher fee no matter what. But if you are not in a rush, using less fee is always the better option. You can add your fee manually on how much you want to pay. Imagine someone making a transaction of $10 and they have to pay $2 worth of fee for that little amount of transaction. That doesn't seem right. If you are in a hurry, you can pay the high fee, if not I think it's a waste of money. If the miners are not profitable, they won't mine.

When I say miners I am not referring to individual miners as this surge is created by those with huge mining farms. Miners fee is considered as an appreciation for the cost they incur largely due to electricity bills but it has been turned into a dynamic pricing practice which shouldn't happen. Bitcoin was created for P2P transaction without defining large or small transaction as decentralization is the essence of it and I don't understand how some of us justify these charges stating we shouldn't use Bitcoin for micro transactions as it makes no sense.",

Bitcoin miners are an important component of the Bitcoin ecosystem, we should love and support them!I wouldn't disagree with you that miners actually play a very important role in the Bitcoin network. It is also true that miners face difficulties in the current times due to rising prices of almost everything from electricity prices to daily necessities. However, there is a way for them, such as holding a percentage of the bitcoins obtained by mining, so that they can profit from them in the next bull run. Moreover, I also think that miners can put in themselves for other work, in which case they have to maintain their time scheduling very well because mining also requires a lot of technical work at the same time.Now if I say that Bitcoin's transaction fees have gone up a few days ago and now, I don't think any Bitcoin user is happy, maybe all of the miners are happy. But regular crypto users like us are not happy. I certainly wouldn't want to pay a $13 transaction fee to make a $34 bitcoin transaction. And I think if this continues for a long time, a large amount of people will turn to altcoins as an alternative to Bitcoin. I hope this transaction fee issue will be resolved soon.",
