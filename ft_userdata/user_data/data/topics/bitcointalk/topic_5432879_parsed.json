  "content": "Today Happy Birthday Bitcoin on 3 January A great gift for all Bitcoin fans for the desk or mounting on the wall or put it with the other stuff in the Crypto showcase area of your home. Genesis blockA genesis block is the first block of a block chain. Modern versions of Bitcoin number it as block 0, though very early versions counted it as block 1. The genesis block is almost always hardcoded into the software of the applications that utilize its block chain. It is a special case in that it does not reference a previous block, and for Bitcoin and almost all of its derivatives, it produces an unspendable subsidy.OrderGenesis block stainless steel plate 120x120x8mm weight approx. 900g --> $49Genesis block stainless steel plate 100x100x6mm weight approx. 450g --> $39Genesis block stainless steel plate 100x100x4mm weight approx. 310g --> $37 Shipping depending on country --> need your address Per PM Payment in BTC and ETHFor a order send me a PM an have a look in my other offers to save shipping cost.Stainless steel Bitcoin Recovery Seed Platehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5323755.040mm x 3mm 30g Bitcoin Coin (loadable and customizable coin)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5382457.0Source: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_blockBest regards,Willi",

If you add a personal touch / design, this could sell quite well here. Just my guess and thoughts.Maybe some other collectors agree / have other suggestions?",

Copper is impossible to process with my laser. Brass and Aluminum works, too. What material specifically did you have in mind?Best regards,WilliI would have never seen this response, if i didn't search it out. The oldest known book in existence is made with gold pages (500BC time frame), silver ones exist as well from the same time period, such as King Darius's tomb. This doesn't included clay tablets. With that said I'm looking for an epic way to store public addresses for long periods of time. Engraving them into silver sheets might be a great way to do it and make a treasure in and of itself. We can call it \"The Book of Keys\" I can't use steel or anything that rust or corrodes easily, especially in humid wet environments or submerged under water for long periods of time. We all know how often we lose items in \"boating\" accidents in the Caribbean haha! I would like to know the size of any micro engraving you can produce. List will be of thousands of different denominations of physical bitcoins/ altcoins public addresses. Probably should include the bitcoin whitepaper as well. I have piles of silver spoons and forks just laying around. I can have them made into small sheets of metal for engraving. Similarly to the pictures provided. Would also need holes drilled to hold the pages together with \"D\" rings. So the purity of the sheets will be anywhere from .800 - .950 purity of Silver. LMK options availablecT",
