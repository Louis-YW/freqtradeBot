I'm curious, though, what do you mean by investing in a game? Like, investing money into the development of the game? If so, I think you'll have a better chance if you start a Kickstarter campaign or something similar to raise funds for game development.",

I see your offer is nice and a good one but you did not make any introduction of yourself, I believe for you to have placed such offer, you must have had such deal before why not include or attach your portfolio here so we could see and have clues of your past records if they are ok to go with. This post will not in any way give you your desired results as it does not convince very well to invest in your project. I need something feasible. I really do not have conviction of this you have posted here. Kindly do well to update us here with more information about your project and what we should look out for. State your terms of agreement so we could know and if it interests us we invest and if we want adjustment in your agreement terms, we negotiate. This is business, you have to spell it out.",

Many investors see so many scams so they will not easily invest on idea so best to create to show something relevant thing to make people believe on what you are offering.",

Exactly why I never picked so much interest in writing a comment or making any willing contributions to it.I'm very interested to knowing how OP intends to monetize the game his building and since his asking for the help of investors, I'm sure he knows that no real investor would wanr to invest money in a project they're not sure of and basically they would want to know how much they will be getting in return so OP should take out time to figure all of this out from how much he will be needing to how much he is expecting to payback on investment.I love the ideas if the game and I must confess that you're song a great job and you aould start a campaign to raise funds if you think that might help.",

Because I think that should be your number one detail before even starting coding.So if I may ask, how much do you need from investors? As I think it would have been more better if you are specific. While secondly, what do the investor stand to benefit from your game development? And how about you go seek a loan from bank to enable you to launch your game, make profit, an go about paying back your depth. Since by virtue that you are just a newbie on this forum who has no reputation, I doubt if anyone will be willing to risk his/her hard earn BTC.QuoteEven chatGPT was helpless.

I will suggest to you just as others have done to start working on your project. It will be nice that you start up the project with your own funds so as to be fully committed to developing it to a certain stage of operation before thinking of looking for investors to invest in your project. You have a good idea and it is a good business for profit making but the possibility of investment from investors at this stage is narrow just as it was earlier said, scams do happen through this pattern so people are skeptical and being careful these days as not to be scammed of their hard earned resources by scammers. At this point what I will advise you to do is that you work on your project and have something reasonable to present to investors.",

To come up with idea of codes to do the map was super hard and took me 6 month of thinking. Now working on the menus, so one code would be able to open many menus and will start debuging raise and lower the land. Doesn't work properly.  I didn't start the networking as I dont have concept of complete network game, yet. That is why I wanted to find investors, so the game would build faster. I plan to setup phpAdmin or Node sever. Perhaps phpAdmin may be at the beginning as it is easier than Node. Need a dedicated server, the rentals are very expensive.Also since im alone is doing it, it might take more than a year to finalize all gaming code and make game ready for thre market. Might be need some one with networking skills to reduce the amount of time taken. It would be nice to know who wants to participate and invest before the project completed. As if I complete all by my self, why do I need investors for after that. Any way the most difficult tasks with the code is done. Now will be easier stuff for programming.At this moment I don't know how much money needs for the projects, because everything so far I can do it from home at my computer for free. But for sure in the future might be such opportunity.",
