No currency is even stable; talk more about stabilising a highly volatile currency like bitcoin. Being volatile is what pushed bitcoin to where it is today; it's not some fiat or stable coin for which we want it to remain at one price. Inflation is one thing we can't avoid, but to some point, it's safer to hold bitcoin than the so-called stablecoins, as bitcoin has resistance to inflation up to a certain level.",

Bitcoin is not a stable coin. it will keep fluctuating up and down. and that's what make Bitcoin so perfect.there are other factors which cause high inflation in altcoin market. inflation in altcoin market is not just because of Bitcoin's volatility. the project, team and business model behind an altcoin play a big role in that certain Altcoin's Value and market price.",

They are also volatile but less volatile than bitcoin. Bitcoin volatility is towards being an appreciating asset. But fiat volatility is towards being a depreciating asset. That is why it is not worth holding fiat.I have noticed that most people referred to fiat pegged coins as stable coins. Are coins like wBTC, rBTC, BTCP and the likes pegged to bitcoin or unstable altcoins not stable coins? They are all stable coins just like fiat pegged coins.",

Yeah, of course it's more stable than most altcoins because we know that even when BTC goes down - it will come back sooner or later. With altcoins, we can't be sure about that.",

What is there will be multidimensional views about it, stability is not expressed in bitcoin and although many people may wish for it, my thoughts are that it is infinity, and represents the limit of Bitcoin. = bitcoin. Regardless, the reality is that we see bitcoin acceptance growing, but in terms of scale, it is still a very new field or, more frankly, very small in scale compared to other markets. We will have target levels for the future state of the market, and there will be changes in society, so there is no real guarantee of whether in the next 100 years you will see what has changed regarding bitcoin.",

The global economic system is dynamic which is why there will always be changes in policies that will either affect Bitcoin positively or negatively. Buying or selling altcoins does not correlate with the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency and altcoin prices depend mostly on the direction of bit Bitcoin price. The volatility of Bitcoin is what attracts many investors to it, if the price doesn't go high and low, how will investors make a profit? You don't need to bother about the growth of Bitcoin because it is designed to grow regardless of the challenges.",

But to become a full-fledged means of payment, Bitcoin needs to reach the stage when its volatility becomes minimal. It is still unclear what Bitcoin will eventually become, it will be just an investment instrument, a store of value against inflation, or it still has a chance to become a means of payment. I'll be fine with any of these options, and that's what I like about Bitcoin.",

Again, if the price of Bitcoin is stable, the price of other altcoins is seen to increase slightly.  So in these cases it is necessary to keep the price of Bitcoin stable.  But on the downside, if there is a bitcoin stub, it will not be possible to make good profits through trading or holding bitcoins.  So just having style will not be good for us",

If Bitcoin becomes the norm, the dollar may be fluctuating. Stability in cryptocurrency is relative.Bitcoin volatility is a sign of growth and changing market dynamics (not just instability). As the bitcoin industry grows, stability will certainly increase, but not immediately. Stability requires growing pains, but so does transformation.Focusing on stability may miss Bitcoin's transformational potential. It challenges existing financial systems as a currency and technological innovation. Instead of restricting it to established systems, embrace its transformational potential. Stability will arrive, but innovation must continue.",

We already have bank do that since they adopt the changes or demand on the market. So for sure there will be less interest for bitcoin goes stable. Bitcoin is design to be a good investment for people seeking opportunity to earn with this coin that's why there's a lot of people got attracted to it since they see that there's huge potential for them to earn on market volatility of bitcoin.We know there's a lot of guys out there got frustrated about its volatility nature but if they could just learn to do a research and get a lot of knowledge from it gor sure they can get the best result for acquiring bitcoin even if they know the market is so volatile.",

For me, I don't think volatility hinders investment because that is where we get our profit but first an investor should study how it works or else he would think of it as hindrance. I personally don't mind Altcoins but I would like to have one but still at the end of the day they end up being converted to Bitcoin in the long run.",

Even though Bitcoin remains a digital software coin, it is humans that drive the supply and demand process.Don't forget that, there is one thing behind every transaction, which is to make profit. In every market, when the supply of coins are high among sellers, the Marchants manipulate the price to buy them at a slightly lower rate, so that, when they sell these coins they have purchased at a time that, the supply is not high, they can sell at a higher rate or exchange at a higher rate.The Marchants is a clique of business people that monopolizes the demand and supply system to favour themselves.Finally, it is the rise and fall of currencies that sustains their value in any economy, so if they sustain consistency or stability, Bitcoin will be devalued for a long time.This is the principle, that is why even the world's strongest currency maintains stability and falls but, the world's strongest currencies don't maintain a consistent fall for a long period or even more than a week.If you want bitcoin to continue been relevant in the exchange market , don't wish for consistent stability.

Making sure Altcoins have room to grow with cool ideas and clear rules is a must so in the end, a laid-back and well-regulated crypto scene is what we need for everyone to trust it and invest wisely.",
