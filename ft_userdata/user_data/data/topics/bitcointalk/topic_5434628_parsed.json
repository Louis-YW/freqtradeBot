This kind of thing happens all the time, it’s a good way for criminals to get drugs into maximum security prisons. Weirdly the drug trade is big even in jail & obviously it’s tough to smuggle drugs in. Our feathered friends are obviously very useful to these guys. I just hope they get fed well & looked after.",

LMAO Any chance the pigeon was actually a super spy? or in this case super junkie?",

      "body": "How can we smuggle in drugs to a prison? This question just has endless possibilities. I could not stop laughing, a pigeon caught smuggling crystal meth in a prison. Drug smuggling gone Harry Potter style; with this inmate has a pigeon rather than a phoenix. What a well thought out plan, however the pigeon probably lacked more training to get to its owner that right way. I can't even stop laughing at the fact that the guards had to set up traps to catch the pigeon. Now that is a show for the prisoners. I just hope that Bird does get compensated for his work, he made it his destination, now that the inmate should have been there.",
