  "content": "BOXING DAY PREDICTIONS - DECEMBER, 26, 2022Hey guys, in the aftermath of Christmas eve, the famous Boxing day is coming, so here are some tips!Middlesbrough - WiganThe home team is extremely motivated after winning four of the six games played in the league. In this match, they should try to add three more points. It is worth mentioning that Wigan Athletic is going through a rough phase, especially when playing away. That said, it will not be surprising to see Middlesbrough ending up winning.Middlesbrough to WINRotherham - StokeI expect to see a balanced match, however, the two teams have shown great football, with a very offensive strategy in place. This way I expect to see the two teams scoring.Both Teams ScoreSunderland - BlackburnSunderland is playing with the comfort of their fans' support, however, Blackburn Rovers has achieved very interesting results. It is worth mentioning that Blackburn won the last two games against Sunderland. This way, it's expectable that the visiting club will be able to demonstrate its quality and end up winning at least a draw. That said, I will risk a value bet on this one.Draw at HalftimeBrentford - TottenhamTottenham should be hard to crack, however, Brentford can take advantage of its fans' support to conquer another good result in this condition. This way, an open match is foreseen, with several goal opportunities, on both sides.Both Teams ScoreLet me know your predictions!",

Well boxing is an another unpredictable sport or game. So I won't say Middlesbrough  will win Wigan and also I can't say WWW (Wigan will win) the match. For Rotherham vs Stoke. Stoke is a good boxer but let see how it going to be. Sunderland vs Blackburn and Brentford vs Tottenham these two matches will be an another tough matches in the night.",

That said, it will not be surprising to see Middlesbrough ending up winning.Middlesbrough to WINMiddlesbrough comes into this game with a defeat in their last game, this is not something that leaves a team motivated, I understand that their opponent was a very strong team and that they are in the first position, but they conceded 3 goals, one of which goals they conceded was an own goal, so I'm afraid if they are really motivated in this game, wingan is not a strong team, but given the fact that Middlesbrough are coming from a defeat I would say that wigan can have a great chance to get a draw in this gameQuote from: Blawpaw on December 25, 2022, 01:46:01 PMRotherham - StokeI expect to see a balanced match, however, the two teams have shown great football, with a very offensive strategy in place.

That said, I will risk a value bet on this one.Draw at Halftimethis is a very complicated game and in my opinion I would not bet on a game like this, these two teams are unstable, both teams do not inspire confidence, so betting on this game even if it is on this market that you have chosen still seems too risky to meQuote from: Blawpaw on December 25, 2022, 01:46:01 PMBrentford - TottenhamTottenham should be hard to crack, however, Brentford can take advantage of its fans' support to conquer another good result in this condition. This way, an open match is foreseen, with several goal opportunities, on both sides.Both Teams ScoreTottenham has been a team that concedes goals, in their last games it was really rare to see Tottenham do a game without conceding goals, with their very weak defense so I hope they concede a goal, but Tottenham's advantage is that they manage to score goals, so BTTS seems to me to be a good betting optionI have a question: do you intend to make a multi bet or will you make single bets?",

I would only go for multi-bets if I was looking for sure bets that had value. My strategy goes to look for the best odd (always above x2) for the most probable outcome, so using multi-bet would only increase the risk and it would not be worth it for the potential profits you could get.",

This way, an open match is foreseen, with several goal opportunities, on both sides.Both Teams ScoreLet me know your predictions!As I predicted earlier, Tottenham will have difficulty starting their matches in the second half of this season. I bet for scores above 2.5 goals. and yes, the match ended in a 2-2 draw. whereas, Brentford took the lead in the 15th minute and added his goal in the 54th minute of the second half. fortunately, Tottenham were able to equalize to a draw. with this result, Tottenham avoided defeat and dropped points.The next game tonight is Aston Villa vs Liverpool. Aston Villa will host Liverpool at Villa Park, their own headquarters. on this occasion, it is certain that Emiliano Martines will be absent as Aston Villa goalkeeper. even so, Unai Emery will target full points considering Liverpool's performance is not in its best condition. on the other hand, several Liverpool players will be absent in this game such as Firmino, Luiz Diaz, and that will definitely be a problem for Jurgen Klopp's troops. however, Liverpool still have Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez who are expected to perform at their best. my estimation in this match, Liverpool will win this match with a score of 1-2.",

I only managed to get a winning prediction between Sunderland and Blackburn. Well, I had thoughts that Middlesbrough would win but I was not that confident which made me disregard my supposed bet on that match. Quite happy with the outcome of my bet 'coz the amount is decent. Simply proves that if you cannot risk your money, never expect for high returns. I've as well never engaging to multiple bets because the chances of winning becomes small as per ratio. My strategy still is to bet only when my 'points of the match' are in line with the odds or simply betting only if I have a bigger chance to make a winning prediction (more of playing it safely). Congrats to those winning predictions!",
