Not sure why you'd want to use indicators on coins/tokens that are illiquid though.",

I already tried searching \"MEX:\" on tradingview but was not found.If you are asking about this coin MEX - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mex, then according to the rating data, this coin is not traded anywhere. Also, this coin is not tracked by the Coinmarketcap rating. For this reason, you can't find it on Tradingview either. In addition, the coin you specified is not listed on the MEXC exchange - https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/",
