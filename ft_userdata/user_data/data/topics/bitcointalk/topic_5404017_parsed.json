I think that you can try to take a look on it. I cant believe that there is a site of that name being run on the internet for shitcoins in real. In all seriousness, these coins are never going to get quoted on CMC or CGecko which means that even searching or attempting to accumulate them over time is a futile venture. Only the bagholders who got those coins at very cheap prices will dump their coins one fine day and the enthusiastic owners will be suffering the losses.QuoteThe reputation of poocoin among the shit token users were good enough.Â   For such insight, take a bow sir, take a bow.",

Coinmarketcap and coingecko already can supply you that. But Im not sure if there are sites that focus only on this but instead providing general or all infos on different coins and tokens they listed.In some telegram group there are signals and update but for a site that only look on that not really sure. There is category anyway on coingecko for different group might wanna check if there is shitcoin list only.",

They're not entirely dedicated to it but they have the lists for it.Just like what were posted, they create a certain section and classification for those type of projects so that a visitor would have to looked it easily through that tab.Although OP looks for certain only for it, poocoin would be the most ideal of it if OP really bothers to see only shitcoins.",

If the project are able to pay the fees to get listed on Coingecko and Coinmarketcap, fulfill the requirements etc, it will be listed. Currently there's around 20K coins listed on those sites, it's full of shitcoins. There's only 3 genuine coins AFAIK e.g. Bitcoin, Monero, and DAI. The rest 99% are just shitcoins and shouldn't be listed.",

Hundreds till thousands of shit coins going dead in every season once the market became the bearish trend. Most of shit tokens were also sending so many applications to the CG and CMC as well. All of crypto tracking sites were also able to be used to track the shit coins. These days after CMC already acquired by binance and it has become a free listing site. Shit scam coin developers were able listing their coins on CMC for free.",
