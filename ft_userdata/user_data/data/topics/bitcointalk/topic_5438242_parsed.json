  "content": "Numbers and % here is how.Do you know why successful people attracting successful people. Every successful specially self Made person have lost the part of their soul.Every time when you go through hardships and lose nervous and taking risks you fail you get emotional scrafs.AT the beginning you have 100% soul when you go through hard times in order to learn discover and improve you lose a bit of the your soul.The law attrecation law Will ensure that people with similar background Will get along well.The bigger success you want the bigger part of your soul you have to give away.That's why people who live regular average lifes without fame success and wealth and power are happy becouse they got left most of the soul energy with them.How we measure this: For example people who have lost 10% only their soul Will get along very well with people who have lost 10% Same ammount it means they have not much risked not much sacraficed and not much failed.So If you see medium type of people who Lost about 40-50% of their soul they get along with other who are Same.The ultra wealthy powerul or famous people they probably have lost like 70%-90% of their soul so that's why they get along very well with Same people like they are.And how you know how much you been Lost of your soul ? It's Simple, you just look the people who you get along very well after your hardships or Desire to get successful If they Are richer then you it means you are about to get to the Same level as they Are Even If you not so high level on social status or wealth class but If you start get along with them usually they Are with similar wealth and status so it means If keep the relation with them you Are about to get Same wealth or status in your life.World works by law of attraction so the same ones Will attract each others that's why the famous hollywood stars or Donald trump Will associate with people who have likely Same Soul energy.In other words soul group of losses of 10% people Will associate with 10% Souls with 50% Will associate with 50% Souls of losses 70-90% Will associate with Same the 70%-90% those people are most well known actors political leaders stars or other high perfomance people they have one thing in common a lot hardships a lot losses a lot failures and a lot hard working and they need more to be happy in their lifes becouse whenyou lose so much of your soul it means u lose a lot energy wich Will help you to create happiness in you. And there is no other way and that's why you tend match withpeople who got losses of their soul energy Same or similar ammount that you have.",

I mean, any relationship where one person has vastly more power than the other isn't really healthy (and money is a proxy for power).Quote from: BADecker on February 05, 2023, 04:51:28 PMNumbers are an abstraction. They in no way fit reality.Numbers (and mathematical operations) help us to understand the world, how stuff relates to other stuff, how stuff works, etc. The modern world and all modern technology is built on understanding derived from numbers and mathematics.",

It can be physical, mental, or emotional, and it can be based on number of factors, such as mutual interests, physical appearance, personality, or shared values.",
