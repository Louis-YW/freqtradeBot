I wouldn't call them manipulators, but everything they said will have a good or bad effect on any market, or sort very influential. And I think they are not doing it on purpose, they have the numbers to back it up.So whatever statement they have, the data is there and so the market interpret it in either direction. Yeah, they are very powerful though, but not to the point that they wanted to manipulate the stock or crypto market, in my opinion.",

That's what they want you to believe  And they are super successful with this. 90% of monetary policy is talking, 10% is doing. They tell you they will be hawkish so you sell and limit spending. Its kinda self-fulfilling prophecy.Jeff Snider explain it in a simple way - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNa-fewraJA&t=36s&ab_channel=WhatBitcoinDidFED does not have tools to impact markets nor they even know what is going on and how money works. They have a tool to make you think they have tools What we will see in February 1st is a single day strong volatility that does not influence rest of the trading month. People get excited about huge dump/pump, not realizing its being eaten up in next 2 trading days and market continue to do its job going in direction it would go without announcement. We just have to look at wider picture and ignore the fact that market changed in a casino for 1 day a month. You will see trends that makes FED do what they do istead of gambling on single FED decision. Who cares if they will stop rising rates this time or after 3 months? They will do it sooner or later, inflation is already dumping. Market knows it and buys the dip. Will sell the top after FED pivot to guys who still wait for better times.",

They have a tool to make you think they have tools But surely that means they have the tools to impact markets if they can impact enough people in those markets.. I think some price movements, similar to research, are driven by many people having similar ideas on what they expect at about the same time (and that's something that comes across from the crypto market). People don't really behave that rationally either a lot of the time so intentional manipulation is hard to spot and isolate.An example of the above is how market prices don't go up by a stable amount over a long period of time. Instead, they go up and down ans find new neutral points as more money enters but fewer sells occur/are available (normally).",

As for unexpected decisions, they are what cause a lot of changes in the price.So the unexpected decisions of the Fed are what make real changes or have an impact on the price, but these unexpected decisions rarely happen.",

As I said. 10% doing 90% talking. So if talking is no longer working those 10% means nothing. And we see how its being played out last months. Powell is trying to be hawkish, raising rates, but market is pumping for last 3 months knowing that monetary system is totally out of FED control. They simply made everyone, who believes in their lies sell and now they just tilting at windmills. They control only those dollars that are on their balance sheet. They don't control whole Eurodollar system which is cashless and reserveless (offshore dollars). Simply too many identities all over the world can put new units into circulation. USD is out of control. Especially out of fed control. \"Since the Eurodollar market is not run by any government agency its growth is hard to estimate. However, the Eurodollar market is by a wide margin the largest source of global finance. In 1997, nearly 90% of all international loans were made this way\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EurodollarTry to controll that mr Powell.",

And where is the manipulation?If your government decides on the 17th that it will cut 100k jobs and needs to devaluate the currency is it manipulation of the market or is it simple action taken to ensure the boat doesn't sink? That's one of the roles of the FED, of conducting national monetary policy, that's what it was designed for and this is how it acts when needed, of course it will influence the markets with such decisions because it was supposed to do so!Too many see that one decision influences the market and think it's some kind of manipulation behind the scene when in fact it's quite clear how they do it why they do it. The market reacts so because just with every trade they are gambling on future prices, and a high increase in rates would normally slow down growth, but here we have optimism that even the increased rate is going up by less than it could and that it's nearing peak so the opposite happens.",
