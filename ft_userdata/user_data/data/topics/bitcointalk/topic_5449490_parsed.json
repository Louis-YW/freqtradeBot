      "body": "Do you a part of oscar team swap or what? is not it better to create your announcement thread? I never heard this one in arbitrum ecosystem. Im very often to hear arbiswap rather than oscar swap. it's likely brand new decentralized exchange site. It seemss like that there are no lots of user in this platform. I just see that based on the liquidity. Why don't you make a partnership with arbitrum foundation to prove your service was legit?",

      "body": "Lol. If you want to effectively introduce your project here, please do it properly and in an appealing manner. I think you should instead create an announcement thread detailing Oscar Swap's features and why people should use it. But with how you presented Oscar Swap, I think I immediately disregard the platform. I think it is not worth any trust. You started describing a platform that accordingly provides a solution to certain problems, but you ended up promising to turn 1 dollar into a hundred dollars. You are offering an investment with 500% APR. Those are serious red flags. Would you care to justify them?",

So what you are trying to promote is SCAMMMMM.Are you from the developer team?",

You can do an instant swap (max 3-6 sec) for less than a dollar using Pancake Swap and BSC network.500% apy changes $100  into $1.5 million in just 6 years. Explain to me why anyone would pay such high interest rates when they might as well borrow from a bank? Where will the money come from to pay 1.5 million after 6 years to everyone who had $100? Who will pay that? Who will lose in this trade? I guess anyone who believes in this scam..",

      "body": "500 APR or more is real. But the real question there is the stability. Apparently high APR tends to go down as per users shares increases on the pool. Thats normal and happening to a lot of projects. So the percentage here isnt really a good offer especially if its a new launch project. I think many will be discourage by that, or pick other new finance defi instead of that. By any chance? Ate you a promoter or shiller of this project oscarswap?",

The surprising part of it is that offering 500 percent APR, is this to attract investors or people's attention? Are you among the project team or founder with the way you wrote about them there is a hidden plans towards this content you created.Anyone investing is liable for their lost because i see no quality or value for someone to use this swap while we have reputable swap and dex over there to be used. BE WARNED!!!",
