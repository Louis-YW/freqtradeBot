Everyone will have to invest based on their capacity. You don't expect people to deprive themselves of basic needs of life because you want to buy Bitcoin. But I get you point OP, we need to pay some price to ensure that we accumulates as we can. If it will cost us to reduce our expenses or taking addition job to buy Bitcoin, I think it is worth it.

But it will not be bad to buy Bitcoin using lump sum if the price drops drastically and you have the funds to invest. For salary earners applying monthly DCA strategy will be perfect.",

Hope it goes down, more and more to have cheaper price for their entry but when things goes exactly like they hoped, they turn to be fearful and worry that price will go down more than their expected entry.They ignore good prices and feel regret when market recovers from bottom area. Then they hope to see a correction to buy in but such wanted correction might never come. Even it comes, it's likely they will be fearful again.They usually join the market after Disbelief phase and even in late of Euphoria phase.Psychology of market cycles",

I remember the topics telling them (or rather fooling them) into believing price is going down as low as $15k so they waited and refused to buy. That means they are very greedy. The reason I said that is because bitcoin still fall below $20000. I can remember that bitcoin got to $15500. That was in December 2022. But such people may still think that bitcoin price will continue to fall lower and their expectations may fall to bitcoin will fall below $10000. Even if bitcoin fall below $10000, they may not still buy and expect the price to fall further. Later they will be blaming themselves after the price increase. Bitcoin stayed below $16000 many days before it started increasing in January 2023 when bull run started at the time.",

Still, for a decent profit, you might have to wait for several years because, on average, Bitcoin bear cycle takes around 3 years (here by \"bear\" I mean being well below the former ATH).That being said, some might say that it's unreasonable to put all eggs in one basket, and that it's better to diversify one's investments. I don't think diversifying within the crypto market makes much sense, but one can be reasonably interested in different assets like bonds or real estate, too.",

I am not disputing the fact that there will be corrections in the market but delaying to invest into bitcoin because the price is increasing is taking two risk; 1. This price you think is high might be the lowest we will ever experience and you could be missing out big time. 2. Not investing means you might be leaving your funds on inflationary assets like fiat which is a loss on its own or except you have it on other stores of value.

ANYONE who ever bought Bitcoin up to 2 weeks ago.....and HODL'd them are now in profit! even the ones who FOMO'd in just before the previous ATH 2 years ago which there are very few if any, all I would say FUD'd out as the price plummeted when DCA would have been a better option.Quote from: Stablexcoin on March 14, 2024, 12:00:56 PMWhat I'm saying is that as much as it's important to buy based on our financial capacity, it's also good to put in additional effort to starch more in our portfolio if we are interested in making a good profit from our holdings.

Yes people are working hard to earn money so that they can invest in bitcoin. Little money from 100$ below in bitcoin is not worth keeping because it is risky. If the price of bitcoin goes down drastically the $100 worth bitcoin will worth nothing by then. If oke needs to invest in bitcoin he should hold nothing less than a thousand dollars in bitcoin. This advice is for a good reason, no one knows how the price movement will be during the having and some persons dont even afford up to $100 a month and you expect them to hold bitcoin even if it is a fraction. How long will it take them to reach $1000 in bitcoin?",
