  "content": "Here once again I am come back to the old topic  I think they are continuously stealing my data even then reinstalling the OS , for more clearout kindly visit my this topic help needed I got attacked by hacker???Now they are attacking again. I think they have set some virus files on my drive that act as brokers as you can see in the pictures below. Runtime Broker is opening with almost every important software, and besides where I only have two or three tabs open in the browser here it shows around ten and more tabs opened. Two questions came to my mind while opening this thread and that is As Runtime broker has been made by Microsoft so it's not supposed to be harmful!But again, broker running with each software in an unusual way and logging out of the software or suspending the software is also suspicious.I had also tried to delete that file via the cmd command but the command denied  Now what can be the solution, they are already starting to access many of my exchangers and wallets. Besides, Google accounts are trying a lot to get access. If I install the operating system again, and if the same problem occurs, I request all of you to help with a permanent solution, If any antivirus works then suggest it. Thanks to all.",

      "body": "since that problem always comes back to you, I assume that the malicious file is somewhere in your documents, the ones you don't delete when reinstalling the OS. or maybe you always install some application that you are used to using, and with it, you also get this malware.You need to know, RuntimeBroker.exe is a regular Microsoft process, and it is in the folder where you tried to delete it C:\\Windows\\System32\\.It often happens that malicious software uses the same name as Microsoft processes in order to make their recognition more difficult, so check location C:\\WINDOWS\\(computer name)\\RuntimeBroker.exe and it is probably that harmful file. (Enable show hidden files)Also, try to scan the system and all your files with some Malware removal tools. I would use several different ones.edit: every time when download some unusual software from an unverified site, I must first test it through Virustotal.",

There are viruses that are attacking the hardware and if you've reinstalled/reformatted your PC already and yet it still exists.You need to replace your hard drive or ssd.Windows 10 has windows defender, try to scan it there first and if nothing has been found, use another anti-virus like malwarebytes or eset nod32.",

Runtime broker is a legit Microsoft Windows process is responsible for managing the permissions for the apps you download from Microsoft Store.More info: What Is Runtime Broker (runtimebroker.exe) Process Doing On My Windows 10 PC?Also, seeing multiple runtime broker processes in the task manager is something normal.Use a better OS for managing your funds and wallets other than windows, as advised.",

I believe if you take all of this procedures and follow up with the guidelines, you would be absolutely free from all of this",

      "body": "As said above, do a virus scan. If you've got something important you really need, back it up before on a brand new drive and dump the drive somewhere for if and when you need it (and try not to use it and when you do pull your hard drive out and run a live os to plug it into - the easiest way to do this is to burn a ubuntu ISO to a new DVD). Once you've run a virus scan, backup anything you don't want to lose (after you've backed up everything you want or need to keep in the step above). You could also wait a while before accessing your files as there's a greater chance antivirus software has spotted the threat in 6 months if it's something quite new (they're more likely to be able to have heuristic detection too by then). If you've caught a lot of viruses over the years then you'll be better off getting a separate machine for handling money and one for installing random things/visiting untrusted websites.

It's really simple to do now (as long as your processor is compatible) and you can get free versions of most major operating systems now (including Windows).",

In my opinion you should follow these steps:Firstly install the os again After that without inputting any kind of info/data in your computer brought a good paid Antivirus , you can also choose from below. Bitdefender Webroot  Norton Abine BlurAvast AntiTrackAnd if you find something then remove thoseEven then antivirus is not worked then format your drive or for backup use a new storage device.",

I think you can find out how many and which Linux distributions exist on Wikipedia. There are so many user-friendly systems for the average user that will work right out of the box. Look for examples like MX Linux or Mint. It is difficult to describe all the advantages of such systems in one post, but the first thing you can try is to see how they work by first installing one of them on a virtual machine, such as VirtualBox. On it, it was possible to practice the installation of Linux.As for your Windows system, bought for 40 cents, it's hard to say whether it is licensed, even allowing for updates.",

It's one of the user-friendly distributions of Linux for someone new to Linux. I personally use it. It's also easier to get help or support from other members in different forums if you happen to get a problem as compared to other distros.Creating a bootable CD or USB plus installation is very easy if you follow instructions from different YouTube videos.Best of it.
