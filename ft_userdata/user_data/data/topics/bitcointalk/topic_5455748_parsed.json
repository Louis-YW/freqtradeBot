  "content": "I've been using TOR for some time now in order to access the forum. However, almost every few hours, I get the following error:QuoteOnionsite Has DisconnectedDetails: 0xF2 — Introduction failed, which means that the descriptor was found but the service is no longer connected to the introduction point. It is likely that the service has changed its descriptor or that it is not running.This is only specific to browsing the forum. If I open a new tab when that error appears and browse other communities/websites I'm still able to access them freely and without any problem. Usually I get this error fixed by resetting my identity in the browser but that is a bummer considering that I lose every tab open at the time.Has anyone faced this problem before?",

Perhaps BitMaxz is right and this has to due with some kind of overload on the Tor network. I just find it odd that it only happened (so far) whenever I'm browsing the forum.",

I wasn't aware of this shortcut and concept, it just worked the last time that this error appeared. I'll close this thread today if nothing more appears to discuss regarding this topic as surelly I won't be the last one with this problem...Quote from: joker_josue on June 09, 2023, 06:50:14 AMTaking the opportunity, do you have any sense of the genre like TalkImg?I know that some users sometimes wait a while to open the page, having to close the tab and open it again.  It mostly depends on the time of the day that I try to access the website. About 1 ago I was getting the message \"One moment we're checking...\" but it was only one time and it quickly disappeared. I guess it has to due with how many users are accessing the website at the time of my request.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on June 09, 2023, 10:03:43 AMQuote from: RickDeckard on June 08, 2023, 11:50:07 AMHas anyone faced this problem before?
