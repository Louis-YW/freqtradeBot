On this point, you can focus on the bitcoin price, the markets, and its evolution.2.-Bitcoin as a Technology. Here we can talk about Blockchain Technology and how a decentralized project was successful.3.-Bitcoin as Data Base.

You shouldn't dive into other topics such as inflation in so much detail if you are just going to introduce bitcoin through it.

It might be better to discuss Bitcoin alone than to relate it with inflation and other economic factors. There are many concepts to discuss in Bitcoin that are very important for your readers to learn. Quote I need some more suggestions from you, please advise me what else I should add:It is important to know your targeted readers because it will help to know what to include in the book. However, the history of Bitcoin should be included, discussion about wallets, the Bitcoin cycle, wallet security, the difference between Bitcoin and fiat, the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins, etc. Reading some good books about Bitcoin such as the Whitepaper, Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, etc, will help you identify areas your book should cover.",

You may have mentioned inflation but I don't see inflation related to bitcoin. Inflation applies to the country's economy. Bitcoin is being used with the advancement of blockchain technology.I think inflation and bitcoin has a relationship as bitcoin is often used to fight against the very said inflation. It is also something that bitcoin is protected against at due to its limited supply.However as a whole, inflation doesn’t have much anything to do with bitcoin anymore. There are a lot of other features that bitcoin has that doesn’t necessarily concern inflation like for example decentralization and privacy.To me decentralization is the fundamental of bitcoin so it would be nice if you also explained that part in your book.",

Most of the ideas you have here are readily available on goggle search engine and wouldn't be too useful for most folks who might be interested in your work. First off, it's necessary that you know everything there is to know about what you're writing so while writing it, you won't find deficulty conveying your message and information in a readable and easy to understand manner.In addition to this, one way to do well at things is to start the work first off then along the line, you can look at how far you've gone and put in the effort to go above the extent of your work. You need to have written some sort of a prototype and then you can tell us how far that is and then we can continue from that point in giving you better suggestions.",

As you can see, the idea of blockchain as a database is a complex topic, not all the community agrees on that point, but i mentioned it because more than ordinals, you can see all the blocks and transactions in the blockchain, and you can request that information at any time. So, i hardly believe that blockchain can be implemented as a database with the feature that users can't modify the data on it. But good luck with the book, and let us know when is out, i would love to read it.",
