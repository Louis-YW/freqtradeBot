I prefer to read discussions about a crypto event or news on this forum, that way you get to discuss and read views from different users and not just the opinion of one person who published an article.Millions of people visit their sites for cryptocurrency news and updates. Forbes as a high DA site often ranks on Google's first page, exposing the site to more crypto readers. Sites as large as Forbes may only care about the crypto traffic not the quality of the message they write. Moreover, they also make a killing from guest posters seeking backlinks. And most guest writers don't put enough effort into their craft. The goal is the backlink. I fear that the top DA sites will soon fill up search engines with poorly constructed cryptocurrency articles. Cryptocurrency learners will then have to read articles written by writers who do not fully understand the subject.",

If Bitcoin hits $100k, I can almost guarantee it will shoot up in search engines, not as much as Bitcoin going less than $20k, but positive news still gets traction.

Do you think Forbes News is losing its quality or being careless about what they publish?This is inferior or quack Journalism. Most of these high-ranked news outlets have cut down on the number of employees and replaced them with bots. The available workers may have to overwork themselves to cover their heavy workload. This is why replacing humans with artificial intelligence tools will cause more harm than good. It could also be that the workers in charge of creating headings and proofreading news are not qualified or well-supervised. A news outlet will lose quality easily if it begins to publish fake news. But in this case, it is just a nonchalant attitude from a few employees that can be easily corrected. It wouldn't take a qualified team of editors and proofreaders a long time to develop unique and catchy news headings.

I agree that it looks like excessive usage, but there's no reference point there regarding the percentage of publications about Bitcoin having that in the title and/or percentage of \"braced for\" being used for other business and financial news there. Without this information, it's hard to make an assessment of what it's about and how to react to it. In any case, I agree with the sentiment that people should be vigilant and monitor the quality of the news they consume.",
