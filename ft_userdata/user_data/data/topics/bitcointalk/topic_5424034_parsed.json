  "content": "BlockFi filed for bankruptcy on Monday because of its connection with FTX. The cryptocurrency lending firm claimed that FTX is its second-largest creditor after Ankura Trust, with $275m owed on a loan.BlockFi also documented in its filing that it owes money to more than 100,000 creditors. With no capital or liquidity buffers like traditional lenders, nobody knows what would be the fate of these investors.

I imagine that when the problems started and there was a downturn, the market already discounted the possible bankruptcy. Anyway, one more chapter in this sad story. As what does not kill us makes us stronger, let's hope that all these events serve to strengthen the ecosystem.Its funny you mention the ecosystem getting stronger, because I feel the price not getting affected could be a reflection of investors not reacting. Investors constantly sell or buy based on news and current events, and a strong ecosystem is full of strong hands. The first 50 headlines about this exchange falling and that exchange falling is tiring to me. It makes me glad I don't put my money on exchanges. It makes me glad that my money is etched onto metal in the form of 24 words, hidden from the adversaries that exist in life.Well I believe getting stronger mean not being affected by the same news.¬† What you stated is an example of getting stronger, since the Bitcoin market resistance to dump whenever there is this kind of bad news seems getting tougher.Quote from: SeeBiscuit on November 29, 2022, 06:12:04 AMDoes anyone know more about the FTX hacker swapping ETH to BTC? Is it affecting the price of BTC? ETH? Haven't have any update on the swapping but if ever ETH is dumped for BTC, it is obvious that ETH price will somehow plummet a bit while BTC price is somehow getting pumped slightly since the one in demand here is BTC and the one in sell off is ETH.",

Check the 1h candles of ETH/BTC pair from 20th november, when the hacker first started swapping his eth for renBTC,(SOURCE). We fell from 0.0725 to almost 0.0685 BTC per eth, around 5% fall. Meanwhile, ironically even BTC fell down 1000$ points (from 16.7k to 15.7k and even a bit below that time so the hacker caused a chain of panic attack on eth which had subsequent effect on btc as well. But now you can see, eth/btc got back up to pre-dump levels caused by the hacker üòù.  I believe even if someone dumps all the eth, the exchange trading bots get affected and cause a dump on btc as well although the reaction may be short-lived but you cant ignore the facts!Quote from: Poker Player on November 29, 2022, 05:50:40 AMThe odd thing is that the price has not been affected. The main reason is blockfi already got rekt once before and was bailed out, so people are getting used to this sh*t.",

Use exchange for said purpose and pull your coins ASAP after. Even best to use a separate virtual box or computer if you have the funds that you only do crypto transactions and banking from. Keep your wallet safe, ALWAYS have a backup and a few backups actually in-case a drive goes dead and your computer. I think there will continue to be more fallout but it wont have much more effect on this market. The market cap is so much bigger then all this but it def hurts the retail guys like us and makes ppl scared and weary of crypto and investing which is not good.

BlockFi should have already died in the middle of the crypto winter months ago along with Terra, 3AC, Voyager, and others. During that terrible period in the market, the price has already fallen down a lot. So, this bankruptcy now is already treated as inevitable. It was just a matter of time.When FTX crumbled down all of a sudden, the market situation couldn't get worse. So whether BlockFi's second life would end shortly thereafter, the market won't care anymore. FTX's fall is already huge enough that any effect on the price must have already taken into consideration its expectedly strong ripple effect. What's surprising is that there are still a lot of people who have funds stuck in BlockFi. What were they thinking? It was already half-sinking months ago.",
