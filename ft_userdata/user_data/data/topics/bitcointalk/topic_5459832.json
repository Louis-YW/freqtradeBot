  "content": "Remember the big Ponzi Bitconnect and learn from the past.At the height of the Bitcoin hype in late 2017, one company in the cryptocurrency sector was almost as much the talk of the town as its illustrious representative. BitConnect (then the sector's seventh-largest capitalization) was at its peak on December 28, 2017, and one BCC (BitConnect's stock symbol) was traded for $477. Bitconnect's market capitalization soared to $3 billion. But on January 17, everything came crashing down: the site abruptly shut down and thousands of investors were left out in the cold. Some had put their life savings into it ¬†A classic Ponzi pyramid: a fraudulent financial scheme in which customers' investments are remunerated by funds provided by new entrants. BitConnect then exchanges bitcoins for its BCC \"cryptocurrency\", while promising a return on investment at a fixed rate over several months. The more money you leave locked up, the higher the return. In this type of scheme, if the scam isn't discovered, it eventually comes to light when too many investors claim their stakes at the same time. This is what happened at the end of January 2018, when most cryptocurrencies experienced a severe correction.\"Influencers:\": BitConnect created a sponsorship and affiliation system. Influential Twitter and YouTube personalities advise beginners to give BitConnect a try, while pocketing a 7% commission. This short documentary shows people being scammed => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thMP0ZpGlDwI remember that at the time I couldn't understand how you could exchange btc for this unknown currency ¬†(BCC). I didn't understand why people were so trustfull in staking for so long. Then I didn't understand how you could put your life's savings into a single cryptocurrency (unless it is bitcoin, that's my opinion).And yet it's happening all over again. People don't seem to learn from the past.",

Moreover I couldn‚Äôt blame them because it is even stated clearly by some that any investor should take caution.

And should anything bad happen to bitcoin as was the fear for diversification then the entire crypto space might collapse.

This is why is better to make ones research before investing in anything.Quotehow you could put your life's savings[/b] into a single cryptocurrency (unless it is bitcoin, that's my opinion).Nothing in this life is 100% sure. Impossibility sometimes become possible. Try diversify your earning to save your money and investment. If all your investment is on Bitcoin and you plan to hold for long but accidentally Bitcoin price now dropped heavily and you need money urgently at the moment. What will happen?

Because AFAIK, BCC is flopped/rug-pulled and I also do know there are huge amounts of tokens and new projects that are still rug-pulling. So to which project are you referring to? And i do agree that such projects are ponzi schemes that offer huge returns but to the question of why people always fall prey to them is very simple.Venture capitalists attract new or I would say newbie investors towards new projects and most of the projects are DeFi. And once they reached their fund capital limit they rug pulled with investors' money. I know not all VCs are meant to attract newbie investors but in most cases, they are just insiders. The point is, we should avoid from such schemes that promise huge return which looks unbelievable. By doing so, we could save our money and tbh i am against all the staking types instead of one with no fixed apy or returns but still, i do not prefer anyone to do staking.",

Then I didn't understand how you could put your life's savings into a single cryptocurrency (unless it is bitcoin, that's my opinion).And yet it's happening all over again. People don't seem to learn from the past.I still remember this incident back in 2017. Back then, I was just a newcomer, and still learning crypto. At that time, this coin Bitconnect is starting to get hyped because of it's insane returns to it's investors. They even made a meme about Bitconnect. Overall, this was the hyped coin until the shit happened when the developers of the team just ran away, and in just a matter of hours, the price of it went down from 3 digits to 2 digits. Though it didn't stop there because there are still newbies out there who believed that something good will still happen, in the end the developers ran away, and left these investors with a shitcoin.There are reasons why back then, people are risking even their life savings. Those juicy returns back then are just very attracting for newbies, and back then, cryptocurrency as a whole is just starting to get it's attention, so they invested into it, threw their life savings hoping that it will yield more money for them. Unfortunately, their life savings turned into a waste, and correct me, but there are also investors who committed suicide because of this scam. Why it's still happening? There are some reasons as to why it's still happening. There are still reasons as to why there are still people who are still getting scammed after what's happening in the past.1. There are some investors who didn't know what's scam, and what's not. There are still investors who can't distinguish which projects have the potential to scam investors, and which projects hasn't. There are some investors who don't know the red flags of a particular projects, and they're just throwing their money into that project hoping that they will get huge profits into it. Sounds stupid, but it's the reality.2. People loves risk. I know, I know there are some who might be against it, but there are investors who still want to risk their money even though they know that the chances of it to be a scam project is really high. I just don't know why there are investors like this. Anyway, researching is always a good thing to do before investing.",

One of my relative joined this community, depositing some money, but after few months of explanation and argument with me, I can finally assure him that it's a ponzi scam, he finally withdraw his money, about few months before the Bitconnect fall. Anyway most people in here never learn from the Bitconnect, after Bitconnect, there are several similar scam, and people still invest in it, some of the scam falsely claiming as crypto but it's not, and people still believe in it, and the more shocking thing is that they are the same people that are fooled by Bitconnect and previous scam project. I really surprise that they still have money after all those thing.I'm completely ignorant regarding the BitConnect scam, but I'm now reading that approximately 800 users were refunded, but the number of users that were reimbursed sounds too small.The issue is that such scams and Ponzi schemes are giving cryptocurrencies a bad name because people tend to associate them with the scam itself. Cryptocurrency-related scams are also easier to recreate due to privacy reasons, which enables such projects to pop up and disappear within a few days. This, however, isn't a valid excuse because the internet is full of scams and has always been like that; it's just that people who are against cryptocurrencies tend to focus on the negative aspects, which are the scams that involve cryptocurrencies.",
