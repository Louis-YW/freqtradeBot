Because you mentioned these coins in your last thread?Quote from: Loco1887 on April 26, 2022, 10:19:59 AMEthereum (ETH)Solana (SOL)Avalanche (AVAX)Polygon (MATIC)ApeCoin (APE)Moonbeam (GLMR)Acala Token (ACA)Astar (ASTR)Acala Token (ACA) and Astar (ASTR) can fall in price very much. The reason is that these are relatively new projects and there have not yet been strong declines, when early investors are fixed. So buying such new projects now, especially at such an uncertain time, could leave you stuck in \"perpetual investor\" status for a long time. When a new project comes out, it is preferable to wait until the initial unloading of large volumes by early investors and then pick up such projects at the bottom, rather than on a HYIP.",

The rest may not be analyzed too deeply. I do not really like to divide the portfolio into many divisions. Apart from avoiding the swelling of certain values from 5, you can still take short-term profits and shift them to Bitcoin.",

If a good project has come to this time, it will be filled, if the market continues in a red way, it will not be held too long and sales will come. At these times, it would be best to wait in fiat money. Even if the opportunities are less, good timing can make good money. That's why we need to be a little more fluid rather than choosing a single coin.",

I usually avoid investing into projects where early investors already made a x50 or even more with it, but when a real bear market hits and those projects are down more than 50% of their ATH again then it might be a good point to invest into them. Of course you never know if those projects keep on falling a lot from the point where you bought in but we just have to live with that as it is almost impossible to hit the perfect time for investing.I have to say it think that all of your listed coins are ok for an investment, i personally would not invest into ApeCoin though.",
