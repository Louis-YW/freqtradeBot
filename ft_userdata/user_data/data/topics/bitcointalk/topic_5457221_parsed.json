I checked your site and tried to get your vision. I really don't have any criticisms about the interface of the site and the design in general.Excuse me for my frankness, but I don't really see anything special, especially if I try to answer the following questions:- What problem will your project solve?- What is the need for Token in the Process?- Assuming that there are answers to the two questions above, what is the difference between you and the rest of the projects working on the same vision?- Uniswap is a decentralized platform and any currency can be easily listed on it. Do you have guarantees for users that the currency can reach centralized platforms where listing conditions are more efficient?",
