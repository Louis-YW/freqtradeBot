Obviously any truly early adopter would be so rich now that he wouldn't need to fake anything to be rich and do whatever he wants.Signed messages from early addresses are just pointing to frauds  like the https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/25/craig-wright-called-fraud-in-message-signed-with-bitcoin-addresses-he-claims-to-own/",

Individual or group. They have gifted us with this one thing that we admire now. We are just thankful to them. The idea and people working behind it has chosen to keep their identity a secret, so we should respect their decision. They have left us with this, and now it's our job to improve it for the next generation. Satoshi, Hal Finney! They are in the past. Let's just focus on the present and future.",

      "body": "im not savage. im just frank(direct. no huggy kissy love letters)the issue is when some idiots(and they earn the title) have had years on this forum to check block data, read code, see source data or re-read post history to get a more accurate account of events....  generally AMPLE opportunity to educate themselves and find real source data..and are reminded to actually back up their narrative if they come back lacking their research time after time. asked to come back with real verifiable data and not just social posts of previous screamers they idolise who also screamed the same crap. (thus infinity loop of echo chambers  without proof).. it is that point there.. if after being reminded to atleast try to learn more for themselves and others.. but all they can do is come back crying how they want to stick with their fantasy and just name call and find stupid excuses not to educate themselves or research for themselves.. then.. and only then..  yea they earn the titles i give themone thing i have seen in the past is if a group can start a myth going viral. it makes people echo it forward and that takes more effort of the community to then re-educate people about facts laterbut those that have been debunked. but come back a couple weeks later and try again playing an amnesia card. where it requires correcting them before their newest topic is sent viral about the same crap mentioned before. that needs to be nipped in the bud.and yea i dont care if im ruining their agendai see you done no harm, seems u asked a genuine noob question(but it would have been better to have done a search to see if your question was asked before(it has))but yea kinda needs to be nipped in the bud by helping you out with the answer quick and to the pointbefore certain social queens play it up as if there was a team behind the name to then push it to go viral(again)and which, if viral makes people think there was a team and where scammers abuse that viral cycle of \"group satoshi\". to then scam people(just in the last 3 weeks i seen 3 scammers pretend they were part of team satoshi and wanted to sell satoshi's stash)other topics like snake oil salesmen advertising crappy subnetworks \"as bitcoin\" which leads to scammers offering users free balance if they join that network and such.. yea. the greed is rife(certain groups dont want the past discussed as it goes against their agenda. they want their narrative to reign supreme for reasons i just explained)",

I'm of the opinion that Satoshi was just an ordinary computer scientist-- or maybe even a hobbyist, his C++ work wasn't professional-- who was hard working, and felt that electronic cash might fail if not designed with proper fundamentals. The guy is gone for good, maybe even not alive. Look forward.",
