Kindly avoid such practices as, it wouldn’t portray you in a positive way. Other than saying, ‘this is true’ and that be all, you could just pass or maybe say something about what you’re seeing, perhaps how is this true and any other opinion on the course.With respect to OP, one main reason why cryptos isn’t adorn by most is, the idea of decentralization. Government and governance is an organized body where power is centralized. Bitcoin conveys the idea of giving power back to the people and this isn’t an idea that the government ready want to accept. The only time power is given to the people is in the pools (elections). Still, the integrity of choices is still jeopardized.Government continues to view Bitcoin as an anti to fiat and with fiat being its product, it’s hard to expect there ease corporation.",

Crypto give people more financial freedom. They don't have to be dependant on local currency. They can send and receive money through crypto without local governments getting to control it.Some counties are scared of this freedom so the easiest way to prevent it is just to ban. It's a sad reality.",

If you see the people in your country much prefer digital currency which is Bitcoin than the country's own fiat currency, what do you think would be the impact to the economy? Of course it would affect the value of their own currency which eventually drop the economic status of the country. This reason why some of the country doesn't welcome and acknowledge Bitcoin cause of the risk, but some legalized it not only that it's actually convenient to do transaction globally, but the fact that they know the Bitcoin once converted to fiat, would eventually circulate to the market which could be a great news for the country.",

The way fiat can not be used to evade tax, bitcoin as well can not be used to evade tax. But in reality, some people are evading tax with fiat, which can make something like that possible with bitcoin. Bitcoin is having a transparent blockchain which is enough to serve the purpose of tracing tax evasion. What I think is the reason few countries ban bitcoin is because the government in such countries, which ban bitcoin wants to have full control over the financial system in the country.",

That is one of the characteristics of the government in almost all countries, Bitcoin cannot be touched and cannot be controlled, the other reason is just the government's hallucinations against the people. that's the logical reason.I am 100% sure, if Bitcoin could be controlled and touched, since Bitcoin first appeared it would have been legislated, maybe we would have seen the government's reasons for illegal crypto, However, for the reasons of full control that the government expects, if that is not possible they will not want to recognize Bitcoin legally, despite the fact that they use Bitcoin as a basis for investment and trading, transactions and so on.The government is cunning, if it's not profitable for them, anything can be illegal until they find a profit point for them, otherwise they will make Bitcoin illegal in their country forever, but in fact Bitcoin is growing rapidly in the country where it is illegal.",

I don't completely agree with some of the reasons often cited by governments for banning crypto as a means of payment, but governments have every right to regulate what is best for their own countries and financial systems.It will take a long time to study the positive and negative impacts of adopting crypto as legal tender if a country wants to adopt it. The government needs to learn from other countries that have adopted it first, but adopting crypto as a legal means of payment is not mandatory for every country. In fact, governments can still earn revenue by not legalizing crypto as legal tender, but they legalize trading and investment which allows them to regulate it with taxes.",

But they don't dare to say that directly to their people, and they find all kinds of nonsense reasons like you are mentioning to ban bitcoin and keep people away from it. But they seem to be gradually failing because as you also said, many governments have accepted and many governments have not accepted. In my opinion, over time all governments will also accept it because they cannot stop it.",

And it maintains privacy very nicely. As a result, there are many countries governments in the world, they will not be able to properly collect the additional tax imposed on the people.Moreover, the heads of state of the countries may have a misconception that these will only have a negative impact in our country, but in fact, their positive aspects are much more. Moreover, if these systems are implemented, many countries have dishonest leaders and dishonest businessmen, both of them will lose out on the illegal money they earn from the people. There can be many such reasons for declaring cryptocurrency or bitcoin illegal in countries.",
