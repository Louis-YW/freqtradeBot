Oh really, do you think you're the only one who can use Google and Youtube and make opportunities using AI, its already everywhere, and people will just waste their $50 for something they can check for free, whatever you have there if you can give us a glimpse or some information, its nothing and I don't think its better, for all we know it's just the same kinds of stuff we can all see being hype by these Youtubers .",

One thing I learned from scammers is if they claim or always stated that what they promote is not a scam, or it is real, it is a scam you forgot to highlight this in your post \"This is not some pity scam\" and \"this is 100% REAL\" scammers will try to make you believe that it's a real deal, a good method to make money that you stumble is something you share for free because you don't need more money and you are genuinely helping people, you're not selling it to make more money.",

Haha. I pointed it out in my post as well. Why do they have to sell those methods to make money when they can already do it themselves? There is a similar business. People sell trading signals from their telegram channel, youtube channel and many more. I always ask them, when you already know the market movement, why are you selling your signal instead of opening a position? They always shut up. Telegram investors also offer to invest $1K and get $10K after 24 hours. Why don't you do it yourself instead of looking for referrals?",

Telegram investors also offer to invest $1K and get $10K after 24 hours. Why don't you do it yourself instead of looking for referrals?  There are two type of users which fall in that scenario: 1The users who have genuinely developed a way to earn money, but they don't have enough capital to leverage their operations, and that's why those users prefer to get support from others and provide them the knowledge they have. Most of the entrepreneurs and sales persons always come from with some idea which they can't leverage without others help. However, very few of such users ever get any success in gaining potential referrals or users that could help them as well as their own selves. 2These type of users are often frauds or scammers who won't help others, but often loot their money. Most of the influencers fall in this category of users because they produce fake content to gain views mostly on social media platform like YouTube, and they really don't teach others a genuine way to earn some revenue, but fake it to earn a lot of money using Google AdSense program. They are very successful in their endeavors because people often blindly trust and follow such clowns without any investigation.Now back to @OP, if you really think that you have found a way that can make you a lot of money then you should not share it with us because we don't want to earn a lot of money in our dreams, and we aren't believers of the fictional stories. I recommend you to find another place to promote such methods as our community isn't interested in such type of earnings.",

Another day, another get rich on autopilot on autopilot scheme being advertised.My two cents:If the supposed AI chat works as advertised, you would have kept it to yourself and make money alone. If the AI works like you say it does, everyone would be rich but that's not the caee. Given your forum rank and reputation, you'd want to provide proof rather than simply typing few words and expecting people to line up and throw $50 at your feet.",

I don't know why he decided to put his contact here which looks somehow unnecessary to me. I hope he is going to get the kind of attention that he is looking for but I doubt it if anyone would want to send money to a strange person to learn from him on how to make money using AI. Unless if he decide to teach people to extend then later ask for money. It is very hard for people to believe and sell money to learn online without having glimpse of what one intend to learn.",

These scammers' business never stops because some greedy and blind people exist in this world who will always be looking for shortcuts to earn easy money and in the end, get scammed by these scammers.Even if there is a real earning and easy method to earn money, people will never sell that and they just make money out of it.  If anyone is selling a money making method, trust me he is making money only by selling a method that does not exist.",
