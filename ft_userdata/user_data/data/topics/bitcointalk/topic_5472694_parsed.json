      "body": "I find it funny that some websites of this kind expose themselves by their own. Without creating a page for License Information maybe it would be quite difficult for us to find clear evidence of their scam intentions. You can verify this on the following page: Code:https://www.pec168.vip/?s=article/index/id/24.html.It's so evident that all the documents provided here are fake and include many false names. The first license is about an e-commerce company that was created on 25th April 2023, which has no relation to their website.Beside that, and based on your description of how the website operates and its investment plans it appears more like a Ponzi scheme than a dropshipping website to me. There are no actual products to be seen or purchased it's just a picture, and you're essentially reselling to them with different price than what you buy it at the same platform.In conclusion this is definitely a scam.",

I am not sure if it is a scam or not but my guts are telling me that they are very suspicious, even looking at their \"licenses\" doesn't change that feeling, there is also very little information about the website. if you check the website on \"scam checkers\"(not sure how accurate they are) you are going to be more suspicious about the website, even the positive reviews on their trust pilot are extremely generic and suspicious. if I were you I would just avoid the website, not because I think it is a scam but because you can barely search anything about the website and for me that is a red flag.",

You have to purchase shop and then you will receive offer with high price of 110$ or 120$ and then buy another shop and sell high. What would make someone want to buy that store at 110? Inevitably, the reason will be that you were told that you will buy at a price of 110 and you will get a profit at a price of 120, and so on. In short, you are buying at a price that another party wants to sell. Since there is no project that generates income, this is more like pyramid marketing, where money is generated from the profits of other people  in the end the project disappears and runs away with the money.In an ideal case, the loss probability for these charts is 87% loss rate, but in the above case it is 100%.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme",

It's just a generic email - no real address, no phone number nothing.  All the signs point to this being one of those ponzi scheme deals masked as some hot new dropshipping opportunity and  you'd have to be crazy to put any trust or money into an operation this sketchy.  My advice?

Yep, not to mention that their company was registered recently, only earlier this year, and definitely not \"will renew its license in 2023\", they just established themselves on this very year... if we suppose this is their company and they're not simply stealing a random name from the UK registry.Quote from: ajiz138 on November 03, 2023, 03:48:54 PMAs risky as we see it here, you don't have to invest anything in the project.You might say it looks more legit because there is a legal license listed there, this is what we suspect because it is a little ambiguous that the site is not what it used to be, maybe they faked the license.What legal license is this?
