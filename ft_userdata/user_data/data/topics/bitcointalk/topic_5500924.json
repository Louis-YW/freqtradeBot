  "content": "I saw this topic earlier today . What if there's a bug no one has seen in Bitcoin? , which led me to start running research on the bitcoin bug and any potential exploitation history, and I came across this article on Binance News . 13 years ago, someone created 184.5 million bitcoins .  I later searched on the forum and came across this thread . Strange block 74638   confirmed that the entire story was true, but the incident was immediately contained by Gavin Andresen, who is still part of the Bitcoin developer team, and he provided a temporary fix before Satoshi made the final permanent fix solution.  This is my first time coming across this part of Bitcoin history. Is anyone here as allotted as I’m?  And now my question here is, what if this was not detected and fixed and the hacker successfully reserved that Bitcoin without being detected? First,  it could have not only tempered with the 21,000,000 limited supply, but would Bitcoin have been what it is today?  Was there any other bug exploit attempt in the past? If there was any link to that, that would be nice.",

Thankfully, satoshi was still around when this bug you mentioned was discovered, as this was a critical one. But there wasn't any other critical one as far as I know.QuoteWas there any other bug exploit attempt in the past? If there was any link to that, that would be nice.I know just about this other case where a person discovered a bug in 2019 and kept silence about it to avoid exploitsQuoteIn 2018, a security researcher discovered a major vulnerability in Bitcoin Core, the software that powers the Bitcoin blockchain, but after reporting the issue and having it patched, the researcher opted to keep details private in order to avoid hackers exploiting the issue.Technical details were published earlier this week after the same vulnerability was independently discovered in another cryptocurrency, based on an older version of the Bitcoin code that hadn't received the patch....Called INVDoS, the vulnerability is a classic denial-of-service (DoS) attack. While in many cases, DoS attacks are harmless, they are not for internet-reachable systems, which need to have stable uptime in order to process transactions.INVDoS was discovered in 2018 by Braydon Fuller, a Bitcoin protocol engineer. Fuller found that an attacker could create malformed Bitcoin transactions that, when processed by Bitcoin blockchain nodes, would lead to uncontrolled consumption of the server's memory resources, which would eventually crash impacted systems.https://www.zdnet.com/article/researcher-kept-a-major-bitcoin-bug-secret-for-two-years-to-prevent-attacks/There is also another report of a bug here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5032831.0Bugs happen. All software has bugs. But never a critical bug caused a big problem for the bitcoin network.",
