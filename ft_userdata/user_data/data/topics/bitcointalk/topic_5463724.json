The point is the same governments are now giving that money borrowed from other people to the needy ones with huge interest rates and I think if that's the case then interest rates will increase more.Plus a few days back I also heard the Chinese Yuan was losing its value and the Netherlands was going into stage inflation and such news is just to put more pressure on holders and traders of BTC. Which it really did. Now those who have lost everything will turn towards banks for borrowing money and that money will have more interest rates on them means the borrowers have to pay more interest rates.

      "body": "I do believe that the biggest contributor with the dump is what SpaceX have done under Elon. That is a huge anount of holding to be sold in a single night. This has been surfacing around the web with ssunptions of why did Elon come up with selling that much of his wealth. As we all know that was almost two years of accumulation and was sold for a lower market price. No one knows the reason why did they do such thing but to my assumption, Elon wanted to dump the market price and trigger a domino effect and once oppoetunity come, they's buy back for a lower price for profit. Unfortunately the ones who suffered the most are small investors which have met with their liquidation and market price tolerance. There's a chance for recovery but no one knows when will exactly this thing would happen.",

I understand that there are some people who think stuff like this and I get why they think of it because governments have always done \"illegal\" things with the law allowing them to do it. Some people do not understand the concept of the \"government can do it, you can't\" logic in law, just for example, if someone points a gun at another person, you can't just shoot that person and kill them to protect the other person, you have no right, you would be charged with murder, whereas a cop can do it. This is the simplest explanation of the \"government can do it, you can't\" logic. But this isn't one of those, they didn't do it and there is no proof of it anywhere.",

TBH, I don't give a shit to what Elon Musk has/would have done even if he's got any role in this because in the end, we all are traders and we have the right to liquidate our funds whenever we need them, and if he did the same, then what's wrong with that? It's his money that he invested, who are we to ^blame^ him for this selloff? That's my pov and I'm not angry, but I feel pity for Elon Musk. In the end, he's a great guy who did too much for the society once he tasted success, and is still doing his best in other areas if we weed out crypto while talking about him.",

Because BTC is way ahead of US dollar in many aspects of life. But that's not what we are discussing here we are discussing that people now found usd a better place of investment instead of BTC that's why they are not investing in BTC and BTC demand decreased like other foreign countries demand decreased. And that's exactly what i was trying to saying, but tell me does it mean, Government really manipulated market to make US dollar more stronger. After reading your point or stats i learnt:1. The government which will get the most benefit out of it is US government. (Which i did not mentioned in my post) 2. This US30 measurement is really helpful to observe some readings to clear doubt.Just to clear things out i was not aware of US30 before.",

Even if BTC used to see good amount of volatility before, that was all because it was being controlled by retail investors, but now institutional investors are involved who go according to the strength of dollar and I've been keenly observing this since they entered crypto, and even you can.I don't think governments are only focused on BTC and/or crypto as they've got much big economic affairs to look into, however, when you're asking that who will profit from this dump?Let me tell you, this (and even if BTC crashes down more) is a chance for every single trader out there that wanted a discount. So, it's a win-win not just for the governments but for all the traders as well. See the positive side too, buddy!And yes, US30 really helps a lot, but don't you trade it ever because it's a highly volatile thing.",

Hopefully, by next year when the idea of bitcoin halving will come to people's minds, the demand for bitcoin would increase, causing its price to soar as it should.

So this one is nothing just yet although we don’t know where it will stop but it was expected. There is always a dip like this whenever it is few months or like a year to halving according to the past trend so maybe we can place this on that category too. But this current dip is probably incited by the fact that WSJ reported that SpaceX sold there bitcoin holdings worth above $300m but that isn’t the case there are no concrete evidence about this just speculations since Tesla sold there’s last and both companies are associated with one another. Another is the fact that green light has been given by Sec for ETF features for ETH. Also probably the Evergrand bankruptcy filing also could be part of it",

Trying to predict the fluctuations in bitcoin is a bit like trying to predict the wind. You might be able to take an educated guess at some of the motivations behind the move, but the mass market movements taking place can often snowball by themselves, if people see a lot of profit taking then they are more inclined to join in before it slips away to zero or even negative equity. The stock markets around the world are dipping at the moment, and it's a big shock to see the biggest property companies in China currently struggling - they are a leading indicator that something is going very wrong in the Chinese economy right now and they are essentially the factory of the world.",
