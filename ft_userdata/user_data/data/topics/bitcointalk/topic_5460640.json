Usually they will replace the shorted part so that your data can be accessed. The repair costs vary depending on the damage, but for a short circuit like this it shouldn't be too expensive.And as a precaution, you have to pay attention to how they access your HDD, because they might duplicate your data.",

It will not be also a bad idea to get the service of legal professional if you have a good number of coins. There is a need for a legal document to be signed that states the terms and conditions of service. Nobody can be trusted with money.",

And much worse if there's really a balance in there like a hefty amount of Bitcoin. You should only get those recovery experts that you trust because if those are the experts that you don't know then they may create a scene that it's totally empty. Because you have to tell them what you are up to and why you need to recovery what's inside the HDD.",

So it is actually the private key they loss when this drives got damage. Even on hardware wallet it is still private keys on it.

Why you haven't keep your backup in a safe place? Is that fund wasn't much worthy? The last hope is that ou may try to repair it from an expert who is trusted too.Maybe you lost a little amount of Bitcoin. Though the fund is big or little it's a must to keep backup in a safest place. It's a good lesson for everyone who aren't much aware about their security or backup. Be conscious about your wallet and make your funds Secured.",

Of course, as some have already mentioned, you should first calculate whether it is worth saving the data considering their value in relation to the cost of the procedure - although I would note that you should also take into account the possible value of those BTC in the future.You can read more at this link -> https://computertech.com/blog/hard-drive-water-damaged",

Such a situation is incomprehensible to me, because I never have any liquids near my computer or any other electronics.It is security wise. We should stop doing things belong to our childhood or teenager hood.Eating and drinking when we are working with a computer, a laptop are simply unwise and it's very risky for physical damages on digital devices. Even we turn off our computer or laptop, like you said we should not put any water, liquid around our devices.QuoteI recommend that you seek professional help from people who are engaged in professional data recovery, and considering that you have very sensitive data, you can ask to be present during the procedure (some offer this option).

They can say we fail to recover your data but in fact they got it successfully and stole that wallet file and got access to bitcoin. We can not know what they do after we pass our devices and drives to them for data recovery.Hopefully OP will recover his wallet successfully and bitcoin in that wallet will be intact. However, this accident reminds OP the importance of wallet backups. If you have a Bitcoin wallet, back it up before you use it for receiving, storing and sending bitcoin.",

As long as OP takes it to data rescue experts, I think everything will be solved. But the problem is how many bitcoins he has because data rescue doesn't come cheap either.",
