This is not to knock on others but I personally think it's stupid to use your bonuses to gambling specially when we are getting closer to the halving. I'm pretty sure I'll have more merrier and more prosperous holidays in the future if I invest that additional funds now.You can make the poll much simpler by removing the \"yes\" and \"no\". Keep it to \"spending less\" or \"spending more\" to avoid confusion.",

A lot has been given already to gambling during the last few months. This is the time to rest with loved ones, and have some fun, attending real-life activities. Spending more on gambling could ruin other fun activities laid out already for our good and increment of productivity. The extra money we make during the end of the season, helps us to meet up with the expenses awaiting us in this season of love. While gambling, I'd need to wager a few amounts each day and endeavor to maintain the limit of gambling for that day. However, there'll be less time attributed to gambling. Many times we'd be exhausted from attending different parties and gathering friends. The only time left would be for movies and sleep. Hence, there'll be only a few moments of gambling, till the next year, when people focus more on their career and would need gambling to kick start the year. In the form of a catalyst for thinking fast and making great decisions.",

But for trading maybe I will not take any less with it since for me this is investment so I'd rather take out gambling temporarily since this is just total disturbance especially that there's no guarantee of profit we can get there.There's really a lot to spend that's why I always decide to cut off my budget for gambling since it doesn't make any sense to push it and do over spending since I also don't want to get broke after this holiday season ends.",

I will gamble responsibly by spending money as I have done before, the other part of the money I will spend on vacation with my wife and children.New Year's time is only once a year, I don't want to miss this beautiful moment with my family just because of my selfishness in wanting to continue gambling to fulfill my lust.Actually in this matter everything will go back to the principles that have been set by  each individual, as you say it's good, and for me also do the same as you, I don't care whether it's the holiday season or not, I still won't change the allocation of money I budgeted for gambling, in the sense of stagnating with the amount I can afford to lose. It is better and more effective to use the bonus money from the Christmas and New Year season for other purposes in life.Basically, it can be a possibility for gamblers if they get free money from other things such as maybe a new year or holiday bonus, they will usually use that money to increase their gambling budget and that means that the expectations they put on winning are also getting higher because it is clear that by increasing the amount of budget on the bet it means they want something bigger, but the fact is that it is not always  like that, the casino will not care about how much you allocate, if it's time to lose, it will still lose. So the best thing is as you said, it's better to use the bonus money for other interests in life, such as going on a trip with family or for anything that can certainly have a positive impact without being involved with risk.",

I already received my 13th month pay from my boss, but it doesn't mean I will already spend more in gambling. I still stick to my set budget (even before) for my gambling activity because that's what I can only afford. This is the time for me to buy gifts for my loved ones and prepare for the celebration of Christmas and new year because it also serves as our family reunion. My budget and time for gambling are still the same and it's better this way because I can discipline myself.",

It’s understandable for someone to spend more on gambling if he has no social life but I believe most people will spend less here(correct me if I’m wrong) since this is the only which you can have a long vacation and it’s useless to spend more on gambling which you can do anytime due to it’s availability on mobile devices and computer.",

Perhaps it's because I haven't seen many promotions lately that would entice me to bet more. Unlike in past holiday seasons when I tried almost every promotion from various casino platforms, hoping for some luck. Maybe it's better this way because I have expenses for parties and, as you mentioned, buying gifts for godchildren. And, of course, I need to prepare for celebrations as well.",

Let us examine it this way; Do you spend much when you earn much Or You spend normal even when you earn much? If a certain gambler spends more whenever he earns more, it means that that particular gambling will like gamble the more when he receives his 13th salary for countries that implements that. But some persons already have their gambling budget and they do not exceed that no matter how their income varies.To me, this is a time to be less involved in gambling and so other things that money requires because this is a period of spending. But there are still people who increases their habit of spending towards season with the mindset of increasing their chances of winning big in the season. I honestly think that chances of winning big is smaller when season approaches than when there is no sign of the season.",
