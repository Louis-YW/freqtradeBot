  "content": "A few months ago,  I made  this post  here. And after reading all of the suggestions, this is what my class did on the last week before the Salah break. I teach a class of forty students. To begin the class, I needed a projector, 10 computers and my personal computer to use as an example. I had to rent the computers for the day, that morning I downloaded Electrum wallet ( because it's my favorite) on all of the laptops and made sure the program ran smoothly on the PCs. All Good!!! The morning of the lesson, I divided the class  into ten groups of four with each group having a laptop each.  The 10 laptops were evenly placed across my classroom.  I had the advantage to do this before the assembly meeting because I had the first period. We began the class with a little revision. We watched  Bitcoin Q&A: How Do I Choose a Wallet? by Andreas Antonopoulos on the projector. The instructions for the exercise were as follows:1. Create a personal wallet on Electrum 2. Write down your private keys 3. Each student is to decide how best to store  their private keys4. Sign/Verify a message with their addressObservationsThe students were impressive, the exercise didn't take them long to complete. Some of my students who had taken a strong interest in bitcoin before the lesson were already familiar with Bitcoin wallets and had a very easy time using electrum. I observe they were not very secretive with your private keys - a point I will emphasize more on in our next class. Electrum wallet seem boring or should I say less colorful for them. I could see they enjoyed signing a message with their address, they had the same expression as when they first did \"Hello world!\" program on fortran. My only regret is the students didn't have the opportunity to o perform a real transaction with their new Bitcoin wallets. Unfortunately I don't have enough bitcoins to splash for them to practice how to send/receive Bitcoin.",

So then you may teach them practically how to transfer Bitcoin from wallets. Also, there are a lot of videos on YouTube on how to transfer Bitcoin. They would learn if they are curious enough. From your end, you are doing great to adopt Bitcoin. Your students are lucky, to be honest, they are learning the perfect thing in a perfect way. Keep it up, mate.",

You have set the pace, for others who want to follow to follow. These important role you have played in the life of these students can help shape the financial life of those who take cryptocurrency seriously. As a suggestion OP, you can consider creating a WhatsApp/Telegram group for the students who are interested to join so you can continue to render guidance to these younglings from anywhere you relocate to.Quote from: Piesel on July 12, 2022, 06:14:19 PM but also since you did not specify the age level of your students and their grade level we may not see it as necessary for them to make a transaction,This is a follow up post from him as he indicated, from the previous post which he referenced, he mentioned the kids to be in secondary/high school, so assuming their age range, It should be from about 11-21years.",

Electrum needs small space unlike the bitcoin core wallet.So practically, this is a lot easier to install and start their journey in bitcoin. Other wallets can come next as they get a good understanding about custodial and non-custodial wallets .Some of these students will be thankful to the OP in the future, as some of them will make a living out of this market.",

Create a personal wallet on ElectrumYou should teach them how to use Electrum single signature wallet and multi signature (co-sign) wallet.Quote2. Write down your private keys Need to be clearer. Private key or mnemonic seed?In Electrum wallet, when you create a new wallet, what the software gives you is mnemonic seed, not private key. To get private key (after you create your wallet, you must do other steps.Furthermore, write down mnemonic seed is easier and avoid mistake than write down private key.Quote3. Each student is to decide how best to store  their private keysYou should teach them to recover their wallets by typing their mnemonic seed or recover a single receiving address by importing its private key.Choose \"I already have a seed\"or click on Wallet, Private key, Export and get a file for private keys of all addresses in that walletor click on Addresses tab, choose a receiving address, right click to choose Private key and get it.I don't prefer to use this method, dump private key. I would like to back up and recover with my mnemonic seed that is simpler and I can secure it better. With a file of private key, I see it more vulnerable to hack.In addition, when creating a wallet, after typing a wallet password, always choose \"Encrypt wallet file\". It activates a security with wallet password and secure the wallet file.If anyone use the same computer and see that wallet, to access it, must know a wallet password or has to brute force it.",

Unfortunately I don't have enough bitcoins to splash for them to practice how to send/receive Bitcoin.  Why not give the Electrum Testnet Client a try? This way, you will be able to demonstrate sending and receiving bitcoin in real time, much like an actual bitcoin transaction. Running Electrum testnet, on the other hand, can be as simple as downloading the Electrum client itself as it is inlucded upon download. Alternatively, you can also make a copy of the shortcut created by the installer and change the target using the --testnet commandline argument which is best explained in this guide[1].Now, I pretty much don't know if @notblox1 is still giving free tBTC though in the Service he offered[2].[1] https://bitzuma.com/posts/a-beginners-guide-to-the-electrum-bitcoin-wallet/#testnet-mode[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5278247.0",

And I think that it would do more harm than good.The time-consuming process and several small payments associated with using faucet are one of its main drawbacks. Multiple small payments (input) increase transaction size, thus increases the fees related with each on-chain transaction[1]. While I am aware that this might be a potential topic, it might lead to more confusion as they will need to learn how to combine inputs in order to reduce the transaction size and associated fees [2] as a pre-requisite.As for any privacy and security related concerns, you can't be certain if a faucet website is legit. Back then, some faucets requires their user to download an application which might contain malwares that could compromise those laptop. Plus, they are also susceptible to some incentive-based activity that openly encourages referral spam, which is a terrible practice.
