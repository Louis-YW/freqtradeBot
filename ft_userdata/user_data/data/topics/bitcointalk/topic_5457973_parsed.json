So if the intention of the user is to launder money through the Casino, their chances of losing the entire money before even getting it out are high. Lower Odds give one some confidence that their chances of winning are huge, but it does not always happen that way. So trying to use that as a loophole in an online casino might lead you to fall victim to losing all your wagers.",

This is because money that were laundered are included in legit businesses which makes it difficult to trace. As for your question. A good gambling site would have made investigation immediately they see someone that deposit very huge amount of money in a way the launderer will not be able to withdraw even his winning, no matter how small the winning is.  Although I think it would be difficult for a gambling site to identify laundered money unless there is an ongoing case about the money and traced to a gambling site account.Quote from: noormcs5 on June 29, 2023, 07:28:43 AMNow the point here is that on the gambling site, there are many easy winning bets with odds like 1.01x etc. If the money lauder is sensible he can easily be wagering the whole amount by placing a few bets where the odds are very low and the winning chances are 99%.Play 1.01 odd 100 times and see that the winning chance is far lesser than 99%. Those odds are only deceiving people to use huge amount of money to bet and to bet frequently.",

They do keep extensive logs (part of their business actually depends on those logs so they can catch fraudsters), sometimes they even require KYC... If you're going to launder criminal funds using casino's, you're just going to get caught sooner or later (and since we're talking about criminal funds, i kinda hope the launderers get caught)Personally, i don't see anything wrong if you just want to hide your money to protect yourself from a $5 crowbar attack or beggars... You can use about any service that allows you to deposit and withdraw funds... An exchange, a casino, a custodial wallet,... I don't know if the wager requirements of casinos are actually there to stop money laundering, and i wonder if their main goal is to make sure their business stays afloat. Only by requiring your balance to be wagered, they stop people from not gambling... The fact they're discouraging money launderers is just a happy coincidence. Personally, if i'd just want to hide my funds from criminals and beggars, i'd rather use a big exchange for this purpose: the risk is much lower than using a gambling website.Full disclosure: i'm not a \"real\" gambler. I did visit gambling sites in the past a couple of times, but i'm far from an experienced gambler, and i haven't logged on to any of my accounts for years... Maybe my image of the gambling industry is wrong...",

Isn't it curious that they only think about money laundering when you try to withdraw your coins but when you deposit and lose it, they act like money laundering hasn't happened. They don't ask for KYC documents when you deposit coins, only when you withdraw, everything is 100% clear here.Btw, don't really think that if you play dice at 1.01x odd to wager your money you'll be safe, play with some money in a row and you'll see how common it is to nuke yourself on 1.01x odd.",

This is very risky and I’d rather go slow on high winning percentage dice with small bets instead of doing all in bet on small odds sports bet. I think there’s a lot of story like this that users lose millions of dollars by wagering on small bets for a peanuts profit that turn out badly.Money launderers will not use this kind of method that can lose everything in single bet. Besides, Casino will notice this same pattern if they keep doing this while they have a very huge bankroll. It’s clearly the account is laundering if all bet made is just safe bet until they withdraw the funds.",

The KYC procedures were imposed, in order to fight money laundering. Perhaps the wagering requirement helps for preventing many money launderers to stay away from online casinos, but it's main purpose is to prevent abuse of the bonus programs.I don't think that the best way to launder money via the gambling industry is to deposit them at an online casino/sportsbook and bet on low odds like 1.01. The best way is to create your own casino/sportsbook and use the dirty money as a bankroll.",

From the perspective of the casino, statistically speaking, one out of every 100 individuals will lose, allowing the casino to cover the expenses of paying the other 99 people.But, most importantly, this is not how money laundering through casinos works. If you try this method, it's a piece of cake for the authorities to track the money and figure out where it came from.

Basically, bet twice the amount of your first deposit.Quote from: https://help.duelbits.com/en/articles/5113339-coin-mixingYou will notice that your withdrawal remains to process if you deposit a certain amount and then withdraw the funds without making a bet or betting just a small portion of it. \"Coin Mixing\" is described as simply transferring funds around in this manner, and it is strictly prohibited in the scope of an online casino. Since this sort of conduct may be viewed as something more sinister and malicious, we are obligated not to enable it. To prevent this, we present two solutions that are utilized in certain circumstances. Utilizations of the following options will be made according to Our judgment. We can refund the amount to your balance, after which you will use the platform for what it was built for, as a casino, and affirm that you will not repeat the following action.As per our second option, you will be asked to submit your KYC documents.Quote from: mocacinno on June 29, 2023, 07:37:57 AMI remember people talking about using gambling platforms instead of mixers for many, many years...

Because as criminals, they would have big enough money to use professional mixer services and pay service fees. They will not use gambling sites to mix their coins as saving a little service fee is not a matter with criminals.Risk to use gambling sites to mix their coins will be bigger than service fee from a professional mixer service.",
