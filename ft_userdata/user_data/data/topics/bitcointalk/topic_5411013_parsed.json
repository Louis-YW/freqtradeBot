  "content": "The BBC has made a film about Trump's ties to Russia, which examines the KGB's compromising evidence on former President Trump. This explains the Kremlin's interference in the election campaign in order to get Trump to the presidency, which he succeeded in doing. Undoubtedly, in future elections, Putin will use every opportunity at his disposal to once again make the ambitious Trump the owner of the White House.Alik BakhshiPutin's hand at the White House       It seems that the team Trump entered the man Putin, they turned out to be the adviser of the US president, the former intelligence chief Pentagon General Michael Flynn. Interestingly, this retired general back in 2015 sat at the table next to Putin at a gala dinner in honor of the 10th anniversary of the Russian television company known for its duplicity in presenting information.                                                                   Pictured (http://www.bbc.com/russian/news-38965606) former head of the Pentagon's Intelligence Michael Flynn with a mobile phone in close company on the right of Putin's hand. How rival knights of cloak and dagger found themselves at the same table in a friendly company? And it's during the war between Russia and Ukraine and the introduction of anti-Russian sanctions. What is a retired general Flynn talked with Putin over dinner is not known, but it was reported that Flynn, being an unofficial person, that is, before his appointment as advisor to the president, has repeatedly had phone conversations with Russian Ambassador to America, where they discussed new sanctions entered by the president Obama shortly before his inauguration Trump. Thus, Flynn went to a violation of US law, which prohibits private individuals to interfere in matters of the country's foreign policy. Moreover, it is naturally concealed from the public the fact of talks with the Russian ambassador. While I was writing these lines, it was reported that Michael Flynn, without waiting for a scandal, resigned. Contact with dirty people, usually leads to trouble, as demonstrated by the example of Flynn, who had the imprudence to approach with a known liar, President Putin (1).     This situation inevitably leads to the question, and who is actually the Donald Trump? Sure, Trump was aware of the contacts of your future advisor to the ambassador of Russia and knew the subject of secret negotiations. But most importantly - why it was so important for Trump, in general, for America, why the rush? Yes, all the growing anti-Russian sanctions are Russian economic collapse, and it disturbs Revanchists Putin, but Trump? Is it important question of sanctions for Trump, he in such a hurry, before the inauguration of discussing the issue of sanctions? Was he a protege of Putin, as was former Ukrainian President Yanukovych? Really, as is the case with Yanukovych, Putin also has the dirt on Trump? It seems that Putin is truly a genius in the achievement of its goals: FIFA president Joseph Blatter, President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych is now possible to Donald Trump, who's next? Putin clearly conducts undercover struggle, taking advantage of an open democratic society. By the way, I am sure that Putin was preparing a government coup in Montenegro, where a large number of Russian, owning real estate. This brings to mind Putin's slogan to defend the \"Russian world\", to which he regularly follows - Ukraine, Moldova, and so on throughout the post-Soviet space (2). To implement this policy objective Putin needs to neutralize the West, he developed a method which victim possibly become Donald Trump.    One thing is clear - America can not escape a major political and criminal scandal.1. The Empire of Lies and its chief liar. http://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/#post-alikbahshi-22317 2. The constituent peoples and its Fuhrer, or Ukraine, and the list goes on. http://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/#post-alikbahshi-21749 14/2/17--------------------      Gradually the facts are revealed, exposing high-ranking officials from the team of Donald Trump, concealing its contacts with Russian officials in America. So, after the resigned adviser to the president of the Trump National Security Michael Flynn, who escaped from the Senate his talks with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the election campaign, now in deception caught myself Attorney General USA Jeff Seshns that the consideration of the Senate of his candidacy for the post of Attorney General the question whether he had contacts with representatives of the Russian Federation, said: \"I have not had any contact with Russian\". As it turned out, Seshns, quite simply, lied to colleagues. The fact that, as a senator and a member of the Senate Committee on Armed forces of the USA, as well as being a member of the election team of Trump, Seshns twice face to face with Kislyak met in his office room.    It is hard to imagine that Trump was not aware of talks of members of his election to the Russian team, or why and were in secret talks with the Russian ambassador. I doubt that Donald Trump will be able to wriggle out of the lungs is not forthcoming issues for him, and even more convincingly explain these facts.(*)(*)3.2.17.",

Because as we know that Trump is very ambitious to be President, and with the resources that Putin has, he can help Trump to rise as President. As we know that Putin is very good at propaganda, coupled with the intelligence data he has will be able to help Trump to rise as President. And in exchange Trump will give Putin \"access\" to some of the resources owned by the US.",

Time for Biden to retire. Trump has a habit of failing at almost everything he has ever delved into. He has a long list of failed business and has now added a failed presidency to his list of failures. Trump isn’t an administrator neither is he a good one. His administration is a failed administration as he rode on the success and growth of the Obama administration. And he rode even that to the ground. With his exceptional healthcare plan we never saw to the wild arrogant twitter rants. Trump, being a buffoon was laughed at by other world leaders and actively undermined America to the rest of the world. Being Putins puppet, he openly sided with Russia over his own intelligence chiefs about the bounty placed on American soldiers by Russia. Downplaying the covid pandemic while secretly getting vaccinated, lousy or non existent foreign policies, and now the “theft” of government classified and top secret documents that he claims to have declassified just by thinking about it. What a moron.",
