We are about adopting the electronic voting process inline with the new electoral act,Â  and I want to ask this question, is Nigeria ripe for electronic voting? When there is epileptic power supply and internet brigandage every where not to talk of our local communities that are not even digitally inclined how do they do about that.Â  Internet Service is poorly available in the villages and most of the communities are near inaccessible some are island and difficult to access as well.

I hope the inec are fully ready to deliver service as promised. This time around no more stories.To answer your question, Nigeria is overripe for any development you have seen in other countries, let us try as much as possible to avoid one bad phrase that has affected our mind and even the mind of our leaders, which is Nigeria factors , this is the situation where we hear comments like.What works in other countries doesn't work in NigeriaThis kind of mindset that is found among Nigerians including the leaders is what have to lead to a high rate of corruption and lack of demand for accountability from the political leaders. And to solve this situation we must fight to build stronger institutions If is truly independent and without executive interference in their conduct then I am very certain that electronic voting should be able to give Nigeria a 97% result which should be free and fair.The current INEC software is is proven to be highly secured and unhackable which may be true even it not in 100% accurate but what we should fear most is insider job a situation where INEC will be answerable to a certain group that control their decision and this is were the electronic voting will be of advantages because it will reduce rigging that os normally done through the manual voting system and even under age voting will be reduced to it minimum.Let just hope that everything work out dine this time, just like Lucky Dube said in his freedom song, one tenure of a good leader can bring about hundred years of development we hope this time we can vote a leader that have the development of this country at heart not minding tribe, class, and political party, we are first Nigerians/human before tribe and religion separated us.

So let us be positive and avoid compering 9ja to Ghana because that is a big insult to 9ja as the giant of Africa.",

I smile.you think 9ja is still seen or taken to be the giant of Africa?In what ways can we say they are giant of Africa, apart from music and movie industries what else can we boast of in life, since 1960, do we call it good roads, or good governance, electricity, employment and what?Â  Just take a look at Electricity as a case study, we can't boast of 24/7 Power supply across the country except those area and region that has been taken by oil company which they got their stable supply through companies.brotherly for me i don't classify our country to be the Giant of Africa.",

That being said back to the issue of Nigeria being the giant of Africa: Quote from: https://bscholarly.com/why-is-nigeria-called-the-giant-of-africa/Nigeriaâ€™s Superintendent and Prudential Role in Africa: It has Africaâ€™s largest economy, best-organized legislature, most powerful military, immense natural riches, the most intellectual giants, and, most importantly, it functions as a peace mediator for all other African countries.Nigeria is an African country that has contributed significantly to the preservation of peace in Africa and throughout the world. Nigeriaâ€™s help in restoring peace and stability in Liberia and Sierra Leone is an excellent example. When a particular army Major Jonny Paul Koroma deposed President Tijani Kabbaâ€™s administration in Sierra Leone, General Sani Abacha summoned Nigeriaâ€™s huge military strength and restored a democratic government.Nigeria has utilized its massive military force to keep the ECOWAS area stable. Nigeria played a crucial role in apartheid in South Africa, the Liberian civil war, and numerous other African countries. Nigeria has played a significant influence in the growth of most African countries, as well as the independence of some African nations such as South Africa and Liberia.Nigerians, on the other hand, are dispersed over the continent, creating the many industries in which they work. Nigeria has traditionally acted as the continentâ€™s big brother, and it is for these reasons that Nigeria is known as Africaâ€™s behemoth.",
