  "content": "I'm new to this so feel free to shoot me down.To be brief, I work in places where I have unlimited access to free energy for between 4 to 7 hours a day.I'm left entirely alone and had the thought that I could plug in portable miners to mine away while I'm at these locations.But I wasn't sure how portable mining can really be before it's not profitable, and if there really is such as thing as portable mining?In an ideal world, I would carry a desktop sized unit to these places, plug it in to the power. It'd have 4g access to the Internet, and ideally not require a screen nor a mouse. I turn it on and off it goes and mines.Does such a thing exist? Am I dreaming here? If it does exist, is there something easy to mine? Interested to hear your ideas and suggestions.I'd start with 1 machine to see how this goes, but would easily be able to do 5-10 machines (depending on size) each session.Thanks.",

However you will need an Ethernet cable to plug it in for internet and thatâ€™s it. Very portable. Just a small box with a PSU connected to it.Keep in mind one thing. The ASIC is fairly loud. As loud as a vacuum.",

Set the lowest electricity tariff and divide the profit by 6.Do not forget about the criminal liability for the theft of electricity.More powerful asics will require wiring upgrades if the sockets in that place are not equipped for powerful deviceshttps://www.asicminervalue.com/",

The kind of miner you would need to run to make even a dollar in 4 hours would be so loud and kick off so much heat that it would get you fired or annoy you to the point youâ€™d pay more to be rid of it. There are silent miners that donâ€™t kick off massive amounts of heat, but youâ€™d earn about $0.10 per day using it. Basically, mining isnâ€™t something you can do part time and youâ€™d never recover your hardware costs that way. The only way your plan would be any good at all is if you had a gpu sitting around or in your office machine that could mine while youâ€™re there.",

They only built them because they could sell them for $50 a piece and used maybe $5 in parts. They were more oriented towards those that want to dip their feet into mining because it was an easy transition.Pretty sure the only people who ROI those miner sticks were maybe those that bought in early 2013 and sold in late 2013 when the bubble popped.",
