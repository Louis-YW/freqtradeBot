  "content": "Bitcoin is 200 days to halving yesterday being the 10th day of October, 2023.Halving is an event that occurs every four years supposedly, it is a period that historical patterns shows that prices tend to rally, even clearing previous all-time highs once it happens.In a price chart shared by the “thescalpingpro” on X on October 9, the analyst appears to suggest that the world’s most valuable coin is in the early stages of not only breaking above 2021 highs but registering new highs after the network halves in 2024.EARLY SIGNS OF BULL RALLY: 200 DAYS BEFORE HALVING.Thus far, the trader(thescalpingpro) notes that Bitcoin is down 60% from previous all-time highs in 2021. This formation, the analyst says, appears to replicate the same pattern before Bitcoin halved in 2019. Then, just like it is presently, the coin fell 60% from 2017 highs of around $20,000. As historical pattern shows, Bitcoin prices tend to bounce back strongly after posting sharp losses from previous highs. These upswings are often accelerated by the halving event momentum, pushing prices further away from cyclical lows. Every four years, Bitcoin halving occurs, where the reward for mining a Bitcoin block is reduced by half. This feature is built into the protocol to slow the issuance of new Bitcoin. Due to the decrease in the number of coins released to circulation during halving, inflation is reduced, which supports prices, as previous price action has shown.Although the impact of halving has been well studied, the sequence of events preceding this event appears to be stirring demand. As aforementioned, 200 days before the 2016 and 2019 halvings, Bitcoin fell roughly 60% from all-time highs.The asset’s prices are at a similar price point precisely 200 days before halving. For this “near-perfect” replication of events, “thescalpingpro” is bullish that the coin might follow a familiar pattern of past cycles.Bitcoin Race To $48,000 Before Halving?The spike to all-time highs and beyond, as previewed, is a scenario that could happen once the halving happens. Before then, however, another analyst is convinced the coin could rally to $48,000. The analysis is based on crucial support and resistance levels formed by the Fibonacci retracement levels. The analyst is convinced that the coin will retest the 61.8% of the swing high low of the recent 2021 to 2022 range, placing Bitcoin at $48,000 once it recovers. The race to this level will be further driven by “halving momentum” and the “bear-to-bull transition from various indicators,” including the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and the on-balance volume of major exchanges, which appear oversold. REFERENCE... https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/1295002?ref=25201067&utm_campaign=app_share_linkI came across this post and was actually amazed, it got my hopes high on bitcoin concerning the coming halving, but i cant on my own confirm is what the trader(Thescalpingpro) claimed is true, this is why i decided to share here, to get an idea of what you guys think.",

And if you search you’ll see that there are different dates for it online, some April, October (as you have stated in your post).The exact date cannot be determined because of bitcoin difficulty adjustment. The average time to get a block confirmation usually varies every 14 days. Some blocks takes less than the average time for the miners to solve the block puzzle and some take more than the Time this can sometimes be attributed to hashrate. So this variation will definitely affect the date and time. If you compare some trackers they are not the same and most varies depending on what they use to Calculate the date. Some of this trackers only have a fixed date with the 10 minutes as average time while some regularly calculate it as difficult of the blocks adjusts. The exact thing is it happens after 210000 blocks and that will take place at block 840000 and we are 28260 blocks shy of that as at the time do this post because the block confirmed is currently at 811740 on mempool.space",

So in regards to this analysis you just gave above, does that mean since after 2019 halving, the price of Bitcoin rose from old All Time High (i.e $20,000) to a newer All Time High (i.e $67,000), which is approximately over 300%, does that mean after next year's halving, are we to expect to see another 300% increase in the price of Bitcoin for a newer All-Time High? (i.e 300% × $67,000=$201,000), Or are we to expect half percent increased just like in the case of half reward for miners? (i.e 150% instead of 300%), which is likely to give us the price of BTC at (i.e 150% × $67,000=$100,500)?. As whichever will still be a reasonable amount of profit for whoever invest in it today.",

Due to new miners getting more efficient (and old ones getting replaced), hashpower is rising in general and the average Block time will be a little bit below 10 minutes each Block on average. In case Bitcoin's price will increase massively soon, our next halving could be around April 21/22 already.",

Big people such as Microstrategy, Elon , michael saylor are influencers who holding btc and their one tweet about selling could bring a drop in btc price. MT GOX refund will also be happen next year which also impact the btc price.I still believe that btc will rise because most of the selling already done and now it's time to buy at low rate. Bitcoin ETF, Halving are two big events which ia very positive and we have not seen any big positive change in btc price.According to this chart if history repeat we will see another dump before the halving and then green days will come. So i am ready for it, Keeping some fund in stable coin and waiting for drop. I am not seeing now better strategy tham DCA while trading in btc and especially altcoins are very risky at this stage.",

The last halving with Covid-19 affected Bitcoin a lot but I believe after failing to reach $100,000 in the last halving, Bitcoin will make it done in 2024 halving.I believe $100,000 is very possible for 2024 halving because if Bitcoin breaks out from $69,000, FOMO will make it rise 30% more easily because rising 30% is seen in Bitcoin history. The challenge is only will Bitcoin touch its past all time high about $69,000?I think it will do it.",
