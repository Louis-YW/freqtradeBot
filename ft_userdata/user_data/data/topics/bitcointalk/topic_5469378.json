Here is the link to the article: https://www.ledger.com/blog/a-message-from-pascal-gauthier-chairman-ceo-at-ledgerWhen we talk about a company that manufactures hardware wallets, continuous development and customer safety must come first. It is not a company that sells TVs or sports shoes, so the marketing mentality must come first, the constant lying that appears in the company’s management will lead them to bankruptcy and may lead to the loss of some users.The numbers he mentioned about the total number of wallets sold are frightening, and I do not know how he knows the percentage of securing 20% of global crypto assets.QuoteOver the last decade Ledger has built a best-in-class hardware and software platform, selling more than 6.5 million Nanos and powering over 100 financial institutions, now securing more than 20% of global crypto assets.

But this Ledger own definitely has to fall into the place of business not growing more due to the bad decisions they made. Reading through this news outlets I don’t see a comeback for them even though they still want to go ahead with the recovery idea, and thinking it will come good. If you read through many insults are thrown to the CEO, someone even tweeted of trusting software wallets than them which is definitely too bad. I would say Ledger should just be considered there was a big hardware wallets firm.

They were also caught lying that they are on an open source roadmap[1] which isn't true, too many lies coming from Ledger and it is enough not to trust them. A company can layoff staffs without any ominous meaning to it, but one that has recently come under fire and have probably lost all their customers that understands a thing or two about security, then it could mean something extra.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5467841.msg62891890#msg62891890",

Considering this fact, it is easy to conclude that such data can be collected very easily and also connected to the IP addresses with which they are accessed.If some big brother were to knock on their door (if he hasn't already) and ask for all this information on any basis (taxes, money laundering, terrorism...) I'm sure they would have to hand over this information. Considering everything that has been happening around that company for several years now, everyone should ask themselves if there is any logic in trusting them with something as sensitive as our private keys?",

      "body": "According to Techcrunch, Ledger has raised around 456 million EURO! That's a lot of money. They have a lot of cash to burn and I assume that while the crypto market was on a bull run, their earnings must have been looking better than it does now. But now without as much movement in crypto, we can safely assume that they aren't doing as well. I tried to look at their financial statements but it seems like they haven't published a new one since 2016!?Well, we could draw conclusions from another metric though. Their series C funding round was $380 million in 2021. They called an \"extension\" to series C and got another 100 million EUR earlier this year. However, for a startup to actually get LESS money in a new funding round, it must mean that they aren't as hot. Their investors must be demanding answers. Probably their earnings were too low to justify as many employees. TL;DR, in financial terms Ledger probably isn't earning a lot and has a dubious future as a company as is, so the layoffs were expected. Excessive growth goals tend to do that to startups. Edit: Forgot to mention that my view is that the layoffs weren't caused by the whole PR fiasco Ledger faced. The bulk of their turnover probably comes from their enterprise services other than retail sales anyway, and corporations utilizing a company's services to secure other people's crypto sure wouldn't mind some trust into the equation of safekeeping crypto.",

However, we must not forget that when initializing the hardware wallet, we have to connect the device to Ledger Live, and we have to download coins apps or even upgrade the firmware, so I wonder how much sense it makes to hide later. From everything that I have personally read on this topic, it seems to me that from the beginning the whole thing was actually in trust between the company and us (customers), and now it all came down to Ledger literally saying \"yes, we can extract your seed from our devices, but trust us we won't share it around unless you pay us $9.99 every month\".The problem is, of course, that the company thinks that way at all, because most of these so-called \"crypto messiahs\" think that we are all just idiots who would lose everything we have if it weren't for their companies and their services/devices.",

We don't know the internal structure of this company, as well as the distribution of work responsibilities of employees and why there are 500 people on staff and not 50.
