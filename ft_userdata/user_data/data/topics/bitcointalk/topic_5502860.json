  "content": "Recent discussions have centered around the potential consequences of the German government offloading 50,000 Bitcoin on the crypto market [1]. This scenario bears striking similarities to a previous incident in England during 1999.The German government's decision to offload its Bitcoin holdings at a price below 60K USD echoes the controversial sale of UK gold reserves in 1999. As one of the world's largest sovereign BTC holders, Germany's divestment at this relatively low price point has raised concerns among financial analysts. Some experts are even comparing this move to the UK's gold sale, suggesting it could be a similarly detrimental financial strategy [2].The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs marks a pivotal moment, broadening BTC accessibility and potentially attracting substantial institutional investment. I anticipate sustained BTC price growth through 2025. Given this bullish outlook, Germany's decision to offload its BTC holdings could prove short-sighted. There's a possibility that government officials may reconsider this strategy, potentially opting to retain BTC as a national asset rather than liquidating it via OTC.I would like to know your opinion on this issue:Do you think the German government's BTC sell-off was a historical mistake?If you could help the German government make a decision, would you like to turn this 50K BTC into a national reserve?Do you continue to believe in BTC price growth opportunities in the near future to become an extremely valuable asset in the economy?References:[1] Germany Almost Done Selling Bitcoin, Holding Less Than 5K Tokens After Latest Moves[2] German Government Bitcoin Selling Akin To UK Selling Its Gold",

I am not well aware of their laws but it could be a possibility that they had to do this to comply. Or maybe they are going to use it for something urgent. Who knows? As investors we would always see this as a mistake but how they use it could show whether it was really a mistake or not.QuoteIf you could help the German government make a decision, would you like to turn this 50K BTC into a national reserve?No. Bitcoin is too volatile right now to be used as a reserve and stabilize their economy.QuoteDo you continue to believe in BTC price growth opportunities in the near future to become an extremely valuable asset in the economy?Yes which is why I continue to hold my bitcoins unlike Germany",

It is only 14% from 2021 ATH and if in this current cycle, Bitcoin did not make its new ATH before a halving in April, current price is very good.In addition, the Bitcoin bull run will continue.",

The difference is that at that time gold was already a global reserve asset and considered the most reliable asset that any country would want to own. Therefore, the decision to sell more than 50% of gold reserves is really a wrong decision by the British Government even though we do not know the reason behind it.Meanwhile, bitcoin remains a volatile asset and is not a national reserve asset nor does it account for too much of the German government's budget. There was a huge difference between the British government's sale of gold at the time and the German government's sale of bitcoin. 2. So far, no country has dared to turn bitcoin into a national reserve asset because of its volatility, so using bitcoin as a national reserve at this stage is somewhat risky for the economy.3. As a bitcoin investor, everyone wants the value of bitcoin to skyrocket, but the future is unpredictable.",

It is now impossible to say for sure whether the German government's move was a mistake.Although I am sure that most of the BTC-community will condemn these actions, believing that bitcoin will continue to rise in price. But even with the sale of BTC by the German government now, they found themselves in a huge profit (money out of thin air), because these bitcoins were received for free (confiscated).2 -  It’s difficult for me to say, because I don’t know the internal economic situation in Germany, what to make a decision about holding bitcoin (there are other reserves) or selling right now (reserves are running out).3 - All direct and indirect indicators indicate this.",

Most likely they had no way of holding it or thought it posed a risk and made them vulnerable. What if someone were to gain access to it due to a clerk's mistake and steal it? The government would become a laughingstock, they would have a problem tracking the thief, wouldn't be able to block or blacklist the money like they can do with fiat money... I also believe this is part of some speculation by them. I wouldn't be surprised if the employees of the office tasked with selling bitcoin had shorts on bitcoin futures set up before they started dumping on spot, which is exactly why they did not do what the FBI did many times before and put seized coins on auction. They wanted to influence the spot market. Maybe for their own benefit, maybe under pressure from EU central bank who as we all know hates crypto. Was this a mistake? I don't think so. If they really wanted to hold enough bitcoin that could mean anything to a country, they'd need to go way beyond 100k coins. They'd need to invest at least 1% of GDP every year.",

Years later, looking back, don't see it as mistake if at the time you sell anything, it helped you to solve some problems in your life.But to avoid regret, to buy massive chance in future, you can reserve a small part as your lottery ticket to future.

The German economy has a rather long and complex history for one decision in 12 months to have such weight.They have already waited for a certain period, why would they wait another year? Because forum users think it's better that way?It should also be kept in mind that the German government's decision to sell Bitcoin is not simple, and it certainly did not happen that the decision was made today and the next day Bitcoin went on sale. It is very possible that the initiative was launched approximately at the time of ATH, but a period of obtaining the consent of all authorities, ratification in the parliament or whatever process was needed. A process that certainly lasts a certain period.",

Do you remember the BTC price in July 2023? I don't remember the exact price, but I remember that it was in the range of 25-30K USD. Selling BTC at 55K-59K USD seems like a good deal for the German government.I don't really believe that the German government would be HODLing BTC and waiting for the price to hit 100K only for the sake of maximizing profits.
