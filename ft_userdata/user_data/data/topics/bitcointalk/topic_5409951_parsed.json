Would it better to store different altcoins in different wallets or decrease the hassle of maintaining different wallets and settle down with just one with all the coins.Yes it would. The main concern is when your wallet got compromised or hacked and then you shall not worry if all of your funds will be affected. I were always storing different altcoins in the different wallet with different seedphrase or privatekey to counter when sometime my wallet got hijacked.",

Trust wallet is my main wallet for Altcoins whenever I trade, its good and secured as well. Though some tokens have their own wallet, you just need to know that but if its about savings or investing for long term, I suggest to stay with the hardwallet.",

Wouldn't recommend Trust Wallet as it is still vulnerable to hacking. Even if I haven't connected my Trust Wallet to my computer, it was still drained along with a couple of my Metamask wallet when I have accidentally clicked the fake PDF which is a malware. I've lost more than $12k back then. If I could have stored them in my hardware wallet, I would still be having those altcoins like ETH, EXRD, VRA, etc.",

My choice would be Exodus but let me know which one is best.Exodus is closed source which means you never really know what goes on since it's only the team who has complete control of the codes. You have to put your complete trust into them that they won't make a mistake or f*ck up in the long term. Are you willing to take that risk? At least go for open source.Quote2.

My second thought is, that altcoins aren't deserved to hold for a long term, they usually won't survive years as I've noticed, diversify them into Bitcoin if I were you is a wise decision.",

The only drawback is that Ledger is proprietary, which is a huge privacy red flag. As mentioned by these threads [1], you can also choose an open source hardware wallet.Because I didn't have many altcoins to begin with, I have personal experience utilizing the Trezor One more regularly than my Ledger Nano S. But if you want to use alternatives like Monero (XMR), you must regrettably get the Trezor T because it is the only Trezor model that supports it. Additionally, third-party applications like Near or any other wallet-type application occasionally have issues with Trezor or may not be supported.In the end, it largely relies on your preferences, how you want to use your wallet, and which cryptocurrencies you intend to store.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288971.0",

I also don't see anything wrong if you put it in different wallets as long as it's safe to use a wallet like this Metamask.",
