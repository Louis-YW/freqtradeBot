      "body": "^^^ In some ways I would agree with you. There are questions about whether or not a lot of things that have change for the better would have remained the same... like a serious overturn of Roe v. Wade.What I mean is, for a nation that was started to a great extent on freedom and God-among-the-people, we have moved into somewhat of a political police state. And if you look at things that Trump says, he wants to give police more power. And he certainly isn't promoting common law for average people... which is what the foundation of the United States Republic is really all about.Of course, Biden doesn't really care about the people... as long as he gets his money. Same said, Congress, and loads of people in Government.Of course, we can't do it both ways. So, nobody knows what would have happened if Trump were at the helm of the US. However, it has always been up to the people to change things. And it's taking us people a long time to get moving.",

Time does not go backwards, and if Trump was really able to make the world a better place, he would have stayed in power for at least another term, but as usual, he is skilled in spoiling everything.I have already explained to you in a previous comment that this man is a racist par excellence and possesses such arrogance that he does not see further than a meter from his feet. You can review both the climate deal and the Iran nuclear deal that Mr. Trump pulled out of to drive the world even more crazy.I hope you'll review your thoughts on this moron.",

In order for any of what you said to come true, Trump will need to be legitimately elected.Biden has been the most ineffective President since King George III. I don't think the reason that China and Russia worked so hard to get Biden elected was solely to prevent a second Trump term, they wanted time to be able to advice their own world interests.",

Bring back the first guy ever to attempt a coup d'Ã©tat in the US, the guy that recommended to take chlorine and not to worry about COVID and was name-calling and cancelling anyone who showed dissent, even in his own party.Trump, BoJo, Bolsonaro, ... all of them live on people looking for simple answers to complex questions. To the topic, I think we would be even in a greater mess or perhaps using nuclear suits to go buy at Walmart.In any other democracy, Trump would have been accused of sedition or even treason and sent to prison = and he may, because after the hearings about the Capitol riots he can be both sentenced in Georgia (for soliciting changing the electoral records) and at federal level for sedition.",

Quirky of course, and too Twitter-addicted, but damn it, someone had to tell America that there are only two genders - men and women, as Trump did today.Following the same logic, I would say that given most of the presidents of the United States since its independence, Donald Trump is on the list of perhaps the best bad guys. In my opinion, he sets a good bad example for the rise to power of the opportunistic conservative party. In a previous comment, I explained Trump's position on many major issues and how he made matters worse. This includes the climate agreement and the Iranian nuclear file, in addition to the issue of immigrants and the right to own weapons.",
