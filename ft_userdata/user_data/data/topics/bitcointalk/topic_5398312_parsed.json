We start from our families, then it spreads to the society.The problem really is that society is set up so that acquisition of money is seen as the main measure of success, and this is exacerbated by the fact that money is of course quantifiable, so it's easy to measure your \"success\" against someone else's. It needs quite a paradigm shift for people to see being ethical as more desirable than being wealthy. I'm not sure how this can be achieved really, although the looming climate crisis might help to engender change.",

A more appropriate topic would have been - The Right thing Vs The Easy thing, because the person doing the right thing is smart, making a good long term choice.

The same thing applies to our modern life. We always love easy things and run after them, so many science fiction writers predicted that we will one day become a hostage of machines.but learning the multiplication table via song/repetition is not stretching the mind to learn.its just memory of a song. its not actually teaching different ways to work things out.its not challenging. its simply try to remember something for long enough to pass a test.EG learning a song about naming the states of america.. is not really geography.. its not actually teaching a skill about how to learn things. its just hearing a song and remembering the words. hoping you can remember the song in a few years.for instance all the kids that learn the US state song. dont have a clue about what shape the state borders are. or which state border leans against which next state. the song does not help them plan a journey from NY to CAdue to learning how to read from top left to the right, and then repeat down.. many young kids think/guess the US states are ordered were alabama must be is at the north west and wyoming is in the south east. due to the songs alphabetical ordering of the song and how they learned it via lyrics in that order.arithmatic. via song, hurts a childs growth. and limits their mind expansion. even trying to learn how to calculate on paper has its time wasting limitations too. calculators do exist and so its ok that these should be used. where the excess time saving due to technology can allow for real learning of more needed skills.(new neurons and synapses linked to problem solving are not grown from song lyrics.. but memory synapses are.)if you want kids to have good problem solving skills, then teach them lots of ways to solve lots of things. why waste 6 months of kindergarten singing songs. when you can teach kids how to make money, save money and avoid risks of debt. learn how to respect each other and help each other. and other real life skills.EG in my college years i learned more at home in the 6 months pre-college preparing for college(to get ahead), than i did actually during the course. i was teaching the teacher new techniquesEG further back..my favourite young school age lesson was making easter eggs and selling them at the school spring fair. and then using that money to buy books our class needed for summer.it taught us alot more than simply a 1+1=2 song, alot more skills were learned in product design, measurements, economics, all in a 2 hour morning session(and yes we learned math too)",

(using the 2 options above.. woman want A(it to stop). men want B(join in and subjugate women into hiding))where as other regions think separating the genders by threat is immoral and teen flirtation is freedom and morally good.take abortions and life support machines.(in a pro-life US state)some think defending the right of life to keep the unviable body alive, that cannot self sustain and requires a support system (machine or pregnant mother) is the right of life and should continue no matter what the next of kin/pregnant mother wants/decides.(men that cant get pregnant where the question of abortion doesnt affect them personally want B(ban abortions).. women that are at risk of unwanted pregnancy because it can affect them want A(allow abortions))(in a free choice US state)some think that the standard of life where the next of kin should decide when/if its time to detach the unviable body from the support(machine or pregnant mother) based on the chances of a good/bad life the body might have and how that supported life might limit the chances of a good life for the next of kin. (those that never personally experienced this think the ease answer is keep them alive, they might become self sustainable.. those that have experienced it may decide its for the best to end the live out of compassion, to end the torture it may get if it continued)after all IF you (hypothetical person) are a pro-lifer. the world should send you all the elderly, comatose patients,  premature babies, etc.  for you (hypothetical person)  to house feed and maintain.. after all, you want all these lives to continue, right? so you manage it. and no you (hypothetical person) cant decline the offer, you (hypothetical person) are a pro-lifer, you (hypothetical person) have to accept. no choice, right?..what im trying to say is. different regions have different 'morals' and definitions of right/wrong on many subjects. you can try to teach these morals. but if there is no consequences to the bad stuff your society has pegged as being bad. people will create their own moral reason to think its acceptable.EG. murder. many americans think killing is a moral right. EG someone enters your house to steal.. a petty item worth $20. they believe its their right to kill someone for $20, due to invasion of property. on the flip side. just displaying a gun makes a witness fear his life. where the witness then becomes a murderer by defending himself from a threat of just seeing a gun(cops main excuse to kill a suspect). (yep egg and chicken.. americans allowed guns but cops can shoot someone showing their gun)in the days of the wild west. yea let everyone shot each other.. no consequence. no second thought. no law. where if you shoot someone obviously they died before they shot you, so you get to live, and you get to continue living free.. no consequencebut in modern times. there needs to be consequences. where if you shot someone you need to be punished for that. where by if you are witness to a gun. you dont automatically just shoot.. instead you think about the possible consequences. such as possibility of you being in prison for a 'bad shoot' and so you instead take other actions. like hide, run. call in backup. try to disarm. hand them your wallet and car keys and bid them a good day.. anything but just shoot....now lets take that cop vs patriot analogy..the 'right thing' well patriots have their right to have a gun, their right to defend themselves against a militia(cops). .. the cops 'right thing' is to defend himself. as he is an officer doing a job and does not deserve to die for just answering a call from 911 dispatcherthe smart thing:patriots stop waving your guns around like idiots. thinking its a flag.cops, stop shooting people just for having a gun. both sides. THINK and be smartsmarter option. no one have guns",
