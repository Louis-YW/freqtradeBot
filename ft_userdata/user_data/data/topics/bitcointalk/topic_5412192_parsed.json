  "content": "Looking for some help with Rollbit account banned.So I use rollbit to bet on sports and I have been making some money doing it.My mom knows that I have made some money, watched me bet on games and stuff and wanted to start betting and help her make an account and all that, show her what im betting on and stuff.Before we set up an account for her, my rollbit account was \"limited\" not banned, so my max bet was reduced making it basically useless to bet. It was limited a few hours after I placed 2 bets on the same game, 1 bet lost and 1 bet won, but the bet that won was cancelled a few hours after it was paid out as a winner. They took the profit back on the winning bet, and and kept the loss of the other bet that lost. I contacted them about the bet and they basically said the \"odds were incorrect\" and would not elaborate more, but that's a whole other story.Anyways so I helped my mom set up an account as she is not very tech savy lol, but she has seeing me use rollbit a lot to place my bets and is most familiar with that site and wanted to use them.she gave me some money, around $1200 CAD to deposit for her as she does not own any crypto, and i sent it to rollbit from my wallet (problem #1 maybe? but i havent seeing anything about this being against TOS)We were getting ready to place a live bet but the situation changed in the game making it a non bet for me. She then asked me if she could withdraw the money at anytime, how long would it take, if she could take it all out at one time, if the money was safe on the site, all that stuff and being very skeptical as she always is with crypto and having money online sites and all that. I reassured her and then showed her that she could withdraw it all at any time, but since was new account it said must wager $10. So we wagered $10 on a game and when the bet was settled we cashed out, told  her it would take max 30 mins to come to my account, as rollbit for me has been really quick with cashouts.Hours went by and nothing, so we contacted support and were told it needed to be manually done (new to me) by a colleague but they are unavailable right now. (mom is panicking at this point)next morning they ask for KYC, so my mom completes the KYC and tells them its complete. Time goes by and now they ask for a selfie of her holding her ID, she completed that. Next day rollbit says your account is banned for KYC circumvention and they dont complete the withdraw. Shes upset, and rollbit will not explain what is wrong with her ID and completely ignores her.I gave my mom the $1200 back she gave to me to deposit.We dont know how else to get this money back from rollbit, or if we ( or I ) were in the wrong and broke TOC for sending from my wallet?would love some help if possible",

Do they say anything about only one account per household or per device or something?  If that is the case, then yes, they can restrict/ban your account. But I don't think they should be confiscating your funds. That is a little too much. Imagine someone visits your house, bets on Rollbit and wanted to check his account. Logs in and you both lose all your funds. But what did they mean by KYC circumvention? Did you or your mom try to use fake IDs or something? As long as both accounts are registered with different ID's i don't think it should be a problem.",

I don't have an account on Rollbit but if there's no mention of multiple accounts then he has a case against Rollbit to cut it short by just allowing him to withdraw, that's a good gesture from Rollbit, it's not really a huge amount and it's for her mother not to lose trust on Cryptocurrency casinos, they did not post here they just send the money huge respect to Rollbit for doing that, but players should see to it that all their activities are according to what stated in the TOS and make sure that there's no unusual activity in your account.",
