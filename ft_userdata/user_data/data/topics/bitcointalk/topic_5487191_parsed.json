      "body": "Quote from: ulungo on March 01, 2024, 01:49:41 PMI don't know how to remove, this is some image hosting website.I only received what can be seen in the photo.Well, if you had the number, you could download a piece of software called \"electrum\", when you would open the software, you'd be greeted with a wizard. You'd have to follow the wizard to restore your wallet. In the wizard, there would be a point where you'd have to enter your seed phrase. The seed phrase is the phrase shown in the picture you posted. There would be an 'options' button on the same screen where you'd have to enter the seed phrase, if you'd click this button you could indicate that it was a bip39 seed with an extension word. The extension word would probably be the 6 numbers the note you posted is talking about. When you'd enter these 6 numbers, you'd be able to spend the 0.1 btc (>$6000 at current rate).Now, without those 6 numbers, you cannot spend the funds... But since you've posted the seed phrase, anybody with enough time on their hands could write a brute force program to test the ~1 million combinations the 6 numbers could form. After writing the program, it would probably take less than an hour to test them all and steal your money. I'd still urge you to try to get that image off that image hosting site you posted it on, then try to find those 6 numbers yourself and if you succeed, move that money to any other bitcoin wallet (you can use electrum to generate a NEW wallet using the same wizard, but chosing to create a new wallet instead of restoring an existing one), since you basically showed the whole world the seed phrase and it won't take to long before somebody tries to steal the money.Now before you ask, i'm not going to write a program and try to bruteforce the extension word... Odds are to big you're just trolling, and if not odds are really big somebody will beat me to the punch, so it's not worth investing my time into this. If you are able to get the image removed, it might be a good idear to see if you find somebody that's willing to help you out in exchange for part of the money (but it will be hard to convince them you're for real). By the way, before you ever pay somebody for this task, do realise odds are somebody is pranking you, or somebody already beat you to the punch and the wallet in question is already empty.",

The rest is identical, except you say you don't have the seed extension word offcourse (the letter you got says it should be word made up of 6 numbers).If you mean a video explaining how to brute force an extension word? Not that i know off, it's a rather technical process... Don't let anybody fool you by either selling you software or by taking money to brute force the number for you... A lot of these guys are scammers.",

(never had balance on any keys in seed range.)so looks like its an initiation to a scam and not a random stranger lottery winthe seed was never funded, so its not like it was funded and someone else moved funds out. it was never funded, so no 0.1btc for you to have ever claimedi would suggest, if the letter gives instructions to contact them.. dont, and dont hand them any money as they are not handing you any fundsfourthly:dont now use that seed in a wallet because now the seed(12 words) are public, it makes that seed now vulnerable so dont self fund or as others to fund addresses associated with that seed",

I will suggest OP contact the sender for more information about the letter if he is serious.I suspect that it is an invitation to scam.

We often see such scams on social media platforms where a person would act like they are too naive sharing their seed phrase saying they have some money but aren't able to withdraw them and need someone to help them but when that seed phrase is inserted in a wallet, the wallet gets compromised.So one should be careful when they receive something like this because they might become a victim of a unique scam if they insert the seed phrase in a wallet where they already have funds.",
