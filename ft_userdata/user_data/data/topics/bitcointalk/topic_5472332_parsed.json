  "content": "I opened my email this morning, and I am seeing lots of mail from different exchanges I have accounts with and also some exchanges that' I don't have accounts on. The message on the mail is about Halloween wishes and events to participate in and win some free gifts (in crypto) for Halloween. These are mostly Halloween giveaways from those exchanges.I know that some of those emails could be real, but I don't have time to verify which is real and which is not. I totally avoid them all. For me to receive a mail from Coinbase and Bingx on the email that I have not registered with on Coinbase and Bingx makes me believe that it could be a scam. Even on the email that I used to register at Coinbase, I did not receive any mail from Coinbase regarding Halloween or any giveaways, although I received from Bingx. Guys, kindly be aware that hackers always like to take advantage of any slight opportunity they can get. They will be sending some phishing links to your email, asking you to claim a Halloween gift, and if you mistakenly tap on those links, you might be granting them access to your device.Protect your bitcoin. Happy Halloween.",

Please try the following code: Code:[img width=*your size in number*]For example I would useCode: [img width=300]I just quoted your image below for you to understand it. Quote from: Dr.Bitcoin_Strange on October 31, 2023, 01:08:39 PMComing back to your topic, scammers are known to use events as another option to scam innocent and greedy individuals. This is how they make millions without any pain or investment as they don't have any kind of humanity. Without such kind of initiative by scammers how will the community know the different ways to scam everyone who have no idea that they got scammed. @OP, please ensure that the next image that you upload to thr forum should be a png image whereas you posted an image which is jpeg image.",

You can't really blame people, they want the free stuff and there are people out there that's really generous, it's not good that we blame them just because they want the free stuff, you're missing the point here which is the scammers taking advantage of people that just want to participate in a giveaway. Of course it's not like these people are blameless though, they need to be vigilant and always remember that an offer that you can easily get is probably a fishy offer.",

They understand the euphoria that comes with events and celebrations, and they try to always take advantage of it. I am extra careful these days because I understand that the economy is bad in most places and many companies are no longer in the business of doing extravagant giveaways and bonuses.",

Any news that attracts the attention of crypto enthusiasts creates room for scammers to take advantage of it. This has been happening for years, and scammers are not resting. We have good news on crypto; they use it to start their own scamming scheme, and many people will fall victim. The same thing happens when we also experience some sort of attack from crypto haters that can trigger a market drop. Even though such news is not an exemption, they still make use of it to plot a scam scheme. The thing is, most of us who spend time here on the forum have a higher chance of not getting scammed. The reason is that we are aware of all their tricks. Most people who fall prey to such scam schemes are those who are always looking for ways to earn free crypto any where, forgetting the fact that the days for free coins are far gone. Chasing free money (airdrops) leads many to falling into scammers hands. We can never be too careful, but being careful enough can save us a lot of later regrets.",

People need to be extra careful because of how sophisticated email scams can be these days (including an option of looking as if it's from a corporate email, unless a company specifically ensured that it's not possible), and there are a lot of actual promos for Halloween all over the place, such as special deals and discounts at shops, cafés, etc.And while the fact of scams is common knowledge, some days require extra attention, so thanks, op, for posting.",

They usually target when the optimism is high and when people are probably looking for the next PEPE to ride to the moon. Don't loose the money you have because you want to become rich overnight.",

[...]Exchange platforms carry out these events, like Halloween and others, as marketing campaigns for them. Binance platform has also launched this event and other exchange platforms. However, scammers exploit these events and what the exchange platforms do to launch phishing sites.As for the message you received @OP regarding the Halloween giveaway event, the Bingx platform has already posted it on their X account and included the event link of their official website, like the content of the message you received, which you did not mention its email or link. If you do not have time to verify the message, it would be safer for you, as you did, to ignore it completely, especially if you do not remember whether you registered on their platform or not. In addition, I have not tried the Bingx platform before. But based on what I have seen on [Trustpilot], it has a very poor rating and receives negative feedback from many users. This is also a sign to stay away from using it and stick to reputable exchange platforms.",

I don't agree with you, because giving merits to participants of the Halloween contest by some member is totally up to that member; he gives merits with his own will, and no one is forcing him to give merit to some \"X\" member's entry. If he likes it, he might give it merit. But yeah, many newbies will register just to participate in this contest, and they will be totally new and take part in the contest and win some merits, but that's totally due to the work they have put in. That means there is still a possibility of getting no merit at all.Because one here assures or gives a guarantee that merits will be shared by comparing it with phishing scams, like the second bolded statement of \"promising to offer bitcoin as a reward for the contest\" says, those people ensure or give a 100% guarantee that you will get free Satoshies or BTC if you join via this link. These are two opposite things, and I hope you are getting my point.And for OP, thanks for sharing this information because I am already aware of the scams but was not giving any attention to such scammy links, so thanks for the reminder.",
