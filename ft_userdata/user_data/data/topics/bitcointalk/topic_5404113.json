  "content": "Altcoin is the Bitcointalk Community Sub Forum where i use to post some hot and trending topics which i do personally like. Usually i use to create topics contain some Questions which i used to ask to communicate with Users and unfortunately due to Less active time I can't reply all.Point to be Noticed Well thats not the Topic Today i can see many repeat topics i think community should improve the Content as Instead of creating news Topics we should focus Guding the community and educating new users.Experienced Memebers Responsibility.What new users i can see many topics are always Created by the newbies or Jr memebers to earn merit points that not wrong but i think the Memebers with experience should contribute by their experience to work with the Community as on Gambling, Speculation Sub Forums usually we can learn more about BTC / and projects by Legendary members.On Altcoin talk i am expecting there Experience members should create Thread which need to be Most active all the time where New members can learn from their Seniors.Lests Hope for Altcointalk to be better Education Source.",
