The way you explained it, there are three accounts in question. You just need two. Your main account (_act_) merits your alt account (_act_ alt account). No need to get another alt account involved. The community doesn't want to see that, and it's a good way to lower your forum reputation.",

Is it possible to merit yourself?No, you can't evaluate yourself as a merite. As well as exchanging it with another forum member for no reason. Merit is a utility assessment tool. If no one believes that the posts of a certain person do not deserve to be evaluated, then they will remain unappreciated by Merit. In fact, it is very easy to earn, and you should not try to cheat the system.",

Always remember that give merits to deserved posts only and exclude meriting own posts because it doesn't make sense.This reminds me of the the story of a lizard that fell from a very tall tree. Having landed, no one clapped. It just did a few push ups, nodded and crawled out. As ridiculous as the story sounds, it could be likened to this scenario. It is better to just know for yourself that you made a great post, and wait for merits to confirm how great it was. Criticisms and good replies/comments would suffice both ways, but if the latter is more than the former, then you made a very good shitty post and should do better.No, you can't merit yourself, because, you aren't a lizard, you need people to confirm your worthiness and merit is like keys, it is not just handed to a stranger passing by.",

Is it possible to merit yourself?Of course it's not possible and you must have known that by now. It's just a rewarding power and what better way to having the thrill of merits if not gotten from other users. Trust me, its something you or any of us would want to be possible. If you think merit is sacred now, it would be even worst should users be allowed to merit themselves.The best is what we have now and it makes meriting a lot more meritable and users are challenged to better themselves by being more constructive in there write up.Meriting one's self is a bad idea that shouldn't be put into context of considered.",

Merit could have been theoretically used for a similar purpose, but it's limited to only the last 120 days, so it can't work like that.Maybe we do need a \"like\" system parallel with merit, because it does have upsides and not a lot of downsides.",
