It is a pity that so far almost all projects are limited to the blockchain Binance, at first glance this project is another clone of STEPN, which is not surprising. After all, it is the only one that was able to raise a billion-dollar capitalization.And what will be the pre-sale price? I could not find this information anywhere, unfortunately.",
