There has been multiple articles and such detailing the reserves at multiple points and there are ways to somewhat verify it. However.Nothing stops Tether, or any other stablecoin (other than DAI IMO) from pulling the rug on reserves and making a huge power and money play. That's quite a pessimistic force though, and the thunder would reign shortly following (I would assume, and hope).I say other than DAI as DAI is collateralized, backed by other crypto assets and managed by a smart contract that has stood the test of time for quite a while to date (RIP Nikolai Musheigan btw, if you don't know about this story, read about t)",

I see that they minted another billion USDT in the last week.All the other arguments of anti Bitcoiner (energy, volatility, ...) I can counter.Is Tether also the thing you are most unsure of?Would like some input, THANKS  The problem with tether is that it will be difficult to verify if Bitfinex has enough reserve funds to back the stablecoin. The so-called reserve data can be faked or manipulated. Most of these centralised platforms publish fake audits or data to deceive customers. Some numbers shown in some of the insurance funds or proof of reserve are randomly generated to make these platforms look healthy, this was the case with FTX.Some of these centralised crypto firms even go to the extent of borrowing money to balance and publish a clean account and these funds will be withdrawn and given back to the creditor. It was suspected that crypto.com borrowed $400m from Gate.io to aid it in publishing a clean PoR audit report. Binance and Bitfinex are also guilty of moving funds immediately after publishing so-called audit reserves reports. These centralised platforms cannot be trusted because they engage in so many shady practices.  Check this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5469988.msg62978993#msg62978993",

They are still inflating the tether bubble but they need to gain something from it if they want to burst it. Unless bursting it will become for profitable for them, they will keep pumping it. I wouldn’t hold any tethers just in case. You’ll never know when will these crooks get mad. Hold only hard currencies like btc, ltc and xmr instead of holding tether. Tether may go down tomorrow or 20 years later. We can’t predict the exact date but that doesn’t mean we can’t protect ourselves. It is indeed crazy to see that they can print a billion usd  out of thin air and nobody calls them out. Let’s see how long that will last.",

I remember few years ago there were talks of banning crypto in India and the value of Tether against the Indian rupees dropped by more than 50% which shouldn't the case with a stable coin if it's backed by reserves and they can easily manipulate to show the reserves it's not rocket science, it's not only tether but all the other crypto stable coins as it's just a matter of time one reputed stable coin goes down they it will create such a panic thay people will start dumping all the stable coin altogether.
