  "content": "The launch of a BTC Spot ETF has coincided with a significant rise in BTC price. Some believe the ETF is a major driver behind this surge, with BTC price even reaching a new ATH before the upcoming halving event - a phenomenon never seen before. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Michael Saylor's company, MicroStrategy, continues to aggressively accumulate BTC. They are even engaged in a kind of arms race with BlackRock to hold the most BTC [1, 2]. Saylor's unwavering commitment to BTC has earned him the reputation of being the most prominent \"diamond hands\" investor in the crypto world, surpassing even El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, in terms of fame.Michael Saylor has outlined the distinctions between investing in MSTR stock and a BTC Spot ETF [3]. While he emphasizes MSTR's advantages, the question remains: for investors, which is better - MSTR, whose value hinges heavily on its BTC holdings, or BTC itself?In terms of profit: MicroStrategy's investment in BTC has been highly profitable. Since starting to buy BTC in August 2020, the company's stock (MSTR) has surged over 1220%. This is a significantly higher return than the roughly 500% gain in BTC price itself over the same period. This amplified gain is due to MicroStrategy's use of debt financing to buy more BTC. This strategy, called leverage, magnifies both profits and losses. While it has driven impressive returns so far, it also increases risk if the BTC price falls.In terms of credibility: some view MicroStrategy, a well-established company, as a more credible investment than BTC itself. They believe investors gain exposure not just to BTC but also to the experience of MicroStrategy's leadership [4]. However, Bitcoin's strength lies in its decentralized nature. Existing for over a decade, it operates independently of any individual, company, or government. This decentralization fosters trust for many investors, myself included, compared to a traditional public company.While investing in MSTR could potentially offer higher returns, I prioritize self-custodying my BTC for greater control over my holdings. This means I rely on my own judgment, rather than trusting someone else's decisions, even a respected figure like Michael Saylor. Saylor has publicly stated MicroStrategy has no plans to sell its BTC [5]. However, I believe it's a question of when, not if, such a sale might occur due to unforeseen circumstances or a strategic shift by the company.When will Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy sell BTC?I would like to know your views on investing in BTC and MSTR:Do you choose to invest in BTC or MSTR? Why?Will MSTR continue to generate better returns than BTC?Is an investment in MSTR safer than an investment in BTC?References:[1] BlackRock and MicroStrategy in Neck and Neck Race As Firms’ Bitcoin Holdings Soar to Over $29,170,000,000 in BTC[2] Public Companies that Own Bitcoin[3] MicroStrategy Makes Its Case as Alternative to Spot Bitcoin ETFs[4] Is MicroStrategy (MSTR) A Better Investment Than Bitcoin? Experts Debate[5] Michael Saylor Suggests MicroStrategy Will Never Sell Its Bitcoin",

There's not a part of MicroStrategy's company that I'd really want.2. At some point, it won't. Unless MicroStrategy's portfolio of bitcoin companies do extremely well, the attraction of MSTR as some sort of BTC play will slowly die down due to the ETFs.3. Define \"safer\".",

      "body": "Investing in Bitcoin and storing it in a secure wallet is the safest option. The reason is that it is decentralized and is not being controlled by a single entity. MSTR might be able to generate a higher return but it is not decentralized as it is controlled by Microstrategy. When you invest in Bitcoin you get the real product which is Satoshi whereas with MSTR you will only get a paper in return. If you think in the long term investing in Bitcoin will be more profitable than a stock in Bitcoin.",

Probably, but in downturns the leverage can make it go down more, it is a double-edged sword.3. No.That said, I owned shares of MSTR and sold them at a profit. I don't think it is incompatible. If you are going to invest in Bitcoin, the best thing to do is to have most of it in Bitcoin that you hold with your keys.

If you want to buy MSTR because you truly believe in the future of the company and that you are positive of its growth and development over the years, then buy MSTR. But if you buy MSTR because you are a fan of Saylor preaching about Bitcoin and that MicroStrategy is sufficiently exposed to Bitcoin, then it's all pointless. You better buy Bitcoin for yourself and keep it safe. For me, Bitcoin is a world safer than MSTR. It only takes one serious problem in at least one of so many points of failure that MicroStrategy has for MSTR to plunge and become worthless. That's not the case with BTC. As to returns, I think Bitcoin has a much bigger room for long-term price growth than MSTR.",

They haven’t sold anything yet but who knows. Maybe one day out of the blue they will start to sell their bitcoins. So you are better off being in control and just buying bitcoin directly.",

Only Investors from the traditional financial sector can invest in MSTR, for whom BTC is something incomprehensible, but on which they want to earn (indirectly) extra money. MSTR provides this opportunity for such cautious investors, but in the eyes of the BTC-community it will forever remain like trash. Choosing MSTR instead of BTC is like choosing a rubber woman instead of a real. 2. This is the same as asking whether the secondary and by-product will be more valuable than the original one. I guess not.3. Controversial issue. On the one hand, when investing in MSTR, an intermediary appears who can both ruin everything and be an additional guarantor of reliability. I think it’s only because of the second factor that this asset will be in demand.",

Bukele sees Bitcoin not just as an investment but as money which is what Bitcoin really is whereas others such as Microstrategy guys see it as a means to make more (dollar) profit. This is why Bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador not an \"investment\"...QuoteIn terms of profit: MicroStrategy's investment in BTC has been highly profitable.

This is a significantly higher return than the roughly 500% gain in BTC price itself over the same period.If you start looking at it during the pumping period of MSTR that looks good; but if you look at bitcoin price in 2020 that started in $3k range and is currently $70k that is 2200% rise which MSTR rise despite its pump can not even compare to.It is also not a good thing that the profit here is not coupled with bitcoin profit because it can dump regardless of what bitcoin does too... For example bitcoin could reach a million while MSTR dumps down to zero.Quotesome view MicroStrategy, a well-established company, as a more credible investment than BTC itself.It is still a centralized company subject to all centralized regulations and consequences. If anyone wants to invest in a centralized company they should do that but they shouldn't even bring bitcoin up or compare it with bitcoin.In other words regarding your main question, I'd say the question is wrong. You should never choose between the two because they are NOT in the same category.Make your investment in bitcoin and also on top of that and separately  make your investment in MSTR or whatever stock you like (Apple, Google, ...) as your stock market involvement.",

The basic step is to learn how to secure my funds and I have no issue with keeping my wallet. MSTR might have a good management who is pro-Bitcoin but humans cannot be totally trusted because they can change. It will be better to invest directly in Bitcoin and have peace of mind than to depend on a third party that can mismanage my money.b. MSTR shares will always rise and fall with the price of Bitcoin. Although the company might make a profit from investing in other sectors there is no guarantee that it will generate more profit than Bitcoin. a. Some people claim that they prefer investing in Bitcoin through third parties because they can't keep their keys or protect their wallets. In that case, Investing through MSTR might be safer for them. But I will always prefer to be in absolute control of my coins because third parties cannot be trusted.",
