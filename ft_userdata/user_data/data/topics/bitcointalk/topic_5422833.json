Won't you be tempted? Indeed there are people who managed to do so but keep in mind the some of those investors forgotten their asset so that won't count in my opinion. There are even stories such as the man who swapped Bitcoins to a box of pizza. That's how hopeless before for this industry. There are only few people who really seen the potential of this industry at its early age, 'coz if there are many, how come that only a few are holding huge amount of BTCs on their wallet and most of them are whales or simply rich in the first place.",

At that time when bitcoin was close to three digit price in USD, people were buying but the exposure of bitcoin to the global population was limited and hence there were smaller booms in price. With gradual mainstream appearances of bitcoin we have seen the bigger price ranges to be achieved, which adds up.Although the price going up made a lot of people regret their mistake of not buying at the low, not every country is lenient about crypto and if you live in one such, then you have no other option.Again it is also true that someone who bought at say 500$/BTC, would defenitely sell at 10k$ without looking back. But if they bought back at lower price, then only they might have held to sell again at 20k$. What I mean is that many people have completely exit the market at much lower highs.",

There were big players in the share market who bought shares worth millions of dollars, however there was big issue with this purchase - the money was \"temporarily\" taken from the bank. Ideally the broker had to send the money to next bank in exchange of Bank Receipt (BR), but it had a timeline (30-45 days). By that time many of these traders used this money to trade into the market and once they made the profit they used to return the money and exchange the BR. However, market was getting pumped due to \"virtual\" buys since big bulls made the buzz with temporary money. In reality, there was no money in the circulation. That created huge bubble. The economy crashed soon after this bubble was burst open!",

The problem in the mentioned situation by OP is that the impacts would be much deeper, since we are talking about 50% of world's population.

I love research, please share you knowledge. And where do you think all the whole money would have come from to make fifty percent of the world population millionaires by now? Or didn't you ever think about that? Because if I'm not mistaken, the total world population back then in 2015 was around 5 billion, of which we only had just 21 million Bitcoin in circulation, whereby not all was even mined by then. So a higher adoption would have only caused a drastic increase in price, just to enable the limited supply go round, and likewise a massive sell cause a decrease In price value too. But till this very date, I can proudly say that not up to half or 10% of the 8 billion world population today knows or owns a fraction of Bitcoin due to many reasons or laws safeguarding people living in different parts of the world.",

If you buy bitcoin now you can make big profit after 5 years. No, a lot of people bought it that year, and they already predicted the price of bitcoin, just as we do right now. I've known bitcoin since 2016, but as a newcomer, I had second thoughts about buying a whole bitcoin at that time because the price was around $500, which is a huge amount to me; it's two months' salary at my job, so I only earn it from faucets. I have a lot of online friends who became millionaires, bought houses, and bought sports cars when it hit ATH last 2017 or in 2018. What I regret the most is that I squandered my bitcoins on frivolous purchases; if I had kept them, I'm sure I'd be wealthy right now.",

If people had known Bitcoin will surge this  way almost fifty or more percent of world population would have become a millionaire. I love research, please share you knowledge. It's always nice to bring the Bitcoin price into perspective by comparing 5 or 10 years ago to today. Even though BTC had a terrible year and is down 65% year to date, we are still up 50% over the last 5 years. Over the last several weeks the number of threads of people asking \"is bitcoin going to survive\" increased a lot, it feels a bit like people lost confidence in bitcoins. Looking at past prices should calm our nerves even if we didn't buy so cheap. There is clearly a longterm upwards trend in bitcoin. Also thinking back 5 years should help us to decide that it's a good time to buy right now, rather than wait for price to drop to unrealistic low levels. I don't think that the bitcoin price would be the same today if more people bought in 2015. If most people bought their Bitcoin for 400 USD back in the day, why would anybody be buying now at 16,000 USD or 60,000 USD one year ago? Bitcoin wasn't popular back then, which is where the price rise is coming from once all the new investor joined the crypto community.",

And investing in 2015, people would have to wait patiently for at least a year to see any profit and at least for two years to see major gains. Not selling at the first sign of improvement, not panic selling in 2018 later would have both been very difficult.IMO, while the times of such low prices are over, there are still times when there's a great opportunity to buy Bitcoin. Such as right now, for instance, when the price is only a quarter of what it used to be, and given that with every bull market Bitcoin goes higher, that means it's reasonable to expect more than 4x profit in the next bull run if one invests now. And it can be more than that, I don't see why Bitcoin can't reach $160k, for example, bringing a 10x profit.",
