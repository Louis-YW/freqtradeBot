  "content": "So on this ticket, i i spent time to make a selection of 20 games, compiled all the games in one bet(multi bet), and stake a small amount of money on it, right now, five(5) games out of the 20 total games have won, so remaining 15 games to go, still a very long way though, but again, Stake is offering me a cash-out that is already slightly above the amount of money I staked on this game, I am wondering if i should take the cash-out offered to me and move onto the next one, or just allow the game to keep going, do you guys think i stand any chance of winning all 20 games..Below is the game ticket,",

And if you decide to cash out and hold on to the profit you have now and then the rest of the games come out well you’ll still have the regret of being too quick with your decision.If I may ask, are you satisfied with the profit you have now? If you think it’s significant enough for you, you can quit now and hold on to what you have but if you’re curious enough to what to see how it will turn out in the end then stick to it.But if your post is about asking for analysis on your predictions I’m not your guy, because for now I’ve taken a break from sport betting also with watching them, so you’ll have to wait for some else’s analysis.",

I'd cash out midway if I see some profits, I don't want to put myself in a stressful situation where I would be regretting my inability to have the courage to cash out when there is a chance. This is why I am amazed by those who make this type of long parlay and stick with their plan to continue it. I just cannot do that. Last time I had a parlay of combined table tennis and tennis with the total odds of 150. When I saw that the cashout option was available and it was already at 50x profits, I pressed it without any doubt. Luckily, I made the right decision as one leg didn't hit. But again, the feeling of being cornered will be there as you decide to cash it out or keep it going.",

It takes a special kind of dedication when you go try doing it on different sports though.I get it you have been following multiple sports but having completely 2 different sports seem too much for me.  UFC and boxing at least are still like combat sports but also football?",

Remember that you invest your time and effort on each of that pick so you value all of that picks. If I will be on your situation, I will just wait until my bet slip complete and I will accept the result win or lose because the thrill of winning and losing is what you are really paying on gambling. The money is just the bonus part. Good luck!",

      "body": "Looks like a safe bet if I look at the average odds, but still it is not a guarantee win and it is a risky bet due to so many games involved in the multi bet.Frankly speaking I tried many similar multi bets like what you have (with so huge odds) and unfortunately I have never won even once due to a lose in 1-2 games. I dont know all the selections in your multi bet so I can really give my opinion what would be the opportunity of your bet but I hope you'll win it eventually. What is annoying from multi bet is when we lose due to 1 bet with low odds",

You can refer to the total odds of his bet find the theoritical odds of picks using the individual odds assigned on each pick by the book maker. I think you are pertaining to the outcome(win/lose) for that 50/50 while the odds is different since every match is now connected to each other to complete this parlay that’s way the odds increase when you parlay 2 match compared if you bet on that 2 match individually.",

That is the value of the 5 games correctly predicted for now from the 20 games, meaning the cash out can disappear if your next ongoing game is not turning right. So for me, you have to make the choice of staying or continuing, 15 more games is too much to put my fingers on to predict and if I knew the result myself, I would have taken the shot directly  To conclude my submission since you played to increase your bankroll and the cash out is still within your staking value, I could still take the risk to allow if some games will turn out good to increase the cash out. This is not a professional advise anyway",

You can wait for some more results, and if they favor you, the value of the payout will increase, and you can withdraw it then.",

I used to spend a lot of money in accumulators. starting for double to 20 fold (maximum allowed by the bookmaker). But my usual accumulators are most of the time 5 to 7 selections. Once I was able to win an 8 fold. I was extremely lucky of course. Usually in an accumulator you will find yourself picked one wrong leg and when one wrong is there, everything is gone. So my suggestions is not to wait too long. If you see there is a good return then just cash it out if it is available.",

By the way, I was really surprised to see the multibet bet that you showed. To be honest, I'm not used to it. but the truth is, there is nothing wrong with what you do. and if you can get it, you are really very lucky. because rarely do gamblers win multi bet bets, with 20 games on one ticket. even if there are gamblers who have ever won it, the probability is very small. maybe, once in a lifetime. referring to what you said, I don't have the right advice. I think all decisions are in your hands. the most important thing is that whatever your decision will be, don't ever regret it.For me personally, I prefer to bet on single bets. even if I bet on the multi bet option, maybe I'll only choose 5 games, that's too many. ideally, 3 games only. thus the probability that I have is large enough to hit it, but it all comes back to each individual gambler. if you are sure of the bet you are making, you should continue. after all, you will not experience a loss, because you are betting on a small bet. well, if you keep doing it, good luck.",

If it's just a small sum of money I would give it a try to see what happens on the next games... Maybe you can still turn your small bet into a considerable sum of money. In this case, I really don't see a good reason to cashout right now, because a slight profit from a small bet is pretty annoying. Also, you don't need to go all the 20 games. Wait a few more and if you feel you should cashout, do it then.On the other hand, if the profit you have already made looks interesting, I would definitely cashout right now.",
