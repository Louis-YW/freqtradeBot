I would say that it doesn't look good, and might not even be legit.When you go to their website, the only thing you find is very basic informatoin about what is bitcoin. If you want to know more about what bitcoin smarter is, you need to give a lot of personal information: Full name, phone number and e-mail.Requesting personal information without  reason is a terrible start.",

I didn't also hear this platform before is this offering some good returns if you invest any amount on them? Since if that's the real case then you should avoid those platform which offer to good to be true profit because this is pure bullshit and may end up scam if you are not familiar with investments escpecially on crypto better search what's ponzi scheme all about and you will learn more things about that scheme and be help to avoid getting scam by any jerks wandering around here.",

It is a scam. Don't send them any money.Considering we do not know which website it is, this may seem to be an aggressive claim. However, history has taught us that you are probably right.OP, if they ask you money, it is best to stay away from such a site until you learn more about it. It might help to post a few more details here so we can make a more accurate judgment. And remember, if it's too good to be true, it probably is. Take care.",

Is this a trading tool or app? If it is then as newbie, it is not even recommended to use it because obviously you don't even have the basic experience to do manual trading, what's more using a tool that is going to be very difficult to use for a beginner. So my advise is, regardless if it is legit or scam, is to stay away from it and learn and understand how crypto trading works and gain some experience first.",
