  "content": "Just curious if anyone here won this auction and if you‚Äôre one willing to admit it, and two ..willing to say what your max bid was by chance ? ¬†I‚Äôm being nosy af and I obviously completely understand not wanting to share. But would love to know. I‚Äôve been after a single buyer funded king K for a good mn. Be awesome to know just for historical purposes and ‚Äúmarket setting‚Äù. ( Also be nice to know how short I was from winning lol). Regardless, nice win üí™Not sure if this link will work. eBay is funky w their links to auctions/items that have already closed (edit, trying to find a workable link).",

The two above are also called \"casascius\"",
