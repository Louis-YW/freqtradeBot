However, due to the current bear market climate, these special art pieces will be created upon request in small batches only. (Please allow 2-3 weeks for delivery.) This limited manufacturing process is much more expensive, but it protects against over-production in the current market. Regardless, the total production is still limited to only 21 pieces. And as a courtesy to our customers who wish to own and display the TWIN SET of Aluminum and Copper Editions with MATCHING SERIAL NUMBERS, we have automatically reserved the matching serial numbers below for all customers who ordered the original Aluminum MMC. (For example, if forum member BOBtheHODLer ordered the Aluminum Editions #3 and #8, then the Copper Editions #3 and #8 were automatically reserved below for BOBtheHODLer.)All serial numbers listed below as AVAILABLE may be purchased separately and without obligation to purchase the matching Aluminum Edition. However, if you'd like to purchase the matching Aluminum Edition along with your new Copper Edition, then please feel free to make the request.DETAILS Project Name: Bitcoin Penny® MINI Manhole Cover, COPPER EDITIONManufactured By: The Bitcoin Penny Foundry (Cryptoville, USA)Manufactured For: Satoshi Water Company (Nakamoto, Japan)Year: 2022Material: Solid .999 Fine CopperFinish: Iridescent Rainbow*Base: Solid Walnut Base w/ 360° Swivel DisplayDimensions: 8” Round x .45” ThickWeight: 7.0 Lb (without 14oz Walnut Base)Quantity: 21 + PrototypeSerial Numbers: #00/21 (Prototype), #01/21, #02/21, #03/21, and so on.

The result is truly amazing and must be seen in person to fully appreciate! The final iridescent rainbow color background varies with each individual piece, and all prototypes have resulted in absolutely stunning backgrounds of swirling Golds, Oranges, Greens, Blues, and Purples! This makes every single one of these special art pieces uniquely colorful!
