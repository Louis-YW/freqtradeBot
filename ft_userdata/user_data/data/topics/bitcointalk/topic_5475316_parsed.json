I don’t know the reason why you want to delete your account but once you reset the password to what you can remember no body will even know this account exists in the forum if all your posts or threads die down",

It's possible that this can still be resolved better than you believed. I became curious since the account was just opened yesterday, it's not even up to 24 hours ago. And in a little time, you hit 4 merits which were sent from a respected member LoyceV.This shows that you are making sense in your posting. It would be nice if you spit the reason out or better still take a break to rethink this. You might thank me later.",

Un his community, you should try and have a thick skin because there are different people from different background here and you should expect criticism from form members. You don't need to allow that to discourage you from learning and growing, because criticism will help you improve more when you are less concern and move on.",

I have explained tax avoidance, which is legal, but I think it is better if I quote what I said, translating it.Quote from: gsus.dev on November 23, 2023, 06:33:32 PMI am trying to find smart ways to use my funds.<...>I hope my educational interest in learning more about the fiscal and practical usability aspect in the real world of cryptocurrencies is noted.My reply:Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on November 24, 2023, 04:50:02 AMWell, first of all it will depend, as it is not the same if you have 2,000 euros as 200,000 euros. In the second case I would consult Crypto Spain or someone similar. <...>As a summary, and as I have just commented in another thread, it seems that what you are looking for is tax avoidance, which consists of minimising the payment of taxes within the law. None of the 5 points minimise it, so, as I said at the beginning, depending on the money you have, consider consulting an expert in tax avoidance, as no one on the local forum is one.What he needs to do, as DdmrDdmr has recommended, is not to take things so personally, and I would add that even less so when he has not understood them. PS: OP has finally understood and apologized, so I'm reporting the thread to be locked.",
