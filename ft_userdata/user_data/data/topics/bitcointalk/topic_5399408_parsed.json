  "content": "It’s been an interesting 2 years for NFTs. With the wave of art (and now physical art), I’m wondering what the next use case is for crypto. I see the future of crypto as one that is interchangeable—where physical goods can be brought on chain. Think: being able to digitally verify/authenticate that you own your Rolex. And even broader, people that seek luxury goods are able to authenticate the goods that they product.This is essentially a whole ecosystem. There are some companies working on this but they all seem to be very centralized. The only company I’ve come across that aims to be decentralized is 4K. Has anyone heard of any other ones aside from big web2 companies like StockX and Louis Vuitton?Reference: https://mirror.xyz/4kprotocol.eth/Ud8fP2pzv6-bb3dubcjjTBkko3qp4DsqKv5vVn5yOL8",

      "body": "We already have physical assets on-chain. I think the most common cases are for ''natural'' assets, such as gold, forests, carbon and garbage. There are several projects that back gold, NFTs backed by forest areas for protection and projects that are well known in the sector when it comes to tokenized carbon credits. Not to mention the real state tokenization, done for example by SolidBlock.They're not in the top 50-100 yet, but maybe soon. These are super cool use cases for crypto/blockchain.",

The whole luxury good authentication + NFT might take years before we can finally buy goods thru physical on-chains with no problems (items are real and genuine).",

If this is the case then many assets have digital encoding and you can create this as the example of gold.But if you mean scanning physical objects and selling them digitally, it is possible, but we take advantage of the value of physical objects.In general, the concept of NFT tokens in itself is controversial and will open a lot of these discussions if it succeeds.",

The startup develops a blockchain platform for luxury brands to authenticate their products digitally. Each luxury item gets its own digital certificate with encrypted records that capture all of the product’s details. These include the acquisition dates, insurance, materials and more. Product owners can register their items on the startup’s app, which are then. reviewed by the startup or a third party for validationThe startup’s advisors include executives from Richemont International and Balenciaga. It also bolstered its position on the market by landing several reputable clients. Arianee recently announced that Vacheron Constantin will be delivering all its watches with the startup’s blockchain-based certificates by 2021. Other clients include BREITLING, Audemars Piguet, Roger Dubuis and Mugler.Shanghai-based VeChain also develops a blockchain platform aimed among other things at fighting counterfeiting. The startup placed in the top 1% of Early Metrics’ rated startups and has secured clients such as LVMH and Givenchy. Chainvine is another example of an up-and-coming rated startup providing bespoke blockchain services. One of its main services is the integration counterfeit prevention in the supply chain of wine producers and other food and beverage players.Luxury brands using blockchain to fight counterfeitingThis is just  the first step. Once brands themselves adopt blockchain to certificate the origin of their goods to customers we will have the assurance the world is moving ahead in blockchain adoption. It's easy to fake a paper, a seal or package, but you it's not possible to fake blockchain data which can be accessed by anyone in real time. A very smart usage for blockchain, indeed.",
