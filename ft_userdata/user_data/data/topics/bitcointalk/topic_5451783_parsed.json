Celsius really had them screwed over. Whilst the Celsius thing was definitely a bad move for them, props to Ray Youssef for accepting responsibility and trying to cover all the lost funds.https://twitter.com/raypaxful/status/1641105827892264960",

Not sure what's the difference with the past and present Paxful, keep in mind when the project is changed hands, you can expect there's should be an update which could differ from the old Paxful.Quote from: Potato Chips on May 05, 2023, 11:58:52 AMHowever it wouldn't be the exact same team as I see the previous CEO advising people to stay away from it when asked.Quote from: https://nitter.it/raypaxful/status/1654272822271696899#mI have resigned as ceo, withdrawn my funds and would not trade there ever again. Good luckQuote from: https://nitter.it/raypaxful/status/1654221730099896323#mNo way bro. Not going back. It is a disaster waiting to happen. My cofounder destroyed the company and everyone has left. BewareQuote from: https://nitter.it/raypaxful/status/1654217359702327301#mI resigned as ceo and took out my funds. I will not be going back or trading there under any circumstances. No idea what will happen there.Quote from: IIrik11 on May 07, 2023, 02:40:35 AMthey've lost their credibility now.especially when they asked for kyc to let people withdraw their remaining funds.Paxful requesting KYC was been so long, if Paxful lost their credibility by asking KYC, it has been collapsed since few years ago.",

I think they have issues with regulations too as some other Peer to Peer marketplaces were shut down recent months, not only Paxful.There are rumors about drug usage and addiction of Ray Youseff but I don't know how trusted such rumor is.Generally I agree with you that it's not good time to use services from Paxful (if they are back) and new startups from Ray Youseff. We must have more confirmations and time to verify what Ray Youseff did with Paxful.",

I will wait for an official confirmation from the owner before resuming trading. Paxful did not announce anything with their Twitter. I believe that their platform was not resumed to trade normally after all.In the past Paxful actively used their Twitter for announcements so if they resume their platform trading, they surely will announce it officially on their Twitter as well as their Paxful blog.

He resigned from Paxful as a CEO but as a user, he should be allowed to use Paxful. I don't think it is a safe time to return to Paxful.No announcement from their Paxful blog officially like why they resumed their service and who is their current CEO.I guess Paxful now is under Artur as he tweeted about it hours ago.

Initially, I read that Ray tried to claim to be the only CEO of Paxful, he has no co-CEO, co-founder in Paxful, and he tried to kick Artur Schaback out. It was written in the law suit document and you can find it on media.The latest event is after Paxful resumed their business operations, their current team banned Ray account on Paxful and that's it. Ray should not have any accessible to Paxful after his resignation as their CEO weeks ago but as a user, his account should not be banned.",
