  "content": "With the release of U.S. inflation data, which was positively assessed by crypto market participants, Shiba Inu's SHIB saw a sharp rise in its quotations. At the same time, SHIB price growth exceeded the growth of its competitors in the sector, which can now be considered Dogecoin (DOGE) and BabyDoge (BabyDoge). Both of these coins were outpaced by SHIB by about 1%, which has seen a total growth of 4% since CPI publication. Thus, SHIB adds another green candle on the chart, which fits perfectly into the uptrend that the coin has been in since late July. It seems that SHIB is moving purposefully toward the important price level of $0.000014. After crossing it, SHIB quotations can go up to $0.00002, a level not seen since May of this year. Nevertheless, whether it happens or not will depend on news like today's inflation report and the overall market sentiment around it.Read more on U.Today https://u.today/shib-reacts-most-to-positive-inflation-report-with-immediate-spike",
