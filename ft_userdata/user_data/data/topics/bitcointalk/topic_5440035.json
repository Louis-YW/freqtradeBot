We did some work to avoid this confusion.First of all, the amounts in all deploy wallets can be burned and a bridge can be created with a smart contract. But this is not possible right now. Because in order to be a bridge with smart contract, the token must have mint and burn properties. To keep users safe, the mint feature was removed. Therefore, the bridge does not work with the smart contract. For the bridge application with smart contracts to work, the mint feature must be active. (This would have created a separate discussion.) As a result, we use our own bridge. For the bridge to work, we must have BTTY tokens in our deploy wallets.To return to the main problem, we state that our total supply and max supply are 500 million units. But potential investors are confused when they see the amount in their deploy wallet. Likewise, it will be more difficult than we think to explain this situation to CMc and CG.1. Therefore, starting today, we are also adding the amounts in Deploy wallets to our Total supply and Max supply.2. This will not affect the circulating supply. Our circulating supply will be = (Max supply - Deploy - Team - Marketing).3. From the amount in the Deploy wallets, we determined the required amount for the Bridge and burned the excess.4. Except for the bridge, BTTY tokens will not be circulated.(If a BTTY token is circulated from one chain, the same amount from the other chain is sent to the deploy wallet.)5. Daily burns will continue.According to our calculation,The amounts we determined according to the distribution in the Deploy wallets are as follows.ETH Deploy: 75 millionBSC Deploy: 150 millionARB Deploy: 125 millionCore Deploy: 50 million (Deploy amount is locked, it will be done after 6 months)According to this calculation:Total Supply: 897,423,000Max Supply: 497,423,000Circulating Supply: 412,423.000.In addition, according to this result, chain-based data are as follows.ETH total Supply: 375,000,000BSC total supply: 274,423,000ARB total supply: 183,000,000CORE total supply: 65,000,000After this big step, all the question marks will be answered.Best Regards,",

      "body": "🔈As promised, on the 1st of March the Bitcointry team will burn 2.5 million $BTTY tokens as per the Q1 roadmap. This will be a one-time event and the quarterly burns of minimum 10% $BTTY accrued from trading fees will be removed from the roadmap.🔥Instead we will burn all accumulated $BTTY from fees on a daily basis. The BTTY commission amount you paid in the realized buy transactions will be burned periodically every day. We estimate that these investors will be more happy than the 3-month burn. 🔥All (100%) of the commission earnings on the purchase will be burned.👉While changes to the roadmap is not always welcomed, we hope and believe the Bitcointry community will regard this as a positive development that will also encourage more people to use the exchange platform over the DEX alternatives.🔥The exchange interface will be updated with a live tracker on the BTTY/USDT pairing showing accumulated $BTTY set aside for the daily burn event. 🎯Make your buy-sell transactions on the Bitcointry exchange. Make the burn increase.Best Regards,",
