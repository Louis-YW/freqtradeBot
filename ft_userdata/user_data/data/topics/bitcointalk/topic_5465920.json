      "body": "Mopar - BTC sent for a set of each. THANK YOUAlso, I have a question for everyone about the Load N Go Chips. The way I have interpreted the somewhat unclear Supreme info is that there was a Gen 1 Red Load N Go chip. Then soon after there were 5 colors that were Gen 2 including another slightly different red. All the chips in this picture have Gen 1 on them. So, maybe it doesn't matter but how do you distinguish the two reds. Would love it if you have any insight.",

Would love it if you have any insight.  if you look at the 2 reds - look at the edges - you will see the difference, one has 3 hashes - which matches the other 4 chips for the 5 chip set. the other red will have 8 hashes and will not match the other chips.The one with 8 hashes will also say “Est 2016” while the one with 3 will have a simple “2017”hope that answers.",
