I don't know what you mean about inaccuracy, but as any graph mostly uses an API, it's normal that we can see a delay of a few seconds. However, Tradingview doesn't support 2 min TF, only available for 1, 3, 5 min TF and longer. For premium user you can choose from 1-30 seconds.have you used tradingview before?",

Even exchange chart can give you the data what you are looking for. I want to know what specific usage you will use it so that we can suggest what’s best on your needs because your thread seems just asking for a website that displays live price chart.",

Set it to 15 minutes and use the time to check what you want to check. If you use like 5 exchanges for it, they should have the same or similar results pointing to the same up or down direction.",

So, you should know which exchange or price tracking website was used as the reference. He should use one of the well known exchanges, it is true that the price on the exchanges can be different, but the candle stick patterns are almost similar in a way you will be able to see if the 15 minutes market candle stick on the exchanges closes with green (more buy) or red (more sell). I use many exchanges and I use their candles stick with them to know about this from experience. Just like I have said before, he can use more than one exchanges for it to confirm, they will slightly have different prices but the candle stick pattern would be almost the same or very similar.",

So now we are trying to reconstruct the evidence with the actual exact seconds prices.Anyway, thanks for the provided links!Websites that offers price predictions typically use an oracle like Chainlink to provide price data. It’s important to determine what’s the oracle they are using as reference for there price since each site use different price oracle for there prediction game. As some user already point out, there’s no exact or defined price of Bitcoin so prediction website use specific oracle for price reference so using other tools for price history is useless if the services that you are using doesn’t use it.It’s better to inquire what’s the source for the price so that you can narrow what specific tool you can use to determine the price feed on the time frame that you want.",

I am looking at it now and the best I can do is 1 minute intervals, but I can't get it to display price changes in seconds.

I didn't know Binance allowed that. It seems awfully slow though. I just tried it out now to see if it works. I set a time interval to 1 sec and choose a random date range of 15 minutes in December 2022. It's been loading now for a few minutes but it won't display the chart I want to see.
