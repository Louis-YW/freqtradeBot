      "body": "Inflation is a part of fiat's design. Low inflation (but not no inflation) is considered a good thing by most economists, as devaluation of money is supposed to motivate people to spend money, and thus money continues circulating and keeps helping the economy. Bitcoin is surely better as an investment than any fiat currency, but I'd say it's worse as a medium of exchange because its growth does lead to the \"hodl\" attitude, and its scalability makes it inconvenient for daily purchases (as a practical replacement of fiat, unless we go with centralized solutions).",

Here comes bitcoin in 2009 the only digital currency that can now be used as a store of value or as currency reserve for the future. According to the country's GDP, the government of each country can print money as it wants, there is no unlimited money printing, and money cannot be printed at will. But we see that money inflation often happens.  But the supply of Bitcoin is limited and we can see that Bitcoin continues to pump since 2009 and it is a very valuable coin and has a lot of potential for the future.  So if we can hold on to it, it will give us a much better life in the future. So I think it is wiser to hold Bitcoin than money",

Bitcoin is a revolution not am evolution, everything in the world is going digital. Looking at the evolution of money, money as a medium of exchange began with barter exchange, as man advanced the commodity means of exchange emerged; the use of cowrie shell, Gold, silver and other valuable commodities. From there, boiling down to paper money (fiat currency) to credit card, to bank wires to cryptocurrency which Bitcoin is the boss. Quote from: Sim_card on April 03, 2024, 03:12:35 PMFiat currency has never been used as a store of value.

And if anyone wants to know, they can find out by checking the blockchain and wallet addresses to see if the person is functioning properly and doing what they claim, and any dishonest actions the person is doing are very easy to find out. And this is a very important thing, there are no fake Bitcoins and corruption in this system has never happened and will never exist because it is transparent, and besides that Bitcoin has advantages in investment in terms of profits and can also store value in inflation.And if we talk about the advantages of Bitcoin, in my opinion there are many advantages of Bitcoin apart from profit, security, comfort and also freedom.",

I think everyone here is in agreement that it's bitcoin over fiat but remember that not a lot of us can use our bitcoin if fiat isn't important to, a lot of people still converts their bitcoin or profits in fiat so I'm not really sure that a debate and whatever is important is a valid one, for now, it's a tie between the two because bitcoin's not yet that strong to go against fiat.",

Because people have no other choice but to work hard to earn money.Fiat money is like magic that makes people keep chasing it. It's not bad if people have to work hard to earn money, but people who are aware of the decline in value of paper money must invest it in types of investments that are not in the form of money.Bitcoin is a currency that can be used as an investment asset to maintain long-term hedging.Actually, if we think about it, it's all about intelligence in taking advantage of opportunities.

Bitcoin can't eat everything. It has its own limitations and challenges. Bitcoin is not fit to replace the current financial system. It can't scale to such a level where it can handle the ever-growing number of transactions. It's expensive and slow. There are far better payment methods available in the market. Bitcoin is a monster in investment scenario, which can probably eat everything else. because the amount of return it has given in its lifetime, no other asset can compete with it.

We know that Bitcoin is not only a digital currency but it is more than this and will bring a change in traditional finance. In the coming era, the traditional finance system will be completely disrupted and everything will be done through BTC either you use it as a storing value or use it to buy or sell something.

You are absolutely correct and your line of argument agrees completely with mine. There is a saying that \"pictures speaks more than words\", the picture below shows how many has lost its value over the years in my country. What could afford the latest car in 1975 can only afford a loaf of bread today, this is just a space of 49years. Money is just a medium of exchange and never a good store of value. Like many people already said, inflation is a huge weakness of money. On the contrary, Bitcoin is both a store of value and medium of exchange. As a store of value, Bitcoin have demonstrated it is one of the best we have seen and as a medium of exchange, it is evolving and we will definitely achieve wider adoption in the future.",
