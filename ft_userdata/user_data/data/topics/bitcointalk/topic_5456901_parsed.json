  "content": "Housebets.io is a scam. I was givin restricted access simply because the housebets shotty development team failed to realize a bug when you wagered with BTC. $0.02 US was credited back to my balance. When confronting staff or a mod in discord or telegram I get muted simply because the chat agrees that I and several others shouldn't be held accountable for their mess ups. The mod (poochy) only reply is simply \"your bets were risk free\" not true, if I place a $2.00 wager im still assuming 99.5% of the risk. Housebets.io is the apitamy of everything wrong in the crypto market and the reason why median class citizens won't provide liquidity in the crypto market. You advertise decentralized betting but when things don't go your way you freeze accounts and ban people. Housebets is not for the people it is a dictatorship and me and countless other people that you banned are not gonna just let this blow over. If anyone can help point me in the right direction, I'd like to light a fire ðŸ”¥ underneath their bums. These guys need to be accountable for their actions and unrestrict all the accounts they froze and allow withdraws. Its to bad that some people exploited this bug (even though as I do the math I quickly realize that the juice is not worth the squeeze). Alot of people myself included simply wagered with BTC and for that we got are accounts froze and banned. You need to make this right and really be objective about this.The bug essentially \"due to the decimal places in BTC not being enough it rounded $0.01 & $0.02 spins to 0\". That is quoted straight from the mod in telegram (porchy). My chat is still up in the housebets/lunafi telegram chat and you can see for yourself his irrational, emotional and non logical statements. Bottom line is me and alot of people were banned because housebets sourced developers from fiver instead of hiring a competent and capable developer. Thats why your accountable Â and thats why you need to lift these restrictions.Start of telegram chat but I was promptly mutedhttps://t.me/LunaFi_Official/31593",

      "body": "First, you need to put up a proper case against the casino if you feel you have been treated badly and out of the content of the terms and conditions so at you need to open a scam accusation against them in the right board and also make sure you include all the necessary evidence and information that can help explain your case better. Because with what you put up,Â  no one is going to take you seriously with just a wall of text that lack evidence,Â  and since you said you have a telegram chat with the casino telegram moderator,Â  and you are told stories you did not agree with,Â  you can screenshot it a share,Â  but in most cases, deposits in small units are sometimes classified as dust transactions but I am not saying that what happens in your case since the support already give you another reason.",

      "body": "this is their ann thread, you already posted on their thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5449559.60I'm showing their thread so you can see two things:1 - and a thread created 2 months ago, i.e. this casino is a very new casino, I keep talking about the great risks of using very new casinos, and especially when people put a lot of money in new casinos, it never ends well.2 - see my post I made on their thread, I was warning people about their kyc and their casino being a dangerous casino, with very strict kyc policies, with a high fee for withdrawals, so I was warning about that but it seems to me that people never listen to, I even talked about a guy who took over 5 hours to get paid.I don't know if you have proof of your accusation, but I suggest you create a scam accusation in the appropriate section and post whatever evidence you have, follow the proper format for scam accusations, you can see it all here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=260073.0",

      "body": "This is not the right board to report the casino. Go to scam accusation board and create a topic of scam using the right method provided for you on the board. So that the casino can be viewed on your allegations. You should also come up with evidence to back up your claims so that your case will be easily treated. When you don't show any evidence to proof your claims,I don't think anyone will take you serious. It is good to use reputable casinos and not new casinos because they can end up to be a scam.",
