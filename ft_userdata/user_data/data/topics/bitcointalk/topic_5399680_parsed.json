  "content": "Currently, my avatar and my signature space is not available for rent.1 - The minimum offer I will table is $100/week, or $400/month if you wish to pay me monthly. I think that's only fair considering my rank (Legendary) and merit.2 - No minimum posting requirements higher than 20 posts/week. This is in line with most other campaigns.3 - I will not accept campaigns for scams or ICOs (or anything to do with tokens).4 - I reserve the right to red-trust and flag you should you fail to make the payments in a timely manner.5 - I reserve the right to update these criteria without notice.This thread is not monitored, so I prefer inquiries be made to me directly via PM.",
