      "body": "You indeed have a point, but your believe that Bitcoin isn't being adopted by countries, because their neighboring countries have not adopted it has a very very small insignificant percentage to add to why Bitcoin's adoption is slow.Let's take El Salvador as a reference, El Salvador is the first country to legitimize Bitcoin and made it a legal tender, I believe El Salvador have neighboring countries around her, if adoption of Bitcoin was to be based on this perspective of yours, by now, I believe that this countries that are around El Salvador should by now, have adopted Bitcoin and made it a legal tender too, but they haven't, why?  .Now, we discover it is not all about a country adopting Bitcoin and the neighboring country following sort, for different governments, Bitcoin adoption is an individual thing, it is what each government of every country has to decide on independent of what the decision of their neighbor is or are.In the end, what actually is holding this countries from adopting Bitcoin is fear, greed, corruption etc.Fear ~ fiat give power to the government, banks etc, Bitcoin takes that power and give it to the people who the power belongs to, governments, Central banks know this and they are afraid of losing that power they have over the citizens through fiat system.Greed ~ fiat can be printed as many as possible, government and central banks print unlimited supply/amount of fiat money mostly to satisfy their greed, but Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, governments and central banks know that Bitcoin will automatically take away their ability to printing as much fiat as they want out of their greed, which have always been at the expense of the citizens.Corruption ~ corrupt governments and central banks are afraid to give Bitcoin a chance because Bitcoin will expose them, it will expose their wasteful spending habit, Bitcoin will expose their criminal-like lifestyles, Bitcoin will expose how they misappropriate funds, how they loot and steal from citizens, Bitcoin will expose their corrupt practices.",

This is particularly observed in the Latin American countries where various bills supporting Bitcoin are either planned or submitted to congress for deliberation. Bitcoin is also widely adopted in Europe, where countries are more technologically advanced. In contrast, many countries in Africa are more or less indifferent to its growth. But I guess this isn't a conspiracy. Neither is it about a massive increase in GDP from Bitcoin adoption. I guess this is simply about how countries appreciate Bitcoin and their level of awareness.",

No crypto businesses? Great, people use it for personal and overseas txs.Better still, those who would never otherwise have heard of Bitcoin would actually hear about it.Class conspiracy? Ha.

It can not do any of that, it won't guarantee increased GDP and income, or decreased unemployment, etc. Bitcoin will certainly open some new doors but it is not going to perform miracles. Big improvements in the economy of a country needs big changes in basic economic matters.For example in Iran we've adopted bitcoin years ago and it has been used for import/exports and about 10% of the hashrate is in Iran. But none of it is the reason for the changes in the economy.What is improving the economy is everything else, like the changes in the banking system that forces them to invest in infrastructure and production instead of what they were doing before which messed up the economy. Changes in the exports where oil is not the main export, a lot of other things are and even oil is not going to be exported but oil products are. The destination of exports have also significantly improved.All that is helping inflation decrease, employment increase, GDP to go up,... not the adoption of bitcoin.",

But Nigeria is indeed the largest black nation in the world, and the most populous country in Africa, of which other African countries look up to in terms of decision making and choice of action. So for me, I think if Nigeria finally legalized the use of Bitcoin, and make great income from it to the extent of developing the country drastically through the use of Bitcoin, I'm very sure other neighbouring countries will want to do such to. Because taking a look at El Salvador, this is a country bordered by both \"Honduras\" on the nortwest, \"Guatemala\" on the nortwest, of which thou these countries never legalized Bitcoin as a legal tender, but the activities of Bitcoin could be hardly felt these places, to the extent the mayor of a town in one of the neighbouring countries was given a Bitcoin mining device to start mining bitcoinSource: https://www.google.com/amp/s/cointelegraph.com/news/why-is-a-guatemalan-mayor-mining-bitcoin-tackling-fud-with-biogas-and-btc/amp",
