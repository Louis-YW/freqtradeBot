If you want to help it would be better he sent it to you through DM just to restrict the information but from what he described I doubt it is a private key",

      "body": "If you have a picture on it and wanted to post it here make it blurry so that no one can decipher but reading or determining the codes won't help.Litecoin private keys are commonly encoded in Wallet Import Format (WIF) or as hexadecimal strings, correct me if I'm wrong with this.  If the digits you mentioned follow a different format, it might require additional analysis to determine the appropriate decoding method.IMO, you need to be careful of this showing to anyone, it should be trusted, not anyone else over the internet.",
