Entry and exit prices are very important in trading. A fairly low entry guarantees better profit and that's what traders look out for. It justifies the trading parlance of \"buy low, sell high\". It's the entry position in trades that distinguishes a profitable trader from one who struggles to make ends meet.",

But sometimes it is difficult to get the right entry point due to the emotions involved. How much profit the trader wants to make from that trade also largely depends on where to take entry according to the target. Because you always want to buy at a low price and sell when the market is pumped. By doing this, one should understand the momentum of the market and open the trade, thinking of making big profit only by entering at a low price will not always be correct. On the other hand, taking a trade in the hope of a quick profit on a huge pumping asset can turn into a nightmare for you. So it is necessary to take trade entries from the safe zone as much as possible by doing market research.",

You can't catch the actual bottom but when you do, then you're in your greatest shape.But forget about doing or buying at the bottom of it, as long as you're buying at the right time and price which you think is one of the bottoms of it, just do it. Quote from: RILWAN on November 07, 2022, 06:34:30 PMIs low price a determinant factor to open a trading position?Yes. That's definitely a factor that you should be able to see and start your positions. There are traders that would be dependent on that and they're the spot traders but for margin traders, this won't matter.",

We can't assure you here because a lot of cases especially \"Buy the dip\" until when is the dip? Because when you are buying those dips, it's like catching falling knives.There are some traders that enter a trade position only if the price is going up again or pullback after a dip, pullback is visiting the previous low after a pump.",

What matters is the result of the analysis that you make of market price. It is not proper to jump in for buy because the price has gone down or to sell because the market has gone high. You have to do the market analysis using the technical indicators because there are atimes when price will be overbought or over sold so if you are trading against the current direction will lose before the reversion to your open order position.",

But what the next direction will be is what I can't tell.It totally depends on you. If you are afraid of more falls, don't spend your capital now. We may not reach the bottom during this bearish market, Bitcoin is always possible to drop more. But if you don't want to miss buying during this price fall, you can buy gradually. Spend a few of your capital to buy now, but keep some money to buy again if there are further drops/falls. Something we must understand that we don't know what the bottom of the current bearish season is. If we don't buy now, we may miss the opportunity to buy at the lowest prices.",
