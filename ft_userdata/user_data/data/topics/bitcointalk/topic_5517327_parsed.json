I'm starting to believe they are still trying to squeeze the private keys of Ross's wallet that's why he isn't pardoned.",

Ross was imprisoned for running darknet website Silk Road which was actually selling narcotics and many other illegal stuffs. So I think that is life imprisonment is quite valid. He was running a criminal enterprise. The site was used to sell drugs, but he was not the seller. He only allowed others to do it. If you don't understand what the whole fuss is about, the penalty for selling drugs as first offense is under 15 years. The man got life for allowing other people to do it, which should carry a lower sentence, just like lending someone your gun so he can murder a person will get you a smaller sentence as if you did it yourself. QuoteI am not sure if Trump will have any executive power to dismiss the decision made in a court. But if it happens, I will hope that Trump will fulfill his other promises he made before the election. Just do some research if you aren't sure  The president of the United States is authorized by the U.S. Constitution to grant a pardon for a federal crime. The other forms of the clemency power of the president are commutation of sentence, remission of fine or restitution, and reprieve.[1] A person may decide not to accept a pardon, in which case it does not take effect.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_pardons_in_the_United_States",

This will undoubtedly be positive news, since if bitcoin3 was associated with the darknet, the sale of prohibited items and Ross Ulbricht, then Ulbricht's rehabilitation will automatically rehabilitate bitcoin (partially) as something \"only associated with negative things\" in the eyes of ordinary people. Quote from: avikz on November 07, 2024, 05:29:25 PMRoss was imprisoned for running darknet website Silk Road which was actually selling narcotics and many other illegal stuffs.He personally sold all this illegal stuff? I think this is an exaggeration, comparable to statements from the tabloids, which is a bit strange to hear from an old forum user.Quote from: avikz on November 07, 2024, 05:29:25 PMSo I think that is life imprisonment is quite valid. He was running a criminal enterprise. Systemically, he was no different from Bezos, since he was not running a criminal enterprise, but an online trading platform. It's almost as if you were the owner of the premises and rented it out to a fruit and vegetable seller who sold illegal goods without your knowledge. You are not responsible for what this seller does, because you are only renting him the retail space.It should also be noted that if Ross Ulbricht is soon released, then this is a sign that his punishment with life imprisonment was unjustified and excessive. Otherwise, if he was really guilty, everything would remain as is.",

Allowing Ulbricht to get released would indicate that he is true to his word and also a good sign that his really for Bitcoin now.So again lets follow up for more update regarding on this case since many people really believe that penalties given to that unfortunate guy is to much and many think that he already serve his sentence in prison.Also reading this article written by coindesk https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/07/donald-trump-more-likely-to-pardon-jan-6-protestors-than-silk-road-founder-polymarket/ rise up the curiosity and discussion about what possible next step will happen in future.",

Thanks to President Trump for keeping the most important pre-election promise for a person who was losing hope.I read some short descriptions at https://freeross.org/ and seeQuoteRoss was not convicted of selling drugs or illegal items himself, but was held responsible for what others sold on the site.It is a shady area for law interpretation and enforcement, and I know it is not how government see it, but if it is a reason for Ross Ulbricht to be free from prison in January 2024, how about mixers' founders and operators who were arrested and imprisoned?They can be free too, but I really don't think Ross Ulbricht will be a case law in mixer industry. Governments globally don't like mixers and they will do everything to ban mixers and put mixers' founders and operators to jail.It's logic that mixers are for everyone, privacy is for everyone, basic human rights, but it's hard to fight and get privacy back from governments.",

It is cool seeing how Trump will pardon folks who have even made significant progress or aided the development of this highly advanced and modern technology aka Bitcoin. What will Ross do when he comes back and will he continue to play a role in Bitcoin in the future? I wonder what his welcoming home will bring back into the space.",

He was running a criminal enterprise.While I get your point, he only created a website with the intent of launching a truly Free Market.  A truly Free Market means no Censorship and there should be no exception to the rule.  Otherwise it becomes not so Free.Now there are obviously other details to his case and I am not saying he is 100 percent not guilty, but I think we should not forget that all of us have the right to innocence unless proven guilty and, if you ask me, the way his case was handled is kind of weird at the very least.  It rather seems like he was framed than any thing else.Not to mention the excessively large punishment he received for only launching a website.  I hate Craig Wright but I would not punish him or consider him a criminal for creating a Shit Coin with a Blockchain containing illegal stuff posted by other people.  He is a criminal for other reasons, but not this one.  Same with Satoshi creating Bitcoin which really can be used for Crime and no Bank or Authority could say no to such a Transaction because it is Free.  However, Satoshi is not to blame for that.",
