From the mail received by Bundle exchange, it was so sadden to see another announcement of shorten down their services.Before I go further, Bundle is a payment app for fiat and cryptocurrencies originated from Binance exchange mainly for Africans precisely to Nigerians to help foster and fast track the ease of crypto and fiat payment through their app to Nigerians announces their cease of operations and have been sending mail across their user to withdraw funds deposited in the bundle App within the period of 60 days to their closure.The following screenshots will properly explain the body of their mail.For those us who don't love login their mails to their current devices they are using, is another bad disadvantages to them as they may miss this updates and ended of losing their funds. I will encourage those us who loves saving and storing their crypto asset on any exchange for ease withdrawal might have a very big chances to lose their assets.Please permits me to borrow this words we often used here as this is the good example of \"Not your key Not your coin\". I have also tried my best to share across for those who don't regularly login their mails to get updated and please move out your funds to a safe custodian wallet.If this already posted then I will get it locked as soon as possible",

From the mail received by Bundle exchange, it was so sadden to see another announcement of shorten down their services.Before I go further, Bundle is a payment app for fiat and cryptocurrencies originated from Binance exchange mainly for Africans precisely to Nigerians to help foster and fast track the ease of crypto and fiat payment through their app to Nigerians announces their cease of operations and have been sending mail across their user to withdraw funds deposited in the bundle App within the period of 60 days to their closure.Bundle exchange services are available mostly in Africa and South Africa and Nigeria had the biggest crypto market in Africa. Since we don't have a South African board but the forum has a Nigerian section, this information would be more helpful in the Nigerian board. I am saying this because many Nigerians might be using the Bundle exchange services. But I want to commend the management of Bundle Exchange for allowing customers to withdraw their funds. This shows that they have no intention of rug-pulling or scamming its users. This is also a wake-up call to people that keep thier funds in exchanges. Many exchanges are out there planning to scam their customers. Thank you @SmartGold01 for informing me about the importance of checking my email regularly. Sometimes I didn't check my mail box for a week, which is very bad.",

      "body": "It appears that you are eager to place all of the blame on the consumers. While the expression \"Not your key, not your coin\" has my support, I believe the exchanges should share some of the blameHow about we delve even farther and talk about the precautions these platforms might take to prevent such things from happening? Have you considered doing regular audits, increasing security, educating users on the necessity of updating software, and possibly even having a plan in place for recovering funds in the event of an unexpected closure? All of these factors must be taken into accountUsers are not excused from responsibility, but neither should marketplaces. It's past time the crypto community demanded more transparency and stronger protections from these services",

It sounds long enough for their users but in early days after the announcement, their users might feel fearful and it might cause congestion in their customer supports and security teams that will approve and proceed withdrawal requests.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

Whatever they do, they will still make withdrawals available for the time being, as most people will just have to go back to using the Binance exchanges unless they finally find a means of avoiding the CEX.",

Rather, it only specifically informs them that the platform will cease operating because they will \"restructure the business.\" So, this is temporary. I think this is simply a process of upgrading their infrastructure to integrate certain developments like the growing adoption of the Web3 ecosystem, for example. They will probably come out a much improved platform sooner or later.",

Its the responsibility of the users to keep an eye on these things especially when they let their money to sleep their so can't blame anyone if they miss the notice period for withdrawal of funds.",

Centralized exchanges today are facing lots of difficulties which includes legal issues or to whatsoever, those who keeps leaving their funds into centralized exchange are in one way or the other endangering themselves by keeping their funds into exchange. This closure is too heart touching because I know too well that bundle payment app is something that really helps Nigerian to make crypto trading seamless without any interference despite the restrictions set across the country. Well I don't know their personal issues but I know there has been lot of exchanges shorten down due to inability to continue their operation maybe facing serious challenges.",

I hope this time based on an examination of the average activity of most accounts, otherwise it would be considered a gentle exit scam.The reason for the closure is due to the competition, the large exchanges have become offering many options such as spot trading, features, staking, p2p, Dex, ...etc all in one place so there is no need to create several accounts in several CEXs.",

Not to mention sometimes e-mails notification arrives late or even not showing on their device due to glitches, notification settings, and so on. I'd love to see them give at least more than one month for their users to withdraw their funds. I'm not sure how much they need to spend to keep their service running, but it should be cheaper after they stopped their services and focus on processing withdrawals.Quote from: rat03gopoh on July 26, 2023, 04:59:17 PMquite surprised that this platform isn't popular enough.Not really surprising. We do have similar platforms that are quite active on the local market but have zero presence on the forum or social media.",
