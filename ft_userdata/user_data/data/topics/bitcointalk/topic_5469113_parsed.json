Unlike in gambling where it will be the gambler against the house and already there is a set house edge that places the interest of the casino against that of the gamblers and that has resulted in several house advantages against the gambler.",

      "body": "With your random decision which you considered based on luck might work in short-term trading but it doesn't mean that this is a sustainable long-term strategy.  Which is in the long run, trading success is typically based on skill, strategy, and analysis rather than luck.That's why traders use different strategies in trading and behind those strategies they don't forget to have stop-loss orders to minimize losses.So if you are trading for the purpose of a short-term period, it doesn't guarantee success over an extended period or let's say long term.  If you luck knowledge, go for long-term trading and do DCA way.",

But still I don't want to rely on purely luck when it comes on trading.Maybe you have a good winning percentage for now but time will come when relying on luck might instead give you a sudden loss and continuous losing streak. Maybe just try to make it balance, still relying on your luck while at the same time, still applying your trading analysis.I don't consider your experiment as a success. From what I read, you only based on 3 days period. Tried to make it monthly.",

Demos are easy and it seems that whoever made them will really make you close to winning.And that's encouraging because you think that you're ready for the actual trade and that's fine as long as you're just going to do with enough money and fine to lose it.With that strategy you've just made, it's really all about luck and if it seems that the result is way better than with analysis, maybe that's how it goes for you but it won't be at most times.",

Congratulations on being successful in these 3 days, but yea we all know that it'll be totally unreliable if anyone does it longer.But yea, people should be trading using plans; not impulsively making decisions along the way.

It seems easy for you to say since we have two options in trading, either we buy or we sell, but how we choose these options defines whether we trade or gamble, and in your own case, you don't need further explanation that you gambled. I've done this before, yet I admit to myself that I gambled, unlike you.However, luck can't be entirely erased from trading according to my experience, but you need more professionalism to succeed in it.",

Faced difference thing between trading with real or demo account, have an easily way to earn much profit trough demo account trading but you can apply based on your lucky when trading with real account.

But when you trade on a real account, you may get different or higher results because it is a real market and you are using real money to trade.Maybe you can profit from lucky results but it will only work for a while because market situations will change. And without analysis, you could find it difficult to find coins to trade with. You can try what you do on a demo account by implementing strategies and methods to see how high the success rate is.However, trading requires analyzing market conditions and finding the coins. That is something every trader needs to have so they can make a profit. And if there are still traders who trade without analysis, they will find it difficult to make a profit. And it's almost the same as gambling.",

And trading relying on luck cannot be applied especially if you have long term goals. Maybe you can do it if you're trying to generate quick gains so basically it is only for the short term. But again, this is still not advisable as it can negatively affect your trading habits. Thus, it is still better that you trade responsibly by applying analysis and strategies for better outcomes. Then again, we all have different strategies and takes about trading, if it works for you doesn't mean it will work for others, or vice versa.

If the trading was random, the probability of achieving a profit would be 50% and the probability of a loss would be 50% in the ideal case, and it decreases due to feelings, fear and greed. Therefore, the probability of achieving a profit from the trader will be less than 50%, and therefore in trading you lose more than you win, which is mistake.Trading is based on some simple rules and the basics of technical analysis, which are not 100% accurate, but they have a good amount of validity, especially in the long term, and this amount decreases the shorter the term, but in the end, it is not random or dependent on coincidence. This is what makes someone rely on coincidence. He who has the information loses and makes profits, but he will not always make profits because some predictions will be wrong.",

Luck doesn't matter here but it depends on how much effort you put into it.  If you have no idea about a particular business but if you fall into that business you do not understand the process of doing business then how will you profit from that business.
