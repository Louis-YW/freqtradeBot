All you need is to have proper mindset, such that is required to profit from other conventional investments like real estate, gold, stock and others. If you give Bitcoin the same amount of time and peace you would give these other investment portfolios, Bitcoin will not fail you. But you will start having problems with Bitcoin the moment you treat it like a get-rich-quick investment, this is where problems begins for a lot of people especially the newbies. No one has gotten burnt buying Bitcoin and holding it for 4 years to 5 years. Those that lost money to Bitcoin as usually those that buy today and expect the price to skyrocket within few days or few weeks. This is not fair to Bitcoin and makes it look like gambling and not investment.",

So, if you're okay with that situation then you can stay being stagnant without any growth and without having the need to take any risk just as investing Bitcoin.What's good in investing with Bitcoin is that this is a proven asset that if you stay for long term, you'll definitely going to make money by just being patient.",

It is not hard to understand. Read about bitcoin halving, how people use to buy bitcoin more after halving. It may not be immediately after halving, it can be some months after. This is the reason to invest in bitcoin now, because halving will occur in 3 months time, likely in April. Bitcoin is an asset that it's value is increasing as its price is increasing.",

Not a lot of assets are capable of that.Definitely Bitcoins are way more valuable than that what it is now. You need to just show trust in the coin and regularly invest in it. Bitcoins have grown massively since its launch and many have witnessed that. You did well mate by buying the coin before 20k usd price. Now the coin will go more up. So if you again buy the coin at this price, then still you can make good amount of profit. Just don’t greed for more and invest in limit.",

You have decided to learn about Bitcoin before Investing. Many people who are in the Bitcoin space want to make a profit from buying, holding and selling in the future. That's not a bad decision as much as you are not seeing the sector as a get-rich-quick scheme. Many people have the wrong Investment mentality because they think the sector is a Ponzi scheme that gives them instant and big profits. Just like stock, real estate and other investments, you can buy Bitcoin and wait till the price appreciates. Many people have attained financial freedom because they bought Bitcoin in its early stage.Other investors trade on Bitcoin. These investors don't need to wait for a long time to gain from it. They monitor the market and sell at a given price collecting their profits. Others also use Bitcoin mainly as a currency because it helps them to invade certain restrictions placed on fiat. Bitcoin gives businessmen unlimited access to their funds, unlike banks that have a limited volume of transactions. So these businesses use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services both locally and internationally. I agree that Bitcoin is still at its early stage, thus there is still a great opportunity to invest in it and make good profits in the future. Therefore nobody should assume he is late because there are still millions of people that have not picked interest in the sector.",

Out of all the topics here in the forum, I'm sure this kind of topic or opinion has already been discussed and has given answers, but for the sake of the question. What triggers me to invest in bitcoin or crypto currency? Simple, because I want to earn money, I want to have a lot of money so I can afford the things that I want to buy or own, and as I see that crypto currency and bitcoin have a lot of potential and have become more popular with many people, that's why I also got curious and decided to explore this technology. We all have different reasons why we take the risk of investing. Even though we know the dangers and risks of this field, the urge to have money or to earn money lets us take the risk and decide to invest.",

Quote from: shepherd_gee on January 06, 2024, 06:20:06 AMThe core question here is; what triggers you to invest?...There are only 2 biggest problems in the world of finance:1 - how to earn money;2 - how to save what you earn.Investing in bitcoin can help solve both of these problems - you can both earn and save what you earn.

Bitcoin has been growing over time, so it's pretty safe to just wait out the bear markets. Moreover, Bitcoin has high liquidity, so unlike with some other investments (real estate, for example), you don't need to worry about being unable to sell fast when the time is right. Apart from that, Bitcoin is something that doesn't need a third party, you can make an investment yourself and be independent of everyone else in that regard.So, to me, Bitcoin just isn't that risky, which makes it an attractive investment or at least a savings account.",
