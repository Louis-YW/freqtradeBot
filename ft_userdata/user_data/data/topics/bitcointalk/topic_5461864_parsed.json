In all my years of F2F exchanges I have only had 1 person ever ask for ID, and due to the amount I could not blame him totally.Didn't give it, pointed out we were in a casino with about a million cameras and that was the point. He was just worried that since it was over $10K that it was some sort of entrapment thing. I just didn't want to fly with that much cash, and hey.... it was in Vegas. We made the deal. So it was all good in the end.If you are passing that much cash in a coffee shop I can see it being a different story.-DaveAlso, this does not belong in the technical support section but general discussion.",

You just walk away if you feel uncomfortable handing your sensitive data to a stranger.Would he have done the same if you asked him for KYC and source of his fiat cash?

You just walk away if you feel uncomfortable handing your sensitive data to a stranger.This is how you fall victim to a targeted attack. Your local cash swapper now knows who you are and possibly how much you hold in crypto. Walk away.",

If they have any evidence they will simply show your face at the moment you asked since it didn't happen they don't have any and there is nothing to worry about for your privacy as long as you didn't share any personal details with them.",

I would be much uncomfortable giving anyone my id. Better to walk way.I have seen many times people fell victim to it. It may not have harmed you instantly. But your information can be sold in dark web. I have seen many users personal data sold in dark webs. They have all kind of information. Later other scammer would use that info to target you.One time I gave someone my personal number, (I shouldn't have) later I would get numerous spam calls and texts. They literally sold my number to a third party. Really sucks. Later I had to stop using that Sim. So be careful buddy.",

How does the process go?I mean, you have to check whether cash is fake or not, then that person has to be sure that you are really sending coins and aren't going to cancel your transaction and both of you should wait for at least for one confirmation. I mean, if you don't do a deal in a public place in front of cameras or near police, there is a chance that one of you will quickly run away. If you do it in front of cameras, I think it will look suspicious for everyone. I have only exchanged iPhone in real life and I know I can block iCloud and feel safe but once bitcoins are gone, they are gone forever. By the way, it looks logical to ask for an ID during exchange because what if the coins that you sent me are from dark web? And I am the only one who will experience problems when I decide to deposit coins from this wallet to casino/exchange?",

How does the process go?There is a thread about it here[1], maybe you can further discuss it there if you want to ask further. I've never done it personally since finding local traders in my area is quite difficult. Fortunately, it is easy to do P2P through other means nowadays.Quote from: Synchronice on August 10, 2023, 08:44:49 AMBy the way, it looks logical to ask for an ID during exchange because what if the coins that you sent me are from dark web?
