  "content": "Coinslotty, the online casino for crypto enthusiasts, is now entering phase 3 - and I'm happy to share a portion of the new design that we have been working on  After successfully closing off our last review campaign, we are now launching several design competitions to complement the new design language, and our first competition will cover a set of signatures and avatars. Hereâ€™s how to apply: APPLICATION PROCESS:â€¢Â Â Â Simply reply in this thread and introduce yourself, your design service, portfolio and BTC Wallet. Priority will be given to users who have experience designing signatures, but I will also pick out a few newbies. Donâ€™t get discouraged if youâ€™re fresh, just do your best in presenting your skills. â€¢Â Â Â There are no member rank requirements, if youâ€™re skilled youâ€™ll get accepted, your posting habits are not important. â€¢Â Â Â Applications are open from today, the 14th of April, and I will close them next week, on Tuesday the 18th of April. Â HOW DOES THE COMPETITION WORK:â€¢Â Â Â On Wednesday, the 19th of April, (or earlier) I will pick out up to 5 applications that stood out the most. Each of the applicants will get $75 to their wallet, together with a design package that will contain the latest design assets for Coinslotty, together with the USPâ€™s. Youâ€™ll get to keep the $75 regardless if you win or not.â€¢Â Â Â After the 5 applicants deliver their take on a set of signatures (full, sr.mem, hero/leg) and avatars, latest on the 26th of April, an internal vote will be carried out, and the winner of the competition will get an additional $100 to their account.After that, starting from May, your work will be displayed on profiles of several high-ranking members of the forum, including LoyceV, Efialtis, Cryptofrka, Trofo, Dkbit98 and more, and on top of that, your profile and marketplace thread will be promoted in all our forum threads, as well as our upcoming Community page directly on our site. If you have any questions, feel free to ask, I'm here",

Just kidding.I'll try to create the better one! Wish me luck xLays You might have been aware of the common issue on signature design, which some of my works don't look good on mobile. It's quite tricky though which you need to choose between mobile or desktop to maximize your design. Since I assume that most users using desktop, then I'd likely prefer that as reference. However I'll try my best to make the design looks good on both of desktop and mobile. Good luck guys! Hope my application gets selected by OP.",

I always appreciate people who can make things with their hands (since my arts and crafts skills are pathetic, I only know how to type ). One of my closest friends loves to create stuff out of wood, with several musical instruments in his portfolio. Since I (also) don't know how to play instruments, I just ordered a simple cutting board - and it's always a fun thing to see what he comes up with.",
