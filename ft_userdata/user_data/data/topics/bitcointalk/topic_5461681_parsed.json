It might also be a coincidence but you never know.QuoteHow do you see this growth?What are the things that contributed to this growth?What else we can do, to keep up this?Something is better than nothing which is why the growth we are seeing today is a positive sign for us to keep contributing in this board.Keep posting interesting topics to discuss and that is how we can ensure further growth.",

There is only 20+ active members which is kind of really unacceptable comparing to our country's population 1.5 Billion. Young generation kids are generating millions of posts across social media every few minutes from India and get nothing really beneficial for them so hopefully the things will turn around in some way.Raffle created short term and also @Heisenberg_Hunter active as merit source more often which is good thing.webtricks Is highly knowledgeable when it comes to educating us anything about legal and policy changes, hope to see further.Quote from: Bureau on August 02, 2023, 05:37:19 AMI really liked this word in your title Reincarnation.

Bull run really bring more news about cryptos to India but they are not really aware of bitcointalk existense even if they do the only place they stuck with is Bounties.Quote from: pawanjain on August 02, 2023, 01:33:20 PMSomething is better than nothing which is why the growth we are seeing today is a positive sign for us to keep contributing in this board.Keep posting interesting topics to discuss and that is how we can ensure further growth.I am also keep checking the crypto related news to share with us but its like finding a pin in the haystack.",

To create more engagement we need more active participation of those who became legendary by activities. Exactly true. This was why I & webtricks collaboratively wrote and replaced two outdated topics in the board. One was about Taxation and another was about Bitcoin Resources. As of now, we do not have any unofficial rules governing us in our local board but we can work upon that and create a topic for the same replacing the old Unofficial Rules created by S_D.Additionally, Welcome to Indians topic is getting spammed to the core  They should obviously be replaced by NEW PEOPLE JOINING INDIAN SUB: INTRO AND MERIT. The Primary reason for creation of the same was for replacement but it never happened. So, let us request for that as well.What else do you think would require unpinning from the top?",

I just went through the thread and it getting spammed royally. I can even see non Indians newbies using it to introduce themselves. It doesn't make any sense, when it is clearly mentioned that the board is for Indians.Recently I filed my ITR and felt these new platforms are over charging users for calculating VDA & for filing ITR. I think we as a community with the help of webtricks should create a guide thread. The thread should teach on how to file ITR using ITR2 & 3 form. What do you think?",

One thread for each year.I agree! Rather going to the main thread and then trying to debunk through those updates it is better to summarize everything using this thread. As pawanjain said you don't need to reply to the existing thread every month. Update the OP with the summary and we can then comment on it. I would be happy if we start suggesting what we can do to increase the traffic on our local board. On this same thread every month. Next month we would be having Ganesh festival, if anyone here wants to suggest any activities before the festival starts then share it on this thread.",
