It's an interesting project though. I can only see how and where the project will go if successfully used by many.He would get some testers and ask them to find bugs in your project. Maybe little fees for finding bugs and testing exchange exchanges. That will do the job.",

The problem is inherent to the app itself and not necessarily to the device in concern. There isn't enough space on smaller screens to fit all the columns. That's why the user will need to scroll horizontally to be able to view all the columns. We are still working on the UX though so hopefully we will come up with a solution to this problem.The orders section is in beta phase. We have tested it with a few exchanges so far.The API details pertaining to the exchanges entered by the user are stored in the database in an encrypted format. The users must ensure that they provide read-only access. We have applied security measures to ensure a data breach never happens but it is something that's not inevitable. CoinTracker recently suffered from a hack even with all the precautions. For this reason, it is extremely important to ensure that only read access is being given.Quote from: cabron on January 10, 2023, 01:40:45 PMQuote from: CryptSafe on January 10, 2023, 01:18:59 PMWelcome onboard.

Hi. You will need to create an API on the exchange first. Please refer to this post. The API that you create must give read access only.",

Many exchanges provide public APIs that allow third-party platforms to access account data, such as open orders, in a read-only manner. By using these APIs, FusedFolio can access account data without needing a user's login credentials or exposing any sensitive information.",
