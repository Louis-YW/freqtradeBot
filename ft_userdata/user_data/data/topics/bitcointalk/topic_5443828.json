  "content": "A thought came over me while spending my BTC. Although I was wondering if members have had that experience and  too  how others would feel about it hence this topic. Now here was what happened. I had an emergency which requires an urgent attention and it involves funds. I had no option than  to get the funds immediately as the payment I was expecting has no yet been credited to my account I had no option at that moment than to fall back to my bitcoin and what touched me most was that the market was red and It was obvious I had to sell to sort out the urgency at hand. While doing that, there was this feelings I had then as a result of the red market as at the time I was doing the transaction . I was just having that thought over me then and wishing the market could just boom immediately so I could only release just a small fraction of my BTC to sort out things then and another was that I could just receive my much awaited alert so I could stop the BTC transaction immediately. You know that feelings that comes when you want to do something you really do not have plans doing immediately maybe you have plans for it in the future and all of a suden an emergency comes up which would force you to do the needful. I had that feelings and it was real and really devastating at that very moment.If you have had such experience, how was it like?",

You bought at top and had to sell at bottom because you have no choice.Having another money source for emergency will help you to have stronger hands, to hold your bitcoins better and to avoid \"buying at top, selling at bottom\" even you don't want to do this.",

There could be an emergency anytime, that's why you do not invest everything in Bitcoin. That is not a wise thing to do. You should only invest your extra money. Don't include in your risked money those savings that are set aside for possible emergencies and other expenses.",

I once sold bitcoins reluctantly because I needed more money than my savings, so I had to sell most of my bitcoins.

The most that is usually recommended is about 6 months' salary. More than that is being too conservative because you will lose money to inflation. So, if you already have 6 months of salary saved like the OP, the rest is better invested somehow. The problem is that sometimes you may have a more serious emergency than those 6 months' salary and be forced to sell, but it's far from the most common. In the last 15 years, the maximum unforeseen event that I have had was 2 months' salary, everything else I was able to foresee and save in advance to meet the expense.It should be noted that if you already have the 6 months and you foresee that you have to make a repair to the roof of your house because you have seen a leak, you have to save that money separately. So, it hasn't happened to me like the OP, but in the extreme case of an unforeseen event that forced me to sell part of my bitcoin, I don't think I would regret it, because I would be forced by circumstances and money is there for those occasions, not just for parties and trips.",

I did indeed have a similar situation years and years ago. It wasn't for that much, but still it felt bad. But what happened afterwards? So I took action and sold with a couple of stones in my chest, and right afterwards Bitcoin took a nosedive and I was lucky and could buy it back later on for less money. Did I regret that I had to sell? Luck was on my side obviously and that way the emergency was even cheaper than I initially thought. You don't want to find yourself in a situation where you have to sell your entire holdings. That's bad and if I get you right you also only sold a fraction. But again, I was lucky enough to be able to buy back cheaper afterwards. However, this is not the recommendation for anyone to try and time the market. Selling today and buying back cheaper tomorrow works as good as buying today and selling higher tomorrow.",
