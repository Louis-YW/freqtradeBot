  "content": "Bitcoin prices should ‘logically’ correct in Jan, but crypto’s a ‘wild card’The price of Bitcoin (BTC) should “logically” undergo a correction once spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are approved, though commentators also concede that crypto is a “wild card.\"Bitcoin has been gaining momentum over the last 11 months, with a jump in March amid banking uncertainty, another spike in June when BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and again in October, similarly due to optimism over spot Bitcoin ETF approvals.On Dec. 3, Bitcoin cleared the $40,000 mark, its highest level in 19 months.James Edwards, a cryptocurrency analyst at Finder, said that “logically,” the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF should trigger a sell-off event. “I'd like to say that logically this makes it a sell-the-news type event.”“Buy the rumor, sell the news” is a phrase that describes a situation where a stock or asset rises ahead of anticipated positive news or events but falls once the news is confirmed or the event occurs.https://twitter.com/crypto_caesar1/status/1731005263832867017“The idea that this is going to lead to widespread institutional buying on day 1 is a bit too optimistic,” explained Edwards, adding it is unlikely fund managers will “ape in the moment it goes live.”“It could be months – if not years – before we see truly groundbreaking inflows,” he added.https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-correction-january-crypto-wild-card",

      "body": "Well, it will only be a short correction just after the application was approved, but in the long-term that small recovery will be absorbed with the buy-in of the institutional investors. I think most of these outrageous predictions priced in that there will be a small hype cycle and their predictions come from the long-term injection of the institutional investors. Rome was not built in one day....",

I do have two qualms about this thread though:- Since when does mainstream crypto news talk about future corrections with a motive to cause people to sell, or miss the gain?- if the 15+ ETF applications are approved, wouldn't that create a race to accumulate Bitcoin between institutions?",
