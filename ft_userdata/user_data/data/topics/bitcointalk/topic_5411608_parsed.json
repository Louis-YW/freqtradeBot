  "content": "Hello everybody,recently stumbled over TXID 9332c8421680ae7f1f9a8db890028703025074687e7670e026ccbbd62156cb53 and as a beginner I'd like to understand how it's possible that the inputs all show the same address. In this example there are 16 inputs and all of them are the same address bc1qx65xcxz6dfsge2g4eaerercslh83y66wrpm79r.On the output side we see 449 BTC travelling to the address bc1qqqatshqv03yk5wg9xqthjuvnqwv7le9cehkd8n.What kind of transaction could this be ?",

      "body": "Because the inputs in a transaction is a set of previous transactions rather than the consolidated amount of coins.That is, if e.g. 3x1 BTC are send to address A, when those coins then are send to address B, the inputs are not 1x3 BTC but the 3 initial transactions with 1 BTC each. It's only after the coins are send from address B to address C that those inputs have been consolidated into a single input of 1x3 BTC (ie. the transaction from address A to address B).",

      "body": "The easiest analogy I know of regarding this is to consider each output from a transaction like physical bills or bank notes.Let's say I'm a merchant. Alice pays me a $5 bill for something. I put that $5 bill in my wallet. Bob pays me $20, so I put that bill in my wallet too. Charlie pays me $10. Dave pays me another $5. I now want to put all the money in to my bank account. So I head to the bank and pull out my wallet. I can't hand over a single $40 bill, despite the contents of my wallet being $40. Instead I have to give them the $20, the $10, and the two $5s, to make $40 in total. All the money comes from the same place (my wallet), and it all adds up to the total ($40), but it is still very much separate amounts of money until the bank takes it and turns it in to $40 in my account.The same is true of bitcoin, even bitcoin which is all sent to the same address. Just like the bank notes coming out of my wallet, the bitcoin coming out of the same address in the transaction you have linked does not combine in to one single amount until it is spent.",
