You don't have to store your bitcoin in any exchange site because you don't have full control of your coin, after purchasing from exchange that is more friendly to your country moved them out, and before that make sure to pass kyc to avoid drama while your coin is inside the exchange.

I don't think that would be worth the cost of bitcoin right now.",

Be very careful because there are many people who are scamming people of their money because they have disguised themselves properly as vendors of Bitcoin to fool people and they take advantage of the interest of new investors to invest in bitcoins to deceive them into buying bitcoins from fake websites or platforms. These scammers can contact you from anywhere and on any platform including this forum, you have to always be watchful and careful to know that you cannot always trust people online.",

Do you want to know if this is the right time to buy?3.) Do you just want to know more about Bitcoin?Here's my answer to them.1.] You have two options where to buy either P2P exchange or centralized exchange. If you're fine passing the KYC you can buy BTC in centralized exchange.If not and don't want to submit any documentation then P2P exchange is your option you can check the list of P2P exchanges here https://kycnot.me/2.] Since there is an upcoming event for Bitcoin then yes. It is about block halving meaning once the event come the supply will be cut into half from 6.25BTC to 3.125BTC most trader and people here knows this every block halving the price of Bitcoin skyrocket. So you're not late yet to buy Bitcoin.3.] I suggest check the Bitcoin price history and history of Bitcoin here below.- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin#Prices_and_value_history- https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Amp/Bitcoin_history",

Am try to buy the bitcoin. But I need some ideas for bitcoin. Kindly help. It's not a bad call to buy, but the sweet spot is usually during a bear market. Right now, prices are riding high, so your profit margins won't be as hefty compared to accumulating coins during a bearish phase. After the last bull run, Bitcoin took a dive to $16k, and since then, it's skyrocketed by over 100%. I'm not ruling out potential gains now, though. When the bull run hits, it's forecasted to smash its previous all-time high, translating to some serious profits for you.",

The wallet may be adjusted to suit the OP's abilities and needs.Yes, many say that BTC is entering its bullish phase, yes it doesn't matter if we make large purchases at once without DCA, even if the price of Bitcoin falls, the biggest possibility is that BTC will rise again and be bullish again, because halving has historically been able to bring the price of Bitcoin up to make ATH new. Maybe it's only a matter of time until that happens, it all depends on how patient and able we are to hold BTC until its value doubles.",

You are no longer new to the market, judging by the age of your account, you are also someone who has gone through 2 bull seasons and 2 bear seasons. That means you've seen all the ups and downs of the market and I think you've got some experience investing in bitcoin. So I really don't understand what support do you need from us? I believe that someone who has been in the market since 2017 will no longer be unfamiliar with buying bitcoin using the DCA method or storing it in a non-custodial wallet...You should be more specific about the problem you really need help with.",

Am try to buy the bitcoin. But I need some ideas for bitcoin. Kindly help.  I would've love to give you the answer from my knowledge but it's not too necessary so I will only quote so advice or decoded ways to buy bitcoin from some members here. Quote from: JayJuanGee on December 15, 2021, 02:10:03 AM Once BTC accumulation targets are either established or at least there is some directional appreciation that you have to accumulate some bitcoin, then the next strategy would be to consider how to go about BTC accumulation.  Surely, the best three ways to consider BTC accumulation is through 1) dollar cost averaging (DCA), 2) lump sum investing and 3) buying on dips.  The consideration of these three strategies is also best in the order that I presented them.  DCA has the advantage of having a kind of regular flow into your BTC investment that can really add up over time.  Lump sum investing is many times not available for the vast majority of normies, and sure of course, if you have some abilities to lump sum invest there is nothing wrong with exercising such option because having a lump sum gives you options to invest it all at once or to even engage in some kind of DCA approach with investing the lump sum over time rather than all at once.  Buying on dips is not a bad idea, but it requires timing the market.",

I’m skeptical on what solution you are asking because buying at correction is always a good idea.There’s tons of idea that you can do to Bitcoin but again your question vague that is really confusing to answer. Just do DCA whenever there’s price correction and hold it until the price reach above ATH.",

If you are having this idea running in your head then I will advise you not to buy bitcoin because bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme.      On the other hand, if you are buying bitcoin because you are seeing bitcoin as an asset or a store of value or because your country currency is depreciating and you want to use bitcoin as an hedge to inflation...good. First of all, you should have it in mind that bitcoin is a long term investment because that is the only way that you can lessen the risk in bitcoin if you are on a long term investment. After that you should prepare yourself and plan on how much that you will use to buy bitcoin every week or monthly that wouldn't affect your monthly expenses. You should have an emergency funds available that will enable you take care of any emergency during your accumulating period. DCA regularly will help you to increase your bitcoin size and you have to set a goal on your bitcoin target so that this can enable you to be focused. You can invest for 4-10yrs and above. During investing, you can start learning the area that you will love to know more. Don't keep your bitcoin in an exchange but keep them in a non-custodial wallet.",

Here's my two cents on it: Keep tabs on the market and price fluctuations, figure out how much you can reasonably invest to start, and find a solid platform to actually buy from.  I know it can seem daunting at first but Bitcoin is an exciting opportunity if you go about it carefully.
