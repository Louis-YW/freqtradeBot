I think there are plenty of testnet coin that are presume to launch their own, but hence using such network first to try out and test their network. Is fuji network belong to the subnet of avalanche and can be considered on their own once launch on the subnet like swimmer network?",

But maybe they will reward them by their own network since I knew that avax has testnet before and given them a validator node for trying which is locked on a vested period.",

      "body": "QuoteWHAT IS AVALANCHE FAUCET?The term ‘Avalanche Faucet’ indicates an open platform for developers and enthusiasts to claim free AVAX on the Avalanche Testnet.Its mechanism stands out as the core of the whole testnet environment.As a reason, without the testnet AVAX, developers would have nothing to pay for gas fees in the process of Smart Contract deployment.Please keep in mind that it has no market value, but for development purposes only.Anyone can access the Avalanche Faucet to claim testnet AVAX at faucet.avax-test.network well, I don't think this could help to encourage people from joining. Maybe, if they could offer something even if it was just small in return, this likely gain a strong response from the community and it makes more sense. And what I guess about this thing is not totally a failure but somehow, we couldn't expect success as well. Honestly, people want compensation. They instead use their main token to reward those who come and join to become successful.",
