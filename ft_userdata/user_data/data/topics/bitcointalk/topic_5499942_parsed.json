Just maybe dont put all your life savings in there if you know your memory isnt perfect.  I mean, losing access to your funds would be a major bummer, dont you think?",

It may seem possible in the first few weeks and months, but with time you are going to forget it, and if you don't completely forget, you'll mess up the correct arrangement. Do not ever memorize your seed phrase, or else you'll lock yourself out of your funds.If you are worried about the safety of your seed phrase, you can extend it with a passphrase and keep the backup in a different location from your seed phrase, or you simply set up a multisig wallet, which gives you extra security.",

There are many threads on the topic and it’s a general consensus among the bitcoin community that relying solely on one’s memory is a terrible way of storing your seed phrase. If you are worried about the lifespan of paper storage, you can always opt for other methods like engraving your seeds in steel, and having multiple backups in different locations.

This is because seed phrase is not what you use often but only to recovery a wallet whose password has been forget or don't have the wallet app on their device or computer anymore.People easily forget their password that they use to login to their accounts every day, talk more of memorizing your seed phrase. It is not good, human thinks a lot and will be faced with stress that might make the brain not remember much.This is why when you are creating a new wallet you will be advised to write down your seed phrase on a piece of paper and put the words accurately before your wallet will be created.

That's not easy even if it's just 12 words I'm sure we can memorize those 12 words but not good for the long term I've been tested it to memorize my backup but after a week I can only remember 5 or 7 words maybe if the backup seed is just around 5 words we can memorize it.However, since we are getting older I'm sure our memory become less effective when it comes to remembering something plus why need to memorize if you can just save your seed backup into an offline device and never connect it online or use a CD/DVD to backup your wallet that is way safer than memorizing 12 words.",

I'm wondering what could go wrong since my place isn't too secured.  How about trying to memorize it? Is it possible?Of course - it's possible especially if you do some techniques. One of the techniques I remember most in memorizing is - write as many of those 12 words as possible and read as many as possible. You have to repeat the same thing until you can remember it even if you are drunk. But are you also willing to bear the risk?Another easy solution to be safe is - take security measures like most of the bitcoin whales do. If you know how they do it - then your bitcoins will probably be safe before you pass them on to your children, wife or family.Quote from: Article4tip on June 14, 2024, 07:03:19 PMWould you try?What are the benefits? ... and the setbacks.No - I'm a forgetful person.
