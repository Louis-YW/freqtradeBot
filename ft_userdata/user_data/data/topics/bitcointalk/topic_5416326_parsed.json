  "content": "QuoteAn array of crypto-related services have been targeted in the latest round of sanctions on Russia approved by the EU. The measures are part of an expected tightening of the economic and financial restrictions in response to Moscow’s decision to annex Ukrainian territories.EU Council Adopts Full Ban on Crypto Wallet and Custody Services for Russian PersonsThe Council of the European Union announced new sanctions against Russia on the backdrop of the deepening military conflict in Ukraine. The penalties, expected to hurt the Russian government and economy, come after Moscow took steps to annex the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.In a statement, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell emphasized that the sanctions are a response to the latest escalation with the “fake referenda” in these four oblasts. Russian individuals and entities that have played a role in their organization will be specifically targeted.Other Russian citizens and businesses are also going to take a hit, including those that deal with cryptocurrencies. The new measures include a full ban on the provision of wallet, account, or custody services for crypto assets to Russian persons and residents. That’s regardless of the value of these assets, according to the eighth package of sanctions imposed by Brussels.This spring, when the EU approved its fifth round of such measures, the Council prohibited only the provision of “high-value” crypto-asset services to Russians and organizations registered in their country. The ban applied to digital funds exceeding €10,000 (close to $11,000 at the time).New European Sanctions to Hit Russian Imports and ExportsWhile the earlier restrictions were meant to limit the transfer of wealth through digital assets and close other loopholes in the crypto space, a recent report revealed that pro-Russian groups have been actively using cryptocurrency, often in small transactions, to fund paramilitary operations in Ukraine. According to the research, they have raised $400,000 in crypto since the start of the invasion in late February. Russian authorities have also been working to allow businesses to employ crypto payments for international settlements.With the latest move, the EU also bans the provision of IT consultancy and legal advisory services to Russia as well as architectural and engineering services. Russian imports and exports have been targeted, too, including the maritime transport of crude oil and petroleum products to third countries. The provision of related services will be allowed only if these have been purchased at or below a pre-established price cap, which is yet to be determined.Among the other measures is a ban on EU nationals to hold any posts on the governing bodies of some Russian state-owned or government-controlled entities. The Council also decided to broaden the criteria under which persons can be designated as facilitating the circumvention of restrictions imposed by the European Union. The European Commission, the executive body in Brussels, welcomed the latest sanctions package.SourceI am not sure what is the agenda here but if you read it closely then it seems that EU's now trying to cease the \"settlements\" that are being done in the crypto payments for whatever imports and exports that Russia might do/did and somehow they are trying to block the payment pathways so as to stop back doors as well. However, as far as I understand crypto can't be stopped over a sanction because EU does not control the blockchain and neither they could track down whose payment it is and where is it going?As long as the payment settler is an entity, registered organization and be involved in the payments directly or indirectly, I am sure they can do so as they will have all the companies domain information and tack them eventually.But is it real sanction?Is it really going to affect the crypto transaction for Russia or any entity involved if they are saying so?",

EU is hampering themselves as the war continues. Though they are powerful together but they lack the natures power of getting daily fuel. The more they stretch it the more they gonna dig up the holes for themselves. Russia has advantage of geolocation and strategic partners across the asian continent so they are going to get money by all means for their crude oil.If this continues then EU will pay heavy tolls in the future when global recession hits with full power.

In fact crypto isnt in anyone's control still they are having so called treaties for all the bans and stuff. Seems nothing is going into right direction here.",

If Russia will stop the war, these sanctions will stay for a while, we may not see the effect of this but eventually, Russia will fail. Let’s not hope that Russia will not escalate this war into a nuclear war, those sanctions may trigger Russia to do this but i hope EU are ready for that.",

I wonder why that is.Russia unleashed the most brutal and bloody war against Ukraine, which was not in Europe after the Second World War. The Nazis behaved in Ukraine much more humane than the \"fraternal Russian people\" in Ukraine. After the liberation of the settlements, the Ukrainians see in each torture chambers and basements where they tortured, mocked and killed pro-Ukrainian citizens. Russian soldiers abuse and kill Ukrainians just for having in their homes or wearing attributes of Ukrainian statehood. The Russians are deliberately destroying hospitals, schools, plants and factories in Ukraine, everything that can serve the economic development of the country and the normal life of the citizens of Ukraine. Recently, attacks on thermal power plants, hydraulic structures, and other critical infrastructure facilities have become more frequent. In general, the Russian bulk kills and destroys everything in its path in Ukraine. Everything that can be stolen and taken out is stolen and taken out of Ukraine.It is not Putin who does this, it is the fathers, brothers and sons of \"innocent Russians\" who ask to bring either the head of a Ukrainian, or a specifically stolen thing, or they are allowed to rape, just do not tell them, and so on.The population of Russia not only did not protest against the war, but supported it by more than 70 percent. True, before the war began to concern almost every Russian after Putin announced mobilization. Therefore, in Russia there are no innocent people in the war against Ukraine, passivity is also complicity. And for this, all Russian citizens will have to pay for many subsequent generations.",

( Nuclear Weapons )Russia is unsuccessfully trying to find ways to win the war it started in Ukraine, as it suffers a military defeat on the fronts of Ukraine. Therefore, Putin and his entourage tried to scare the world with the use of nuclear weapons. In response, they received a rather harsh warning about catastrophic consequences for Russia from the United States and England, as well as a statement from Ukraine that even the use of nuclear weapons on its territory would not stop the resistance of Ukrainians. This cooled the Kremlin's desire to brandish a nuclear cudgel, and lately they no longer do it and declare that, according to the constitution, nuclear weapons can be used as a last resort, when there is a real threat to the existence of the Russian Federation as a state.Putin has now changed tactics and has been launching massive rocket attacks on Ukrainian cities over the past few days, targeting the infrastructure that supplies civilians with electricity, heat and water. Moreover, Putin saw the support of such strikes from his own population and therefore does not hide the purpose of missile strikes on civilian critical infrastructure. However, this did not intimidate Ukraine and caused a lot of indignation on the part of the international community. Now the Kremlin is confused and they do not know what to do next.",
