That's hundreds of millions of potential customers, and it's far more transactions than Bitcoin can handle on-chain. So if you want Bitcoin mass adoption, you'd better use the Lightning Network.QuoteIt will have a \"Get Bitcoin\" button where plan is for visitors to be able to easily stockup on their bitcoin.You mean like a faucet?",

Is the button going to be for tipping, or is it going to be a \"Buy Bitcoin\" button that points to some exchange?",

I think alxs is thinking of providing basic information to site visitors, where they can read how and where to buy bitcoin that would ultimately be used to pay the artists as he calls them. I seriously doubt the idea is to tip potential clients from his own pockets. That would be a first. A fetish porn website with a faucet for the pervert in you.@alxsWhat fetish are we talking about here? For all you know, some people might be into various kinky stuff. Throw us a bone.",

Great project, this is not just a directory where you list top new adult sites but also you have cam girls paid in BTC?",
