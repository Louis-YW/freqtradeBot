The issue in the country is not the extension of of depositing deadline date but the circulation of the new Naira banknotes. The deadline can still be the on Tuesday if the new Naira banknotes is fully in circulation, people will meet up to deposit their old note and take the new note. But if the extension is till September and the new note is not available, the same things (cry, suffering and others) will still happen so there is no need for Happiness. If the new note is not available before the next deadline, the cry will be worst than this. That is, you will still request for another extension again.",

The new note is still scarce and I don't know why the banks are still hoarding it. I dey suspect say some of this rich politicians son call some bank managers and MD to keep the new note for them to fit send their old note for swap. Na naija we dey anything can happen. All these wahala na bcos of this election o. I get information say one part for Delta state all shops son close down dey wait till Wednesday before dem go open,they only sell to people who will make transfer to their account, if not sorry.

The commercial banks even claimed that this pressure on them to return it this week has produced positive reports. What I take is if this old notes aren’t return and the new notes are given out excessively it defeats the sole purpose of this whole redesign process which is to have more than 70% of the paper money in banks. The only thing the CBN can do to reduce this pressure is to mount pressure on this banks to give out more new notes for this next 10 days and we will know how it goes",

This country is dead and buried in corruption. Incase you don't know the story behind the old and new naira circulation. Listen!Commercial banks have used the new Naira notes given to them to give politicians who came with old money and the politicians are no hoarding it for election and that is why the new notes are scarce on arrival.",

The CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, on Sunday, said President Muhammadu Buhari gave permission for the deadline to be extended to February 10. In its swift reaction, the Ad Hoc Committee, chaired by the leader of the House, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, rejected the extension, insisting that the CBN must comply with sections 20 sub 3, 4, and 5 of the CBN act. Doguwa said that, ” The 10-day extension for the exchange of the old naira notes is not the solution.“And the House would go ahead to sign arrest warrant to compel the CBN Governor to appear before the ad hoc committee.” He said under his chairmanship, the committee would continue its work until it gets the demands of Nigerians addressed in accordance with the laws of the land. Describing the extension as a mere political gimmick to further deceive Nigerians and worsen their economic and social livelihood, Doguwa said the CBN governor must appear before or stand the risk of being arrested on the strength of legislative writs signed by the Speaker on Monday.  He also said the policy is capable of frustrating the forthcoming general elections. “Security agencies and their operations, especially at the state level, are generally funded through cash advances and direct table payments of allowances to operatives during elections,” he said.Source: https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/01/old-naira-notes-reps-reject-cbns-10-day-deadline-extension/",

Some people may still decide to accept the old currency, but that's a bad idea. Reject the old currency if it's been given to you; at least that will urge people to send it for deposit in the bank and help the new note circulate faster. Again, based on the misconception about the information and from Sokani's reply, I don't really think the date had been agreed upon by the Nigerian president. Last time I saw him on air around last week, he was saying that Nigerians have been given since November until January, which is 3 months, to return the old currency to the bank, but they kept using and accepting the old currency. He clearly said that it is not the fault of the government that Nigerians are neglecting their instructions.",

Why do you need to stop your business because of the naira swap. The only thing you gats do is to stop accepting the old naira notes from your customers, it is either they pay you with the new naira notes, or make them do transfer, or make you go get PoS machine for your business so your customers go fit pay you through that way.
