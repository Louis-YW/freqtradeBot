  "content": "With positive data coming on CPI data for July, the market responded bullishly giving signs of an altcoin bull run. Data showed that consumer prices grew 8.50% in July year on year, below expectations of 8.70%. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data led to a bullish environment in the financial markets. While Bitcoin saw an upsurge of around 4.30%, Ethereum price rose nearly 7.50% after the CPI data release.

      "body": "Price resistance should be around $25k-$28k or even $30k to Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum at around $2k. It will be a relieved if this prices will be reach by both top coins. What I mean is that we have been hoping that it can go on a swing after hitter all time lows. So we might see some sort of mini bull run and then maybe few sideways again. So we will have to see if the CPI announcement is really very positive to crypto and the rest of traditional market and if the effect is going to be sustainable.",

At least this month Bitcoin and Altcoins will be green.I hope so. The question is what rate will be used by bitcoin to close its weekly candle. The chart seems to be bullish but i would believe if that was about recovering the price. If we are talking about the bullish trend seems the chart is not so bullish as well. If bitcoin would able to recover its price to the 30k or even more and that will become a very good price to start with. We do always see that if bitcoin was always making another higher low. it keeps repeating any year. I hope that if recover will be happening as fast as possible and bitcoin will be mooning again.",

It's because of what they've seen from the others who got lucky investing into those low cap coins.They're too hype with it because it's likely that they'll all be rich with it and that's the reason why many still invests into low cap coins and even most of them are meme coins.",

As inflation came down more than expected in July compared to June but we have to wait more especially for the interest rate decision and the August CPI report will also be looked at for the interest rate decision. If inflation comes down in August as well, the hope is that interest rates will not be hiked and that will be very good news for market improvement.",

Is it true?, it's really hard to find a hidden gem in a bear market. I'm very curious to know the project that you guys invest in this bear season, x28 is a huge profit. Can you share about that project?",

This cost me 1550$ at the time and at 3900$ I started selling",
