  "content": "Thinking to the future and the fact that many governments are acting more and more like communist dictatorships instead of a democracy I see a possible time coming where they will want to subjugate everyone and dictate every movement and financial transaction in our lives, WEF Klaus Schwab said something along these lines at the beginning of the scamdemic, you will own nothing and be happy about it. Frankly I dont want to play any part in that kind of society at all.We need an aternate economy, one that is not controlled by government, not controlled by the Rothchilds banking cartel. If we stop using \"Their\" money their nasty little communist games are over.So, what providers, shops, goods and services do you all currently know of that offer bitcoin as an alternative payment source instead of fiat currency?Is there a bitcoin services directory?, if not perhaps there's an opportunity to create a yellow pages for bitcoin enabled shops and services.",

Now we have a new desk, lamp, an office chair and a few other gadgets and all the codes are gone  Give your woman some money and she'll find ways to turn it into goods and services",

Small businesses nowadays have to provide e-payment as one of options for customers if they don't want to lose potential customers. Same with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment options now and in future.QuoteI even made a transaction like that to buy a PC and several other devices at a store that actually doesn't accept Bitcoin payments. The transaction can happen with some discussion and interest from the seller.Such deals can be done privately B2C and if Bitcoin, cryptocurrency payments are not legal in your country, there is more reason to do it privately and a business owners will not take risk by providing QR code for Bitcoin receive from customers to public eyes. If you can discuss with them, you can have private deal to purchase their goods and services through Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.",
