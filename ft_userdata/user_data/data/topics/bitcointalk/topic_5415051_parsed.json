  "content": "Lies and rumours have existed since the beginning of humanity. But if they were local at the time, they can now travel around the world in seconds thanks to social networks and impact a very large audience. Indeed, 4.48 billion people are active on social networks every month and 56.8% of the world's population is part of a social network (Statista, July 2021).With such a large number of users comes a gigantic production of information. Every minute, 240,000 photos are shared on Facebook and 500,000 tweets are posted.‍In this flood of information, it is difficult to sort out, and misinformation can then make its way easily. It is estimated that only 12 people are responsible for 65% of the false information on covid in the US.This misinformation directly threatens our societies by creating bipolarisation of society between 'pro' and 'anti' camps based on two completely different realities depending on what is read on social media feeds.Decentralisation as a solutionWith Exorde, we want to add nuance to this flood of information. By tracing the spread of information on the web and linking similar facts together, we want to source each piece of information.‍To achieve this, we are creating a decentralised economy and community whose mission will be to scrape and link all the public data passing on the web. These contributors will be rewarded with the crypto-currency we create and will be able to progress through our system over time.TeamWe are three co-founders: Térence, Mathias and Damien. We are all software engineers and we decided to use our skills to fight disinformation and fake news.Térence, CEO, is developing the company's strategy and is looking for our future investors.Mathias, CTO, is creating a robust protocol and finetuning our network's tokenomics.Damien, COO, develops the applications and puts his writer's hat on for the communication part.Website: https://exorde.network/Twitter: https://twitter.com/ExordeLabsDiscord: https://discord.gg/ExordeLabs",
