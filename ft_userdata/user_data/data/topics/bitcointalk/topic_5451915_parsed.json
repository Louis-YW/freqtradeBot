This is a concerning situation, as it suggests that foundry may be attempting to manipulate the blockchain for their own benefit. Without more information, it is impossible to determine the exact motivations behind foundry's actions. However, any attempt to temper with the blockchain is highly problematic, as the blockchain's security relies on the assumption that all nodes are working together honestly.",

Is it not possible that Foundry's nodes aren't updating quick enough, so they are simply just trying to mine blocks that have already been mined without realising it? I'd like to believe DaveF's theory that this is likely out of incompetence, as there isn't any financial benefit for a mining pool to do this right?That said, he also mentioned that if it happened again they are evil (which has since happened as you pointed out).
