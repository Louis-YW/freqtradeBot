They will build a good relation with you. One day you will send large amount of money for example $10k. You will not hear any response from them anymore. I think having a mentality of building trust for both parties are very risky for trading online.I will always, suggest to use escrow service when you are trading crypto currency online. There will be some fees but it's worth for the safety.",

Either one will get scammed or both are scammers.Btw, your email id which you posted here (archive link), connects with an other account (Btcspot) [with a lot of negative trust by DT members] who posted the same address here (archive link). Meaning, both the accounts Btcspot and Bitarock are yours and you're a confirmed scammer!!PS: Nobody should deal with this user if you love your money.",
