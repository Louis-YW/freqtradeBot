In regards to the part on high intelligence and power, that in other words could mean \"recognized and famous people are not necessarily powerful or very intelligent\". I think those recognitions kind of lower intelligence and power when they get into the heads of the recepients . It's better to just avoid them by being discreet in our good works or giving glory to the ONE who made the good works possible > in regards to being yourself, that is tricky part considering the fact that most people have been corrupted to be what they were not originally created to be. They have been programmed into something else by the kind of information they consume. That corrupted part is not their true selves but of the corruptor. So it's safer to tell them to be who they were created to be else they take up  false selves/personalities such as homosexuals, filthy singers, movie groomed scientists, false economists etc. They need healings to discover their true selves.  Obviously certain people learn through mistakes, failure, trail and error. But we here don't pray for that. We are called to be perfect by our CREATOR, as it's written \"be ye perfect\".And Ofcourse, we don't quit. It's hard to quit what gives you alot of satisfaction, happiness and joy no matter the challenges faced. People who quit are clearly missing this.",

And you still face them with lots of courage and passion.I don't have much to say about this. I was born and grew up in an environment which really close to poverty, I have witnessed a lot of dreams withered and succumb to reality, but also I have watched people who had privilege in list just wasted their resources for nothing. What I have learn is, fortune play a big role besides hardwork, no matter what we do, no matter how hard you work, if you are not fortunate enough, if the fate is not on your side, you may not gonna work. I might sound like a pessimistic person, but that's what I think based on my experiences so far, eventho I think like that, if we stop working hard, we will not have chance at all against fate.",

Most of us have gifts that will fetch us a fortune but because we believe its not societally accepted as a standard we tend to want to do awway with it.  If we can handle our crafts and believe in ourselves, we'll excel in our areas.",

We can say we learn from mistake but not all mistake is Worth learning, any mistake that have take your happiness and possibly give emotion Truman should not be given room to occur at first place. Setting the right goal and achieving it at appropriate time give more healthy life and joy even if life is deem to be short on earth.",
