As of yesterday the price range was between $30-31k but today it's $34,300 as at time of writing but we are hoping for more highs since it has stayed on the $27-28k range for too long.Yeah, those future traders will benefit more from this pump and while I'm hoping it stays this way, I will not rule out a possibility of it going back down. QuoteJust within an hour plus bitcoin rose by $5k which I don't think anyone had expected it in this way  This is not something we should be surprised because when the Grayscale ETF was approved, Bitcoin price shot to almost $28k in a short period of time.",

This price action happened too when Blackrock first filed their ETF and other event. Bitcoin show more stronger gain than that in the past bullrun.It’s a sign how strong the Bitcoin market when everyone is positive. This is FOMO buying due to speculation for the upcoming ETF.",

I could remember how many times forum members have speculated that bitcoin price will not cross 33k by the end of this year, but right now still in the month of October we have seen the highest rise in bitcoin price since 2022. This shows that bitcoin is a good asset to invest in and anyone that has bought yet can still buy because nobody knows what bitcoin price will be by the end of this year. If ETF Bitcoin is approved by January, it means that bitcoin price will go above 120k as the new ATH.",

Is it because that most in your portfolio are altcoins and you've got less allocation in Bitcoin? When we're in a bull run and it is started by Bitcoin, at most times it is being followed by altcoin season. But as far as I can see, Ethereum is following it as well and has got a few hundreds in addition of its former price yesterday. And going back to Bitcoin's move, there's no official announcement yet about Bitcoin's ETF approval so, these indicators and factors could lead to more rise in less than 24 hours. It gives us the idea on how much Bitcoin can move on unexpected days so there could be more to this. Whether you hold Bitcoins or altcoins, what matters here is the bull run that's very imminent to come.",

I rule out that view because looking at the halving which is getting closer people will continue to buy then the pressure in the market is getting higher including them to prepare for investment starting from now.",

If you've been here on this market for a while then having this movement wont really actually get you shocked because we know that this market is really that something volatile.It just turns out that after a couple of years which the price isnt moving yet and if it turns out that you are just new since you are just that registered on last year then i do see the reason on why you do make out such commonabout such movement on which i would tell you that 5k movement in a day is really just that normal or something not really new into this space. There's really that times that it even considered to be a normal day with Bitcoin, it did really just make out some minimal move because of that crypto winter but since its been said or announced that its already over then expect that movement somethinglike this would already be that common or something that could be seen from time to time.If you do find yourself that able to make profits in short time then better to secure it off before the market would really be making out some correction, but if you are really that going for long termthen these movements wont really be that an issue for you. Get used to this market because it did really have that kind of behavior in the first place.It just turns out that this had been just your first time.",

It's probably one rare case that altcoins didn't follow bitcoin's spike. On the other hand, we are still in the heart of the bear market, and still altcoins investors are very reluctant to put their money on altcoins. Or it could be that they are putting their money on bitcoin right now to jump with the hype of the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval or the listing of such ticket. And if I'm not mistaken, the price hits $35k, the highest for this year, although it drop a bit to $33k, but still it's a good price to hand at this point of the year. Because it might coincide with the majority prediction that the price at the end of the year will be around $40k-$50k. So just a couple of dollars to hit that price.

Investors may have sold some of their Bitcoins to take advantage. However, many investors are still holding Bitcoin and not selling it at yesterday's high price.But it is still far from the previous ATH where Bitcoin is currently still struggling to reach the previous ATH. And now, the price correction has come. This correction makes me curious because with the $34k level reached, where will the price of Bitcoin fall? Can Bitcoin price remain above $30k during the current correction or will Bitcoin price return to below $30k?It remains a mystery to us. And people who bought Bitcoin at $33k or $34k yesterday could be worried because they bought Bitcoin at high prices. But if they don't panic about the decline in Bitcoin and can hold their Bitcoin tightly, they will see that they will make a profit in the future.I don't think there has been a price correction right now from the significant increase that occurred in the last few days, currently the price is still in the $34k-$35k price range which means it is still quite high and we are still waiting to see whether the increase will continue or vice versa.We don't deserve to talk about ATH right now, currently a significant increase has just occurred and we are entering a halving time which allows us to return to seeing the things we want.There is no need to panic, Bitcoin's movement tends to be more in a positive direction this year, and that indicates it will continue until the end of the year, and I am quite optimistic about that.Just wait for it, we arent still on bull market yet and just like been said or mentioned above by some posters. We are really just that still far away on bull run or year and half basing up on the historyon which there's really that still chance for you to wait up for some extreme dips or corrections on which it could really happen on this year into the next.This is why it would really be just that fine that you should really be taking up some assumption that there would really be some further dumps that could happen along the way. If you are really that just new into this market then these things would really be surely be experienceabout that roller coaster ride on which it is really just that something that very normal into this market. Now tend to look around on the news and sentiments that floating on which it seems that we would really be having some nasty corrections around the corner. This is why you should really be that careful on what are the things that you would really be gonna do specially on deciding whether on buying or selling because in any actions be made then there would really be a corresponding effects next to it. This is why you should really be wise on taking up decisions or else it would really be costing you.",
