It's $200 pre-order. Who knows if it will actually stay that way.I thought this was some kind of Blackberry joke first, but then I remembered it was not April 1st. It's obvious to me they are concerned with their main competition Passport wallet, so they decided to go with this phone look direction instead of old calculator style, but having 3xAAA batteries is a big mistake in my opinion.Similar thing with batteries was done by Keystone essentials and Passport wallet first edition, and it didn't work very well for both of them.Good thing to see that this year is going to be very interesting for hardware wallets, now we have Coldcard Q1, and new Keystone and Trezor should also come out.",

Well they are both Canadian companies. You never know the engineers might have been sharing a Molson and some Timbits and decided to swap ideas.IF and that is a big IF, the power circuit is done properly using 3 standard AAA batteries is not a big deal. Also, it still allows for USB power so even if that is bad you can still power up the device the old way too.Lets see how the final product comes out and if they still keep the open public hardware schematics like they did with the other models.-Dave",

I do not like sealed units that have special batteries which you would need to either break the sealed unit or send it back to the company to replace batteries. These batteries they are using will always be available and I know I can leave my hardware wallet in storage for 20 years and I will find some of these batteries if the batteries have died. NFC communication is my biggest worry I am not a fan of NFC I think it makes devices less secure and if someone gets into your house or where you are storing your hardware wallet they might not even need to physically touch it and could wave a another NFC communication device to interact with the wallet. I wish this was optional I do not even have NFC on my phone because I do not like the tech. I like that we have dual sd cards but what would be the use of having 2 sd cards in the device at the same time?",

I found your conflict really amuzing, can't wait for NVK to join the party soon and talk more about QR code scanner and device dimensions.Speaking about code, Coldcard doens't care at all about being open source, so it' doesn't matter f they use propriety code.In their defense again, secure element you are using in Passport is also not open source and it has security issues, that is why it was outdated by manufacturer",

Maybe, but than you would have to trust manufacturer they are telling the truth about self-destruction.Mnay times it's just a security theater like in case with Safepal, and I remember people managed to easily bypass Cobo (now Keystone) self-destruction mechnism.",
