There was also a threat that was discussed about better fan if you were digging a little bit. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5443190.0If you were still trying to shill it by creating new account and i think that will be just only ruining the reputation of better fan. It's not something new. I prefer to use trusted reputable site like stake rather than it. It's just another new platform that recycle the common idea and mix it with web3.",

It is better to read about a project before posting or commenting about it. This project will find it very hard to gain market share, the number of crypto betting sites that have sprung up recently is on the increase and you can see most of them are spending very hard to get noticed and they are one of the most carried signature campaigns in the space. So the team needs to work harder rather than spamming the forum with their thread",

And if I'm not mistaken, there is a token around the World Cup and obviously after the event, the token price goes down hard.So it might be successful in the beginning, specially for fans that are supporting their club.But sooner or later there will be times that the token price will go down, in my opinion.",

I do not think so. Precisely with this it makes people think why should it be promoted with lots of new accounts created At least in this case when your project really can be held accountable, you should also be better at token promotions like this.",
