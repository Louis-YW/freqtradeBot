A friend of mine told me that Bitcoin has been sent to her wallet and since two today it fails to confirm, so can she make it to be confirm faster with application??",

However there are a few that do not. Electrum does. Core does. What wallet is it that your friend is using?You still did not answer the question of what is the TXID. With that we can probably give you an estimate on what fee would have to be used to send the TX. Keep in mind the mempool is filled with a bunch of low fee TXs at the moment so it should not be that much (probably under 20 sat/vb) but without more information it all a guess.-Dave",
