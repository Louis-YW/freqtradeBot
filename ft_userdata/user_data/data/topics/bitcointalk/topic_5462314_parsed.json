If I were to bet on this, I'd bet against him. But this man isn't a John McAfee or a Balaji who were apparently exaggerating in their predictions. Adam Back seems to be a very reasonable man for me. I know he's just reacting to Cointelegraph's article Bitcoin miners need BTC price over $98K by the halving — Analysis. But he's really convinced that Bitcoin will indeed reach at least $100,000 on or before the halving. He's willing to bet on it. Do you think Adam Back's prediction is realistic? Are you as bullish as him?",

I think we will hit $100,000 probably in 2025 but if the raft of spot etf’s get approved then that could see us pump to $100,000 quick enough for AB to win his bet. I’m thinking he will lose his bet but I wouldn’t he overly surprised if he were to win it. Let’s wait & see what happens.",

It's better if we just skip the predictions or we keep in a special note about all the predictions from people so we can analyze them later.I am still bullish and feel that the Bitcoin price could be over $100k, but I don't know when that will happen. And I also don't care about other people's predictions because I focus on collecting more Bitcoin now. You should also have the same focus on collecting Bitcoins rather than just reading predictions from other people because that will make you forget to try to collect Bitcoins.Let that prediction be a prediction, especially since we don't know what will happen in the future or a few months later. We have to try to have many Bitcoins at times like now to get big profits when bull runs occur.",

I'm not sure $100k will be hit before the halving, but if this bet is about face value after the halving then I'd say it's a reasonable bet. I'm bullish on bitcoin, but $100k won't be reached before the halving and maybe 3-5 after the halving.It will take considerable time and support from investors for $100k to become a reality, but if a bitcoin ETF is approved then there is a possibility that $100 will be reached sooner than many think.",

The flat earth comparison i did in previous post is a bit too strong here, because it's total absurdity, and 3x from the current price on bitcoin is possible. So Adam made this deal in my opinion - \"i buy 100k subs for $300 with this action, if it fails, no one will remember it anyway, because it's almost a year from now. And if I succeed, he will get another 100k subs, 300$ and I'll be called an oracle\"",

Since the halving hasn't occurred, I think am less bullish on bitcoin price.  I'll turn bullish on Bitcoin following months after the halving season  that is expected to occur by next year. Regarding that, I'm trying to determine how realistically Adams projection of $100k before the halving season might be made. Since it is after months of the halving season that Bitcoin tends to soar in price, reaching a new all-time high. I'm not sure how likely it will be that the current state of the crypto market will result in a new ATH being set before the halving season.

Because what if the Federal Reserve made the pivot from QT to QE? There are projections from the more bearish economists illustrating that a recession is inevitable, and the timeline could be late 2023 or early 2024. And because the Federal Reserve has the susceptibility to over-adjust, the first small signs of a recession would probably make the printer go \"BRRRR\". IF \"BRRRR\" does indeed happen during March next year, then we have already seen its effects on Bitcoin and other markets during March, 2020. They will SURGE.",
