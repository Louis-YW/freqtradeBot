  "content": "Fidelity just opened bitcoin trading accounts. What this means to the market? Fidelity is one of the biggest assets manager or a financial institutions worldwide. To know more, you can just visit their website directly. I think they just did it on time because of how FTX messed up, they're the ones that's catching all of those customers that they've left. But, I don't want to celebrate early on this one. It's another centralized platform but I don't know how it will be done by them. What can you say about this news? Are you bullish? Or are you worried as another big financial institution and centralized platform gets in? Quote from: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/fidelity-opens-retail-bitcoin-tradingCertain users have received emails detailing their new access to purchase and sell bitcoin on the Fidelity platform.I wonder aside from buying and selling, will they allow to withdraw those bitcoins and it's not just going to be an appearing number on their customers account?Source: FIDELITY BEGINS OPENING RETAIL BITCOIN TRADING ACCOUNTS",

In addition, it launched a spot bitcoin ETF in Canada in December of 2021.I guess i can say Fidelity have been a pro BTC company for a long time now, but probably because of 'anti-BTC' and crypto regulatory laws in the United States their support can't be massive as they face criticism for them:QuoteThe financial services giant’s interest in bitcoin has not come without criticism, having been the subject of U.S. senators’ scrutiny for its offering of a 401k plan that allows users to allocate to bitcoin.Quote from: tabas on November 29, 2022, 08:54:47 PMAre you bullish? Or are you worried as another big financial institution and centralized platform gets in? I am neither bullish that this will have a price effect, nor because of this centralized platform getting involved in BTC trade because i don't feel people would create new accouts on Fidelity just to trade BTC when there are crypto exchanges available to them that gives them so many options to trade; so the people who would probably use this are BTC people who already use Fidelity, and it may also encourage non bitcoiners to try it out too.",

Props to him but I can say that he had made a difference during the bull run with such news that had been released about his moves. This time, any good news won't affect that much because it's hard to beat up the bearish sentiment of the market.

At least, that's the beauty of this news that those who wants to step in to the crypto market, they'll be introduced by Fidelity.Quote from: Antonas1 on November 30, 2022, 01:09:34 PMNothing special. As long as it's a centralized platform, there is no different from other centralized exchanges (CEX). And they say there is no commission for your trades (free), but there is a spread charge. It's still a fee (for me), same with other CEX.Quote*You will not be charged a commission on bitcoin or ether (“crypto”) trades placed through Fidelity Crypto. Fidelity Digital Assets will collect a spread (assessed at no more than 1%) calculated as the difference between the price at which you buy or sell crypto in your Fidelity Crypto account and the price at which Fidelity Digital Assets fills your order. This spread will be reflected in your execution price. For an initial period, Fidelity Digital Assets may in its discretion decide not to charge a spread. Fees are subject to change.Source: Fidelity.com-footnoteMaybe it would be more interesting if they made a decentralized trading platform.Most new exchanges are having that type of promo regards to their fees but eventually, when they've been established with their users they'll suddenly change the terms a little by little. The idea of making a dex platform, I think the name of theirs will still tied on it and people would still have the impression like this; \"a dex that's made by a cex\".Quote from: Wapfika on November 30, 2022, 01:18:26 PMHow come Fidelity catches FTX customer while the customer funds is already stuck on the FTX by the time FTX halt the withdrawal and file bankruptcy to save there company. There situation is with Celsius that gives no guarantee to all there users if they will still recover there funds or not. I doubt all the victims will still invest on services like this despite they are huge company. FTX is once the second largest crypto exchange in crypto yet they still fall with just some string pulled by high profile player like CZ.It's about the idea if you get it that those people lost trust in exchanges like FTX, here comes Fidelity with a big name announces that soon they'll be able to open trading. Quote from: Wapfika on November 30, 2022, 01:18:26 PMI think they will allow it since Coinbase and FTX is doing it. Only ETF is not approved to have a physical backed. They can do actual trading of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency by getting a license that same with Coinbase scope since US is already fully equipped by law for this kind of business.Yes, it's just all about the time as they said they'll will add it soon.Quote from: bittraffic on November 30, 2022, 01:29:53 PMThey are a big institution, they will probably be working together with CFTC and SEC just like FTX.And they are going to be like FTX again.

We were advised to withdraw assets from exchanges and now we are back again to trusting a CEX. Not your keys, not your coins. I won't defend them that they won't be like FTX because of how they big but we don't know what's the future in most of these companies. This is the crypto market, we've seen the best and the worst from it, we'll never know. But the thing as an individual, we're aware on how to keep our funds safe and not to trust them wholly.",

Conventional banks are insured by the country's deposit insurance companies but these exchanges have no such backings. The terms and conditions of Fidelity is harsh and most investors or users would not be patient enough to read them. Customers would carefully read these rules only when there are issues to ascertain if there are avenues to recover their funds. It wouldn't be a bad idea for government to force these exchanges or trading platforms to deposit certain funds that would be enough to settle their customers in case of bankruptcy.",

If they can make it suitable for bitcoiners  without a high tax for bitcoiners, I guess it will attract more people to start Bitcoin trading with fidelity bank, because Bitcoin investors increasing every day which it will give bank more customers that will make their income improve.",
