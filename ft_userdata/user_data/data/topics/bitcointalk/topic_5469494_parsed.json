  "content": "I found this exciting news coming from an Indian exchange. KoinBX one of the Indian cryptocurrency exchanges is now ranked under the top 100 spot exchanges on CoinMarketCap. Other Indian exchanges have been struggling with low volume and liquidity issues after the 30% tax slab was announced. KoinBX started onboarding new users not only from India but from 50+ major countries across the globe. They are operating in Asia, Africa, and Europe. The current spot trading volume of KoinBX is BTC3,395 as per CMC.What do you guys think? Will other Indian cryptocurrency exchanges follow the path of KoinBX?",

It means that the other Indian exchanges can make them profitable if they diversify thier user base. I don't think others will follow them as they are waiting for the next bull run. They are only concentrating on Indian users. Whereas Indian users are moving to International exchanges. Congratulations to KoinBX team in achieving the 94th position.",

      "body": "In this bear market, an Indian exchange reporting high volume and getting ranked on the list of 100 is admirable. I do not know how this Chennai-based exchange got into that league I certainly believe they are getting users from other countries. They might have pairs that most exchanges in India do not have. I have never registered or tried using KoinBX, this is the first time I have heard about it. I only knew a few Indian exchanges like Zebpay and Wazirx. I was surprised to read that they started their exchange way back in 2018, the same year when Wazirx started.",

      "body": "I am waiting for the day when the Indian exchanges come under the top 50 list there.With growing crypto demand in India and increasing adoption we are supposed to rocket forward too, but the thing stopping us is the 30% tax slab and people are trying to avoid this by reducing their crypto use or bypassing it by different means/under reporting tax capital gains.Things will take time to develop in this space, in India it will take even longer. As soon as this tax wall breaks down, there will be a huge boom in trading volume.",

Seriously, if that is true then why they didn't try to bring their exchange to next level, surely they can reach bigger heights if they promote their brand to the actual user base and who knows they maybe even capable of top 20 in a year or two in my opinion.",

The website is clean and easy to use, Definitely would tried it if not registered on other global exchanges.I heard their name first time they need to do some promotions now, to bring new crypto users on their platform.",

I haven't used the exchange and don't plan to as you need to pass KYC.  Possible that they have not been marketing their product unlike CoinDCX has. I remember in the year of COVID, their names were plastered all over the Indian Business news channels and they had their own crypto related segment in the daily telecast. Point to note that I was looking forward to them continuing this program but they have slowed down as far as I remember.At least some traction in the media for crypto should be present, in my opinion.",
