Once you lose access to your bitcoins either through losing your proof of ownership which is your private keys or through sending to the wrong address which you do not control, there is no way to recover the bitcoins. Transactions are immutable and Bitcoin is extremely secure.If you lock yourself out, you can't get in.Quote from: HajiBagi on December 06, 2023, 08:19:29 AMTherefore, my question is: Why did those who lost their private key purchase bitcoin? The most important thing to keep safe when owning cryptocurrency is your private key;Loss of private keys was more common in the early days when the value of Bitcoin was significantly smaller than it is now. It was easy to be nonchalant about an investment that only had promise but little value at the time. Today when even a few thousand sats is running into thousands of dollars people are more careful with their investments but still make common mistakes one of which is having a single backup in one location. Having one backup means that any natural disasters that affects that environment results in loss of bitcoins.",

This two can be use to recover the wallet but if you include either a passphrase to that seed phrase or a password to that wallet file and you forget them then you can’t still recover that wallet. It is also true that you can’t recover a lost seed phrase or private key. All those services promising people that they can recover their lost private or seed phrase are fake. The only case is if you forget some words of the seed phrases and still have some then btcrecover can do that",

Probably the very first step when getting acquainted with Bitcoin, people need such stories so that they understand the essence of their ownership of their own bank. We are used to seeing people fascinated by the stories of the growth of Bitcoin and people's financial success, but instead, it would be wiser to show the other side so that people are freed from illusions and can soberly assess their ability to keep initial phrases and, in general, their ability to be careful.",

Bitcoin become more scarce, so it can have a positive impact on the price if the demand remains the same, but the supply goes down this way.Some might argue that lower circulating supply is bad for Bitcoin as well because the supply is already quite low, and a decrease makes it even less practical for global adoption. But I don't think it's a valid concern because Bitcoin is highly divisible into sats and because adoption is very far from a rate where it could become a problem.",

Bitcoin is in my opinion 99% of practical and 1% theory, every bitcoin informations we learn from the forum or any other platform are practical experiences of bitcoin users so if anyone is taking them for granted it's to ones disadvantage. Let drop one or two instances to consider:1. Wallet hack and phishing prevention: when we learn about preventive measures to consider in protecting our bitcoin wallet from been hacked and against potential bug vulnerability we put what we learn to application because having your wallet hacked with your funds stolen isn't a theory. Maybe such people should wait till it happens to them.2.
