Probably true what you're implying but there's no way anyone can digest all of these within a short time even if he's giving the time to read and we can't definitely agree that OP may not be reading what he's posting out here too. It could be OP is just someone that in mind wants to showcase to others that share in same rank as him certain informations and materials he has come across in the forum so we can't really say he's not reading it too to add to he's own knowledge. While on the other hand I may agree with you  that there are some who just act in this way just to phish attention and merit.",

Perhaps, you may want to use google search or forum search to help you so quickly and besides, all subtopics have their rules and regulations pinned at the top of the board or section, to me this is likely to be spamming, reason being that only those who doesn't read that could likely find it difficult to get all helpful materials.",
