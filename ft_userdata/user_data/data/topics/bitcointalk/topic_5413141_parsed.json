No. Anybody who buys stock does it with the idea of making money. Get in while the getting is good, and get out if things look like they are going bad.Musk is a big player. And it is good to check him out. But there is a difference between simply taking profit and intentionally pumping and dumping. It's up to the courts to decide.",

It's up to the courts to decide.But how will any court prove that what Elon Musk did was a scheme of Pump and Dump? This situation assumes that there are victims who will file a claim to compensate for the damage. The court will not raise a case on its own.Elon Musk is a good player in this market and is not naive enough to leave his opponents with loopholes through which they can topple him or any of his plans.In any case, many public figures are carrying out the same scheme, and we have not heard that any of them will be legally pursued.",

Similarly, Musk also did the same, it's just that he is popular and I am not the coin start to pump as well, now nowhere in the tweets till now Musk has shown the one should Dump Doge, and Neither has he told that he has sold all his Doge. So this doesn't even constitute a complete pump and dump because only one element which is the pump is present here and not the dump.",

I believe the problem is that some investors don't follow the right channel of crypto investment and determine their investment decision on influence tweets which is totally bad. I don't see any reason why Elon Musk must be arrested for announcing buying a certain which is not lying about it.",

Its so funny how the left gets so uptight about every aspect of life and the problem with the right is they just take whatever the left dishes out to them which is why I'm an independent, anarchist capitalist.

Yes, we might not blame Musk for his actions because people need to research and gather information about businesses before investing. This is because relying on people's promotions or endorsement of a product might be disastrous. But I think celebrities should be held responsible for their actions because many people are always willing to follow them. Recently there has been an increase in successful Ponzi schemes in my country because these Ponzi operators always partner with well-known celebrities to defraud the people. If the legislatures make laws that would make these celebrities responsible or accountable for what they promote, the latter would mind what they advertise.",
