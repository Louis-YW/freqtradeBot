  "content": "I recently experienced a power failure while performing the Initial Block Download onto a Samsung T7 solid state drive, which was partitioned for ext4 and mounted with the default data=ordered journaling option. My node was running with the following parameters: -txindex=1 -blockfilterindex=1 peerblockfilters=1.The node started back up without any issues. However, I am concerned about the possibility of data corruption (blocks, indexes, etc.) due to the power failure. To be on the safe side, I've decided to restart the node with -checkblocks=0 -checklevel=3 options to verify the integrity of the stored data.Is this enough to ensure that no data has been corrupted due to the power failure? Or should I consider taking additional steps to verify the integrity of my node data?Thank you in advance for your help!",

Or should I consider taking additional steps to verify the integrity of my node data?-checklevel can be set up to level 4, see if you need the highest level of verification: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9d85c03620bf660cfa7d13080f5c0b191579cbc3/src/validation.cpp#L92-L99In case there's a corrupted data due to power-failure, it's usually those latest block, block index, chainstate that are being written before the power failure.So ideally, Bitcoin Core should be able to detect those with the default parameters.",
