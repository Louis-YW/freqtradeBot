I don't think it is a problem if you list which companies you work for, what business you did in the past, and so on. Simply saying you have 10 years of experience tells nothing. In fact, scammers use that quite often to trick users. If you're serious about it, maybe you can be a little bit more open about your work history.",

Working in the traditional financial market doesn't automatically mean you know all the nuances of the crypto industry. They aren't the same. You only need to hear from the giants in the traditional finance market and realize that many of them are clueless about Bitcoin. Jamie Dimon has been much respected in the financial market decades before 2011 and he surely cannot \"advise on almost any issue\" relating to Bitcoin. Anyway, the platform was only launched in 2019 as a project of Buycoin sp. z o. o.? So, Buycoin sp. z o. o. is the company that's been running for 11 years? However, there's information online that this company's incorporation date was April 12, 2023.[1] What have I missed?[1] https://www.emis.com/php/company-profile/PL/Buycoin_Sp_z_oo_en_14347842.html",

You clearly mentioned More than 10 Years on the market, not years of experience, or the meaning of what they say is that the platform has been in existence for 10 years.",

But that claim of yours, I guess that experience really is helping but you'll still have a different approach from it. And don't forget to say about KYC. This is where most of the users are going to take complains against you. You have not mentioned it on your features but on your website, it is clearly saying that you need one for it in case that you find some triggers on a user exchanging you. Unlike the other good instant swaps, most of the centralized swaps are a pain when you all of a sudden asks for it.",

They provide nothing to verify from the reserves to their work history. I do think it would be better if you register a new partner that is a bit more open to its customers since they work in a centralized exchange industry. As far as I can see, OP's service is quite questionable for now. It would be nice if you added more details to alert users about the risks.",
