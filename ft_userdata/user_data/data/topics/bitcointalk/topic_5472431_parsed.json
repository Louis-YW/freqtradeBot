The 2 websites you mentioned are also very good to follow and I think you just need to follow both of them, no need to follow too much because it won't bring you too many benefits. I can add you a hint that I am using social network X , I think the news is also fully updated there and there will also be discussions to verify whether the news is fake or not not on X.",

If I am not mistaking, some Bitcoin founders are even here, so getting Bitcoin knowledge here is one of the safest ways to learn Bitcoin, and lastly, Bitcointalk.org gives those that don't have the capital to start their Bitcoin journey the opportunity to get some Bitcoin for free and this is what makes Bitcointalk.org more useful than other source of learning about Bitcoin.",

It's good to double check facts if something seems fishy or you're gonna make a big decision based on it.  There's lots of angles and agendas with crypto news so it pays to verify before jumping to conclusions.",

Cryptopanic.com is the best source of news because it’s a news aggregator meaning it has a lot of source for their news and combine it to their website. It’s the most reliable news outlet since it gives update in real time event from different news channel platform.",

You can verify by checking other websites concerning the information you are interested in. It is not enough to read news from these online news channels you have to also know the sources of the information. Some of these news outlets can be an instrument to spread FUD. The ideal source of information for government policy is the website of such state agencies. If you want to get information about Bitcoin ETF the most reliable source will be the SEC media platforms. We all knew how fake news about the ETF was circulated by a well-known media house. Nevertheless, my main source of information is bitcointalk.org because you can verify the reliability of any news in this forum. Members are good at analyzing the validity of the news to ascertain if it is true or fake. For YouTube videos, I recommend Andreas M. Antonopoulos.",
