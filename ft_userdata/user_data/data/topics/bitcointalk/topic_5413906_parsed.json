These topics we can discuss: > Quotations and fares > Odds and speculation. > Rating the cyclists> How to bet on Professional Cycling> Assessing upcoming talent. > Parcour knowledge. > A historical perspective to inspire new people who would like to join. > Talking Nostalgia> Overall overview of the achievement and presentations of the cyclist. > Predictions. I would love to get in contact with you who share my interest by heart",

Maybe it's because most of the casinos or sportsbooks doesn't have cycling in on of the sports you can bet that's why no one created a thread for cycling discussions just like other sports or maybe it's popularity is not the same as other sports like volleyball, basketball. I think it's also the same for golf where there is no thread for discussions too. If there's a demand for this sports in this forum then the thread for it would have created already.",

We have not yet encountered the same on this, if you are really interested you can discuss it here or in a gambling discussion.Bike cycling is a good sport too and I wonder why most gambling casinos were not accepted this in their casino. This possibly more fun and it could bring a massive amount of bettors.",

Biking becomes one of the top activities in my country started during the pandemic, and having a competition and placing a bet for this looks interesting. Not familiar about the top bikers or top competition for this, but if its already available in some site maybe we can also check that.",

I look forward to seeing how you grow your presence here on the forum and build a big community for your projects and hope to see you introduce some bonuses in your system that can attract players to your particular kind of game as I am most familiar with only car races.",

I also have not stumbled or there is a casino I know that included road bike cycling in sports betting I also love to go road bike, especially on weekends and we used to have a national cycling event in our city, but its a good idea if there is a country where there is a weekly cycling event or tournaments where casinos can pick up and make betting on it, cycling is very popular on many countries like horse racing and I believe it should be added also on sports events.",

Honestly, it is fun to watch and really entertaining as the race progresses, but having an in-depth knowledge on bikes and its technicalities will give someone an edge on betting on these events. It would be best if a lot of bookies start to offer professional cycling lines. The event is anyone's game really, which makes it all the more fun since there really isn't a single consistent winner on these events. Hopefully Stake and Sportsbet cover these kinds of events in the future. I know Sportsbet.io does but only on the huge events.",

This can be a good event if well organized, I mean if there's a hosting site to handle the bet then it's pretty good. In pandemic, cycling becomes more popular in my place we already have events like this and there's already a bike lane in public road which is not available on pre pandemic scenario. Good luck on your research about this OP, maybe it's feasible or not at all let's find out.",
