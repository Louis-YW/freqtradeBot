I like the advises you mentioned strictly straight to the point but you forgot that seeking education on trading can be done freely. So a signal like this is likely not gonna work in here.Many newbies joined signal trading group with subscription loses their money and to be honest. If I were them, I learn it myself to avoid that $150 payment and use that as a capital when you already grasp how trading works.",

That has made me think if this post is supposed to belong here in B/H or rather in Trading board or Services board. Lols... He offered some nice advice for newbies which qualified the post to be in BH.The post is about trading which qualified it to be in tradingAnd he also advertised his seevice which makes it belong to services board.In all, I don't think paying $150 monthly for a speculative signal is worth it.",

Don't Buy at the Peak, Buy during a crash like now, so you can Sell at the Peak like $70,000.Do you mean buying at the peak is buying in a green market? I think a trader can be more flexible than an investor. Daily trade or scalping, can buy at each market trend (red & green). If your target is just a small profit and for a short-term trading goal, there is nothing wrong to buy at a green market. Except if you buy for holding a long term, better to buy in a bearish (crash/drop). But it isn't for trading purposes, it is for investment.Quote from: Kalson9 on July 27, 2022, 03:18:04 PM3. Don't borrow money to invest in crypto, ~Sure, borrowing money for a crypto investment is a bad idea, especially if you are a newbie.Investing in crypto coins is high-risk, it will be riskier when we invest with loan money.Quote from: Kalson9 on July 27, 2022, 03:18:04 PM7. Remember to use StopLoss especially when in profits and trade wisely.Using Stoploss isn't a must. If you trade daily and find you have got enough profits, kindly sell your coins.

In a certain community, you also must choose and sort the information that really suits you.
