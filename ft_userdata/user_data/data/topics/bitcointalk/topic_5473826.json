You can simply purchase few Satoshi and still benefit on its price growth in proportion to your holdings instead of buying shitcoins with low price but has a massive supply.Bitcoin supply is limited while most of the shitcoins is still has a lot to be added on the circulating supply. You can suffer huge loss on shitcoins because they are more volatile due than Bitcoin so you should stick to Bitcoin since you are still a newbie. A 10% gain on Bitcoin is still the same 10% gain on altcoins with much cheaper price.",

It's true, currently the price of Bitcoin is still within the range of 36k-37k which might seem high for the now. If you are considering buying it will be advisable to do so now because we are currently experiencing a bull market now and it's price might be higher than what it is today. It's usually adviced to purchase Bitcoin during the dip and hodl till the ath but the price you see today might be the dip  tomorrow, so If you have the money to buy, do so without wasting time.Quote from: Kensure on November 12, 2023, 05:28:42 PM  I don't know why I feel like it's the only cryptocurrency worth investing and I would love to try  but am still learning gradually about it.There are other cryptocurrencies you might consider, but it's generally not recommended because most altcoins are more volatile and less valuable than Bitcoin. So, investing in Bitcoin might be your best option. Right now, it's crucial to learn how to keep your coins safe and secure.",

I will advice you to start building your Bitcoin portfolio no matter how small you start but be consistent in it. Like people already commented, you must not start with 1 BTC, just little fractions and done consistently will do the magic. If you are intentional about it, set aside small percentage of every funds you earn to be injected into Bitcoin in such a way that you will not be pressured to sell it. Do thus for few years from now and see where you will be in the future in regards to your Butcoin portfolio.",

What I really mean is for you to get your portfolios started as you are getting to know about Bitcoin. You can't just sit down and keep learning about Bitcoin. You also have to keep some coins in your crypto wallet because the coins in your wallet will help you learn more about Bitcoin. However, if you are trying to tell us that Bitcoin's price is high and that is why you are procrastinating to buy Bitcoin, that means you also have to get ready for the price if Bitcoin hits $60k and above within a short term.So you better start buying and don't just keep your eyes on the price, although I don't really believe in altcoins, because those coins are not meant to be trusted.",

If you talk of great ROI, Bitcoin won't give as much as some of the altcoins will give within a space of two years but it's the only coin one can buy and go to sleep with both eyes firmly closed. There's a reason Bitcoin is often recommended to newbie investors and that's to keep them away from heartbreak that will arise from loss. Talking about XRP, just be careful. It's the only top altcoin from way back in 2017 till date I've refused to buy and hodl. There's something about it I don't like.",

Bitcoin is still on it growing level to the ATH so if you have the money, you should buy now because the price will definitely pass $40+k and bitcoin is still $37k and the last ATH was $69k and this coming ATH will more than that 2021 ATH so if you buy now the finally the price hit the ATH of $80+k, you will be smiling.

I do not get why some folks think Bitcoin is too pricey to buy into right now.  But let us think this through - what happens if the price goes back to 69k? Or 100k? Or more? Seems like waiting for the right price could backfire big time.  The cool thing with bitcoin (and crypto in general) is that you can invest however much or little as you want.  Whether we are talking about a single dollar or a million bucks.  Either way, you will get some amount of Bitcoin for your buy. Say you have got 370 bucks ready to deploy right this second.  The question becomes: is it better to get 0.01 BTC or 660 XRP? Id go with the 0.01 Bitcoin, personally.Quote from: Kensure on November 12, 2023, 05:28:42 PMI don't know why I feel like it's the only cryptocurrency worth investing and I would love to try  but am still learning gradually about it.Look, taking it slow and learning the basics first is smart.  Crypto world is nuts these days and  rushing in might not end well.  Better to go step-by-step so when its time to jump in you will be ready to rock.  More fulfilling that way.",

That's exactly the reason why the concept of sats exist. So you don't have to buy 1 Bitcoin to join the bandwagon. Even smaller denominations count. Another point I wanted to point out is that you should take out time to gather enough research to back up whatever decisions you make it the end and don't just take anybody words for it because aside XRP, there are still some good altcoins but then, you need to manage your risks properly.",
