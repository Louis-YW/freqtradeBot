Most people are buying Bitcoin and believe in it because they have done their own research and found out that Bitcoin has an actual utility (as a currency and an asset), they have also found out that the Bitcoin network is far more secure than any other crypto out there, it is also a currency that is free from government and central control, meaning that Bitcoin owners can use their coins as they like.Quote from: Stepstowealth on January 30, 2023, 02:49:26 PMThis hope carried in this forum is infectious and for any one who had doubts about the future of bitcoins but manages to come across this forum will be very encouraged.

Most of the forum member believes on the technology behind Bitcoin and how it can solve the world economy problem if everyone just believe on it. Nowadays, there’s already a lot of big players that invested on Bitcoin so newbie holder will have more confidence and easy to believe compared before.I believe once you fully understand the technology of Blockchain and it’s many possible use case in the future. You will understand why forum members is die hard believer of Bitcoin",

Same is applicable to bitcoin OGs they didn't give up on bitcoin even when the market fluctuated, or the price dropped. That's why most of them are successful men today, happily going to their daily businesses. The forum is a good example and like you said it's contagious, I think only for people who wish to follow the same route as the OGs. Nevertheless, the early birds ain't out of the game, they're still with bitcoin despite the previous ATH and the bear market that just happened. So, members of the forum still buy bitcoin because older users of this forums weren't discouraged to buy bitcoin when it was a year old. They're many bitcoin elites who emerged from this forum and members of this forum today believe that we are still early. And it's the right moment to garner more bitcoin.",

Rather, saying \"clairvoyant\" should be more appropriate for those who believe in Bitcoin. Those of us (yours sincerely is among) who see what they saw when Bitcoin was just newly birthed should have them to thank for such perception. Those who are queuing now to join in the bright number of Bitcoin lovers and fans also should applaud those of us who didn't back down when we heard the gospel of Bitcoin. In all, we continue to express our optimism with certainty that Bitcoin will even gain more value in future.

In this forum we are not guided by feelings. It is not a question of being happy or afraid because the price goes down. We know what bitcoin is, and that's why we try to acquire and hold it. It is not a matter of faith or hope, it is a matter of looking at the world, the financial system, and looking at bitcoin, making a reasoned decision based on that. But we are human and there is more joy in price commentary when we are in the bull market than there is now.",

That number is much higher than 10 times, and according to the latest statistics, it is as many as 469 times that someone announced that Bitcoin died - and anyone who announced such news must feel like a real idiot, especially when they write something like that in the year 2022 or even in 2023.

Even today, you cannot say that half the world believes in Bitcoin (in any sense), because we have less than 5% of people in the world who have something to do with Bitcoin, while the rest of the people in the world have a negative or skeptical opinion, with the fact that 40% people in the world do not have access to the internet.Quote from: Stepstowealth on January 30, 2023, 02:49:26 PMHow come people on this forum are still encouraged to buy when things do not even look good.
