  "content": "I saw this on X, and I decided to bring it down here for discussion, because when there is high fee in bitcoin transaction due to spamming on the blockchain, a lot of silly things are done just to get their transaction confirmed. I know that due to the halving a lot of people are paying high fee so that their transaction will be included in the halving block for some reasons best known to them. Some believes that the next block after the halving will be expensive, which I can understand that. But what I don't understand is someone sending a dust transaction and used 507,109usd to pay for transaction fee so that his $0.70 amount will be included in the bitcoin halving block. Why will one do such, is it madness or he wants to make history or pride. I ask this because this is the time that people are holding tight to their bitcoin, and some careless about the amount of coins that they have.Can someone tell me why he/she will want to do this.",

It will be refunded after the mining pool get agreement from their miners.With this intentional expensive-fee-paid transaction, there will be no refund in my guess.",

The truth is Bitcoin is usually affected in terms of fees anytime there is an event. You will notice that even when there is a nice increase in Bitcoin price in just a short space of time, fees tend to rise all of a sudden. This is usually  because a majority of people begin to move their coins to exchanges so they can make profits off it. As for that which occurred in this year's halving, it was just too enormous and uneconomical. Since I joined the crypto space I have never experienced Bitcoin fees up to 100 sats / byte however unfortunately fees were over 2000 sats /bytes during the halving block.  For some time now I have been trying to rap my head around the reason why a lot of persons were ready to pay such enormous fees so their transactions would be included in block #840,000.",

Or is it true that stompix is just bragging because it was minted in block 840,000. It is not stompix who made that transaction, he just explained the nature of dust transactions on ordinals.  These are tiny amounts of bitcoin sent with an inscription on the Ordinals protocol.  The fees can be high because they are competing for block space just like any other inscription.As for Ordinals, you can think of them as rare collectibles of the digital era. Some people invest in them for two reasons: either they believe they will achieve much higher prices in the future, or, in some cases, simply because they can afford it (a.k.a. bragging rights).",

But yeah we can also say the spike in tx fee is affected by FOMO as well. But the main reason is this that stompix has stated. Well, I have a question as well, that its also possible that the dude is some kind of miner and might have a lot of source like farm of mining that he could somehow got that fee he paid back.But still, he could make more money by utilizing this NFT but I wonder how? I am not into oridnals or BRC-20 tokens but still they are good source of income, and if this NFT gets a M.Cap of 1 million only, the person who pad the funds will be able to recover what he has spent. I know its not so logical but yeah if he wants to rug pull then he can recover what he spent.",

Some goes to 840,001 and 840,002 so definitely it didn't make sense that they attempted, pay high fees and then failed, dumb money?Unfortunately, it trickled down and the effect is that after 48 hours, fees are still insanely high.",

For sure it is really something that in exchange between values which it wouldreally be bringing out that kind of question in mind that how the heck they do make out such transfer without even trying out to read on where that amount to be transferred should really be putted on?This is why knowledge isnt something that could really be able to buy no matter how rich you are.",

They seem to be doing some NFT stuff on bitcoin network. We've seen what the height of NFT hype were and where it is heading but still being associated with a rare occurrence of halving on bitcoin network might age better. For that person it might be a risk worth taking. There are not many halving anyway.The person that paid a huge fee to mint the rare NFT might feel good at the moment and might even get a buyer to get a profit on his work (if it's tradeable) but in the long run, it is going to be hard to predict if the NFT holds any significance.It sure is rare but by a third party. If I understand what it is, there would be 100 of different projects issuing similar NFTs for next halving decreasing it's legitimacy and value.",
