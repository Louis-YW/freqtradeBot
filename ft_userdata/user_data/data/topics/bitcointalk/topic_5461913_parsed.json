  "content": "Hi All, I thought I would share this artist infoBitcoin Apex Art - Daniel KrÃ¤nkel - https://www.bitcoinapexart.com/I won one of his prints in the Auction for Coldkey Victims run by smoothie and over the weekI have been sorting, cataloging and filing my modest collection of Bitcoin collectibles.After doing a search for this print which I knew was Bitcoin Apex a new world has opened upto me about this skilled artist woking in pencil. Some works are like something I would expectto see in some 16th century cathedrals. There are a lot of details and the look almost likemarble and stone sculptures, I am very impressed with the skill involved and with the themes.I cannot opy any of the images from th website but below is a screenshot of the first page of the gallery.",
