  "content": "As we know, a panel of the UK House of Common Treasury Committee on May 17 proposed retail cryptocurrency trading and investment to be regulated as gambling as they viewed it as ‚Äúsame risk, same regulatory outcome.‚Äù I later threw this on board, and I was encouraged as people overwhelmingly disagree on this.Since it's a mere proposal, yesterday, the Treasury's Economic Secretary Andrew Griffith blatantly rejected it as he ‚Äúfirmly disagrees‚Äù with the stance of the committee.Some of the considerations of the government are:1. The controversial proposal could cause conflicts of mandates between the Gambling Commission and Financial regulators.2. It's odd and a deviation from global recommendations and stance on cryptocurrency trading.The government however iterated its commitment to crypto regulation, and with the look of things, it would be regulated like other trading assets in the financial market, but with little alteration.Personally, I don't know why this should be an issue from the beginning as cryptocurrency is an asset which should be treated as such in both payments, trading and investment regulations.https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-rejects-call-regulate-crypto-gambling-2023-07-20/https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-uk-rejects-regulating-crypto-gambling",

      "body": "Well, it is no news about the regulation. The U.k SEC initially got assent from The King of England, to allow cryptocurrencies be used for payments and as it has always been used, but it has to be regulated. I see it as a better option, compared to Kuwait's government which just banned the use of anything cryptocurrency. I don't need to hammer on the penalty anyone found would have to face. Their reason is simply that it is being used for money laundering. The country is doing well economically compared to other Arab countries in the region.Although the idea of cryptocurrency is to operate on a decentralized network, the major challenge it faces now, is that of regulation. Most countries are indifferent about it and have adopted it like El Salvador, some simply want to restrict it, to tax it, to gain from it, others just want to stop it because criminal minds use it to launder money. Whatever be the reasons, am sure we will get to know how well the regulation has been effective.",

If they really want to take a look at how they should approach people who trade, they should take a look at people who trade stocks and meddle with forex and all that, it would show them the type of thing we are doing here, the thing we are trading changes of course, its not stocks but bitcoin, but its the same logic. So if they want to put a rule or regulation or law, they could use that as guideline to make one. It would be pretty similar, and people would pay taxes just like they do when they make a profit from a stock trade as well.",

So how come these unanimous policies at this time and era? When I feel crypto shoulda gotten a global recommendation at the time?? Huh??Look, this is so fuckin' political as I keep saying - they just wanna have few more sanctions on crypto to see that as a liverage to gain dominance..

Since the UK classified it as the same as gambling, I do think that strict adherence to its mandate is necessary and there also may be penalties/punishments present in this situation.What I also fear is that if the regulation is too strict, it may become too restrictive to the point that it absolutely defeats the purpose of using cryptocurrencies at all. Well, however, it is still a bill and we all know that once it reaches the Congress, such bill would be massacred and changes would be made. Just hoping for the best for UK!",

The reason why I am saying this is because, for example, three people can be crypto investors, but there is likely a possibility that only one among them can become successful in crypto investment, and the reason could be that they all pictured crypto differently; the one among them who sees it as gambling would likely not have much interest in learning how to manage risk and what coins not to invest in to avoid loss. Perhaps why would anyone treat crypto as gambling? It will only be a thing of gambling to those who see it that way; rather than getting to know the ways to archive success with it, they only feel it's luck that can guide them. Crypto can be used for payment across borders, but where on earth is gambling used as a means of transaction?",

They can pass it but in UK, citizens have their rights and voice, they will fight for it.I disagree with you that cryptocurrency is an asset as it has more use cases than that. It can be a commodity, can be used for trading, investment or gambling or more. The UK government try to bind cryptocurrency with gambling which is only one of many use cases for it, so they only try to do what they want.It is not true if we say cryptocurrency can not be used for gambling and I can understand the strict bill from the UK. They will prohibit casino advertisements in Premier League next two years. The new season is a last one we will see casino advertisement, logo at banners, skirts etc.Premier League clubs set ban on gambling companies advertising shirts",

As we have also witnessed the collapse of exchanges, altcoin projects have been going on for many years, so it is inevitable for those who have not entered the market to be skeptical and misunderstood. It can be said that this big misunderstanding is caused by altcoins, and we cannot deny that investing in altcoins is no different from gambling.",

I guess we can give that leeway if we're talking with the average joe. But I don't think a government body can be that careless and just assume everything is the same thing. Even if they focus on altcoin instead of the Bitcoin market, I don't think it is that hard to see some differences between gambling and their high-risk trading process.That being said, I think UK in general is more 'friendly' toward crypto from the news I've seen shared on this board for the last months or so. I believe they see potential in regulating the market/crypto for their own benefit instead of outright banning them or deterring people from trading crypto. CMIIW.",

Their citizens have rights to ask for what they can do and their will make many meetings on road to create pressure on their government. I believe the UK. government only want to charge more tax from their citizens and they want to stop grey areas where their citizens can avoid taxation policy.",
