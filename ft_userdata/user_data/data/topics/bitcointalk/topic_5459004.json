  "content": "Attention, BitcoinTalk community:I am writing to bring your attention to the alarming fraudulent activities carried out by the fake crypto exchange website known as \"mycoinchange.io\". It is crucial to delve into the specifics of this SCAM accusation, as they expose the deceptive practices and lack of credibility exhibited by the website.To begin with, mycoinchange.io operates without providing any company information, rendering it impossible to verify the legitimacy of their operations. The absence of transparent contact details raises serious concerns regarding the platform's authenticity.Furthermore, the website lacks any visible feedback or user reviews, an unusual circumstance for reputable crypto exchanges. It is evident that mycoinchange.io attempts to mask its lack of credibility by concealing the absence of user testimonials or complaints.What's more, \"mycoinchange.io\" illicitly employs the Trustpilot logo on its website, falsely presenting itself as a trusted and reputable platform. This manipulative act blatantly violates ethical practices and further erodes their credibility.Most critically, mycoinchange.io's exchange tool neglects to verify the authenticity of cryptocurrency addresses provided by users (ðŸš¨). Regardless of the information entered, the website redirects users to the next step without confirming the submission of a genuine cryptocurrency address. This disregard for security protocols raises serious doubts about the legitimacy and integrity of their operations.It is imperative to protect innocent users from falling victim to these deceptive practices and potential financial losses.I discovered this fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange through a Medium post (https://medium.com/@michaelkortiz17/review-best-top-5-cryptocurrency-tumbler-reliable-bitcoin-mixer-2023-30076dfba74) created by a fake account (banned), which deceitfully mixed legitimate crypto services in the article to socially engineer and manipulate potential victims. The actions of the fraudsters maintaining MyCoinChange.io are highly malicious.As of 12/21/2023, the domain \"MyCoinChange.io\" has been successfully suspended due to its phishing and scam activities. However, the fraudster has acquired a new domain named \"mycoinchange.net\" to continue their abusive practices. In the article \"https://medium.com/@michaelkortiz17/how-to-convert-bitcoin-btc-to-monero-xmr-safely-in-2023-2530a2c6ec91\" (banned), the clickable URL has been changed to \"mycoinchange.net\" following the suspension of \"mycoinchange.io\" for fraud and abuse.As of 12/21/2023, the new phishing domain \"mycoinchange.net\" has been successfully banned by the PDR domain registry.Update as of 12/21/2023:In addition to the previously mentioned domains, it is crucial to highlight that the operator of MyCoinChange has recently acquired two new domains for their fraudulent activities: \"mycoinchange.co\" and \"mycoinchange.ai\". This indicates their persistence in executing the crypto fraud scheme.The actual phishing websites used by the fraudster in this case are:- mycoinchange.io (banned)- mycoinchange.net (banned)- mycoinchange.ai (active)- mycoinchange.co (active)What makes the situation even more concerning is that the operator intentionally selected domain registrars known for engaging in shady practices. By doing so, they have made it more challenging for authorities and legitimate organizations to take down these domains and impede their illicit operations.It is of utmost importance to remain vigilant and raise awareness about these new domains. It is vital that potential victims are informed and avoid falling into the trap set by the fraudulent operator of MyCoinChange. By working together and reporting any suspicious activities, we can enhance the chances of shutting down these deceptive practices and safeguard innocent individuals from financial harm.",

It's correct however it's the v2 onion link and CM moved to v3 which is the chipmixorfly, see ANN: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1935098.0. Regardless, I wouldn't dare click any links on the article as it's been established the publisher/author has malicious intent. I suspect the information where the article is based from or copied from is of long ago seeing how a lot of data is outdated.

I'm the owner of this platform and I can assure you that there is an explanation for everything. I have invested a lot on this platform and may have stretched the truth slightly but have no intention of scamming anyone as I provide a reputable service. For starters I'll leave my email below for anyone to get in touch with me personally:admin@mycoinchange.ioif there is any issues with an exchange, I will deal with it personally and see to it that you receive your funds and as quoted. The pictures of the support staff and some reviews will be replaced with real personal once I've acquired them, the ones on the website currently are there temporarily. From what I can see on the website there are no stuck exchanges, so anyone who has done a transaction has received their funds. As per the name of the website, I thought it was a catchy name and have no affiliation with any previous similar sounding domains.I have a marketing team that posts content on many websites, if the information is outdated or incorrect, I'll see to it that the job is done properly. There is no wallet feature currently but will be introduced in the near future along with purchasing with a credit card as well. In order to do this I will have to register the business. At this moment, I'm driving traffic to the website and establishing the business. I understand that passions are high but I'm simply looking to provide a service. Regards,AdminQuoted in full for future reference.You're disappointed because someone unearthed the fact that your platform use fake reviews and fake customer support profile pictures, and your defense to justify it was that you've invested so much on this platform and you may have \"stretched the truth\" slightly? Slightly?Am I correct to understand you perceive fake reviews which said --and will lead gullible people to believe-- your project has been around at least for four times longer than it actually is, and customer supports that's not even existed yet because, \"The pictures of the support staff and some reviews will be replaced with real personal once I've acquired them\" as something that's should be accepted?Further, how exactly can you hire --and thus, prioritize-- marketing team --implying, though not necessarily means, more than one person-- instead of customer support? Which kind of strategic planning is this? Why can't you hire a single person as your customer service, especially as you said you've invested so much on it? Or, since the customer support team is currently nonexistent and you seemingly handled them yourself, why don't you just use your picture instead of using fake profiles?Last, I also understand correctly that these numbers are also \"slightly stretched\"?",

At this moment, I'm driving traffic to the website and establishing the business. I understand that passions are high but I'm simply looking to provide a service. Regards,AdminThe post quoted above contradicts itself in several parts, which I have listed here below.1. The statement \"I may have stretched the truth slightly\" contradicts the earlier claim that there is an explanation for everything and that there is no intention to scam anyone. Stretching the truth implies dishonesty and undermines the claim of providing a authentic service and at the same time it shows the fraudulent intentions.2. The statement \"I will deal with it personally and see to it that you receive your funds and as quoted\" contradicts the earlier claim that there are no stuck exchanges and everyone who has done a transaction has received their funds. This suggests that there might be issues and problems with his fraudulent \"exchange\".3. The statement \"The pictures of the support staff and some reviews will be replaced with real personal once I've acquired them\" contradicts the claim of providing a reputable service. Using fake or temporary pictures and reviews is manipulation and fraud on the psyche of the potential customer/victim.4. The statement \"I have a marketing team that posts content on many websites\" contradicts the earlier claim of providing accurate and up-to-date information by the presumably invented \"marketing team\". If the information posted by the conscious marketing team is outdated, incorrect and including phishing websites, then it also shows that this is unprofessional and published with false criminal intentions to trick people and scam their crypto.Overall, the post by the new account \"support212\" contradicts itself by making claims that undermine trust and raise doubts about the fact that this is a clear scam.",

There isnt a single customer who has come forward and said that their transaction has not gone through and I've scammed them, it's because they dont exist. The service works, I dont control any transactions, there is an API that processes the transactions. I wish no ill will on anyone, we are jumping to conclusions.Remember it's innocent until proven guilty. Not the other way around.It is your prerogative to use or not use the exchange. I'll be watching the forum for any customer support. I wish you all the best.CheersYou are right there isn't a customer that is going to say that your website works like a charm without any issue because those customers don't exist in real life and all of them are just fake promises. I have never used your site and I will never use a site that seems fishy from its name. However, I'm quite sure that you have made fake reviews, and fake customer support team, and that proves that something is fishy in your website, and anyone who ever do any transactions on the site will most probably end up losing the money. If you still think that your words are enough to explain your honesty, then kindly prove that why you have used fake customer support team and fake reviews for your site? If you can explain in a brief and convincible reply then your reputation might get a little better.",

      "body": "Quote from: CryptoGrizzly on July 15, 2023, 01:19:52 AMGreat job getting the site closed down!It has come to our attention that the fraudulent operator behind the previously blocked domains of MyCoinChange has resurfaced and is now operating under the new phishing websites \"mycoinchange.co\" and \"mycoinchange.ai\". To lure unsuspecting victims, he is actively promoting his new website through several platforms, including SiteJabber (https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/mycoinchange.co), where he even managed to obtain a blue verification tick by falsely verifying a SMS. Additionally, he has created fake Medium blogs (https://medium.com/coinmonks/introducing-mycoinchange-the-most-secure-cryptocurrency-trading-platform-for-2023-ca54fb05d8fd) to further legitimize his scam, and he can be found on Trustpilot (https://trustpilot.com/review/mycoinchange.co), Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/user/Mycoinchange_co/), Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@mycoinchange_co/channels), and Pinterest (https://www.pinterest.jp/mycoinchange_co/), and Bittrust (https://bittrust.org/mycoinchange). Furthermore, he maintains a Telegram channel (https://t.me/s/MCCcrew) where he continues to deceive users.It is crucial to note that the operator of MyCoinChange has resorted to purchasing fake reviews for his Trustpilot and Sitejabber websites in an attempt to deceive potential users. These reviews exhibit clear patterns of malicious activity, as they predominantly come from newly created accounts with just one review. Additionally, the names associated with these reviews do not align with the countries mentioned in the reviews, raising further suspicion about their authenticity. Such manipulative tactics are often used by scammers to create a false sense of credibility and trustworthiness, ultimately tricking unsuspecting individuals into engaging with their fraudulent platform.Please exercise vigilance, report any suspicious activities, and avoid providing any personal information or funds to MyCoinChange or any associated websites. It is important to spread awareness among the community to protect individuals from falling victim to this scam.Stay safe and informed, and let us work together to expose and shut down these malicious operations.",
