Any recommendations are welcome.This decision that Binance made would have been as a result of government regulations challenges in UK that they never come into agreement because not should this be in countries like UK, even some government also are stopping thejr bamks from performing anything te related to bitcoin or crypto transaction, this same could have happened in India but because they resolved the discrepancy as fast as possible before it escalated and resulted in the payment of tax for every transaction made, choose any exchange at your own risk because they will still have more reasons to why the exchange put a hold and am sure other exchanges may be worst than Binance.",

Yup, I don't mind KYC, I just remembered that I actually had an account there, but haven't used it in years. Might give it a try if fees are not as high as on Coinbase. Kraken did manage to build some good reputation and trust over the years, so could be a good choice.Quote from: 348Judah on May 30, 2023, 12:19:27 PMThis decision that Binance made would have been as a result of government regulations challenges in UK that they never come into agreement because not should this be in countries like UK, even some government also are stopping thejr bamks from performing anything te related to bitcoin or crypto transaction, this same could have happened in India but because they resolved the discrepancy as fast as possible before it escalated and resulted in the payment of tax for every transaction made, choose any exchange at your own risk because they will still have more reasons to why the exchange put a hold and am sure other exchanges may be worst than Binance. I'm not sure what the reason behind it is, so far as the official communication from Binance goes, they will no longer use Skrill's services, so it's possible they'll find some alternative in the near future. Other exchanges are operating successfully, so it doesn't look like there's any government crack down on exchanges in the UK.",
