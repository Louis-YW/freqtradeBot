Sometimes though we all want to spend our wealth on the physical stuff like cars, houses, chicks etc... Saylor is a human being too so I wouldn't be surprised if he sells his coins to purchase something big like a private jet for example. Otherwise, I don't see him ever selling his coins. He is now a believer.",

He is using investors money to purchase Bitcoin and not his personal money alone so he will surely sell whenever there's an opportunity for him to do so.He can sell tomorrow or next week if the price goes above his buying price with enough profit that will satisfied investors. But I think the real date is still gonna take many years since he needs atleast above ATH in able to have a decent profit while the current price is still halfway there.",

He has been the biggest fan of Bitcoin and also invited many other big investors to join his gang of Bitcoin collector(s). He might sell a little bit amount or like 10% if his company doesn't do good in any financial year to cover losses etc. If he has a particular target price in his mind for his investment, surely he will cashout there.",

      "body": "I already had this discussion few days back where i expressed my doubts that Slayor (if) sell his BTC then what will happen. Then the OP replied my one statement that why he would kill the golden Goose who lays golden eggs. Means, he will be earning a lot of money from holding it and simultaneously he is earning from the commissions and fee collected by his Market shares. Overall, my answer is he will not sell his all BTC or maybe some to compensate his costs and expensive. But that amount is not going to be huge so, my answer is D. No. Many might think he would sell, but that can only be known by him, no one could predict that. I am wondering now can he make that decision by himself. Well, that i will look onto but later now i found only 1 useful link where MicroStrategy only sold 700+ BTC which is every small trade in compare to the buying they do, (source)",

So there's no point in discussing their movements because they hold a very small % in my views (I know they hold a lot but still, I'm talking collectively).",
