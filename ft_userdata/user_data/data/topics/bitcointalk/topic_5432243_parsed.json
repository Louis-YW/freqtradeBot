Why? It's simple. Formerly, when you supply your NIN on any transaction, it is stored by the organization  or business entity which is raises a lot of security concerns as it is possible that your personal information can be stolen and used for other mischievous vices. With the provision of the virtual NIN, you generate a number that can be used only once, your details cannot be stored by the organization or business entity. The mechanism of action is just like how a bank token works(not totally but you get the idea)What do Nigerians think? Personally, I think this is a welcomed development and we should commend the government on this. PS: Make una no vex about the picture arrangement I never sabi how to put am next to each other  You fit suggest am to me.",

On way to learn for this forum na to quote wetin person do and look how him take do am. You fit use table run this matter or just reduced the size and keep the images close to each other.For the matter, personally I no understand why platforms dey request for our BVN when dem know say na very sensitive information be dat and dem dey store am for centralized platforms wey dem fit hack. I like this new innovation as e go help reduce some kind thief wey dey happen when people wey understand how to use ur BVN get am. Or better still make dem pass better law wey no go require financial platforms to dey request for our BVN, make dem just find another way to dey verify our information.",

      "body": "Wow this is a great development and a welcome one too. When I first saw the title of the topic, I assumed the government wants to be taxing people using NIN, lol not until I read the full gist. I think this little things the government are doing to make Nigeria a more secured place for us and a fraud/crime free nation is something we should appreciate them for. The little things matter and we’ve to start somewhere to get to our promise land of a more secured and developed country.",

PS: Make una no vex about the picture arrangement I never sabi how to put am next to each other  You fit suggest am to me.The information come at a time when person like me get issue with verification. Na because of trust issues and time press make the center wey i go then for my NIN, to just generate National Identification number from the one wey my bank do, without verifying it. Some people said local vendors could do it, but my fear na just make e no fall into wrong hands. However, this new development go ensure say if I go through the stress to verify again, I go dey confident in using it because I know say as na token, another new number go auto generate. So person weh feel say e don cram my number go confuse las las.Nice one coming from our Naija government o. Una well don!",
