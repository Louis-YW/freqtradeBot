They used to offer few risk free bets (ie the stake is refunded when the bet loses) but an ante wager requirement was needed. Now they seem to offer half-refunded bets from time to time, but we can't call that free bets or risk-free bets. If your bet loses, you will still lose half of your stake after getting the refund. For Sportsbet and Duelbits, yes AFAIK they are regularly offering freebets or risk-free bets in their promotions without any wagering requirement.",

Recently I have created a topic about the Loyalty Bonuses & Promotions on Crypto Casinos and Sportsbooks.While I was checking the promotions of the sportsbook I found that most of the sportsbook offer free bet or risk free bet occasionally. Perhaps, I found 3 bookie where you will be able to make risk free first bet. Trustdice is one of them. Mbet also offer risk free first bet. But it is limited to “Horse Racing, Greyhound Racing or Harness Racing market”. BK8 is the another bookie where you will find the risk free first bet promotion. Anyway, there are some terms and conditions for this offer, including turnover requirements on the refunded amount. Check the rules before giving it a try.I remember you had created another topic before: Is there a reliable sports betting site that offers a welcome bonus?Free suggestion: Use established and reputable betting site without searching for this type of free promotion. An established betting site always offers various promotions on sports market. And you will receive better treatment from them.",

You don't get to risk your real money, only play on the promotional offers from the company and that's still some cool initiative to test out there system, get acquinted wth it before taking some actual risk with your money.Abuses are some of the reasons why these promotions gets some limitations to them as users will go about crating multi accounts just to get these freebies.Quote from: Mahdirakib on July 26, 2022, 03:40:31 PMI remember you had created another topic before: Is there a reliable sports betting site that offers a welcome bonus?Don't be the one always seeking freebies. If you aren't ready to take some risk, it's best you take some real pause on gambling and maybe return only when you've known the game enough, got the nerve to take risks and the financial capacity to back up your risk taking before gambling. Gamble responsibly.",

I could say 85% he is going to win this fight, that's close to risk fee. Its the odds that might not make you more win if you only have small capital.All these including the Free bets can  be found in most sports bookies actually.

It usually gives you such promotions in special cases which are not always available. But those who use good sportsbooks usually get these offers.

What mattered more was no KYC, regular promotions, VIP systems etc.I recommend Sportsbet for sports betting primarily because of the fact that they do offer freebets through regular promotions, boosted odds sometimes, no KYC, zero deposit and withdrawal fees etc.Don't just join a sportsbook for their freebets since that makes you look a gambler who is only interested in freebies.",
