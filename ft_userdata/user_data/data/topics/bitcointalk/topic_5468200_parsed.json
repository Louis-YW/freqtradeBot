Blockchair should show you the confirmation time.Blockchain, on the other hand, shows when the transaction was broadcast and not confirmed. But if you click on the block on which the transaction was confirmed, you will see when that block was mined and that would also represent the first confirmation time.",

Both times must not be the same and are allowed to differ by quite some amount.Very correct. If we want to be specific, the block time must be greater or equal with the median time of the previous 11 blocks + 1 second, and less than the adjusted network time + 2 hours. These are the particular lines in validation.cpp that check it:Code: (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5bbf735defac20f58133bea95226e13a5d8209bc/src/validation.cpp#L3749-L3756)    // Check timestamp against prev    if (block.GetBlockTime() <= pindexPrev->GetMedianTimePast())        return state.Invalid(BlockValidationResult::BLOCK_INVALID_HEADER, \"time-too-old\", \"block's timestamp is too early\");    // Check timestamp    if (block.Time() > now + std::chrono::seconds{MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME}) {        return state.Invalid(BlockValidationResult::BLOCK_TIME_FUTURE, \"time-too-new\", \"block timestamp too far in the future\");    }- GetMedianTimePast() can be found in chain.h, and it returns the median time of the past 11 blocks. - MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME can also be found in chain.h, and it is equal with 7200 seconds (2 * 60 * 60).

So if you really poke around on a block’s reported time you may find small time differences. I have posted on this a few times. here and there on this site.",
