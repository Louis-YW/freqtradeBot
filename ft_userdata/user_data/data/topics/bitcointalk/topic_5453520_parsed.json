The web design is very cool, I have even started the site yet I'm already being entertained with some cool animations, the sounds thye make when you click on any icons most especially the adjusment bar. The dev really took their time in designing the webpage and I  really commend them for that.I might try the site some other time when I'm less busy because I'm now curious to see how it works, if the landing page could be like that how then will the main casino be?Quote from: libert19 on May 21, 2023, 12:12:28 PMI have no relation with this site, just sharing it here.

To many scam exist and will not trust new platform  unless someone tried then give a feedback that they are legit and doing that is safe. For now will stick to casino which use email for log in since for me this is more safer since using dummy mail for log in cannot harm us since they cannot take anything from that.",
