I don't think many will agree to do it. At least not me. Just few weeks ago I denied an investment offer of over 7 BTC in one of my personal project because they wanted to have a zoom meeting with me. If anyone wants to do business with me then they have my forum history. Visit my profile and check everything that I have open from years.If you can convince the team that the forum history is enough then I would love to check your project, discuss in group chat on telegram. I can offer you any sort of crypto marketing with the connections I have from over the years of bitcointalk marketing experience. I can even offer you billboard advertising in the busiest place of the world (I am sure with a million dollar advertising budget, this will be a great addition). Article publications on platforms like Business Insider, AP News, MarketWatch, StreetInsiders, Newsmax, yahoo websites, blockchain sites and many more.Feel free to visit my service page. Most of the things are wide open. The projects I have worked with and working with right now, everything you can explore. If you find me exception than everyone else, feel free to contact me.I wish the best for your project no matter if we work together or not.Cheers,",
