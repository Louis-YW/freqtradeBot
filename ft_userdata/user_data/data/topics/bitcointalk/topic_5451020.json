Help secure the network? No matter what the reason is, it is the right of the person who has the fund to decide where he put his money.  If all the people who have the money have the same mindset as yours, everyone will be buying BTC and no one will be left to secure the network making it easier for a 51% attack which can affect the valuation of Bitcoin and may render our Bitcoin investment worthless. If I have the fund and friendly energy cost, I would also set up a mining farm regardless of the price of BTC.  I would rather have a secured network than look for short-term profitability.  Call it foolish but it is what it is.Quotewhy the f are you mining nowbut here's the specific reason .... because it is still profitable.",

Even if you strongly believe mining is not profitable at all, the fact that people still looking to mine Bitcoin means that they are profitable for them. Whether they have access to very cheap energy or for other reasons, they can do whatever they want with it. I believe people are not that stupid and will quickly stop mining if they suffer thousand of dollars loss every month with no method to make profits. If you're trying to discourage people from solo mining or starting a new farm, you don't really have to make this thread since they will soon quit as long as it is no longer profitable for them. Not to mention there are dozens of threads talking about this same issue from years ago (you'll probably see similar points like yours from other users when a newbie asks if they can mine BTC with a CPU or a single ASIC, for example).

Not to mention there are dozens of threads talking about this same issue from years ago (you'll probably see similar points like yours from other users when a newbie asks if they can mine BTC with a CPU or a single ASIC, for example). CMIIW.The case I talk about is crystal clear (starting 1 year before the halving) that is the most stupid decision to take. Even mining needs a business plan and not every moment is the right moment to start. If you started like 3 years ago it would have been profitable as you would end up with 50% more in BTC.If you start right now, yes you will be profitable in USD only. However, you will be fucked up in terms of BTC. The only good time to start nowadays is to wait the halving to happen and price to double than start your farm.. otherwise, I don't see any other wise decisions as no one can prove it in terms of BTC so, mining isn't dead it just needs the right time to start.",
