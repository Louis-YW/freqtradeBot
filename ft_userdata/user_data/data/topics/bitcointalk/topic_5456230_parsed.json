Even if the computer which you connect your device is infected with malware your keys will remain secure in the hardware wallet.Hardware wallets are secure, but do not believe that they are completely safe. Learn more about clipboard malware. Clipboard malware can change receivers address to a hackers address. That is why you need to check and recheck the receiver address before broadcasting any transaction. Be it cold or hot wallet, be careful of malware and hack. Quote from: https://coinguides.org/import-ledger-trezor-seed-electrum/If you want to use your funds immediately then for the time being you can use software wallet. But do so at your own risk.If you have high amount of money there, you can setup a wallet airgapped device instead. Like this one: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html",
