Yes, where can we find a Brazilian user to do that?",

Thanks again.  This is somehow risky if bet goes wrong then another 500$ will be stuck on Bc.game account. Why not bet on almost 50/50 match with -1% to -2% EV? This will just required you low amount and you can do the method multiple times until you finally won on the other casino. Try to use reddit on finding player from Brazil then just use the forum for the negotiation.",

Leave it for others to comment?  Nice you got some one to help you out with your deal.  I was about suggesting you ask questions about it in the Brazilian board for more information if a Brazilian could help you out but however, I would advise you get an escrow if you can for transparency and credibility so that there would not be any issue and if there is, it would be resolved amicably according to the terms and conditions you both agreed to and lastly, I was of the opinion that you lock this thread so as to avoid spamming since the real purpose for which this thread was created have been fulfilled.",

Thanks again.  From the abbreviation of the country currency which I coloured, I suspect that you are a Nigerian. And you are a Sr. Member meaning you have been in the forum for a long time yet I have not seen you in the local board, well it is not compulsory to be there but it necessary. By the way if the $53 can't be converted to bitcoin which I guess you we trying to convert, that means BC.game has a limit of withdrawal and probably your withdrawal amount is not up to the stipulated amount. I don't think anyone from Brazil can do that because the policy is from the company. You can use it to bet as you said to increase the amount for the conversion.",
