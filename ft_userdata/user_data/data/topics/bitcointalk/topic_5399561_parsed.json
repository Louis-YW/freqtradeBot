From now on, posting or replying to such threads could result in being banned. Existing threads will be locked.Specifically, you are not allowed to give people any incentive to post insubstantial posts in your threads. You can't offer to pay people who post their addresses, usernames, etc. You can do giveaways off-site and link to the giveaway page in a thread, but you can't give people any bonus for replying to your thread.[.....]Heya, i wanna do a private airdrop for a asset on the stellar chain. My only goal is to get more people creating a trustline to that specific asset and then answer with their federation or wallet address so i can send them their token.Is that still ok over here? Regards,hackySeems like your giveaway incentivizes posting within one or more specific threads (\"answer with their federation or wallet address\") in exchange for altcoins (\"a asset on the stellar chain\"). So no, it's not allowed. You're free to post an announcement for your giveaway in Bounties (Altcoins) but accept entries via Bitcointalk PM (either ask users to PM you or PM a user specifically created for the airdrop). You can also accept entries off-site (e.g. via Google Forms).",
