Another way to tell if a post is good, even if it doesn't have merits, is when people recommend it to others who have questions or need information on the same topic. If someone suggests another person's post, it means it's probably good. You can also identify a good post if it comes from a user who consistently creates helpful content and is well-known for being informative on the forum. When such a user shares a thread or reply, most people trust it immediately because they know it's important and helpful.",

Other alternatives could be \"Thank/Like\" as we mostly see on social media. But in the absence of that, a merit system is being used in their place.But if there is no merit system like you assumed, then there is no way you would appreciate it other than replying to their post to show your appreciation.",

The forum is around 14 years old and we survived 9 years without any merit point. Haven't we had a lot of quality posters back then? We had. But at that time we had many spammers too who were easily increasing their activities and achieving rank.When you will actively participate in discussions, you will be visible to others. When you give positive contribution, people will know you and appreciate your work. You don't need some points for appreciation or a post to make to say I appreciate it. The reason for introducing merit was to filter spammers quickly from people who are at-least giving some efforts in their writing. I am not going to say it worked very well, there are farmers who are always trying to abuse merit to rank up. However with abusing merit you can not continue much far. There maybe some exceptions but the people who made to at-least Sr and above, a lot of them contributed well to achieve it. Without merit these members would still rank up because of their contributions.",

Have you think without those function what will they used to rate a photo or a content on facebook, same it is to other social media such as x, reddit, tiktok and many more you knew of.So the Bitcointalk forum introduced the meritocracy to determine how quality and useful or do I say meaningful a post is to the reader and to the entire forum. Let say any post with low effort may not have merits and merits comes how helpful its to you others, hence what you found meaningful might not be that quality enough for me to give credit or merits that's why today you find some post do not received merits by everyone rather only some few people can give it merits.",

And off course no post has been merited by everyone just as you have given reasons. Although some post are mostly visible on local board and I would suggest some people to put efforts on their local Board, and again it's also good to share general knowledge across the general board to also learn meaningful things.Sometimes those who have smerits or are merits source are mostly moved to merits people with quality post and meaningful contents.",

When you see someone post is appreciated by most of the users or it's quoted by many users then that shows the post has some value and is somehow helping others. Meriting a quality post is helpful for the forum because the member who receives those merits will try to increase his/her posts quality even further after getting those merits. When a post contain a lot of information but still that post hasn't got any merits then in such case when someone reads the post and finds it valuable will try to reply to that post and show his/her appreciation for the information. I still believe that high quality posts receive merits even if it take them a lot of time.",

As a reader, a post can have a positive impact on me by making me think differently, teaching me something new, or motivating me to take action.I believe a post can still be considered of high quality if it meets the criteria set by a reader's judgment.

The criteria for quality and valuable may be different for everyone, hence some post that you may come across, may be valuable to you because of the information they can provide to you even if they are not merited.
