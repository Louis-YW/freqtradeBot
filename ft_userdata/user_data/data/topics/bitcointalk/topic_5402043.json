  "content": "Miners feel that the New York legislature’s efforts to get Bitcoin miners out of their state will backfire in the long run as other states invite miners to help improve their energy grid.Environmental sustainability has been at the heart of the New York state government’s argument against Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining. The controversial mining ban bill would prohibit any new mining operations in the state for the next two years. It would also refuse the renewal of licenses to those who are already operating in the state unless it uses 100% renewable energy. GEM Mining recently commented that the bill will not only miss its intended target but also discourage new, renewable-based miners from doing business in the state. Warren told Cointelegraph that his operation is already 97% carbon neutral.Roughly 10% of the US's hashing power comes from New York according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI). This makes it the fourth-biggest producer in the country. As of April, miners indicated in a survey with the Bitcoin Mining Council that about 58% of the energy used for mining is from sustainable sources.(Source: Cointelegraph)",

They were the first state to really get serious about crypto, not just mining. They want miners to get clean energy, miners will comply. And then they will become a model state, for others to follow, and after a year or two everyone will know how to get into the clean process easily. I see this as a good long term plan, plus adds more ammunition to dispel the dirty Bitcoin mining myth.So I know it seems like bad news but 2 years is a short time and enough for everyone to become 100% renewable. The complications and requirements are unfair and biased for sure but it will work out for miners in the end.",

It's always difficult to take the first step but the others steps just follow the first one. I am afraid that shouldn't become a trend in US. Exactly what I was thinking. Mining margins are already thin with the average cost of electric, and the miners themselves. Let alone, factoring in running those miners in or around a city/state like New York. I guess the out skirts of the city itself, probably is more affordable, but the city will have massive electricity charges just like any major city. This probably isn't going to effect too many smaller miners either, since the margins probably wasn't worth it in the beginning. Although, this does signal one of the first steps of doing this sort of regulation, and likely other countries, and states of the US will follow suit.",

As I posted elsewhere on the board:Since as of last year NY had just under 20% of the total US mining and was growing:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/09/war-to-attract-bitcoin-miners-pits-texas-against-new-york-kentucky.htmlQuote from: avikz on June 10, 2022, 12:30:48 PMThe land price in NY is one of the costliests in the world.

They can simply move to Texas and probably expand their mining operations to a great extent. Not even close. DOWNSTATE NY like NYC and the surrounding area are very expensive. But once you start heading north and west it's not really more or less expensive then any other state. As you get even more north you have cheap hydro power and since it's cool / cold a large part of the year it makes cooling your facility that much cheaper. OR as 'real' major data centers have found it's better to pay more for electric and land and then use less cooling then save a few (yes a FEW) cents for KWH and have to run the coolers longer and harder.Quote from: ChiBitCTy on June 10, 2022, 12:52:33 PMThe funny thing is New York has been isolating themselves from the financial industry for a very long time despite being where Wall Street is. They don’t even allow for a good amount of basic financial products, which in turn actually hurts its citizens rather than protecting them (which they claim is what they’re doing). Or, it puts them in more control of the businesses that are here. I use this example since it happened to me. Black Hat / DecfCon 2011 3 of us got our debit cards comprised. We all used the same ATM at JFK when flying out. I had all the money taken out of my account returned to me before we were back home a week later. The other 2 neither of which were NY residents even though we all used the same bank waited more then a month to get their funds returned. Why? Because of the big stick. Nobody wants to mess with the NYDFS. The carrot is you get to do business in one of the largest financial markets in terms of people and money.NSFW how NYDFS talks to banks / financial institutions that don't follow their rules: https://youtu.be/Odd8Zdhuj9o?t=109Which, on the other side of the coin does as you said cause a lot of people / businesses not want to be here. No argument, but the ones that do exist here tend to follow the rules. -Dave",

And to move from another place might not be a big issue for the miners. But what I see from this situation, NY has been making themselves out of big opportunities that these miners could contribute to their economic growth. Ohh, that NY alone can't make stop Bitcoin mining, there are so many places that welcome miners and help to grow their business. So I see this no impact on the market, we are still seeing an increase of miners in their place rather than being afraid of what this banning proposal may result.",

So in the future we will see more tough measures on this issue of electricity that pollutes and miners will be accused of wasting electricity and therefore will be restricted, I wonder what kind of future mining will have?",

They can simply move to Texas and probably expand their mining operations to a great extent. here is a thought to expand peoples minds.. setting up 200 asics (29peta) only requires a 20foot shipping container. having an empty parking lot with 20 shipping containers and access to the neighbourhood electrical junction box can allow for half an exahash..these days it does not require warehouses and leases. instead just a plot of empty land or an unused carpark that previously could park under 50 cars is all thats needed to have a 0.5exahash farm.the other advantages of mining these days is that being set up in shipping containers is that yes.. they can easily move if asked to... so its of no consequence either way..they can set up within hours of a truck convoy in NY, run there for a few months. organise a better electric deal somewhere else for the next quarter, convoy to that location and run there for a few months. where they are not fixed to 1-10 year warehouse leases. instead they just pay the similar fee to what a truck pays to 'park' for a certain time in a truck stop kinda of scenario.",

Some of them has called it a Ponzi, and some has said that it is bad for the environment due to the mining, and a lot has been said about it which really makes it hard for the government to agree with this.
