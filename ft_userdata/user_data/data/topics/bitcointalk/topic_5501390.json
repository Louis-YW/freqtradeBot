  "content": "Hello,Google is the number 1 visited site in the world. Google is a so called 'Search Engine'. Nowadays people don't use google for searches. Most people use google because they are too lazy to type a full URL website address in the browser address bar. For example if you want to buy something from amazon, most people don't type the URL address of amazon in their browser address bar, instead they type 6 letters amazon in their bookmarked Google tab then click on the amazon google search result to go amazon. I see this lazy behaviour all the time. Most people be on social media all day, you telling me these people don't know the web site addresses to their fav sites like instagram, facebook, twitter, reddit & such & instead they 'search' for these?You only search for something that you cannot find or to look up something new to you, everybody knows where, instagram, facebook, twitter, reddit are located and these sites are not new to most people.The point I am trying to make is for Bitcoin to scale to the world and become the global reserve currency then will the lazy people put in the effort of using it via their bitcoin wallets like wallet addresses, maintaining keys, using & manually maintaining liquid or lighting protocols in their bitcoin wallets to do a btc transaction?I fear due to 'laziness' Blackrock & Wall street will capitalise on this and use bitcoin derivatives to make it convenient, easy & quick that is no different to current fiat banking that the world will use but it be just Fiat 2.0 while they will have all the real bitcoins and I believe in future bitcoin will scale through this derivative way only where the world will use bitcoin but not transacting on the real btc base layer blockchain but transacting on derivative btc & the governments of the world don't want people transacting on the real btc base layer blockchain and will force shops not to accept transactions on the real base layer btc blockchain but only allow derivative btc transactions only that wall street & governments will control on layer 2s or 3s or who knows The governments, wall street and blackrock might do their own exclusive layer in which they will only approve btc transactions.Otherwise show how lazy people can transact on the btc base layer chain with cheap fees using private keys that the people control in a quick, easy convenient way like using your visa/mastercard in shops or online? Otherwise lazy people wont adopt bitcoin for everyday use, they will go back to using their quick & easy CBDC's. And if btc base layer fees are high then that will encourage btc derivatives.",

Bitcoin is only a mean for we to use but in many different methods. We can use it in good methods that can help us to have control of private keys and fully control our bitcoins. We can, oppositely, use it in a bad way, and spend money to purchase bitcoin but don't actually own bitcoin, because we don't have private key.Bitcoin is better than bank system is it is an existing tool for us to use in a right way. If we understand Bitcoin technology wrongly now, practice badly, we can learn and change our practice quickly later. It's not like bank system, we want to change, but how to change our practice with bank system.",

Actually the necessity for Google search engine is to help facilitate on ensuring proper contents of a user or serves as quick notation in order to proceed, process and get yourself search or enquiry resolved and satisfied. There could be a lot going through ones mine that you don't find somethings necessary to be stressed about such as memorizing of the web sites as Op has emphasized.Let's imagine our private seed phrases, why do we still have to write them down or store them elsewhere if we think search engine are for lazy people? That's just basically to be ensured that what we're doing is right and how to save our time instead of going through the critical and logical stresses.Quote from: kryptqnick on June 30, 2024, 09:37:41 AMAs for your point about lazy people, I agree that there should be more mainstream solutions that make Bitcoin as user-friendly as the best mobile banking can be.

These exchanges usually publish doctored proof-of-reserve holdings just to deceive their clients that they are in good shape. Meanwhile, they might be going through potential insolvency. This was the case when it was discovered that Alameda Research's major asset was FTT tokens which was a token by the parent company FTX. This means that the Alameda was not backed by any independent asset but mainly a worthless asset.",

I do really believe that with the current knowledge of cryptocurrency spreading everywhere, it will be difficult to play with people's intelligence as times goes on. maybe you're getting what the OP is saying the wrong way. What OP is saying is that people generally prefer systems that are too easy and that they can conveniently shift responsibility to and not being responsible for what happens to thier funds. This is the main reason why they will rather save up in banks and allow the banks to be responsible for most of thier funds security and safety rather than saving in Bitcoin that gives them full control of thier funds safety and protection. It's a word tussle between not wanting to be accountable and and being lazy with it at the same time. The most practical way that will give Bitcoin users this level of convenience is if thier is a sort of simple Bitcoin app where all transactions can be easily carried out in smaller unit but like it's already been pointed out, it's most likely going to lead Bitcoin to go too bearish faster than we've ever thought of. The best way to look at this will be to know that Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Isn't same with the fiat. Bitcoin has its own area where its relevance is very useful regardless of its simplicity and if you ever make it too simple, it might not serve such purpose effectively. For those of us who hope to create some amount of wealth through our Bitcoin holding, the complexity with converting our Bitcoin to fiat is one sure reason why we've been able to HODL this long. If everything gets too simple, it's certainly going to affect long term holders in a bad way. It's just good that Bitcoin remains the way it his now and would be better if it goes even further up in its worth so it becomes one of the most valuable and  strong investible asset.",

And if btc base layer fees are high then that will encourage btc derivatives.The people's laziness isn't the main reason why Bitcoin isn't getting mainstream adoption. The main reasons are price volatility and transaction fee volatility. Bitcoin has turned into \"digital gold\", which means that this \"digital gold\" could soon be used as a reserve asset(that doesn't mean that it will get accepted by the central banks as a reserve currency). The real gold was the main currency centuries ago, but it was replaced by fiat money and it's role was changed from actual money to a reserve asset. Maybe the same thing will happen with BTC.Creating an electrum wallet, keeping your seed phrase and password in a safe place and sending and receiving BTC isn't rocket science.Even the laziest people can install an Electrum wallet and use it without any issues.",

      "body": "I feel like wall street making stuff that is bettong on the bet on the bet type of thing should be important and could cause some trouble there is no doubt about that part. But that's a problem for the people who deal with that exactly, if you are the one who is buying it then we could say that it's your problem and not ours. On the other hand we are talking about something clearer here, it would be very important to realize that we are not making that much of a big increase at all.We need to make sure that people are dealing with bitcoin exactly and nothing else, if you directly connect with bitcoin then everything else is fine. Bitcoin don't need to \"scale\" as long as it goes like this, the past 15 years it grew exponentially and if it contineous down the road like this then we are going to end up seeing a lot of people being happy about it. Scaling isn't just going up in price, it is also more people coming into bitcoin and I believe that will happen.",
