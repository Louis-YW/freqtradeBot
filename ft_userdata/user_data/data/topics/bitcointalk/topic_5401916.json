Imagine you hit the block and it becomes to be orphan because of software issues... But if you don't mind about the BTC value and just do it for the fun, you will find many ressources here in the forum which will help you a lot.Keep us informed, this is an interesting project. An other user did a post about building your own ckpool recently, it could help you",

I’m not expecting some YouTube video or easy answer. I know I still have a long way to go. I’m learning python now and I know some C++ .That's going to be A LOT of work, and don't get me wrong, it will be extremely difficult for a top-notch programmer, let alone someone who is still learning, but to give you a sort of a summary of what you need to write, it will be as follows.1- You will need to write or modify an existing mining software/driver to control the S9, that will be either Cgminer or BraiinOS.2- You will need to run your own bitcoin node software to keep up to date with the blockchain and to propagate any blocks you might findFor that, you will need to be well connected to the other major mining pools, which requires a good server/s and some good amount of money.Keep in mind that the above open-source codes is plug and play, you will need to do a lot of modification and testing, and in the end, you will only know if your code can actually find a block after it finds one, so you could be mining forever with a piece of software that isn't capable of finding a block in the first place, but it will be a great learning experience for sure.",

Or where I should start? Thank you You need to learn a lot of things. Some of those are orphan blocks, and stale blocks. You don't want to have them.It requires a lot of work to create and manage your own pool to solo mine successfully. You can start by looking at the source code of ckpool solo, available here: https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool-solo/src/masterYou might consider just joining that pool(it's not really a conventional pool), since it's basically solo mining, paid directly to your own address (minus the fee). Here's the address for that: https://solo.ckpool.org",

If you just want to solo mine you could also solo mine in a solo pool that just gives you the backend so you have to simply connect your miner. Benefit of that is that you will still get the full block reward but it is much quicker to set up.",

      "body": "I just wanted to give an update since I kinda just went AFK.So the shitcoin event happened and I have almost sold off all my hardware. It feels amazing not supporting that unregulated security. I feel guilty, dirty for mining those coins and selling them to people but idk what to say... I guess in todays space, everyone goes through their shitcoin phase; glad to be out of mine.I am going to buy an antminer S9 and start working on this... here is my goal and why I am doing this:There should be an open source mining software on Github anyone can fork to be fully sovereign and mine to their own node. I do not have the skills to build that, but I will eventually as long as every week I make one step in that direction and don't give up.Yeah, it would suck if I had an orphan block I guess. But doesn't every miner, even pools, have the same luck? Why would a large pool fork after I find a valid nonce rather than build on this chain? It seems illogical that this would happen. UNLESS, I found a block at the literal same time as another pool and the pools are in their own consensus to help each other by beating my block out by building on the chain the pool contributed to. Nonetheless, this is still a risk for the pools in this little make shift alliance. What happens when two of them find a block at the same time? At the end of the day, blocks are blocks, nonce is a nonce, consensus is consensus; it's all luck no matter how we slice it.I plan to fork my own BTC to test my get block code to test and see how it performs. Yeah, it isn't the same as being on the network, but at least this lets me see if I can even run a \"get block\" command.I fully, in my heart and soul feel like you should be able to click a button in Bitcoin Core that says \"start mining\", and begin mining with your own full node. YES, it is largely impractical. YES, it won't matter to one single user. But I consider it like going to vote. Will my vote make a difference, probably not; but I still spend my time and resources to vote because I care about democracy (or what little of it we have left in North America).If everyone used their computers and little piss ant miners to mine, it would largely help Bitcoin as a network and give the community a sense of pride knowing they are doing their part.",

I do not have the skills to build that, but I will eventually as long as every week I make one step in that direction and don't give up.In the early days you could literally just download Bitcoin (called Bitcoin Core now) and click \"Generate Coins\" and it would solo CPU mine without any pools.Later, you could use cgminer or bfgminer to solo mine without connecting to a pool.Over time, it got really competitive, and the idea of solo mining in main net slowly faded away and most people use a pool to avoid things like orphan blocks.But since you want to ignore this advice, you can still use cgminer and bfgminer today to solo mine without connecting to a pool. I made guides about how to do it for testnet, which makes sense since those coins are worth nothing:[Guide] Solo mine testnet bitcoins with cgminer, Bitcoin Core, and a Compac F[Guide] Solo mine testnet bitcoins with bfgminer, Bitcoin Core, and a CPU/GPUYou could simply change the relevant parts and make it work for your miner, in main net.Again, it would be a shame to actually solo mine a block and then lose it because you don't have your machine well connected, but you can definitely solo mine without a pool today.",

You have already been told about the amount of work that you are wanting to carry, it won't be easy, but it can be worth it. I don't think that there are many solo miners, the few ones likely are not regretting their decision to take that path.",
