At times due to the random movements of the market you will have to make loses even if you are using a good botWhoever tells you to deposit money to them, and they will do the trading for you at an unrealistic percentage per day or week is lying because the offer is too good to be true.

It pays to be skeptical of such offers, YouTube influencers have a bad record of promoting scam projects to their subscribers. I think this post was made two or three days too early. Why don’t you wait to see if you will get your money or if you will be told a different story. I’m counting on the latter to happen. But why make this inquiry here when the deed has already been done? This is more like medicine after death type situation because there is nothing anyone here can do to help you recover your money.",

The entire thing is so amateurishly done and is full of grammatical errors and other obvious warning signs that practically screamed \"scam.\" And if a company ever thinks it is smart to publish fake reviews, it is a clear sign to sprint in the opposite direction as fast as you can.Quote from: CupCakeHugs007 on June 27, 2023, 09:30:30 PMBecause I was able to withdraw $10,000 back to my bank.

Remember, even notorious Ponzi scams have paid out at least some of their clients. It is all part of their strategy to lure in new investors.",

If you set it up badly, with bad risk management and terrible trading strategy, a good trading bot will fail to protect your capital, not yet help you gaining profit.[BIG LIST] Crypto Trading bots",

If they were scammers, would they let me do that?You’re definitely on your way to been scammed. First it is a very bad idea to put your money online, even the most reputable and well known centralized exchanges are advised against and then you have some bot and site which is definitely a scam asking you to deposit there. Secondly the 5% profits is actually the bait here because it is almost impossible to have such profit every week, some investors can have that in a week but there certainly week of less profit and possibly losses too. If they are actually true they would just sell off the trading tips and pairs (which is wrong again) and then charge you. They allow you to withdraw your first for two things. One so that you will trust them and deposit more and secondly you will spread the news just like you are doing now. After all the shenanigans they will tell you the site is under maintenance and that is how your funds will never be returned again.My advice is try as much as possible to take all your funds out if it is still possible and then go get a cryptocurrency trading knowledge and trade your self. More so $20k is a huge some to hold and get a good profit and also minimize risk of loss",
