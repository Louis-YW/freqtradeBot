The owner of silk road contacted him when it appeared to him, that 50k btc disappeared from his wallet due to the glitch, but Jimmy afforded him no help. Later, Jimmy transferred $800 to a KYC enabled exchange, and the cops were able to link it back to the stolen 50,000btc from silk road. How possible is this?",

The tracking was way too easy due to the fact that he had already given away his kyc information to an Exchange. Tracking with his IP address alone would have been more tasky for the FEDs but he make it easier since his KYC information was readily available with an exchange. Probably if he had used a mixer the entire process might have played out differently.",

It's Monero, of course it's not as easy as that to stay anonymous even you've use the most anonymous coin.The problem of staying anonymous while using cryptocurrency is, when you're want to cash out your coins. I mean, you're need to use bank accounts or something like that to receives money, if you can't explain the source of your funds, you're in trouble.",

People are anonymous in the blockchain, only your transactions are tracked, no name or identity is attached to your wallet, therefore no one knows who own a particular wallet unless if it is a centralized exchange wallet. According to the overall story, Jimmy was caught after sending $800 worth of Bitcoin to centralized KYC exchange, which means since he stole the Bitcoin, his bitcoin wallet address was under watch list, but nobody knows the owner of the wallet until he made a transaction to a centralized exchange wallet that reveled his identity because if the KYC he submitted in the exchange.

This is a simple thing and anyone following the wallet that the stolen funds was sent to will have follow up of whoever and where ever the bitcoin is sent to, so this should not be a misery to you at some point because at some point you need to give up some privacy anytime you chose to use a centralised platform like exchangeszl, and from this user incident, you can see that the coin was traced to his kyc exchange wallet and he was caught.Bitcoin is like every other currency, once you have commited a crime by taking coins that is not your own, the authorities will have to right to do a fosice analysis on your wallet and sometimes, they can request for other information from exchanges.",

I believe that the reason that he's not careful is because he thought that he's gotten away with it and that he's already like an innocent so he didn't care too much when he called about the stolen bitcoins that was stolen from him too which is an twist of fate for him, getting arrested because of karma.",

This is another reason to avoid CEX.KYC in centralized exchanges goes against the privacy of Bitcoin, the moment a person submits their KYC it's no longer private and the identity of the wallet owner can revealed if it's an address that is being monitored by the authorities. I think that it's only p2p transaction between two parties that their privacy can be guaranteed, so jimmy, probably didn't get an accomplice to do the p2p with and he went to a CEX and got bursted. So I can say that Bitcoin can only be linked to the right owner when the owner submits their KYC, otherwise Blockchain don't require names and the identity of the wallet owner will remain anonymous.",

They don't know the owner of the address so they can't make an arrest, but the moment he made that transfer to a KYC exchange, he revealed himself. He submitted his details to the exchange so they know who he is, where he lives, what he does for a living, his age, and his face. They know every single thing about him.He must be a novice or he's just plain stupid because he must have known that sending that Bitcoin to a CEX exposed him.

Anyway, I think the answer to your question was literally already written by you before you asked the question.About 9 years after his theft, he made a huge mistake which cost him imprisonment for 1 year and 1 day. That mistake was transferring Bitcoin to a crypto exchange that followed KYC policy and was traced to his home in Georgia. Afterward, he was arrested.",

There could be a chance where he didn't get caught if he didn't leave anything that can link to his identity. This is why many people avoid using exchange that requires KYC to buy and sell crypto.",

Read what you wrote carefully, the bitcoin network is anonymous, the security of your data is your responsibility, I think that the misuse (or, depending on the case, because wanting to hide information due to theft, kidnapping, is not good) of the network lies in people who do not understand what the technology they use offers, and then they misuse it, and it is the fault of third parties.",
