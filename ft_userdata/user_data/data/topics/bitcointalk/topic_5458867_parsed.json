Its a nice name but yeah, a bit unfortunate.Also the top of the site seems a bit funky. Might want to redesign it. A few balls hide the letters and it seems a bit close to the header.Firstly, I want to express my sincere appreciation for taking the time to provide feedback. I value your insights greatly. Regarding your question, indeed, I am aware of the situation. I also experienced some financial loss on that particular exchange. However, ever since I entered the world of cryptocurrency in 2017, I have been drawn to that name and have desired it. Finally, I stumbled upon an available domain, albeit with a .in TLD, and it brought me great joy to secure it. Therefore, while I am aware of the risks associated with it, we cannot continue to overlook the allure of that enchanting name forever. Moreover, it aligns seamlessly with my platform! \"Cryptopia ‚Äî Your Digital Topiary\" warmly welcomes every cryptocurrency with open arms.",
