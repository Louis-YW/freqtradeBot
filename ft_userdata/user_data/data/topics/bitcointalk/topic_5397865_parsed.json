Has this happened in the past or is this not possible?The blockchain is not just a file all the clients download and go on happily.The only way the new blockchain would be accepted by other clients would be if that one would be longer (more blocks) and still valid, and for that to happen the \"attacker\" would have to have bigger hash rate than the current network.So it is possible, but the current cost of doing that is too big, making it highly unlikely to be performed.I would give some reading to https://learn.eqonex.com/news/what-51-attack-and-how-much-would-it-cost. It's just one of the first web results, but it seems to cover the mining/blockchain part and the costs too.",

Would it be possible for an attacker to upload a different blockchain history to that server so that possibly millions of users would send transactions to a wrong chain or have wrong balances displayed? Has this happened in the past or is this not possible?It is definitely possible, because Bitcoin Core only does a block verification which checks each block that contains valid (i.e. not syntactically malformed) transactions.A particularly creative attacker could forge 600K blocks of fake transactions (all valid according to consensus rules), but did not actually happen, and put this on a node which serves many SPV clients. These unwitting clients would proceed to download the wrong blockchain history and thus make balances appear and disappear for some users.This would be only a visual inconvenience though because none of that history is valid as long as more than 50% of the network is using the correct blockchain (as the bad nodes will eventually be cleaned with true history until they reach a minimum).",

Has this happened in the past or is this not possible?yes it is possible(in your hypothetical)but (in reality) its not like there is just one blockchain in a central cloud which thousands of merchants all link to.instead its thousands of merchants with thousands of cloud accounts with thousands of blockchains. which then millions of users then use the thousands of merchants.to cause an issue, a hacker would need to access all cloud services, and all cloud accounts and simultaneously then try to upload thousands of blockchains to each..(emphasis, at the exact same moment)..yep.. over 400gb needs to be uploaded instantly per account.. multiplied by thousands of instances. at the same time..GOODLUCK TRYING THAT!now this is impossible...because..those servers you speak of have hundreds of connections to other peers.and the moment one receives a deceptive chain that does not match their peers chain. boom. the deceptive chain is dropped, rejected. gone",

Assuming non-custodial wallets:* Server dependent wallets like Blockchain.com, Blockstream Green, ... connect to a centralized server and the company that controls that server has to run a node and implement protections and if their server is compromised or a vulnerability is found to fool users' software to think the fake server they are connecting to is real, they could be fed fake data (blocks, transactions,  their confirmed state, etc.).* Server independent wallets such as Electrum, ... can connect to any random full node or a random specialized full node and synchronize that way. These implementations must have additional verification code inside them to verify the data they receive. For example Electrum performs full verification on all block headers and checks it with multiple specialized bitcoin full nodes which makes it impossible to feed it falsified headers.There are also other ways that an SPV client could verify if a transaction is actually in a block that would prevent attacks where you would give them fake confirmed transactions.",

Has this happened in the past or is this not possible?No matter the Node that runs the bitcoin software, for a transaction to get confirmation and added to the block it must require a consensus from nodes connected to the bitcoin protocol. If an attacker uploads a transaction containing a different blockchain history definitely it will be seen by all the nodes connected to the network and can't be verified. the Bitcoin ledger is public and doesn't not have a central database so as anyone can run the bitcoin node it makes it even difficult to upload a wrong balance or a central wallet for payment",

That will certainly be a very expensive project and it must be almost instantaneous. ...right?Wrong. Validity of blocks is not decided based on how many nodes are running. Lets look at things in reverse. From bcash perspective bitcoin blocks are invalid, meanwhile there are far more bitcoin nodes than there are bcash nodes and yet they continue considering bitcoin blocks invalid.A valid block is a block that YOUR node decides based on the consensus rules it is enforcing. QuoteIs that not one of the methods that BCash and previous \"Fork\" attackers tried with the voting system, during the fork wars? (Running a bunch of nodes on Virtual Cloud servers) The minimum requirement for creating a fork is a single node run on a single PC (a single CPU) and changing the algorithm to what you like. You can do it right now too on your PC. Copy bitcoin core's code, change the PoW to allow you to mine blocks at a lowest difficulty on your CPU, change anything else you like and start your fork.As you can see, you don't need voting at all when creating a fork that will be considered an altcoin.The reason why bcashers ran a lot of nodes on cloud servers was to create the illusion that their shitcoin has good support. Of course that wasn't all they did, they also manipulated the difficulty to create the incentive for miners to mine on that chain and get more reward in total (1000+ bcash blocks per day compared to ~144 bitcoin blocks per day).",

In elections, you get to either vote for a party specifically, vote what the majority prefers, or simply leave the country. But, consensus is rather a decision you take free-willingly.Nor the number of nodes neither the number of people who're running nodes matter. All it matters is what you do. If you want to make transactions reversible, change the block subsidy, the difficulty etc., there's nothing stopping you. But, you don't change bitcoin that way. And this applies to everyone, regardless of the percentage, regardless of their economic strength, regardless of their influence. The moment the majority changes a principle, that very moment, they stop being the majority. In democracy, the BCH users would have to switch back to BTC, because as it seemed, the majority didn't want it. But, in consensus, they can have it; they can switch to BCH V2, BSV etc., if they like. They don't have to care what the others say.",
