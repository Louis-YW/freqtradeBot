I wonder what's the use of the token on your casino, it really triggers my curiosity to know. Well, welcome here but I think you should accept feedback and suggestions.",

I have visited your site and it looks really good and it seems that you have put great effort to create that site. In its current state your site seems okay to me and the design is also good. But, your announcement thread isn't that good because it's only text based thread and it isn't eye-catching. I recommend you to purchase copper membership and once purchased you will be able to include images of your site in your announcement thread which will make it more eye-catching. Like others I would also recommend you to go for signature campaign if you want to have more exposure on your site because signature campaigns will really help you to get new players on your site. I would also suggest you to do a review campaign thing because with good reviews from the members of this forum, your site will get even more visitors.",

But BTT people will only take you seriously if you come from the front door and not the back door like this. New casinos need awareness and marketing as the key to success. It will be fine if you come here for a review of the site with some incentives or you open a campaign where people advertise for you for a token.Good luck to you!",

Nowadays, only some casinos have classic games like your site.You should consider promoting through this forum to get other members' attention.

BFG is still very much alive . If you check through BFG on CMC is trading @ 0.014. It is mostly on Dex exchanges and I think we had betfury ran a campaign here this year. So probably it could be a good track for op to follow by reaching out to some managers who can help him publicize the casino more. I think @ CryptopreneurBrainboss handled betfury signature campaign.",

I think @ CryptopreneurBrainboss handled betfury signature campaign.Yes I can remember that name,  I remember ther signature campaign, but aside from that exception with BFG,  we heard so many other casinos that all developed their native token,  and issued out their coins but were not able to sustain their presence in the market,  but then the bottom line for the op is to try and follow the footsteps pf those old casino coins that have made some improvement to keep them in the market. Because quite a lot of the others all failed to meet up with the competition that comes along with the crypto market and they were not able to maintain their presence in the market for long.",

      "body": "I would join the rest of other members here to giving you a sound welcome OP. I will also want you to understand that first approach matters alot here as members are very much sensitive to that. From what I could see here you have not been much active onset from when you made your first post here and there have been lots of replies and questions waiting for your response. This is not the best way to start here as a new casino. You are here for business and as such should be very much active to deliver your services to the masses here which would be of huge benefit to you and your casino.  Starting in such a way to keeping  your announcement thread very much active matters alot so I will advise you to be very much active or you employ a representative to do that because this speaks of great volume how your customer care service timely response and activeness is like. I would advise you look into your announcement thread as it would be nice you do a good and professional announcement thread to help give a good image here. I see you made two links here which indicates that there are two different projects under your supervision which invariably means that you would need to separate them as earlier advised by a member here so as to make communication more easier amongst the users or your clients. As you can see OP, there are lots of casinos out there and are strong contending forces here which you would need to match with. Having in mind that your casino is still new and would need publicity for popularity it would be nice going for advertisement and if you deem it fit doing advertisement I would advise you seek the expertise of a reputable manager here well experienced and vast to handle your promotional campaign. You can contact Royse777 as he is well known with several jobs successfully completed and  would deliver your project when it comes to advertisement.",

It seems true what some people say here that this platform is still under development because in terms of appearance it's a little interesting, it's just that I tried the poker game. The loading was very long when I wanted to enter the game and try. again in the plinko game it turns out that you can only use 1 ball without being able to use several at once and for settings in the plinko game or viewing statistics it still can't be clicked.Maybe this platform is here to find out reviews from all of us for any shortcomings that OP can remember and convey to the development team for improvement and by the way, welcome to this forum, I hope you can develop your casino site slowly here and hopefully get lots of users. as long as you can maintain the reputation of your platform.",

Maybe for a review campaign so you'll know what to improve first. On the other hand, if you need help translating your website and/or your OP in order to post it in the different local boards, to increase the awareness on your altcoin casino, you can ask reputed bounty managers if they offer the service, ask the member wwzsocki, or let me know and I will ask the other members of the AoBT for availability.",
