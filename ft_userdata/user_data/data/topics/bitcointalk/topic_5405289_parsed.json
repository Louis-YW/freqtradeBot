The price of Ethereum today is about 1,102.41, so I think you are talking about a range from about $800 to $1,600, not the range you mentioned.Unfortunately, Ethereum has lost a lot of momentum and the price is related to the Bitcoin movement, which may not look its best, so I don't think we will witness a fundamental rise on BTC/ETH or BTC/USDT pair during this month.",

As you can see, a crisis is beginning in the world in many areas, which means that one way or another the crypto market will react to this, or rather, it is already reacting and will continue to do so. So if the situation in the world and in traditional markets continues to deteriorate, then the prices of cryptocurrencies will go down, including on Ethereum. From this we can assume that the price of ETH can reach $800 for 1 ETH and possibly even lower. It is also worth adding here that now the crypto market has entered the beginning of a new cycle and, as history shows, at the beginning of each cycle, prices for cryptocurrencies have always gone down. So my answer is that the price of ETH will go down to at least the levels indicated above.",

Just because we had a few bad months doesn't mean that we will continue to have those bad months. Hope that it will do better and you are going to be doing just fine.I believe that we will stay in the 1k+ range and that's about it. Sure, that's not an amazing price, we were hoping to be 5k+ and stay there and now we are talking about 1k. But, just because we dropped doesn't mean that 800 bucks or lower seems a possibility, we had the drop and now hopefully it's over and now I hope that we will stay here or go up.",

I do not know whats going to happen, I feel like its going to be like maybe 900 or above? If we are at around 1200+ range already, then a 300$ dollar worth of drop, even slightly more, could still be 900. So if we want to drop under 800, that is around 440+ or so drop to get there. Is it possible? Of course it is possible, hell under 500 is possible, you never know whats going to happen in crypto. But I believe its a bit more unlikely right now, 900 and above seems \"solid\", not guaranteed but pretty solid.",

And if the current sentiment will continue no doubt that we get to reach back to $1,500 again and it looks positive as currently, we are at $1,200 something at this post?Well, it was clear to us that ETH gains huge trust from the investors among altcoins. It is expected that these people are buying ETH which uplifts the demand and trade volume making the price grow as well. Anyways, the entire market is changing its course by now.",

I would definitely get into a psychological bet with you though, and say that it won't go under 1k, not on Binance (just to make sure we use the same place).",

Or maybe futuur is also the site where you are betting at? B moving on, that was right that if you trust a coin, you will accept it if ever it drops more because you know that your coin can recover and can break another ath in the future.In my case, I have also voted for no because there were positive news that I see related to eth, like those whales are buying more eth and then there are those eth.20 updates which development is almost finished, and so on, but unlike you I don't think eth can drop to 900 usd. If ever it drops again, that will only be at 1.1k.",
