  "content": "HiIm following the guide here (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md) to install Bitcoin on my Mac. I want to be able to run bitcoind with and without the GUI. The first time I went though this guide, I DIDNT install berkeley-db@4, and used the configuration:    ./autogen.sh    ./configure --without-bdb --with-gui=yesHowever, when i run `make` and then `./src/bitcoind` it fails and I get the message:   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Bitcoin Core version v24.99.0-9c47eb450346 (release build)   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Using the 'sse4(1way),sse41(4way),avx2(8way)' SHA256 implementation   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Using RdSeed as an additional entropy source   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Using RdRand as an additional entropy source   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Default data directory /Users/me/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Using data directory /Users/me/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Config file: /Users/me/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf (not found, skipping)   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Setting file arg: prune = \"1907\"   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Setting file arg: wallet = [\"My Bitcoin Core Wallet\"]   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Using at most 125 automatic connections (285 file descriptors available)   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Using 16 MiB out of 16 MiB requested for signature cache, able to store 524288 elements   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Using 16 MiB out of 16 MiB requested for script execution cache, able to store 524288 elements   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Script verification uses 11 additional threads   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z scheduler thread start   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Binding RPC on address ::1 port 8332   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Binding RPC on address 127.0.0.1 port 8332   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z [http] creating work queue of depth 16   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Using random cookie authentication.   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Generated RPC authentication cookie /Users/me/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/.cookie   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z [http] starting 4 worker threads   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Using wallet directory /Users/me/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallets   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z init message: Verifying wallet(s)…   2022-11-27T16:20:32Z Error: Failed to open database path '/Users/me/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallets/My Bitcoin Core Wallet'.

Then I again ran:    ./autogen.sh    ./configure --without-bdb --with-gui=yesand then:    makeBut when I run `./src/bitcoind` I STILL get the same error above. What am I doing wrong?",
