Especially now as inflation is extremely high and countries are debasing their currencies. I would argue that maybe more important than GDP is access to natural resources. If a country has an abundance of resources that they are willing to access, other countries will bend over backwards to get their hands on them…",

Normally the world wouldn't take a country like Russia seriously because their economy was failing for years under Putin and their military was weak -- only such problem being they had more nukes than any other country in the world so we're forced to look at Russia as if they have power.Military might used to be the first indicator of a powerful nation in the past. Because strong nations can easily invade wealthy nations and take over their wealth. An example is Persia under Cyrus the Great which some historians believe to be one of the first superpower empires. In recent times it has also been a source of strength for some nations. Nations like Iran and North Korea cannot be pushed aside or overlooked in global politics because even if it is assumed that they are economically weak, they are militarily strong. But in recent times economic development has become the number one indicator of a strong nation because these rich nations can afford to buy or invest in their security. Economically developed countries can easily align with militarily strong nations to get the needed protection. But the combination of military and economic might makes a country very powerful and the US, Russia, and China possess these two qualities.",

But saying they have a weak military is not really, if they have a weak army, how can they become the country with the most nuclear warheads in the world and not stop there, they are still leading the military when constantly developing the most advanced weapons, the latest in the world. While their defense budget is much lower than that of the US, China, or Japan.",

Now a country with a large population may produce a vast output and field a huge army but it would be taxing to bear and can even drain the wealth of the country due to the load of catering for the security and military needs. Imagine a war ridden country like Afghanistan, ordinarily will not be ranked in world's most powerful countries, but have enough natural resources to make the US and other powerful nations set their sights on them.",

      "body": "Firstly a strong military, with a strong military that country will be able to conquer and win wars. Secondly,abundant of natural resources as said by Ognasty,as long as there is abundant resources, other countries will need them to survive and this will strengthen the country's economy. It will also attract powerful countries to have interest to help them in times of war.Thirdly,when there is abundant natural resources there should also be people to work,for the country to be productive. Good number of population is also needed,since it is the people that will go into the military to fight,a country with low population will not wage war with a country that has high population,if they are equal in strength. The more the population, the better chance of winning. Let's take Russia and Ukraine war as a case study,I see that so many countries are assisting Ukraine in manpower because they can't face Russia who has high population than Ukraine.Lastly GDP this is a very important factor as it is the backbone of every country",

Take a look at the third world countries, some of them don't have those factors listed, and as such they are regarded as less powerful.",

If your military power is well equipped other countries will be affair and any policy or ideals egaited by the powerful country will be respected by all because of the military power of that country. That's why today, whatsoever the US says always stand.Every country should strength Their military power and associates with powerful allies in the world to command respect.",
