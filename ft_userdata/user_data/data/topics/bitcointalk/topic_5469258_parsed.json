Anyway, it's still a great fight since it's a championship fight. Hopefully, next time, we will see a unification fight.I agree, since Josh Taylor vacated all the belts here and then lost it to Teo Lopez, it open ups this division. But I understand that the names are not familiar to us because it's from a lesser governing body in boxing which is the IBF. Nevertheless it's a good opportunity for this two to be in the limelight and became a champion, someone has to start from something and hopefully whoever wins this fight will have to cross and unify the belts with other champions so that we can see how good this two are, pitting against the like of Teo Lopez, which upset Josh Taylor and started to get back his name again after his 135 lbs conquest. So Jr. Welterweight is going to be lively, also with Regis Prograis fighting the 135 lbs unified champion in Devin Haney.",

But with the fight on the horizon, maybe some of us here will do their homework and see who is the tougher of the two and predicts who is the champion.But the fight that we are talking at 140 lbs is Regis Prograis vs Devin Haney.",

If he doesn't deserve to be the champion, then Ergashev will replace him. This division has four champions, which makes it very exciting to follow. Personally, I would like to know if there's one among them who will become an undisputed champion. With what has happened in other divisions, we get the feeling of watching a unification battle, especially an undisputed fight.So, just follow your instincts. Champions are not meant to stay forever, and as long as the competition is fierce, there will always be others who can replace them, as it's the battle of the best.",

I'm expecting this to be hella entertaining, and we'll see if Ergashev, as the challenger with more ring time, can outwit the champ. It's gonna be lit!QuoteI am more impressed with Ergashev than Matias he is a southpaw who knows how to move out and move in and with a good combination so he is my favorite here but still an even match because both fighters posses power in both hands.The champion has a 100% KO rate based on their record.

But then have to vacate some belt and then defend it against Jack Catterall who I believed he lost that fight but was awarded as a winner. But that is the first sign that Josh could have been slipping. And then he defended his belt against Teo Lopez in which he was really exposed and he said after wards that he will be going up in weight as he can't no longer make the 140 lbs limit. And then there is Haney as well moving up and then Ryan Garcia. So this is a tough division for this two boxers and the winner will have to go and battle out the rest of the champions. So very hard to say if they can survived or will be just a one hit champion because of the other great boxers that is in this weight class.",

Currently, Matias is the champion, but I haven't heard from his camp regarding whether he'd like to challenge his fellow champions. There doesn't seem to be much hype in this weight class, I guess. I'll watch this fight since I'm not very familiar with the champion and his opponent, but the records show that both are very dangerous fighters. Maybe a fighter can easily become popular if they love to create drama and controversies, like what Teo is doing. Well, he had his first surge in popularity when he defeated Loma, but after that, if my memory serves me right, he lost to George Kambosos Jr., and he didn't even accept the defeat.",

So, if posters here think that Ergashev would win, at least the majority of them should consider betting on Ergashev with odds that are very tempting. I understand why Matias is the favorite; being the champion, he should gain respect from sportsbooks. But can his 100% win rate continue by defeating the challenger?",

That's your take, buddy, and you should totally stick with it. Honestly, nobody really knows who's gonna come out on top in this fight. Those bookies? They're just throwing odds out there based on what most folks are thinking. And right now, most folks seem to think Matias is the one to bet on. I mean, the guy's got a solid track record, plus he's the current champ in this division.You're on point when you say it might all come down to who lands the first punch, especially with their knack for knocking people out. One solid hit could seriously mess up the other fighter and spell the end via knockout. So, let's just sit back and see how this showdown unfolds.",

But if there are no fans that are going to watch in PPV or even in live gates, then they won't make any money for their promoter and even if one of them declared to be a champion, we are still not going to be familiar with them.But if they will go like in the undercard in the Andrade against Benavidez they are going to be benefit more and if they produce a exciting fight, for sure those who watch them live and in the PPV will remember their names. And then one day they can hold themselves and have their own card them. So it's a win-win situation for them and for their promoters in putting them in the undercard first.",
