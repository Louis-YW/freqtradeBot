And at that time all functions might be enabled for you by the account management team at stake. Now I think there is no other alternative except waiting.",

It's sad and shocking to say that's a common modus operandi from scammy casinos. Shady casinos like 1xbit would do the same thing unfortunately. If they found you cheating why they don't just tell it and cancel your winnings?",
