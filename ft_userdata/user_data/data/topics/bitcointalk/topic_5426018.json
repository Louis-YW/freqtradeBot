I wont believe if someone actually told me i would be having a wallet and not to talk of transacting with this wallet is just a great achievement for me . The encouragement i got from top forum members after my first purchase in bitcoin was really encouraging and i just believe that with what i have learnt and i know now, i feels this is the perfect time in the crypto space to buy bitcoin. My reason for creating this thread is today is that today is going to be the first time for me to be transacting with my electrum wallet after i was encouraged by the forum top to move my coins from an exchange platform to a wallet with which I have full control(electrum) .Now i donno know but i feel  its taking too long for a transaction i made to be confirmed please guys what do you think is the problem of this transaction",

      "body": "It's good that you are using electrum instead of keeping your coins on an exchange. Now you have full control over fund and note that the delay in confirmation of your transaction isn't electrum's problem. Transactions are prioritized based on their fee rate. The more fee rate you set for your transaction, the faster it can be confirmed.As mentioned by khaled0111 above, your transaction has an unconfirmed parent. That makes the situation worse. If you aren't in hurry, just wait. I expect your transaction to be confirmed in the next 24 hours. If you are in hurry, you can bump the transaction fee. Of course, since you are transacting only 9000 sat, I don't think it's worth it.",

This forum is really something else and i think i am really at the right place to gather as much knowledge as i can to help me build myself on the  technological advancement of the crypto space. Okay my next transactions i will just increase the charge rate to speed up the whole process to avoid any delayed transactions",

You will see how often the last few blocks were mined keep in mind that the average is meant to be 10 minutes, hence you can try to do an educated guess what's going to happen next.All this can help with the fee and can also help avoiding headaches.",

You don't just increase the transaction fee you need to calculate and check the mempool stats, the parent transaction, and your transaction size to put the right TX fee that can cover the parent transaction the formula is already posted by khaled0111 above. However, I suggest you to read this [TUTORIAL]getting a low-fee transaction unstuck by creating a CPFP with electrum",

When you broadcast your transaction, you don't know what will happen to the mempool in the next minutes or hours and that's why you can only estimate the required fee rate. Since different tools may use different methods for estimation of required fee rate, it's completely normal that they give you different estimations.",
