Could you please elaborate on that? We will receive a random envelope?2) If I understood this correctly, you have already posted those envelopes today (24 April 2023), and you are waiting to receive them in the following days? 3) Will we receive an empty opened envelope? ie. you will open the envelope, and remove the inside paper/letter that contains the receiver address?Quote from: bitbollo on April 24, 2023, 11:35:50 AMExample for bid: Lot X - xxxxx btc4) What's the exact bidding format here?

On this site you can see some covers.https://www.francobollitematici.it/filatelia-tematica-francobolli-erinnofilia.phpGenerally speaking, I think that in a crypto-bitcoin thematic collection these labels used for real postage cannot be missing  and here probably with Cryptoverse there is one of the firsts attempts.Consider the general circulations (560 pieces) and those of the postal history (10 pieces) these are hidden gems",
