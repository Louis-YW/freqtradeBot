Questionable if they blocked without explaining anything, anybody will be confused if they are blocked without any explanation, I hope by posting you can get your answer.",

Watched the balls fall into each 210x... The game itself recorded it, but still wasnt paid. Messaged support and they asked for a video of it... cmon now. Then they said they would be right back with an answer. 8 hours later a new person messages me from support and says \"We have checked with our colleague and only 1 is shown\".... I literally watched it hit lol, and the game had it in the history.... Their history on the bottom didnt show it. Support pretty much avoiding me at all costs now.Screenshot of my screen:https://postimg.cc/z382Rgjvand it was the exact same case, verbatim, posted by this user, hereQuote from: rollbitscam on February 23, 2023, 08:02:11 PMHit 2 210x Plinko balls for $5 each and was only paid one.

The DTs --yes, plural-- overseeing that thread had also came to the same conclusion, which is why the flag is not supported. Not sure why you bother mentioning and referring it.",

OP even deleted their post stating that the case is solved and they got paid, which unfortunately for them --as every single post on this forum is-- is automatically archived by several platforms. Oh, I also happened to quote that statement,Quote from: holydarkness on January 10, 2023, 04:52:41 PM[...]Quote from: moegreen on January 10, 2023, 10:15:21 AMPlease note : Upon posting this thread the admin of 8bet.io has paid my withdrawal. Thank you !As well as, they don't want people overseeing this case to know that the verdict given by 8bet is valid, that OP did a multi-acc. Here on their previous case, the account is under moegreen1@protonmail, and this case is under justforvpn99@yahoo.https://imgur.com/a/EzfrvFShttps://prnt.sc/EHjWAxwNn3kLI think this case is as good as solved, since 8bet's finding and reason is valid.Edit: mentioning wrong platform name, edited and corrected",

Now I have no doubt that OP was abusing 8Bet bonuses with multiple accounts in the past. And he has provided the proof publicly with his foolish movement at this time.I will leave a negative feedback on his trust page tomorrow. He is an abuser who deserves a feedback. What do you think about it?",

I saw them online after I posted my reply and they're online again today, so I think it's safe to say they just admitted their defeat.I'll tag the account as well, so that future scam accusations they raised could be taken with a grain... a bucket of salt.",
