      "body": "I don't think it matters unless they've actually listed what the trigger price should be. There's two different ways this is done on exchanges though, the trigger price I'm thinking of is the one that makes the order active/live after the price is hit? In this case you can set it to whatever you want as long as it's close and perhaps learn from how the market reacts to it if they have a bot that updates when the assets have been bought. If you have a trigger price set too close, there's a chance everyone's could trigger at once and produce a buy/sell wall that ultimately acts as support or resistance that might then be broken again before the take profits are hit meaning you could have set your trigger price to be further away.",

So they can control crypto prices automatically. If the price drops below the specified price, then Bitcoin will automatically be sold. This serves to avoid bigger losses.",

      "body": "Trigger price is most commonly used as a stop loss. The way it works is as follows.Say you are long Bitcoin at $20000 and if it goes below $20000 you want to sell. You need to give 2 numbers. First one is when you want it to trigger, basically send to market. Second is the lowest you want to sell. So you need something like $20000 for trigger and $19900 for limit sell. Because sometimes if you put $20000 for both, it will go right thru your stop and wonâ€™t execute and you will have big losses.",

Suppose you put a buy order of BTC at 20000$ and put the trigger price at 23000$, in this conditional order, that order will be activated once the BTC price reaches 23000$ and will automatically place an order at 20000$. It's a useful tool if you are trading based on the support and resistance level of BTC or certain of its behavior in the upcoming days.",
