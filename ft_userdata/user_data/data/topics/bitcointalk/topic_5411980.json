  "content": "Future trading is extremely risky.This is just a trading discussion and not an advice for anyone to follow. If following it, use the amount of money you can afford to lose. But I think this could be profitable.Assuming bitcoin is at $20000Going 3x leverage in long position That means the iquidation price would be around $14000Noticing a strong support at $20000, the market is not that going dip further, but we have just entered into the month of September, we do not know what the price of bitcoin could be at some point in the days to come before the end of this month. Assuming using $1000 for swing trading, but leverage 3x in long position, the liquidation price would be around $14000. Can bitcoin dip down below $14000?What could be the maximum bitcoin price this month? I am thinking bitcoin could go up to $25000 again this month. What do you think?The result, if bitcoin reach $25000, from $20000. if using $1000 as trading fund.If bitcoin increased to $21000, the profit would be around $150At $22000; the profit of $300At $23000; the profit of $450At $24000; the profit of $600At $25000; the profit of $750But if it is the other way, so it is the unrealized loss until liquidation at around $14000.Quote from: Oshosondy on September 13, 2022, 07:55:58 AMBitcoin reached half the price today as it got to $22680, but the daily chart is already indicating that bitcoin may not go further for now (never misunderstood me, we all know that the time for all-time-high is coming). I mean just for now. Maybe bitcoin price would still hit $25000, I do not know because indicators are indicating that there could be a mild downturn in a way bitcoin may not hit $23000 for now before the next price uptrend, but I can be very wrong.",

I'm accumulating bitcoin ever since BTC got down around $17k. Well, from my experience and thoughts, I think we wonâ€™t see any big pump now anymore while it's very likely to get down to $12k or even lower to $10k.Having leverage position is huge risky. So, play it safely. I would rather buy $1000 worth of bitcoin instead of having leverage poaition. I never had this other than SXP on FTX when we were in a bull market.",

This will increase the chance of your winning.Third, waiting for the liquidation of as much as $14,000 is a high risk for me. What I have learned in my trading career is to cut my losses short. This approach might eventually work, but another question that should be running through your mind is, what if it eventually hits $14,000? A huge loss would be incurred which is not wise as far as I am concerned.Lastly, Bitcoin is still bearish in the long-term trend, and based on my weekly chart analysis, if $17625 is breached lower, it might reach around $10,000, which makes it riskier not to manage your trade better.",

It shouldn't always go to be unlimited, you have to take losses with losing trades, but the decision to see if that's only for the short term or not is hard. Determining if you will hold on or not is the challenge, so you should be firm about it. Look at the charts, if the resistance at $21514 is broken, it could go upwards.If the candles break the $19132 support, it's definitely going to go lower. A lot could happen. It's the decision to see the bigger picture that is the challenge.",

I do not think bitcoin would go below $17500 again, but anything can happen, even if bitcoin dip more further, it can never get to $10000. Even if bitcoin will decrease more further, it can't be below $15000. Before bitcoin decreased to $17500, $14000 is what we analyzed before in accordance to previous year volatility, but likely bitcoin may not get to $14000 if it decreased below $17500, unless microstrategy sell its holding. Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on September 01, 2022, 09:43:15 AMYes its quite risky. 3x leverage is a conservative I saw some with 50x to 100x and its movement could be way more profit but also a huge risk to being liquidated.For 50x leverage, the liquidation is $19600For 100x leverage, liquidation price at $19800Those are too risky. I can't go more than 10x leverage, and it has a special time I can do that, not frequent. I prefer to go on just 3x leverage.I used $1000 for just to know what the PnL would be if the trading fund is $1000, never mind that. I stated it in the beginning that it is better to use the amount of money you can afford to lose.

I understand what you are saying, but I believe as $20000 is a strong support, $17500 would be a stronger support.Bitcoin \"can never\" reach $10,000? That is a strong sentence borne out of the misconception of how the market works. I do tell people that no one controls the market, we are just speculating, so we should not be so affirmative with our positions and ideas about the market. Anything can happen in the financial market, so we should get prepared for the expected and the unexpected no matter how trusting/confident we are with our trading analysis and views. The strongest support/resistance levels have been broken countless times in the past, so do you think such could not repeat in the case of Bitcoin even at the time that the monthly and weekly charts are clearly bearish?That aside, my reply was borne out of the consideration for better planning by managing your trading account safely because the exposure is too much, not even with your direction. It will be fine if your speculation is right, but what if it is not right? That's where the wisdom of proper risk management comes in.In other words, I believe you are risking too much with your plan.",

      "body": "Quote from: Ratimov on September 02, 2022, 06:11:42 PMOf course it can. $14,000 is not such an unattainable price. Bitcoin could fall as low as $10,000 given the past loss of value in percentage terms, which is usually around 85% of the last ATH. 85% of the last ATH is just in the $10,000-11,000 zone for 1 btc. So your long position is not just in the risk zone, but in the high risk zone, especially during a period of market instability and a deep bear market that we have not yet exited. When I traded on a margin account, I had a leverage of ~x1.36 and several times the market was in a very close state to liquidate me for a very large amount. The only thing that saved me was that I had a lot of collateral and I could replenish my balance to push back the liquidation line, and you have x3 leverage, and even in such a negative market. Those who trade against the market are very often liquidated.Anything can happen in the market, we have noticed extremely volatile market countless number of times in the past, the last before the last one I could not forget was when bitcoin falled from $65000 to $30000 in few few days, and also when it falled from $48000 to $17500.The $20000 that supposed to be a support is now a resistance, but we are in weekend, the weekdays would determine what would happen next, I expect bitcoin to get back to $20000 like on Monday, but anything could happen, and if it couldn't, there is possibility that the market is going down further, especially if the $19500 support is broken.Never mind that I did not mention that people should still have collateral, I prefer to go 1x. If going 3x, definitely I have collateral that would make the position opened to be like 1x. Assuming I use $100 for 3x, having $200 as collateral is important, that would make the liquidation price to be difficult to attain by the market price. About volatility, I could be wrong, but I do not use the extent of the last volatility for any calculation, in each halving cycle, bitcoin is becoming less volatile, I am expecting bitcoin not to dip far more than $17500 this time around. Like I have mentioned, we are only speculating, speculation can be wrong, but I have strong stance about this.",
