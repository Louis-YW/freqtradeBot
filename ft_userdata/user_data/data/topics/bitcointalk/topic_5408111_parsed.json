This is why traders and investors should be careful and do thorough research before trusting any company with their money.The reason for the bankruptcy might be due to unplanned business, mismanagement, more liabilities than they can cope with, harsh business environment, lack of funds and loans, and many other reasons. Yet, I don't think this should discourage traders and investors that mean business as they can always go for the best alternatives.",

What is different from fiat banks, is that there are absolutely no rules or regulations governing what loans they can make, and there is absolutely no insurance either. While the platforms all claimed that they did due diligence, only made safe loans, all the loans were covered in excess by collateral, and so on, it's now becoming clear that absolutely none of that was true, and these platforms loaned out your money to pretty much anyone who asked for it without checking their ability to repay the loan and with little to no collateral in return. When one big loanee collapsed (Three Arrows Capital), there was a massive knock on effect on a bunch of these lending platforms which left them all insolvent.I've discussed all this at length in my thread here: Recent events should make you withdraw all your coins to your own wallet: Part 2Quote from: talkoncrypto Official on July 30, 2022, 04:19:24 AMMost Importantly its the people's money, will traders be able to cope up or have faith in trading crypto in future if they lose money like this??These ongoing collapse of multiple such platforms does not affect the fundamentals of bitcoin whatsoever. Hopefully, however, it will result in people losing faith in these centralized lending platforms and exchanges and instead choosing to keep their money in the only place it is actually safe - their own wallets.",

Coinbase have obviously been through bear markets before, but still seemed to be caught so off guard by this one (that wasn't/isn't even that bad) that they had to fire 20% of their workforce. Imagine if the price dropped to $3k again like it did in 2018.

That's why I'm always careful about people who try to position themselves as some kind of crypto leaders, and at the same time use Bitcoin as a story through which they sell their product (token). Every day I wonder if people will finally understand that they shouldn't be so naive and believe that someone is pro-Bitcoin just because he invested in Bitcoin, or has a company that trades with Bitcoin.Quote from: stompix on August 01, 2022, 07:57:16 AMSo, basically, the exchange was already bankrupt with almost nothing left some 8 months prior to his again...death?On the link I posted above in the post, you can see the report of the Canadian authorities, which summarizes what they concluded from their investigation. However, it seems quite unreal to me that a man managed to gamble away more than $160 million through various investments, as if he was a total anti-talent for such things, and everything that was revealed in the documentary clearly shows that he was a very insidious scammer from his earliest days.",
