Gamble with what you can afford to lose, not with bitcoin that you supposed to hold.Quote from: bittraffic on June 27, 2023, 03:42:11 PMRegardless of which game. To me, I bet on Soccer but I seem to have lost every day. How often do you win in Soccer games if you just bet based on odds by picking a team with 1.50 and 1.70?It depends on the odd itself and how perfect the match is after making analyses. That last one I took was 2.2 odds. The last one I took before that was 2.4 odds which was in-play. But I bet in a way that I know that I can lose as well. I can go for 1.25 odds, but I can go lesser than that. What that matters before staking is my analyses.I do not like going for any odd lower than 1.25 odds anymore. Sometimes I like penalties too which can be of at least 1.2 to 1.3 odds for a penalty played. But penalty can be lost too.I gamble with very little amount of money, so nothing to think about if I lose.",

Open a thread like stadus did in the last NBA season and update us on the result of your odd-based betting.I also bet based solely on the odds but I seldom do that. Maybe only 5 or less out of the 38 games in the Premier league. The amount I bet is also not that significant since I understand the risk so it's not really worth counting the wins and losses.",

How often do you win in Soccer games if you just bet based on odds by picking a team with 1.50 and 1.70?This is absolutely a bad idea to try to increase your level of betting just because you want to earn more Bitcoin because it has been proven that the more you gamble just to win the more you lose and the more money the casino makes instead you making more (Bitcoin) as you wanted,  there is no way that a gambler will determine the direction the outcome of the bets. Also, note that even the game with the smallest odds can still give you losses so as that you shouldn't rely on odds to make such stances of winning. And if care is not taken,  the more games you play the more money you will lose using odds indicators unless luck is on your side consistently.",

Gamblers who often see gambling as a way to make money will loose plenty money trying to make more. @OP, if you are trying to get more Bitcoins, winning some from gambling can seem like a way, which is true, but it is not the most advisable place to hope to make money from gambling. Even if you win Bitcoins from gambling today, and gambling by then has already become an uncontrollable habit, it is not impossible that you still gamble away the Bitcoins you win. It takes strong discipline for gamblers to keep what they win.",

How often do you win in Soccer games if you just bet based on odds by picking a team with 1.50 and 1.70?How well do you follow soccer?For you to win bets in soccer you have to have to a have a certain level of understanding of the sports. If you are just going to bet according to the odds then its going to be more difficult for you to win. Sports betting is very tricky and soccer is among the worst of them. The team with the smaller odd doesn't always win. In fact most times the opposite is the case. Even when the team with the lesser odd wins the odd turns out to be too small and you end up not winning much. At that point you're risking so much to win very little. Picking teams with 1.50 to 1.70 odds, its not guaranteed you'd win even if that is the smaller odd. So I would advise you not to use odd alone, but try to analyze to match, analyze both teams and see their current performance. Check how the perform at home and how they perform away from home. Check how often the score, both home and away. One thing other gamblers do that I don't do is check the head-to-head of the teams. I don't know how accurate that may be, but a lot of gamblers do it and it wouldn't hurt to try. All these are not guarantees that you'll win, but it might improve your chances. You can also use your intuition to determine.",

But currently I don't gamble regularly and I don't lose that much maybe if I do the likelihood of winning a game would be higher of losing. Actually those odd aren't that bad for you to lose, so the possibility of winning might be cool with you.",

How often do you win in Soccer games if you just bet based on odds by picking a team with 1.50 and 1.70?I actually have a good win rate when it comes to football because I know a lot about it, teams, and players. I can estimate what will happen in a game and place my bets accordingly and most of the time I win. However, I don't include more than 5 games in a combo, usually sticking to 2-3 games, maximum 4. I aim to find odds of around 4-5 so my potential gain is 5 times what I placed which is pretty good for me. I suggest avoiding random teams that you have no information about and instead look for known football games that offer good odds.Good luck mate:)",

To me,Don't put your faith in gambling to increase your BTC earnings; gambling is unreliable, therefore you should exercise caution while placing bets to prevent losing all of your previously earned BTC. Instead of jeopardizing all you've managed to save, why not just stick with your signature campaign? Working with campaign managers can help you amass a lot of bitcoin quickly.

Just do your best to avoid letting your loss affect you or letting greed rule the day. When placing a bet, I take into account a number of other things in addition to what the odds are indicating about the game. Though odds don't always deceive, they can occasionally be misleading.",

How often do you win in Soccer games if you just bet based on odds by picking a team with 1.50 and 1.70? Such a flawed mindset. Although I understand your cause and as much as possible would like to stand behind it, I would highly discourage gambling or betting on sports to earn profits for your bitcoin basket lmao. You'd find that you'll lose more games than you win even with whatever strategy you have in mind, and the only thing that could really secure you profits in this industry is making sure you don't lose what you win. So in that regard, secure your wins, try to bet less, learn which teams you're more comfortable betting on and stick to them so as to make sure you amp your chances of winning even by just a tad margin, and never go beyond your pre-set personal limits. Gambling for profit is just a massive death wish but I can't really stop you now can I? besides, I think you know what you're doing already, so just make sure that all the pointers I set above are met and you should be good to go at least.",

How often do you win in Soccer games if you just bet based on odds by picking a team with 1.50 and 1.70?There are no guarantees in football betting and in most cases 1.50 or 1.70 odds are not the problem but the team itself. While placing sports betting; it is important to check through the team sheet, statistic and overall play before casting a bet on teams because the odds (1-50 and 1.70) never tell the true picture. This is why sometimes you see 10.00 odd scoring 2 goals against a team with 1.13 odds. The odds figure paint a different storyAlways check and study the football side stats",

How often do you win in Soccer games if you just bet based on odds by picking a team with 1.50 and 1.70?I think you’re approaching this the wrong way. The odds of course state the more times you play the more chances you have to win, simply by the numbers, but those odds aren’t at a very high percentage if you’re not very knowledgeable about what you’re betting on. I mostly bet NFL and NBA, especially the NFL because it’s by far the sport I’m most knowledgeable about and I do quite well each year. I bet say Hockey here and there but I don’t know the game well at all and I often lose, so I stopped doing so. My advice is stop betting soccer.",
