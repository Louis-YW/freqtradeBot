      "body": "I don't precisely understand what your question is but let me try.Not inherently the way Tether reserves compound, but assume that If user A depositing $100 into Tether, then A got 100 USDT, in order to maintain the USDT price stability, Tether must align their reserve with how many USDT circulation that exists. In that way, the 1-1 parity should be realised since the total USDT circulation aligns with the Tether reserve. Tether reserve: $100USDT circulation: 100 USDT",
