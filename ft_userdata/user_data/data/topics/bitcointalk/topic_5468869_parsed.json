It means it will be more expensive for you to buy ETH with same money like $100, you will be able to buy less ETH.Why don't buy it now?QuoteI do not hold Ethereum but do have a few tokens that will require me to pay fees so wondering what is best to do have it ready now or if it doesn't matter and just wait till it actually comes to selling and pay then but obviously the price of Ethereum will be a lot higher next year then it is now so thinking is it best to buy now whilst cheaper? Your post implies you didn't buy ETH but bought ERC20 tokens. I am not against you but you made bad decision. Buying ETH is better and safer than buying ERC20 tokens. ETH will be here but I am unsure about ERC20 tokens that are weaker and can die.Like you did not buy Bitcoin but bought BRC20 Ordinals tokens. Another bad decision if you do it.",

Currently, the price of Ethereum coin is low, so the gas fee of this coin is also low.So now there is a low fee to transfer any token on this platform.As you said when the price of this coin increases but the Ethereum platform tokens you have bought whenever the price of ethereum increases even if the price of these coins increases.But then you have to pay a lot of fees.For me buying Ethereum is better than buying Ethereum platform coins.Because the price of all the tokens of this platform will increase but not as much.",

When ever bitcoin is on a bull, it automatically have impact on the market so your assumptions are not wrong mate. So therefore buying now should be a good target as it is cheaper now before the bull run.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on October 02, 2023, 09:21:07 AMI do not hold Ethereum but do have a few tokens that will require me to pay fees so wondering what is best to do have it ready now or if it doesn't matter and just wait till it actually comes to selling and pay then but obviously the price of Ethereum will be a lot higher next year then it is now so thinking is it best to buy now whilst cheaper? If you have tokens on ethereum chain then you must definitely need eth for gas fee and there is no two ways about it. So you must buy it and keep it for gas fee come bull run because it would be much expensive then to purchase. As it is that the market is volatile,  Use your spare cash you can afford to loss if it happens that the market changes direction you would not bother to worry about it.",

If you have some tokens that will require ETH fees and if you think a bull run is incoming, it makes sense to buy some ETH at current rate to cover the fees. There's no other way to pay the ETH chain fees except ETH. So get it while it's cheap and if you are certain that a bull run is coming next year. ETH is also good for investment as well if you are planning to hold it.",

If you have extra cash or balance then do buy some of it while it still cheap. If you believed bull run will arrived then eth will likely increase and as the price increase you only can buy few of eth to cover for the gas. Its hard to say when it will increase but much better if you can buy while it still low.",

So if you have ANY money at all right now and you could spare it to buy something ETH, that would be a lot better and should be something that could gain a lot of return we could have in the end.I believe that we can't really have all that much of a bad return if we do something like this, ETH should be as good as it gets and having that type of return should be the priority. If you use it for fee, then you could use it for the fee, if you do not use it for the eth fee then you could end up with holding it to make as much profit as we could. That should be something that would be very important on the long run that could help you in either cases.",

Let's hope together, hopefully the years ahead will be good years for us, crypto enthusiast.For your doubts and questions, first try to understand what your goals and hopes are, isn't it to sell your tokens at a high price when the bullrun comes? If that's the case, you should know that if the token you are holding now has a high price, Ethereum as the native token will also experience an increase in price.So why are you still hesitating about it? Currently the price of Ethereum is at $1,650, I mean, don't let it happen that when you buy it later, the price of Ethereum is already at $2K+, LOL.",

It's better be ready than sorry. I guess you will get a little bit of discount if you buy ethereum today expecting that ethereum will sky rocket again in the next bull market. I think you only need a little eth for those future transaction given that we have some technologies in making the transaction cost cheap. Though I personally won't keep a erc20 without a gas fee to transfer it again, actually all major blockchains like BSC. I just like to be ready on future transaction and to lessen the hassle of instant buying a token in it's current price for the sake of the transaction fee.",

Buy now, because it will be more expensive later. Gas prices will not come down during the bull run, but instead will increase strongly due to the strong increase in demand for the blockchain space. Think back to 2021, gas prices were just insane at times. Right now, the market is relatively calm, so this is a good chance to buy coins.",

Why wouldn't you buy eth for fees now? It's not like you need to buy that much it that you would be saving a huge amount if the price goes down, as it's just money for gas and nothing big. Eth is definitely not going to drop as much that you would save something that's relatively cheap now. But it can rise in the price and no one really knows how much it could, now that's in deflationary mode.",

I think just have some ETH ready, there's no better things that getting ready. A $100 worth of Ethereum would like be enough considering how huge transaction fees when bull run comes, I don't trust those upgrades they've promised to lower the gas fees. I think you've already plan it ahead because truly it's cheap right now to buy Ethereum and if it increases in value that $100 could even worth more in the future and would be more than enough to pay some fees.",
