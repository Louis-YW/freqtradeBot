Many beginners ask this question, especially when they are just starting out. I have to admit, I also thought about it at some point.

Yes you're right, but for example you can already increase your entropy by using more than 128 bits (which is 12 words) for your seeds. There are 2256 private keys and 2160 bitcoin addresses. It means you wont be able to generate all addresses and/or private keys with a 12 word seed, and the entropy of your keys and adresses will be reduced from the full capacity of Bitcoin. If you are looking for more entropy and security, it's certainly a good idea to use seeds with at least 160 bits (ie 15 words).",

The only real way to add meaningful security would be to reduce the chances that someone can calculate a particular seed in less than linear time (eg, faster than brute force).",

It is almost certain that any seed phrase could be used to generate every private key which could possibly exist. Allow me to explain.BIP32 allows 1 byte for extended keys to specify their depth. This means 256 possible values. 0x00 is for the master key, leaving 255 levels for child keys. This means that a derivation path can have at most 255 levels beyond m/. It also allows 232 possible indices per level; 231 hardened and 231 unhardened. This means that any seed phrase can generate (232)255 possible child private keys. This number works out to 2.5*102456. This number is obviously many many orders of magnitude larger than the set of all possible private keys, so while it is impossible to prove, it is almost certain that any seed phrase can be used to generate any private key, if you can just find the right derivation path (which is, of course, impossible).Quote from: Saint-loup on July 17, 2022, 09:57:50 PMand the entropy of your keys and adresses will be reduced from the full capacity of Bitcoin.It won't. Although bitcoin private keys are 256 bits in length, they provide 128 bits of security, since the most effective attack against them is not random brute force but to reverse the ECDLP, which would require (on average) 2128 operations. This standard is intrinsic to the secp256k1 curve which bitcoin uses, so no matter how many bits of entropy in your seed phrase, your private keys will never provide more than 128 bits of security.You can see this in Standards for Efficient Cryptography.
