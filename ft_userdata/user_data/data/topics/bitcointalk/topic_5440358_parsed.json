Basically bitcoin and crypto education is borderline mandatory in our honest opinion.What do you all think?To put it simply, as the use of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency becomes more widespread, it is likely that more people will need to understand these concepts. In a world that is increasingly digitized, digital currencies may become more common and even necessary in some situations. So, it is good to familiarize yourself with these terms. But not everyone needs to know all the technical details. Just like millions of people use card payments and ATMs without knowing how they work, many may use cryptocurrencies without understanding all the details.",

On the other hand, for me personally, I don't really want to be bothered with it because until now in my environment, if there are new people who want to learn and discuss, then I'm ready to give suggestions, but if not, I don't want to be bothered by having to introduce it to other people.",

So whenever an elderly person who's heard of it on the news or saw it on social media asks me about it, or maybe just someone who's not that familiar with bitcoin, I only ever tell them that it's like money, because well you can use it to buy stuff, you can save it, or you can exchange it for other currencies, just so happens that people love to play with it that's why the price is volatile and can go up and down (\"playing with it\" is a little too simplified and a bit of a stretch but it's an explanation you'd have to tell otherwise your credibility is at stake at this point). At this point, if they've listened intently, they would pretty much grasp the basic concept of bitcoin already and would stop bothering you with questions, unless they wanted to invest in it.",

With the feeling of reassurance they become encouraged to want to learn more about Cryptocurrency. Learning something new can be challenging on you if you try to do it alone, so I will ask if they want a physical tutorship or can do well learning online from resources, if the choose tutorship, I can offer to guide them, but if they prefer online and learning on their own, resources can be recommended for them.",

QuoteIf bitcoin is supposed to be the future of finance, then the whole world will need to know at one point or another. Basically bitcoin and crypto education is borderline mandatory in our honest opinion.This depends on the government of each country because the government really hard to adopt a decentralized and make it a centralized currency. It could be for the country that Bitcoin already declared legal and tender to their place, it's easy to spread the education of crypto, especially Bitcoin. If people have an interest in Bitcoin they will need to do their own research even if no one teaching them.",

It's just hard/scarce money like Gold, except way better, which is why it is so valuable. And it is digital so included is a payment platform that works globally with anyone who has the internet, no need for banks - you bank yourself, no red tape or expensive fees to send between countries, just anyone who has access to the internet is an equal user who can use it freely and send or receive from anyone in the world.It's an extremely valuable currency and a totally open global payment network and its the most secure network in the world.But yeah if you go beyond that and start talking about how the technology and the network and everything works and trying to explain blockchain that's when it gets confusing. And I guess it gets confusing if they start saying like \"well governments make currencies so who makes Bitcoin?\" and questions like that because they probably aren't prepared to understand how money works.",

It operates on a decentralized network called the blockchain, which is a public ledger that records all bitcoin transactions. Think of it as virtual cash that you can use to buy goods and services, with the added benefit of being able to send money to anyone in the world with just an internet connection.\"I don't think there is a point in oversimplifying things, people need to learn what blockchain is and they need to learn about bitcoin.I hope schools will start teaching about it soon.",

I don't think there's any need to explain the nitty gritty details of the tech behind it, unless they asked ofc, but then with that they'd need a certain level of understanding what blockchain is so you'd have to start from there.",

It was known as the longest Bitcoin faucet, but now they're add gambling in their sites. Not a good way to let a newbie know if Bitcoin is generated through a faucet site, they will get a misconception about faucet, mining and cloud mining. I think that's why many people get scammed due to cloud mining and ponzi scheme, because they think Bitcoin is really easy to earn.If the regular person can't control themselves, they would fall in gambling and they will become an addict.You need to start to explain Bitcoin by compare it to fiat and bank, they will learn how Bitcoin solve the centralization problem in this world.",
