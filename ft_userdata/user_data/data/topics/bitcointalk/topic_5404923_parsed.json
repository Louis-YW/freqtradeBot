      "body": "There is no software yet for overclocking it. Why do you want to overclock this unit? is it hashrate drop? There is an option under the configuration of this unit to choose either normal mode or performance mode. Or you can try to play with the FMS app and use \"diagnose\" and send the commands below 537 to 612 these might be frequencies increasing it might force your miner to run overclocked.Code:[{\"command\":\"ascset\",\"parameter\":\"0,aging-parame-ter,60-537:562:587:612\"}]Take note never tested it but you can try and be careful it might also need more power and it can lead to PSU failure.Just in case send this command below for auto tuning your miner.Code:[{\"command\":\"ascset\", \"parameter\":\"0,aging-set,1\"}]",
