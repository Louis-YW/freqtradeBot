  "content": "I've recently got this bad boy and I'm looking into getting part 107 so I can maybe do a few commercial jobs to help it pay for itself.I had drones in the past before regulation. operating them isnt really an issue. Has anyone here gotten P107? What kind of questions am I expecting on the test?. basics like dont fly over 400ft without waiver, always watch it physically, check restrictions , b4ufly and so on. . I'm wondering if there is material around for study that's on the FAA test like a quick study guide?",
