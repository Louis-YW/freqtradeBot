  "content": "Hello,I am another victim of LocalBitcoins.com Exit Scam.They are now closing forever but they are doing anything in their power to deny BTC withdrawal, including the \"neverending KYC Scam\" tactic.I have a legit and verified (with ID) account with them, but they say it's not enough and they even refused to refund my bitcoins to the original address.I read many complaints about them.I wrote to their regulator, I'm unsure about the outcome since the LocalBitcoins.com support is completely useless and they are already closing, so they could not care less about their reputation.",

I hope people stop using or highly trusting these centralized exchanges masquerading as p2p services. They are literally the once in custody of your funds and there's nothing you can do when they decided to keep it to themselves or exit scam.",

      "body": "so sorry about your experience with them. Centralized exchange can not be trusted with funds any more, There have been lots of complaints from different quarters about them but it is unfortunate that at this moment they are folding and are going away with investors funds which is not appropriate. I heard they gave time for withdrawal, did they send out messages to their members? did you receive any message from them telling you to make withdrawals in time? It is sad though but i think they are a big time exit scam. That is why it is advised to keep your assets in your own wallet where you have assess to your keys alone hence the phrase \" not your keys, not your coin\"",

Upon checking their website, its says thereQuote from: https://localbitcoins.com/service_closure/We encourage all customers to withdraw their funds from LocalBitcoins and we ask you to proceed with withdrawing the Bitcoins from your LocalBitcoins wallet. You have 12 months to withdraw, however of course we encourage you to proceed withdrawing sooner.It says there, 12 months to withdraw, that's plenty of time to provide necessary stuff to withdraw it completely or something. Quote from: localbitcoinscam on February 27, 2023, 10:53:06 AMI read many complaints about them.Can you show the complaints as well? I know they have been very active for the past 10 years so I don't think they would just do that or something.",

If they say that your verified account is not enough for your bitcoins to be refunded to the original address, what other requirements did they ask of you?! Can you send us screenshots?

Not on my end but too bad that there really were those people that experiencing this before their closure.Not that much to do and as time ticks before their final days, I just wish you that they'll respond to your complain properly and address it based on how you want to receive the response from them. You've made another thread and hopefully you answer back here with the questions given above.",
