  "content": "I posted this yesterday in \"Press\", but this story surely deserves a topic on the main board.Geeky crypto thief, 32, jailed for hiding $3billion in Bitcoin in popcorn tin admitted to trying to use the cash to score women - as government offloads stolen gains on Coinbasehttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11985885/Bitcoin-scammer-admits-using-money-stolen-gains-impress-women-hes-sentenced-year.htmlIn short, an autist has been sitting for 10 years on a bitcoin stash worth over $3 billion, cashing out parts of it to try to impress hoes. That's a pathetic story and shows how miserable life without a higher purpose is even if you have tonnes of money. But there's also other interesting mention there:QuoteThe government sold it on cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase – just like millions of other crypto traders, who have been characterized as 'degenerates' and basement-dwelling geeks in the past three years since digital currencies took off in popularity.The only difference was size. The government's transaction was for 9,861 Bitcoin, sold for a total $215,738,155.'There remains approximately 41,490.72 BTC, which the Government understands is expected to be liquidated in four more batches over the course of this calendar year,' Felton wrote in a sentencing memo for Zhong filed on March 31.Hmm, could it be that this has something to do with Bitcoin struggling to keep above the $30k?",

Instead of the government selling the bitcoin, why not ask for those bitcoins to be returned to the exchange or platform they were stolen from?",

It's really a big catch. And the guy who stole the bitcoin must really be so unknowledgeable on how to go about those bitcoins he stole. Sending Bitcoin to Coinbase (a centralized exchange) from a wallet that holds about 50,000 bitcoins was so unwise of him, and there was not even a reasonable thing he was using the money for. Well, this should serve as a lesson for people who solely depend on trading their bitcoin on centralized exchanges. If a person holds such an amount of bitcoin in their custody, it's supposed not to be sent to all kinds of platforms because it can be tracked. And Coinbase is an exchange that also saves user IP addresses, so I believe it was not even difficult to catch the guy.",

Classic old case of \"If I have more money more girls will talk to me\", although wouldn't really put that much blame to him since he admitted to his crimes and because well, he's mentally disabled. By mentally disabled, do you mean autistic? Well, some autistic people can be intelligent, but autism does cause problems in relating to others, although I don't know to what extent in his case since he studied at the University.On the other hand it is pathetic that he spent a lot of money to try to impress women and didn't attract them. I imagine that the ones in the photos are escorts. Very strange because a guy with a lot of money always attracts women interested, no matter how ugly he is, who wants to get his money but at least he fucks them. The article also states that he abused cocaine and alcohol.

      "body": "I think you're all being a bit hard on him. At the time, he was 22 years of age. Of course, this is still adult-hood and he should be growing his morals and values as a person by this stage. However we don't know his upbringing. We don't know his circumstances. We don't know his mind. If we want to judge a book by its cover, we can probably assume that he may have been bullied at school, probably not a part of the jock team and probably did not ever get a girl that he wanted...maybe not even a sexual experience.With these assumptions in mind, if he landed on this large sum of money which at the time was worth less than $100, then it turned into over a billion...how is someone supposed to grow personally in order to manage that money and do something good? Especially if there is any form of mental health deficit or mental disorder that is also in the mix. Alcohol, cocaine, women...that's how the movies have programmed people (especially young males) to enjoy money, or what you can do if you have a lot of it. All of which turn into habits until you can't do it anymore...so this guy probably just kept on doing it because it was always within his means. So in my opinion, I see a young kid with probably not the best track of personal development, possibly slight mental disorder or low mental health, and fueled it with further toxic actions, while not knowing what to do with so much money other than what he has probably seen on the TV. It's pretty appalling for people to assume that he is autistic and also insult him on the board for what he did. I feel sorry for him if anything, and I commend him that for holding on to all of those coins for so long for over 10 years. By no means am I endorsing, supporting or commending his actions overall, it's definitely not the right way to go about things. I just don't think that he deserves this kind of hate and publicity. Just like when every other DeFi smart contract is hacked, it should just be news and everyone should just let it go. Let him serve his prison time and start again with nothing when he is out.If people want something to be angry at, it's the U.S. government for confiscating the coins and hurting the bitcoin market, where most likely not one cent will benefit the people of America.Also. He is not a scammer. He is a hacker. He found a hole, he expoited it, he profited. If silkroad was secure, he would not have gotten those coins in the first place. He did not trick or deceive anyone. There was technical skill involved in what he did.",

It's a huge dump happening, so the price will certainly be affected. However, if that's really the main reason, then I guess the dump is just temporary since Coinbase has over $1.6 billion in 24-hour trading volume. Alternatively, the best idea is to divide the amount of Bitcoin to be traded in different exchanges, if the government allows it.Right now, Binance has the biggest trading volume with $12 billion daily. So, if some trades are done in Binance, then there won't be much effect on the overall market price.https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/",
