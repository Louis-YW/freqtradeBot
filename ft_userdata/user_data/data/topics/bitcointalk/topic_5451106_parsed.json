  "content": "Photo by Alexas Fotos A few days back I posted a topic on this board on Beware of such ads on Instagram & Facebook!. I was not aware that Meta's advertisement algorithm is such a shit. As it has now opened the Pandora box of scam ads everywhere I go within the Meta ecosystem. I am reasonably a logical person with the ability to decide what is right or wrong. As I have been continuously getting such shit adverts. Now, most of you might be thinking why I did not report these ads. The reason was simple I was in a hunting mode to find which one can deceive me. I found one that according to me was the best these scammers can do and to an extent it convinced me. It is a Deepfake AI video with Elon Musk convincing anyone to invest in this scam project. What made me believe that it is not fake in the beginning is the voiceover done by the AI on this video. You can check the video as I have now uploaded it as a short on Youtube. I did add a heading for everyone to understand it is a fake video. If you want to watch the video then I have uploaded the video as Youtube shortsI went ahead and clicked on the Learn more link to see what were they offering. After going through the website I understood that this is another scam website. As it had multiple connect wallet buttons, which is a big red flag for me. What do you think will happen next?",

Because moreover, in as much as cryptocurrency exist and new launched coins are going 10x to 100x within the first week or month of getting listed on an exchange, scammers will always use that as an opportunity to scam people that may be searching for such gem token/coin, and its left for us to be security conscience and not expose or connect our wallets to any site that promise to offer secret profitable coin gems too good to be true.",

This is just a recipe for disaster into scamming people as it seems genuine on its face but it is in fact fake.While this kind of technology may have its some uses, it has more disadvantages than advantages due to the impact that it can affect everyone. Imagine, you stumble upon an advertisement on Facebook and you saw the face of Bill Gates promoting some fake gambling platform. Of course to a veteran's eye, we would know that it is fake. But for someone who is relatively new to such space, they would instantly and most likely fell for such scam.",

The scammer may hire people who are experts in deep fake and they develop these fake videos in order to shill their scam coins. You are right that if we are careful and do not just trust everything blindly, we can be safe from these scams. However, the concerning thing is that too many scammers are active in the crypto world as they think it's easy to scam the crypto investors.",
