However, if you're not seeing it there, it's possible that there might be an issue with your device or your connection.One thing you could try is updating your Ledger device to the latest firmware version. Sometimes, updates can add new apps or fix issues with existing ones. I think, you try disconnecting and reconnecting your device to your computer, or even trying a different USB port.",

You could try posting on forums or social media platforms to see if anyone has experienced a similar issue. However, it's possible that the app may have been removed or replaced with a new version.",
