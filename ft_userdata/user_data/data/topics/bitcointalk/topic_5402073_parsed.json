  "content": "Yet again, Cardano (ADA) won by a landslide margin in a Twitter poll against Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The poll was conducted by London Real TV on Twitter on June 6, 2022.The Twitter poll simply asked people to vote for the coin they feel confident holding in this bear season. Out of 8,861 total votes casts, 76.9% of the respondents picked ADA. BTC got 11% votes, while ETH got only 5%.This represents the third time ADA would win in a major Twitter poll since January 2022.In a poll conducted last month by The_Bicoin_Express on Twitter, ADA won by 80.3% against Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Algorand (ALGO), which all had below 10% votes out of the 15,458 total votes cast.The largest poll so far was the one run by Vitalik Buterin in January 2022, the co-founder of the Ethereum Network, where over 600k people participated. ADA won against BTC there by 42%. BTC came second in the race by 38.4%ADA is the native token of Cardano, a proof-of-stake blockchain. According to TheCoinRepublic, Cardano is one of the most stable blockchain networks in the cryptocurrency industry. Its founder, Charles Hoskinson, also a co-founder of the ETH network, defined ADA as a solid, futuristic technology with a programming staff that places a premium on accuracy over speed.ADA is one of the top six cryptocurrencies, with a market cap of over $21 billion. It outperformed its peers in the last seven days, gaining above 6%, where BTC, ETH, and BNB all had negative values. At the time of writing, ADA trades at $0.6098.",

At the time of writing, ADA trades at $0.6098.Yes maybe it is well established when it comes to marketcap but think about it. Among other competitors its also lag behind those earlier L1 projects in terms of price discovery and market growth. Its like an alt project with a very stable movement like stocks. So I agree that its one of the stable alts in thr choices. Not gaining massively and not dumping too much too.",

The market price at ADA have fallen to the range of $0.45 from the price around $0.6 in a week's time. This is something around 25% drop. In the same period bitcoin and ethereum have experienced a much higher percentage of drop.",

Voting polls set up on Twitter are never enough reasons for you too base your decisions. Nevertheless, cardano is still a really good cryptocurrency for anyone that wants to invest in the alternate cryptocurrency market.But, the numbers on Twitter does not tell exactly what people are up to. If you really want to know what people are really into, then you should be checking the market capitalization, and also the most traded coins on exchanges. When you look at all this information you would see that the coins you think are on top are never really the ones that a lot of people are into.",

It might win in the poll, but in the market, right now ETH and BTC are losing their value more slowly than ADA. Twitter polls and surveys are as good as asking whether to invest in bitcoin or fiat in a forum which is about bitcoin. They are not reliable and neither are they an extrapolation of the general trend in the market but a niche group following a specific influencer/social media celebrity.What we all know is that ADA has a good community to back it, but that does not stand to what bitcoin and ethereum has already had. My choice duing a bear market does not vary with the name of the currency but what I was already holding for a longer period. Maybe I would be buying more but the base portfolio remains same. Who said that during a bear market you need to exchange all your assets to something else? Seems BS according to me.",

Only speculators pay attention to that, investors look at long-term value preservation opportunities and older timeframes. And in those categories ADA loses to bitcoin. If everyone was looking at how much an asset loses in a week, we would have popular assets that aren't even in the first thousand on coinmarketcap.",

Everyone suggested to invest in btc and next to it would be eth but it is surprising that ada still manage to won the competition secretly. There are comparisons about avax and ada but it can be obvious that ada is going to win on that one. I think the reason why ada won is because it more cheaper than the two giant coins.Ada also has its own fundamentals and that shouldn't be mentioned anymore as many people already knows that. As of now, btc is still declining. If this continues, more and more people are going to pick btc and btc could win this time.",

This has to be realized right? Like people know that twitter polls mean absolutely nothing. Let me put it this way, there was a nation wide poll in my country during last elections, about 600k people voted, which is lets face it a lot more than what these guys did, we are talking about 600 thousand people! Thats a lot, and it showed one candidate getting %53, and the other %35, we had literally exactly opposite of that in real elections, think about it, EXACTLY the opposite of that.
