Is this your country? You should explain properly so that we can share our thoughts or information. If you have the exchange site or app link then share with us so that experts can answer you.Anyway I will not suggest to use a local crypto exchange as they might scam you or steal your funds. You will also not get much features link popular worldwide exchanges and have not much liquidity too. They don't have good security concerns about their sites like Binance, Kucoin or DEXs. You can try these decentralized exchanges from https://kycnot.me or can use any reputated and ranked centralized exchanges for trading but leaving funds in them are not recommended.",

      "body": "I can't find anything with \"Nicaraguan_BitCoin\". How did you stumble upon this app cause it seems obscure AF and that's typically not a good sign... did someone PM'd you?or perhaps you meant \"Nicaragua_Bitcloud\"? because an appstore link showed up on my search - it's inaccessible by the way + tobitcloud has the \"bitcloud\" on one of their fake certificates.Code:https://apps.apple.com/ag/app/nicaragua-bitcloud/id1669626299If so, someone on reddit claims it's involved in pig-butchering/crypto romance scam. Gotta say, I'm not surprised.Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/13o57mn/scam_alert_nicaragua_bit_cloud/Scam alert Nicaragua bit cloudI met a woman who convinced me to trade with her. She said she was wealthy and her uncle was a wall street trader millionaire. When I didn’t want to put money in she deposited 3000 dollars in the Nicaragua bit cloud. We traded with guidance of her uncle wink wink and we won every single trade. She asked ok now do you understand how it works. She wanted me to wire $3000 of my own money. Because I was being apprehensive about wire, transferring money into the Nicaragua bit cloud account for trading with her. She began getting upset with me and calling me a liar, and just harassing me trying to make me feel bad all the techniques that a scammer will use. We stopped talking for a week. I went on the account and i wanted to try to withdraw some money, something was telling this was like a rigged poker machine. I knew if I did make a withdrawal it wouldn’t go through and I was right. All of a sudden. She texts me and says she got an alert from the site I was taking out money mind you from my account. Stay away from Anna and that site it’s a scam. People suck that’s all I can say. I can elaborate if anyone wants to reach out. Devil comes in sheep’s clothing or a nice dress.Quote from: JohnnyLA112 on July 11, 2023, 04:06:21 PMThanks, I am located in the U.S.  I do not keep currency on that app too long.

      "body": "@OP that app you've mentioned isn't familiar to most and the explanation that Potato has said is the perfect reason why many aren't aware of that. Sometimes, it's hard to think how people are ending up with these unknown platforms and you guys are just gullible to believe that these are all legitimate. And if you don't stumbled upon with that app, it's likely that you just want to give people an idea that this app is operating and trying to get some victims in here.",

A simple search on Google doesn't even show the app you're talking about. If it really was legitimate. The one of the possible things is it would be easily searchable and accessible by the common userThen there is this Google's cache of page I came across which has a close march with the Nicaragua Bitcoin APPlinkCode:https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:zSS2PqbA8jQJ:https://khupk.yujifactory.com/nicaragua-bitcoin-app/89533360&cd=23&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ug",

In addition, I think if it is a trading platform, it should have a website and you should now their website link too. Please could you share the trading platform link?If you get invitation from anyone to join a trading platform, you can check that platform is listed on big marketcap websites like Coinmarketcap or Coingecko.https://coinmarketcap.com/https://www.coingecko.com/If you don't find it on those marketcap websites, be more careful, it can be a red flag or that platform is very new to be trusted.",
