If you were not a Terra or UST owner, then do not participate in this ecosystem. There will still be a lot of negativity and speculation. I'm monitoring this situation because I had UST.The best thing to do now is to wait. LUNA/UST might recover soon but it will take time and I think that there might be a scenario where many investors before the attack might dump their LUNA if the value is within the range where they bought it at that time. My only question is why there is a massive dump going on right now of LUNA even though the snapshot is approaching. Maybe because the spot trading of LUNA/USDT or LUNA/BUSD will be terminated temporarily within these days.",

This huge failure shows that the team can't be trusted, you have to invest with one eye closed.For the ones that were invested in Luna this may make a difference as they will have a chance to get some money out of this, however for the rest of people like us that were fortunate enough to stay out of it this does not help us at all and if anything it is something that affect us directly, the debacle of Luna is being used as a model by some politicians about what it will happen to all cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, so this will without a doubt diminish the rate of adoption during the next months or even years.",

I still see it as a lie from Luna herself to investors. They have the project's hedge fund and what happened? Why can it be minted so irrationally? Obviously, they must bear the full responsibility for the mistake they made. Luckily for me personally, I didn't make any investments related to Luna, but I feel sad for those who lost money because of it.",

For how this new version of LUNA works, it seems that it is still not fully open to the public but we all hope that this detrimental thing does not happen again, there will not be the same gap in the new version that is our hope.",
