Btw this is a message and a warning for the rest of the world, the message is that Bitcoin is part of the modern financial system and it can't be abandoned or left without attention. Doesn't matter if any country wants it or doesn't want, they are forced to accept Bitcoin and keep their attention on it.Who could imagine a few years ago if we would see such a picture? Lots of interesting events are going to happen soon. Just get your popcorn and watch the show and hold some Bitcoins too.",

Russia has to find an alternative soon enough to counter this. I don't think Russia accepting cryptocurrency payments or allowing domestic bitcoin mining is intended to counter China's use of the yuan. The BRICS bloc has a common goal of reducing its dependence on the USD and then seeking to completely eliminate the USD from transactions within the bloc. And to do that, they need to have a common voice, join forces and agree with each other on the bloc's issues. Fighting and competing will not bring good results for the bloc and I think the co-founders of the bloc understand that better than anyone else. So I don't think Russia has that intention.",

Every one of them has an individual intention of joining the alliance. Maybe they do not have a single currency because China might be nursing the idea of making the Yuan the organisation's currency. Meanwhile, India and Russia might not be comfortable with the idea. China wants its currency to compete with the US dollar so it might not accept payments in Bitcoin. Maybe we have started seeing the effect of the publicity the US elections is giving to Bitcoin. Donald Trump sees Bitcoin as the future of money and he wants the US to to stockpile enough. There is also a bill in Congress that seeks to mandate the US government to buy some amount of Bitcoin periodically. Maybe Russia also wants to start its policy of hodling Bitcoin.",

This is a good news to Bitcoin community, which shows the adoption and open arms we've been glamoring for.President Putin's move are sometimes unpredictable, but i think he must have put some policies in place to checkmate electricity consumption by those who will be going into mining, because I think electricity consumption must have been part of the reasons why some government frowns towards mining.And again, are miners allowed to operate in any part of Russia freely without registration or licensed?, because I think some form of licensing might be imposed on those who want to open a large mining farm.Quote from: DeathAngel on August 09, 2024, 03:40:08 PMI don’t know how much this will affect us price but regardless, it's obviously good news.

Yeah, I sometime read about them being among the top three in electricity generation. which I think we might be seeing lots of mining farms. But, I am interested in knowing if the legalization gives miners free hand to do their thing, or maybe licensing and regulations are involved.Quote from: TheUltraElite on August 09, 2024, 03:16:28 PM, while India has no future plan to regulate crypto and has kept a hefty tax on crypto, China does not allow bitcoin use and is illegal there.India's action towards crypto is quite funny and same time disappointing. Though, I don't live there, but I know for sure that large number of their citizens gets themselves involve in crypto related matters as an alternative to surviving hardship. As for China, they've stand on their words on crypto, but some of us here will be looking forward to the day where they will be forced to make a U turn.",

I don't think it will affect the price because who in their right mind would start a mining business in Russia right now? This is a country of uncertainties that's currently at war. It's also sanctioned so there's no way companies from abroad will move in to invest in mining farms.
