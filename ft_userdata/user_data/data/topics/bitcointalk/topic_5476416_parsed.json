I even tried downgrading GCC to 11 but that appears to have the same problem. There's no package for the PI5 distro for earlier versions of GCC than 11. I've succesfully built CGMiner using GCC 10.2.1 on the PI3B and PI-Zero-2W and that is my main driver for my set-ups. While I can get the executable running on the PI5 it'd be nice to be able to build it there too.I'm wondering if I can build GCC 10 from source, but thats giving me a headache just thinking about it.Anyway, thanks for your help on this topic.",
