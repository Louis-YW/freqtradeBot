  "content": "This is the new M2 exchange baaed on Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The exchange allows investors to buy over 30 Verified Crypto Assets. This is gonna be big and their regulation is not inline with the US regulation. I can;t be sure if its open for everyone around the world but on what I have read on comments US citizen may not be able to register.Kevin Oleary posted this on his linkedin.https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kevinolearytv_abu-dhabis-m2-exchange-activity-7130216211488931840-UHZP/?trk=public_profile_share_viewIs this gonna be the next big exchange that will replace Binance as what Oleary claimed? What dyou think?",

What dyou think?Don't think too much about it. It's not uncommon for new businesses to have inflated claims as an attempt to improve their image or for clout.Right now, there is nothing much to see to support such claim. They're not bringing anything new on the table nor doing aggressive promotions. I also noticed, they have a mandatory KYC which ask for a lot, see: https://explore.m2.com/guide/how-to-sign-up-for-a-personal-account- when you could find many exchanges with lighter requirements.I think we also have to aknowledge how having a NO mandatory kyc at the start gives a huge boost to new exchanges when it comes to building userbase.",

It's always a bluff these days when we see such website or someone tells that with what they've found whether they're associated/affiliated with it or not. It's look like they're highlighting the earn/interest feature that they have. And the design, why it seems so very familiar and it looks like we've seen it somewhere like nexo, right?",

And so, when he presents something as if it's the biggest thing in the world, it has to be taken with a grain of salt. Based on its terms of service, yes, US residents are not allowed to use the platform.[1]I wonder where they would get the very generous yields they are offering to their users. Even USDT could give you up to 11.50% APY. This M2 exchange could indeed be one of the biggest, one of the biggest reminders not to trust centralized exchanges. It will only be a matter of when.
