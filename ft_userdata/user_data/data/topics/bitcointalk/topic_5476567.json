Only valuable thing any politician ever cried about, thank you Chuck!Welcome to Bitcoin bud. As SquirrelJulietGarden said Bitcoin is not crypto, most of crypto is scams, also known as \"shitcoins\"  Bitcoin is unique and changes the world like the internet did.And I'm no expert on anything, just an old member that popped in to see where it all started and your thread caught my eye. Only thing I can tell you as an \"expert\" on since I learned the hard way is, don't sell! Hodl, only mistake anyone ever has made with Bitcoin is selling. Cheers",

All types of activities are carried out without face to face.Op could be right at his post while i just tried to view his profile and he seems to be a Fellow Nigerian. Lemme break it down for you, at earlier 2019 there was no effect of Covid-19 in my country there were free movement and face to face talk and discussion while op progress, we have been hearing this lockdown rumor from China and other countries how so many dead case were recorded. So, late 2019 around December the rumor gets to our country Nigeria were they started recording some cases in ABJ and LAG, then early 2020 between February A first lockdown (Seat at home was introduced) in fact to crown it all, the year 2020 was almost spent in Lockdown due to covid-19 then people were just praying for life to leave. Then back to op, i know it's risky not to take risk why because when the world bitcoin first came to your knowledge you thought it was scammer but then you never knew anything about it maybe you never did any research before jumping into conclusion to classify it as scam or something else but thanks to those who came to your school to advance you people on how bitcoin works and how one can be financially free. I believe it was from this class you pick the courage to delve into bitcoin to discover and unveiled things you never knew before, and lastly you belong to the place where people talks about only bitcoin and I believe you still have long passage to walk through to be fully guided in terms of security and how you could make a successful investments without falling into scam. SquirrelJulietGarden did share some links to you please kindly make reference to those links and educate yourself the more, also do not forget to ask question whenever you seems to be lost or confused about some things though the forum is very large and i expected you to read widely without getting tired.",

One of the things I observed when bitcoin was still new people never hyped it the way other new projects were hyped and promoted but with time it was get more  recognition. Most early beginners of bitcoin had  a little doubt in bitcoin and I don't think anyone needs to be blame for this . I think when it is best to embrace things that are new it is  when their is a good understanding about. When the proper knowledge is their toward new innovations their won't be any regret going into it, it is good for people to accept and get engaged with bitcoin at the right time when their is good understanding about it.",

Before we got to know bitcoin, we never imagined that there would be crypto that could help us get benefits. But after we know that there is a cryptocurrency/bitcoin that can help us make money in the future by using it, it really opens up our horizons that we can make a profit from bitcoin.And if @OP now realizes the potential benefits he can get from investing in bitcoin, he should start to focus more on investing in bitcoin. Right now, he still has the opportunity to do so, especially since the price of bitcoin can still rise again, so he still has time to buy more bitcoin.",

My advice is that you shouldn't see Bitcoin as a full-time job because you need money to invest in it and you can engage in it as a passive endeavor. So go get a job and invest gradually from your earnings using the DCA strategy. The Bitcoin journey is a lifelong experience that is fruitful if you keep learning.",

You know, whenever these stories are told, we often forget that it wasn't a straight path. One of the best things that has ever happened to the world is Bitcoin, and it is easy to see because at first, they ignored it; then it started to get more support, and then they tried to shut it down. All other strategies have failed, and we are right now in the phase where they are trying to indirectly own and control it through their Bitcoin ETFs. And this is what makes it all the more exciting.Investing in Bitcoin is one thing; investing in learning about how to secure your bitcoins is another thing that you must take seriously because people lose their bitcoins more to the loss of their keys than to scammers and hackers.",

People who don’t truly understand the concept of bitcoin will always think it is fake. Few months before the introduction of bitcoin there was a Ponzi scheme that was introduced in my country and it scammed a lot of people that time, so when bitcoin was introduced people didn’t want to believe in it, they all assumed it was also a ponzi scam because they don’t want to scammed again not knowing they are missing out on a golden opportunity at that time.
