Quotehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_LeagueThe Kings League has a set of rules that have been created through a voting process conducted on social media platforms, where fans were given the opportunity to contribute and vote on the rules.These rules include a tie-breaker penalty shootout from the center of the field, the use of offsides, the allowance of handballs for throw-ins, unlimited substitutions, yellow cards resulting in a 2-minute exclusion, and red cards resulting in a 5-minute exclusion until a substitute can enter. The game starts with the ball in the center of the field and players starting from the back line, player numbers ranging from 0 to 99, games are divided into two 20-minute halves, and there is the inclusion of special \"secret weapons\" that each team can use once per game. These secret weapons include a penalty kick in their favor, a shootout in their favor, the exclusion of an opposing player for 2 minutes, a double goal for 2 minutes, a wildcard, and the ability to steal an opposing team's secret weapon card.Kings League teams have the possibility to invite one guest player (the \"12th Player\") each matchday.Yesterday it has been played the first final on Camp Nou of Barcelona.What did you think about this new game? Did you know any gambling site offering bet on it? Be ready for \"The Summer Split\". This summer season is set to begin on 7th May 2023.",

      "body": "It sounds like an exciting and unique approach to soccer, with rules created and voted on by fans through social media platforms. In addition, it seems to add some fun and excitement to the game, including special \"secret weapons\" and the allowance of handballs for throw-ins. As for gambling sites offering bets on the King's League, I don't exactly have any idea about it. However, some online sports betting sites may offer bets on the King's League, as they tend to cover various sports events and leagues.",

KINGS LEAGUE is a type of sport originating from Barcelona and for now it is still not popular among the sports industry because this type of sport has not spread widely to all corners of the world, especially KINGS LEAGUE was created more or less 1 year ago.This type of sport is like Futsal in the country where I live because it only uses a relatively small field, it's just that KINGS LEAGUE has ways and rules of the game that are far different from football in general.But it looks like this match is quite interesting to watch and at the same time can make us have more experience about all types of sports that exist.QuoteDid you know any gambling site offering bet on it? If I'm not mistaken, it seems that there are no gambling sites that offer bets on this type of sport, which is still relatively new and not widely known by the public out there.",

      "body": "The penalty shootout from the center of the field had me laughing. Other rules like the exclusions from yellow or red card looks adopted frm other sports but  little twist. The addition of a secret weapon made it look like an online game or probably something you could see from esports. I'm not even sure if I am going to follow and bet on their games but maybe something good to watch during the off-seasons.",

I read Wikipedia, these sport just founder on 2022 in Barcelona that's mean only the local people who know these sport.They chasing a sport who are getting recognize from not just one place, but around the world who know the spot to give them a good revenue. My suggestion, try to look on the local gambling especially landbase who want to provided these.",

      "body": "What's with this new football fad, the Kings League? \"What the heck is going on?\" has become a popular question recently. What, a shootout with penalties fought in the middle of the pitch? Offsides? Handball throw-ins? It's like they threw all the regulations into a blender and hit the \"mix\" button!What do you know, though? I find it mildly appealing. It's like watching a football game with no scoring and arbitrary regulations, a la \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" It's refreshing to see something new in an often routine sport.You may even place wagers on this wild new game at a few select online casinos if lady luck is on your side. Perhaps a double goal or a secret weapon card taken will result in a huge victory. It's like betting on a football game!",

This summer season is set to begin on 7th May 2023.After going through the link provided by the (op) on the thread, I found out its similar to the type of soccer game we played here in my locality although ours involves a 5 man team and we do call it 5 aside sometimes or we can call it monkey post game because of the size of the post  and so many other funny names but only those here can really relate to what am saying. The game is really fun and yes it even has same feature of penalty shout out when the both team tie in a match and the penalty is also played from the center of the pitch or in most occasion from each end of the goal post. In this game no goalkeeper is placed but a defender that stands back to guide the goal post is always there to cover up offensive attacks from the other team. The game is really nice to participate in and it's normally played out in the streets of city here in Africa and Nigeria to be very specific.",

Yeah, I think I can relate to this as I actually played the game yesterday with my friends as its very popular here in my place. The game is really fun and would have love to watch something like this play out in tv channels like supersport and the rest but for now I think it's still at its early stages and would take some time before this kings league will start gaining recognition. For now I think there is no casino or sport book  that carries this event  in their platform but over time I think it's going to gain ground and we will betting more on teams in this league as we do now in popular soccer leagues.",
