However, if just 10% of them paid, then that would be 122.2 months to make $44 billion, granted the subscriber base stays steady, and that's still not too bad, given how much they make in advertising & other revenue. The real number will be closer to 1-5% I'm willing to bet.",

Elon Musk is a genius.From $20 and then dropped to $8, and it is facing a lot of backlash from users. I think if he really applies that fee then people won't pay to stay, they're willing to quit this social network and find another. Social networking is not a monopoly, it is facing stiff competition and we have a lot of free social networks. Although twitter is the most popular social network, that does not mean it cannot be replaced.",

If everyone really wants to pay, it's clear what the op calculated will definitely happen, Elon Musk will easily get his capital back.but I don't believe it will be easy, that active users will want to pay. because the funds that will be issued by each active user are quite large and definitely not cheap.where on the other hand there are still many social media networks that are still free, although it must be admitted that Twitter is very popular because of its simplicity.there are always good and bad sides to every new implementation, but we will see in the future whether this will work as expected or there will be another mechanism.",

Formerly, verification does not require payment (https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63478854), it is more of an integrity thing. I think he should take it easy, at least twitter makes a lot of money in adverts. He should know that there are emerging social media platforms, so his quest to recover his money quickly can make people to change to other platforms which have the capability of impacting twitter negatively.",

I admit that would be funny as hell.Edit: And then there's the fact \"Elon Musk says Twitter has had ‘massive’ revenue drop as advertisers pause spending\". I an not sure how genius move this was.",

Elon Musk is a genius.It would be interesting to know how many of those verified users are staying with twitter and how many are leaving. I would guess though that the overwhelming majority will stay and then you are absolutely right with your statement that this was a great deal by Elon Musk if everything works out as planned. I think though that those verified users don't really have a choice here. I would guess that they make their money with twitter and therefore they need to be verified and there is no other platform that has the same reach as twitter. I know that mastodon is becoming a little bit more popular at the moment but it is still nowhere close to twitter.",

There are bunch of bots in twitter and it can't even be counted. There are some influencers dislike that idea to make twitter becomes a monthly subscribtion. They may also leaving twitter if such monetization will be implemented. that's pretty much the same like a monthly bill that came from twitter lol. Elon is not a genius but he was seeing an opportunity from what he has bought. I hope that bluesky that owned by dorsey may become a new solution for that. The fact that if that would be only 30% from total potential monetizable active users that will regularly paying for monthly subscription and that's profitable enough for elon. You pay money to get free of speech. Nothing is free. I rather call it as pay for speech.",

Many of the currently verified users belong to the mainstream progressist beautiful people who have already shared their negative feedback regards this feature. They had the blue seal as a conquest that could be achieved by few. For them it's a shame any common user can have the same seal they carry.On the other hand, the main trick here is that the monthly subscription can be paid by any scammer pretending to be a celebrity like they have already did before.The black market of verified accounts inside twitter already exists for a long time, now Musk is attempting to profit with this market as well, because many scammers will pay the 8$ in multiple accounts to execute their schemes. I expect the incidence of scams through sealed accounts to increase considerably after this monthly fee introduction.But who cares? The important is that Elon Musk is a smart guy and will hit ROI really fast!",

He's actually taking action as the new CEO of the said platform by firing thousands of its employees. According to the news, he's planning to replace the manpower with bots. Seems like he wants to decrease his ROI period. Verified users won't pay that amount just to continue using the platform. It will surely backfire on him because users can easily switch to another platform just to avoid charges.",

Brands, celebrities and influencers didn't hesitate to pay for this kind of service. Though it was a one time payment where the money is used for press release to meet the requirements of getting a twitter blue tick. Some used the blue tick to stand out while others utilized it for illicit businesses. Now Elon is charging 8 dollars per twitter verification to fight bots and people are complaining. I think influencers feel bad to have a twitter where anybody can get a blue tick. He wants to determine real members from bots using this method. Unless business men move ahead to purchase a subscription for their bots which will add more funds to Elon's bank account. However, He owns twitter and nobody should tell him how to do his business as it won't add up, he doesn't care.",

Secondly, there won't be enough people paying 8 bucks per month to keep that blue tick, it would be more like 50 million dollars a year at the very best guess.Also lets remember that ads were the only way of making money for twitter before this, and right now twitter is getting a huge damage to their ad income as well since Elon took over, its clear that people are disliking Elon more and more everyday, and many companies do not want to be assosiated with him.Just look at this;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588538640401018880",
