The university doesn't teach you how to start a business, they don't teach you how to become an entrepreneur! Although it is very important, I think! Therefore, no one will teach at the university how to use bitcoin correctly or which exchange is better to choose! Because no one needs it! But in general, as for cryptocurrencies, I agree that training in this area is necessary and very important, since not every beginner can immediately figure it out.",

Bitcoin is like any other technology, you can use it without knowing how it works academically.",

Because currently, we cannot find human resources who have thorough knowledge of Bitcoin easily. In big cities it may still be relevant, but even then if the government has a program that does refer to information and communication technology majors.Even though today knowledge of bitcoin is very important (especially among Bitcoin users who learn everything from scratch) they think that the knowledge taught in schools about Bitcoin is important. Unfortunately, so far we may be able to find the program in Nigeria and several other African countries. The idea also emerged based on the awareness of the Bitcoin community. Even in El Salvador, Bitcoin adopting country I have not found that there is a Bitcoin education program in their schools.",

Education system are prone to bias, especially the ones that are designed by the government itself. Recently, it looks that many countries are researching and planning to implement a CBDC, so if they incorporate bitcoin and design the curricula to suggest bitcoin as a superior form currency, it doesn't make any sense.",

However if you mean Bitcoin is used for investment, there's a subject about financial investment in general that can be found if you're taking economic and management degree. IMO it's better to teach Bitcoin as investment or the utility rather than the technical thing, because majority of Bitcoin adoption are because Bitcoin is used for investment.",

They have not yet entered specifically, but they have provided education through pamphlet seminar activities. In addition to the truth, what the friend talked about above is the basis of blockchain through computer operations they learn indirectly. Maybe outside my country there are blockchain experts who are at a university and have educational programs recognized by the government. But my country doesn't seem to be.

Right now consumerism is killing the world and the economy, people who can't afford things, make bad debt and work hard like slaves to pay them off, that can't sustain.",

I believe that in the coming future, bitcoin and blockchain technology will be included for learning in educational programs, but before that time bitcoins first have to jump the hurdle and get accepted/adopted first mainly, and then other things like this will follow. For the now we have to focus on individual contribution to assist young students, teachers and others to know about bitcoins and blockchain technology before the time where knowledge about bitcoins and blockchain becomes regular knowledge that everyone knows about.",
