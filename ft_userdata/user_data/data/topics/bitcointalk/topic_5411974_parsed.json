  "content": "Avalanche coin (AVAX) ranging between $69.08 and $37.13 at the resistance3 and resistance1 levels in the recent past, and then touched $11 support1 level and $19.71 support3 level.AVAX Coin Price Prediction 2022Irrespective of this sideways movement in the price of AVAX, we can deduce the following:AVAX coinâ€™s price is expected to reverse at the $37.13 resistance1 level, due to double top formation. In the event that investors get their way, it could surge higher above the resistance2 level.Resistance1 level reverse will lead to a further decline in the price of AVAX to the support2 level at $11 until a triple bottom is formed. This could lead to a bullish reversal.Nevertheless, we predict a bullish AVAX price prediction for 2022 as psychological resistances may be broken. We can expect Avalanche to reach $120 this year.",

Regardless of project, combined efforts every alts or major tokens would definitely reach or even surpass their previous ATH before.I am bullish on avax even though a lot of fud has been spreading about it. Anyway, in a bear scenario, building is one way to survive. Thats why I like avalanche cause they keep building ans never stop improving. One of my major hold and most likely my biggest bag.",
