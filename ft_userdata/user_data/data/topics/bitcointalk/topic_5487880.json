Some people are withdrawing to their noncustodial wallet to keep their bitcoin in their control, as the halving is close and the value of bitcoin is increasing , because it is expected that the halving will also skyrocket the price of bitcoin.No matter how many bitcoin is sold per day, that will not stop bitcoin price from pumping, because it will only last for a short term. We saw after ETF was approved, and Mt. Gox sold a lot of bitcoin, but what happened later here we are in 65k, and the price reached 69k,before falling back to this price. We are in the bull market, and it will continue to be bullish, because bitcoin is designed that way. Bear and Bull",

What will make an asset's price more stable is mostly more market participants.Yes, this is the basic economics. The coins are limited in numbers. That is the price of the coin increases when more people buy the coins. Now once the price goes up, many people start selling the coins. Hence the price goes down and we see a correction in the price. This circle goes on like this and itâ€™s pretty common I must say. Long term holders always wait for opportunities like this, and they make good profits from it.",

And to many believe that even if we reach the ATH there's still a chance that we can see it to reach at $100,000. But if you are not confident and still afraid then do what you think can give you a peace of mind and execute your withdrawal.Maybe you need to see something and experience it so that you can increase your patience to wait for something good to happen. Although all of it will just be a gamble but for sure all of waiting game especially for those long time holders patience will be worth it.",

Funding rates soar because of their leveraged positions and funding rates were reset with corrections.Overzealous people with their high leverages were liquidated by exchanges. Now after the correction, the market is more healthy and I really believe it is ready to go sideway for a while before rising again.You can not stop people to use leverages so they will be liquidated again and help the market to have healthy corrections again.",

You should actually be thankful for them because if they're doing this right now, it's probably high time to prepare for something big to happen. Also these people don't really mind withdrawing huge amounts of bitcoin to take profit because most of these people are probably rich enough that they don't mind missing out on potentially bigger profits if they just hodl out a bit longer.",

Many people who long the market have lost millions, I read online that a massive 1 billion dollars was lost when traders expected bitcoin to go past 68k days ago and it went down unexpectedly, do not let all these be a distraction for you.",

Since the price automatically starts experiencing a dip after every massive withdrawal.Don't expect the market to move straight up without any correction. If you are old in BitcoinBTC, you would have known that bitcoinBTC always takes a nice reasonable correction before moving another leg up. This is true in both bull and bear markets. In the bear market when the price is moving down, it does not dip in a straight line, rather it will keep touching every resistance before moving further down. If you know the concept of higher highs and higher lows, then I am sure you will understand how to read the market.Also, there are not only long term investors in the market but there are short to mid term traders too who will surely take profits at the current top and will buy back at the bottom. The market's pump and dump is normal however if there is any bad news, like any big exchange hack or something, then we may see a big price correction which may indicate a reversal in the market.Quote from: Despairo on March 07, 2024, 07:45:29 AMYeah, then what? do you really hold Bitcoin until you die and never sell any single satoshi? you can show your address here to prove me wrong.I keep accumulate Bitcoin, hold and haven't sell it even Bitcoin already reach $69K, but it doesn't mean I won't sell my coins when Bitcoin cross $100K, $200K etc. There will be a time I sell my coins in order to accumulate more coins during bear season or I need big cash on emergency needs.For sure people will take profits along the way. Also, people are anticipating sell from certain key level and they place the short orders in advance. I think the OP needs to understand trading better in order to understand the movement of the bitcoinBTC.",

Since the price automatically starts experiencing a dip after every massive withdrawal.You already have the answer in your question. Why did so many people sell bitcoin when bitcoin reached $48k and then caused bitcoin to drop to $38k, but why was bitcoin able to reach $69k so people kept dumping to let bitcoin go down again? In just a short time bitcoin has increased from 48k$ to 69k$, doesn't that prove that bitcoin is rising? What else do you want from bitcoin? Want bitcoin to go from $69K to $1M without any drop or dumping?",

Since the price automatically starts experiencing a dip after every massive withdrawal.Itâ€™s pretty nomal that many will sell their holdings of the price skyrocketing because itâ€™s the perfect timing to take profit. Iâ€™m not sure how you do your trade but you should do the same if you purchased on the bottom and already profited a lot. Price will not continuously to rise since thereâ€™s always a trader that purchase on the bottom of the current price. Those new investors that will enter on the current price will do the same if the price grow in the future above the current price. This is the normal cycle of trading. You should worry more if thereâ€™s no one selling even on price rally for a long time because it will form a bubble that will later on destroy the price once popped due to everyone take profit at the same time. Do what you suggest if you just recently purchased and want to hold long term but this is not applicable to everyone especially those who are already in profit a lot.",

Of course, a lot of people want to cash out their profits, and then some people just join the selling wave out of panic. The ETF example, however, doesn't have much to do with it. The SEC approved ETFs in the middle of January. The price was around $45k-$46k in the first half of January, and then gradually dropped to $40k closer to the end of January before starting to climb back up. The price didn't skyrocket, and some selling happened, but Bitcoin recovered soon.The price is currently almost $67k, so we can't reasonably be talking about a massive withdrawal or a massive selling at this point, in my opinion. There's no automatic withdrawal, there are just some corrections along the way.",

It's for everyone to decide whether they want to sell or not and that can't be stopped when people wanting to sell what they are up to by that time. Just expect that at any price range of Bitcoin, there's always people that will massively sell their bitcoins and expect even the dormant accounts that has hundreds to thousands of bitcoins that have been held for a long time might also get into withdrawals and will eventually get sold. What you're worrying about is with these withdrawals and sell offs in the market when it's normal on any market to have these actions. You, as an individual of this market will also have to sell whenever it is necessary for you to do so and yet, other people aren't worried about you and us trying to sell when we need to do it.",
