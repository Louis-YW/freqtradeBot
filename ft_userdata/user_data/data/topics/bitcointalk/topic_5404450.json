EG when you use the backup wallet feature. if it backs it up as a file then that file contains all the keys for all the addresses it has created.if the wallet backs up using a seed (a password of 12-24 words) it uses that seed phrase to create the addresses where all the addresses are made from that seed phase as the key",

I don't think I have to use it to check my wallet. That website is used when I need to check address and wallet of others. Honestly, I don't use it but forum members share it and I re-share it to others.Third party sites can track your data and they can sell it to other third-parties. It is the same when you use blockchain explorers to check your transactions, addresses. You should use it with Tor connection.",

First check your wallet and see is the balance is still showing and if yes then look for the address where it stored then try that address on the explorer to see if its showing balance or zero. It shouldn't show zero when the address has balance if its still showing it then try using different blockchain explorer.",
