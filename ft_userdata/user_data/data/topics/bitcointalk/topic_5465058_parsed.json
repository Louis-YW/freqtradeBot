  "content": "The nonfarm payroll (NFP) report is a key economic indicator for the United States and represents the total number of paid workers in the U.S. excluding those employed by farms, the federal government, private households, and nonprofit organizations.The nonfarm payroll report consistently causes one of the largest rate movements of any news announcement in the foreign exchange (forex) market. As a result, many analysts, traders, funds, investors, and speculators anticipate the NFP number and the impact that it will have on forex.The NFP report is typically released on the first Friday of each month, providing the total monthly increase or decrease in paid U.S. workers across most businesses. Increasing numbers may show economic expansion but may also give investors reason to be concerned about inflation and decreasing numbers suggest a broader economic concern.BrokersView.com - FIND THE BEST ONLINE BROKER FOR YOU",

      "body": "NFP is indeed high-impact news that causes huge market volatility and which drives the market within a specific time. As a trader, I basically stay away from the market if we are expecting such reports and if I'm currently holding a position in the market,  what I normally do is exit all my positions, secure some profit, or either set breakeven and a tight stop lose, And wait to trade in the direction of the report. If the report is positive it makes the US dollars become stronger while a negative report weakens the US dollar.",

      "body": "If we know how to get our profits from the market, the NFP is a better time for us to make good profits from the market only if we know how to position our traders will buy it sell limit. This will enable us to sell it the report of the news is opposite the previous part months which could make the market to spike to the bearish direction. Good and experience traders do make crazy profits from the news because there is always different speculations about what will be the outcome of the actual previous month. There are good money that cam be made from NFP if we are very good and market speculation and analysis.",
