  "content": "Hello, friend of mine configured Coinbase Wallet (the self custody app) on his Android wallet in 2021.Then he got a new phone and did not restore the wallet there yet. Now in 2023 he asked me if I can restore it and I wanted to restore from his old phone (he doesn't have the seed phrase).App is showing \"Authentication Failed\" and a button to sign out ( I didn't sign out ) , his Coinbase Wallet app was outdated so we updated it through Google Play but still he gets the same message.We also tried clearing cache for the app but it doesn't work.Is there any way to recover from this error without deleting App data? I guess the private key is still on his phone in the app data but as said the wallet app throws \"Authentication Failed\" and you can only retry or sign out.(https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~mmannan/publications/Horus-SecureComm2021.pdf) Please help, don't tell me he needs the seed phrase as he doesn't have it but he has the phone and app with the seed data stored on android and we need to find a way to extract it.I'll try to backup the app data before doing anything, hopefully it can be done as his phone is not rooted and afaik it's hard to backup app data without root. He is on Huawei Android 12 (EMUI 12).Thanks",

They just said if you lost your seed you're on your own. I tried asking to escalate the ticket to an engineer for the Android app and now waiting.We checked permissions for the app and gave all the permissions but that didn't help.I think my friend used Face ID or fingerprint for login to the app, but it doesn't even let him authenticate, it just says Authentication Failed.I read other posts about people resetting Face ID and then unable to login to the app so I won't touch Face ID or fingerprint settings yet.",

Problem with rooting is it can wipe off the very data you need or brick the phoneAlso, I must warn you about Huawei Android back up using their Hi suite. I don't think it does the job well. I lost a lot of data sometime back when I backed up using the app and factory rest my phone. On trying to restore my data, most of my important files were missing.",
