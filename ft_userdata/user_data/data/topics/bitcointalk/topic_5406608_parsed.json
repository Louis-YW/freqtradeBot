Shoul i buy used or i should go with buy brand news cards and whole gpu rig setup?Best RegardsGetting a rig with 9 cards and even the better version with 3 fans compared to the 2 fans one,which means less heat and less problems,together with near 550 Mhsh in total hashrate I would definitely buy it for 4300 USD.Of course after testing it for one day to check for any anomalies that this board has,it looks quite cheap to me,despite the fact that the prices of video cards have gone down during the last couple of weeks.If it has no anomalies then I would suggest to get it and put it running right away.You have to ask the seller to give you one day testing and if everything look good go ahead and get it.I have a 2 fans 3060 ti running from almost 1.5 years and is one of the stablest card I have ever had,0 problems from day one up until now.",
