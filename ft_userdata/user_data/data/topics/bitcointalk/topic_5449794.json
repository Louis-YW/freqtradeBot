Someone that believe in commercial bank and not able to have little amount of money on an online bank can not have the knowledge and mind to hold bitcoin on a noncustodial wallet.",

Online banks brings conveniences to crypto users in Nigeria.I also share in your reasoning that ignorance is one of the key factors hindering bitcoin adoption in Nigeria. The other thing is the inclination to traditional monetary policies, average Nigerians do not believe in anything that lacks government control. They believe everything done through the internet is a scam and this hasn’t helped the bitcoin situation, coupled the fact that bitcoin is ROI they see it bin taken down sooner or later. Even this Opay story by OP have seen many individuals that also don’t trust it before it was licensed by NDIC. Even if bitcoin is to come to Nigeria Today without it under government regulation there are some that will still avoid it. Look at the case of centralized exchanges, many people still use it and save funds there because they just want to have someone to blame when something goes wrong. They don’t want to take responsibility of things by themselves or are scared of trying out new things, such is the case of this woman",

I get am correctly abi una get another point of view wey I fit reason am from?First of all no blame them, many people suffer something from ponzi schemes era wey finish people savings and na since dem people begin lose trust for anything wey be online and no get physical location. No forget plenty people still dey see Bitcoin as ponzi scheme or anything wey no get physical shops as ponzi so e go hard for them to trust am and you no lie na one of the reasons e go hard us to adopt Bitcoin without the approval of the government he dat. Since government no give Bitcoin a go ahead, people go still dey see am as the ponzi wey dem been dun label am before.Also na the price volatility dey fear people too, for the fact say you fit get 1 million today and when next you check your account, na 100k dey there dey fear people pass say you fit turn your 100k to 1M anytime wey bull market dey. People still get the mentality say Bitcoin need people to they come into the industry like downline for the price to continue to go up. Them think say na dat kind business wey need new users so they old users can sell to the new ones like pump and dump schemes, people still dey think say na so Bitcoin be.Many misunderstanding dey contribute and you no go blame people because Nigerians dun see shege for this online businesses hands. Governments just adopting Bitcoin no go do, alot of enlightenment needs to be dun before our older people go begin dey believe in Bitcoin, youths sha no get problem.",

Mind you say na lack of knowledge they make people talk something like this about OPAY, if you get issues via your commercial bank and you go bank go complain, abeg no be form you go fill, dem go come tell your how many working days dem go take resolve your issue, you go come go house.OPAY don make things easy for people, yet dem no want am, if you get any issues with OPAY, you go just enter for your app go lay complaint, if e dey necessary customer support go give you form online make you fill, and dem go still tell you how many working days dem go take solve your issue. If you call dem for phone dem go still answer you and provide solution to your problems, so abeg tell me how e take dey different from commercial banks. Naija people seem to forget say OPAY dey registered under the CBN and they are a licensed company, so dem no fit loseguard your money. Bitcoin dey different from the two of them because on how you lose am ehn, e don be for you oh, hardly any remedy dey.",

Some online Ponzi schemes don come even after bitcoin and dem no dey exist now again. But bitcoin still remains and have not being susceptible to scam investment in any way. All we need na correct dissemination of information to the public about bitcoin and tell them how oda cryptocurrencies can’t be dependent on like bitcoin even if they show high ROI in a short time period as a way of luring people into investing in them.",
