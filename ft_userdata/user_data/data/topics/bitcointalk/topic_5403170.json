  "content": "Hello everyone! How are you? Today I come with a question about RBTC (RSK Blockchain). Looking for better options to the traditional BTC, I couldn't help but find RSK Blockchain. This is a BTC sidechain that leverages Bitcoin miners on a blockchain similar to ETH. Becoming the second most decentralized blockchain on the market and therefore secure. As this sidechain uses BTC miners, could RBTC (main crypto) be considered the best version of BTC out there? Let's keep in mind that this sidechain allows smartcontract, it has never been hacked and its bridge has never been breached either. Clearly it is better than any WBTC on ETH or other blockchain. What do you think?",

      "body": "hi there Roquefort!I belive on BTC Â´cos i discorvered RBTC on RSK. Helps bitcoin to get smarter by appliying smart functionality to the contracts. the key here is RBTC, that let me acces to excellents projects like BLINDEX, great partner of RSK Network! WBTC is more centraliced, so my best choice is RBTC over WBTC for sure.Wrapping BTC to send to Ethereum is throwing your money away. I've seen awesome returns on Sovryn without being overcharged for gas fees on Ethereum. Also now the top DeFi projects where I used WBTC support RSK now anyway. Like MakerDAO. And Uniswap has an RSK fork, RSKSwap",
