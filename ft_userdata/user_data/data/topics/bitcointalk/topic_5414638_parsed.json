  "content": "QuoteArgentina’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate Thursday in a bid to prop up its currency and curb inflation nearing 100%.The central bank boosted its benchmark Leliq rate by 5.5 percentage points to 75%, according to an emailed statement. The move comes a day after data showed consumer prices jumped nearly 79% a year in August, the fastest pace in 30 years. It was the bank’s ninth rate hike this year.The bank’s board of directors also added in the statement that it intends to reduce the level of short-term debt held by the central bank next year, but didn’t provide more specifics.Earlier this week, central bank President Miguel Pesce and Economy Minister Sergio Massa affirmed, in a meeting with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva their commitment to implement the country’s $44 billion deal with the IMF. A key element of the accord includes keeping interest rates above the rate of inflation.What Bloomberg Economics Says“The new rate hike catches up with the rise in current and expected inflation — but may not be sufficient to tame inflation or boost reserves. The substantial uncertainty on inflation and the persistent risk that the peso may soon see a sharper depreciation undermine the ability of the new rate to convince households to save or investors to have a position in pesos.”—Adriana Dupita, Latin America economistEconomists surveyed by the central bank forecast inflation will accelerate to 95% by the end of the year.Central banks across Latin America have raised rates this year to combat high inflation, but prices have continued to stay hot as high levels of all-cash workers and businesses make monetary policy less effective than in developed economies. Argentina’s central bank made incremental rate increases early in the year but over the past three months has ramped up its hikes, with a combined 23 percentage point increase since July.Pesce and Massa face added pressure after they allowed a devalued exchange rate for the month of September for producers of soy — the nation’s biggest export — in a bid to replenish the country’s dwindling international reserves.The central bank has been propping up the official peso rate, currently at 143 per dollar. The blue-chip swap rate, an implied exchange-rate based on the difference in prices between Argentine stocks and their American depositary receipts, stands at 297 per dollar.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/argentina-hike-interest-rates-75-200117136.html....Here we see an interesting approach to inflation:QuoteEarlier this week, central bank President Miguel Pesce and Economy Minister Sergio Massa affirmed, in a meeting with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva their commitment to implement the country’s $44 billion deal with the IMF. A key element of the accord includes keeping interest rates above the rate of inflation.When I read things like this, I always wonder if these policies will eventually wash up on american shores. Banks lose money on loans with lower rates than inflation. Hiking rates higher than inflation, could eventually become necessary to the survival of the banking industry. This is a point I have not seen anyone addressing. Our level of discussion on these topics appears to be somewhat lacking in depth. There could be a desperate need for content that covers these points and some of the basics. If it can be written in a way that is easy to understand and helps people to feel better about reading and learning. I see the question being posed: how bad will the american inflation get? On a level between argentina or the zimbabwe dollar, its anyone's guess.",

On a level between argentina or the zimbabwe dollar, its anyone's guess.I don't think we can compare the inflation in Argentina with USA. 100% inflation in a year is insane and while increasing the interest rate is necessary I don't think this is going to do much. USA is at the start of rising inflation periods and reacted very aggressively to fight inflation. You can see the difference between Europe and USA, with ECB being very cautious and afraid of interest rate hikes. The US Dollar is now on its 20 year high compared to the Euro. The strong currency means that imports are less expensive for Americans and inflation should fall. A more interesting comparison for Argentina would be Turkey, their inflation is at 80% at the moment, but they are not increasing interest rates. Turkey is being unconventional and lowers their interest rate instead. It would be nice to see which country gets their inflation under control better.",

      "body": "I will focus on the question how bad is US Inflation? and whether America can approach a crisis like Argentina or Zimbabwe. Let's trace from the beginning where this point will lead. An increase in interest rates is an action taken to counter rising inflation. In general, that's what the US does because of its economic concept that focuses on the essence of the dollar.Can we link the US crisis to Russia actions against Ukraine? Of course, because I see it as the start of an economy being beaten by Russia that really wants to beat the US and sees it bowed. Quoted from local news referring to the statement Chief Economist at Comerica Bank Bill Adams:\"Inflation remains high in the United States, reflecting global food and energy shortages caused by the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, resulting in high domestic prices for housing, rent, and medical care.\"Don't think it's all unrelated, and don't think Russia didn't plan this in the first place.Will this inflation bring America to the brink of recession?It probably won't be that fast, as there's still around 2.3% growth at the end of the year which keeps the US a bit on the defensive. Even after that, I don't know for sure. About the US going into a deeper chasm like Argentina or Zimbabwe. Oh imagine if that happens, the bad impact will be felt by all countries that have entrusted their economy to the US Dollar. Everything is a mess and well the global crisis depends on how the US handles all these tests. If so, who stands? The answer is that Russia and its allies Russia didn't plan this parliament from the start.Go deeper before Russia deals a blow to the US, namely the Pandemic. Do you think when we see all countries experiencing a clean crisis is just a disaster? What if you look at it from a different point of view? Where did the covid 19 pandemic start? and which country was the first to announce globally to the world that they were free of Covid 19? Chinese isn't it? but look at the impact, other countries are even involved in continuing to carry out such a long lockdown driven by data from hospitals. What if the data has in fact been bribed so that the pharmaceutical industry runs on target in the market? Mainstream media process it all so that we swallow the news that is released.",

If you look at historic charts, inflation has been a big problem in Argentina for a long time. It's not a strong economy, and the currency is especially weak, unfortunately. The US is a very strong economy, the USD is in high demand, and while it does lose more value than usual, it's very far from the case of Argentina. The IMF requirement is put in place to ensure that they don't lose because of the inflation, which IMO makes perfect sense and should work. I don't see how that would hurt the USA.",

Just recently my local currency Naira just went down and it's now $1 for 719 Naira (my local currency) and yet no measures has been taking in tackling this situation.

No one will borrow with such huge amount of interest, and that could lessen the money in circulation which can help to at least lower the inflation rate. This will be a long term problem for Argentina, I hope they can survive on this. With regards to relation of this to US, I think USA is already doing their best to avoid on the same situation, imagine inflation rate lower than 10% and yet they are increasing the interest rate aggressively, I’m pretty sure they can lower the inflation in just a year.",

However, a 5.5 percentage point increase in the benchmark interest rate is a very aggressive move that may not be sustainable in the long run. Additionally, the central bank's decision to reduce the level of short-term debt held by the central bank next year could further destabilize the economy if not done carefully.Anyways, they are used to it lol",

I have met a few Argentines and they all talk shit about the various governments there, although considering that they had to leave the country to make a living, if we were to ask someone who lives there, maybe the opinion would be different.What is clear is that by a multitude of indicators, if Argentina is not a failed state, it is very close. It is not just inflation, but economic policies in general that have been in place for a long time. We have to bear in mind that just over a century ago it was the richest country on earth where many Spaniards emigrated:'Argentina began the 20th century as one of the wealthiest places on the planet.
