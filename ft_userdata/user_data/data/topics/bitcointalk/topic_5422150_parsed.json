  "content": "The Caribbean country of St.Kitts and Nevis held a conference on the use of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as a legal tender for payment in their country in March 2023.Quotehe Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis may declare Bitcoin Cash BCH legal tender by March 2023. Prime Minister Terrance Drew made that announcement while he spoke at the Bitcoin Cash 2022 conference in St. Kitts on Nov. 12.St. Kitts and Nevis is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank and part of the ECCB’s DCash central bank digital currency (CBDC) program, which was launched in March 2019. “Our nation has always been a forward-thinking nation and a leader in exploring new technologies that can advance our people,” Drew said, but he added:“I can confirm that we are prepared to explore that possibility with the guidance of experts and professionals and after consultation with our regional banking system. […] I welcome the opportunity to dialog further with a view to exploring future opportunities to engage in Bitcoin Cash mining and making Bitcoin Cash legal tender here in St. Kitts and Nevis by March 2023, once safeguards to our country and our people are guaranteed.”Bitcoin Cash was created from Bitcoin in a 2017 fork. The DCash program has had technical problems that have impeded adoption. Besides introducing new competition to DCash, the Caribbean nation may be eyeing its replacement. Sint Maarten Member of Parliament Rolando Brison spoke after Drew and expressed his support for Bitcoin Cash and his opposition to a CBDC.Brison opposed CBDC as “too much of a danger to consider.” He said:“I love the fact that in our jurisdiction, the central bank has at least been open enough to say and admit, ‘We don’t have the capability to monitor and engage and promote and safeguard something like this.’ […] If they can’t properly regulate the banking sector, […] why would I give them now a huge mandate to do something that they have no idea about? […] The legislator should be the one to have a say on what happens in regulation.”https://cointelegraph.com/news/caribbean-nation-st-kitts-nevis-may-adopt-bitcoin-cash-as-legal-tender-by-march-2023https://coinmarketcap.com/id/currencies/bitcoin-cash/Saint Kitts and Nevis is a country in the Leeward Islands, Caribbean. with a population of 53,546 people (data for 2021). You could say this is the smallest country in America. The government's decision of St. Kitts and Nevis to make BCH the legal tender for payments in the country would be bullish news for the future of Bitcoin. In my opinion, the more countries that legalize the use of Cryptocurrency as a transaction tool, the brighter the future of BTC will be.Buy BTC now and HODLWatch conference eventshttps://youtu.be/1W0-N_0K6jQ",

Even though it's true that you don't think it will have a big impact on bitcoin at the moment, if the use of BCH isn't going well in that country, maybe you can find an alternative that is easier, safer, more comfortable in transactions.Ultimately Bitcoin will be the solution",

It has a small population, but if majority will try to invest on BTC and other crypto, it could be a win win for us. Global adoption is another question though, it might take long and slow process for the world to see how BTC and others are going to benefit every government. On the other hand, CBDC has been growing as well in the last couple of years.",

In El Salvador, the president believes on bitcoin and I guess this will be the same for other countries who have their own belief and favorite cryptos to adopt as a legal tender.",

They held a conference, and for all we know they already know the difference between BTC and BCH. Also, I don't think most of them will be using the said crypto in all of their transactions. They'd most probably still stick with their local currency or USD. Legalizing a crypto for payment purposes doesn't always equate to the nation upping their payments system overnight. Those are two completely different things.",

Roger Ver might've made some deal with the country. Trying all the ways to keep it on the top as a competitor to bitcoin as it failed to prove as the original bitcoin during the 2017 hardfork. Following this different countries will consider different cryptocurrencies as the legal tender which doesn't look like a healthy way of adoption.",

BCH is just a shitcoin that many newbie buy because the price is cheaper than Bitcoin and it's the biggest Bitcoin fork, actually it doesn't worth to invest since sooner or later Roger Ver will disappeared and run away with investors money.",
