If am not mistaken na around December/January wey d federal government d harmer much about the census matter, sae em go happen around March this year, which made the Nigeria census commission organize trainees nationwide for Nigerians wey go like partake in the census counting. I was among the selected Nigerians from my locality that went for the training(it lasted for a week).  After that we had another training, that one be sae, we did it through online. Since then(January/February)till now, no news wey peso don hear concerning the census mata. Everything just d pending base on wetin d happen for the country via the presidential election. I think sae nah when the presidential election mata go end, na when the federal government go fit reason to conduct the census. Back to your question.1. I can't sae much about the last census wey happen base on sae peso never to know  much then. Wetin census people na minor question of how many we d family, we answer them and the record go. But as for census wey d come, this one go d much different pass the previous ones wey d happen. Everything will transmitted digitally and the location also. There won't be anything like woroworo. 2. This year's census go run electronically. Gadget have been provided for it. As the census is been carried out, naso it's been recorded electronically plus the location. After the days census counting it will be uploaded to census server for documentation by each zonal coordinators of each states.",

Dem talk say by 2050 we fit get like 600 million people, even reach one billion by 2100. E no dey possible to get that population why because we no dey also include the death rate as well, anytime you include death rate you go see say the multiplication or make I say population ratio fit just increased by 0.9 percent reason being that everyday people dey die and everyday people gives birth, if you watch in between this numbers you would know that the population doesn't increase that much and also take a look at people who are under the age bracket of 80 years - 100 years they are about 20 percent or lesser of Nigerian population and their death is unpredictable and unannounced, have you also include accident rate across the country? This could be air, water, road and everyday there is always an incident rate this is includes ( fighting, house burning, or death during labors) so where do you think our populations could get this higher by 2050 which is just 27 years from? then add it up to people in age 60 currently and see what their age could give you by then, is either some of them could be dead by then, also add this same 27 years to your age currently and see how old you could be by then and why do you think we would have such number of population by 2050.What you would know is that the more people are coming the more they are also going so, that population changes might not be at least 30% as I believe if is that much then there is no place for people to come stay.",

See as dem dey talk about Nigeria population for future. our politicians now doesn't need any thing like census because what they wanted is the one that benefits them and their families nobody is care to know the population size of nigeria and also know how the massive is been suffering, the thing is that we can't depend or rely on politicians Quote from: Agbamoni on August 26, 2023, 12:21:20 AM Dem talk say by 2050 we fit get like 600 million people, even reach one billion by 2100. Me I jus dey find am funny small.The national population who take care of census doesn't give accurate numbers of people in nigeria, some one told me that they use nigeria census to play politics, they don't give the figures of a particular region complete like other region so that during allocation of local government more state will be beneficiary to one than another one. That is why they don't know the total population is in nigeria, so we can have such population but national population that is in charge of census will not know because of corruption.Quote from: Agbamoni on August 26, 2023, 12:21:20 AM Based on wetin I don see since I dey Naija, dem neva do correct count for people wey dey here as long as I don dey.

This time around, government don plan to do am with digital style. Dem go use new technology wey go help make am correct, just like how dem take do the election wey plenty people believe say na the election wey plenty people participate pass for history. the last census I witnessed that should be 2004 thereafter, they selected the people they calculated in their census and again I notice that this people knows what they are doing, and they Bring up census when ever they seen that election is coming close, but since we have voters card it's not supposed to have conduct another census and if we use the biometric of voters card we can know the total number of nigeria because this previous presidential election almost every Nigerian participated because they needed a revolution Quote from: Agbamoni on August 26, 2023, 12:21:20 AMreally dey make person think, you no see?
