  "content": "I've been hodling in a Ledger wallet. With Ledger's reputation going down the drain after introducing the controversial recovery feature, I planned on moving to Trezor. I procrastinated for a while. Lately, I found out I can't anymore sign from my hardware device because of screen issues. That's the deadline! Finally, I need to act.My Trezor hasn't arrived yet. But even if I have one ready, I still won't use it to recover my wallet. I'm generating new keys with that one. Now, I'm confused how to move my funds. Surely, however, I won't enter my backup on anything except on another hardware device. Luckily, I have a KeepKey lying around for years. I'm planning to use it for the recovery. When my Trezor arrives, I'll be sending all my funds to that new wallet. Am I good to go with this plan? Am I doing this right? Or am I committing an unsafe step with my KeepKey recovery plan?Thanks in advance!",

He posted already that he wants to generate new seed phrase on Trezor, which is good. But if he is not sure of the derivation path, I think he can use airgapped wallet to send the coins to KeepKey.

There's no issue in your \"Keepkey method\".But in case you've used a script type in Ledger that KeepKey doesn't support, your best choice would be offline Bitcoin Core.It can import your \"Master Private Key\" inside descriptors which represents each of your Ledger accounts.To spend, you can either create an online Bitcoin Core with watch only wallet containing the public descriptor versions of the ones you've imported to your offline Bitcoin Core wallet.Or import the addresses or extended public keys to an SPV wallet that supports such import.I'll try to provide instructions if you decided to do this.Or refer to these to try if you can figure it out yourself:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md#exampleshttps://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/27.0.0/rpc/wallet/importdescriptors/https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/27.0.0/rpc/wallet/listdescriptors/",

Hardware wallet is your best choice if in the waiting time of your Trezor wallet, you can move your fund to a multisig wallet and wait for your Trezor wallet to move your fund to a hardware wallet for final storage there.It's not too complicated and multisig wallet is safer than single signature wallet. If you create it in an offline device, it can help more in security. I know risk of non hardware wallets and understand your concern.Creating a multisig wallet with Electrum wallet.I believe that importing Ledger to Trezor is not good choice too. When you have your Trezor wallet, you need to move your fund from a wallet in Ledger to your new wallet with Trezor.Then, it's not big deal to move your fund to an Electrum multisig wallet and move it next to your Trezor. I will do it with different round, and not make a single transaction to move all my fund.",

That's great news then, Ledger's \"accounts\" works the same as Keepkey,Both use the standard; succeeding accounts are derived by incrementing the \"account_index\" of the selected script type's standard derivation path.Keepkey may not automatically generate your second and third accounts.But you can easily re-create those in the client's account tab.Quote from: Darker45The only thing that's stopping me from proceeding further is that Microsoft Defender SmartScreen has flagged the KeepKey app (unfortunately, yes, I'm not running Linux).

(Dear other french people: don't feel offended, no grudges against french!) I needed this rant...What do you think where Ledger buys its cheap and crappy screens?If your Ledger screen is terribly dark but still displays something very faintly, have you tried to amplify that by looking at the screen with a mobile phone camera? I've seen some examples of this intermediate partial remedy of the dying screen issue on Youtube. Try this in a dark environment, of course turn off the mobile phone camera's flashlight.Maybe worth a try to move your coins from the Ledger wallet if the view by mobile phone camera makes the faint display visible for you. As others said, nothing wrong to use your KeepKey as recovery target device for your Ledger wallet, unless you can't recover all properly.When you were able to transfer your coins to a new Trezor wallet, do not throw away your recovery details of your Ledger wallet. Do not use the Ledger wallet any further, but keep the recovery details with lower storage security, just in case you need it for whatever purpose may surprise you in the future. (General advise: never completely destroy a wallet you ever used. You never know when you might need it ever again and it doesn't hurt to keep it at low storage security.)",
