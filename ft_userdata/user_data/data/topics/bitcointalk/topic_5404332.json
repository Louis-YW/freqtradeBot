A user may not know what exactly is incorrect and repeat the same mistake every time reading an address.Bech32 checksums actually include error correction as well as error detection. I'm always hesitant to suggest using this ability, though, as it is invariably only needed by inexperienced users, and when the error correction algorithm suggests a correction, such a user is likely to accept the correction without double checking it and then send their coins off to the wrong address.Pieter Wuille has a tool which does something in the middle, showing you where the errors are but not showing you the correction in case it is the wrong correction.

I am a hodler and hardware wallet user and in all my years in Bitcoin, I don't have a single backup of my addresses. There is no reason for you to have them. You aren't sending Bitcoin using your local post service where you have to write down the address on a piece of paper or receipt. It's done digitally and over the Internet. If I give you the link to this thread (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5404332.0) and ask you to save it, you are not going to take a piece of paper and write it down by hand, are you? You will bookmark it, copy and paste it into notepad, or something similar. Your seed is the most important element of your wallet. That's the only thing that should be written down on paper safely and carefully. The seed takes care of the rest. It derives your private and public keys, and your addresses.  Quote from: xml on June 29, 2022, 08:35:41 AMAlso, there is risk that inexperienced user would misread l as 1 when checking if the two addresses match in your example.

Can I ask you to elaborate on your suggestion, please? You shouldn't search for answers why it shouldn't be done, but ask yourself why you should do it? Let's say I have used 100 addresses in the last year. What possible benefit would I have to keep all these addresses written down on paper? The address itself can't spend coins without its seed and private key. Like I mentioned previously, having multiple copies of your seed on paper is the only thing you need to do.One more question for you:If you need to send me Bitcoin, how would you prefer that I give you my BTC address? Should I write it down by hand on a piece of paper and send you a photo of me holding the paper in my hand, or do I copy/paste it and send it you via PM, email/Telegram or any other digital way?",
