  "content": "BlueWallet is an open source Bitcoin wallet with the original aim of using a Bitcoin wallet on Segwit-enabled iOS. Apart from being open source, it is also decentralized and currently supports several other features such as Multisig Vault, Multiple Wallets, Coin Control, Payjoin, Plug-in your Bitcoin node, Coldcard support, Full encryption, HD wallets , and others.[1]BlueWallet which is a desktop wallet, available for MacOS and can also be used on mobile (Android and iOS)Many good mobile versions of Bitcoin wallets have been recommended by friends on this bitcointalk forum such as Unstoppable, Bitcoin Wallet, Mycelium Wallet, Samourai Wallet, Hedge Wallet and others .Regarding the news made by theymos Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts as an important announcement, then I took the initiative to share how to create or get a BlueWallet wallet on Android.I've tried to search on several boards about tutorials on how to make a BlueWallet wallet, but I couldn't find it. There may be something wrong in the search. So, on this occasion I tried to do it in the hope that it will be useful.The process for creating a BlueWallet wallet is very easy. We only need to run according to the following command;1. Search Blue Wallet on android Google play store and install it.Installation links: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bluewallet.bluewalletEdit:It's even better if you download it directly from BlueWallet's official website, either the Â App Store or Play Store.2. After installing, click open, it will immediately be directed to the application.3. If we are already in the Blue Wallet application, then the next step is to press the \"add now\" button, it will appear as shown in image 4.4. In the column that says \"my first wallet\", you may choose a name as you wish.BlueWallet provides 3 types of wallets, but for this tutorial, just choose the type \"Bitcoin\" then click \"create\".It is important for me to say that after you press the \"create\" button, 12 phrases will appear for you to save properly by noting them in a paper book or other supporting tool to remember them because the application does not allow schrenshooting, if on your android it supports schrenshooting then no anything.Image 1Image 2Image 3Image 45. To get the address, click on the wallet column that says \"0 BTC\".6. Then click the \"Receive\" button below.When it has reached stage 6, the application will display a reminder information display on our Android screen regarding the 12 word phrases that we have saved.7. If we have saved the 12 word phrase, click \"YES I HAVE\".8. We managed to get a Bitcoin address.Image 5Image 6Image 7Image 8Blue Wallet can also be installed on the iOS version and the process is not much different from the Android version.Apart from that, Blue Wallet can also allow us to Sign/Verify Messages.[1] https://bluewallet.io/features/",

Search Blue Wallet on android Google play store and install it.Installation links: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bluewallet.bluewalletBest to still download it directly from Bluewallet official site: https://bluewallet.io/. It will still direct you to app store, but better than to search directly on app and see a fake one, which is possible on app stores, especially google playstore. You can also use coin control on Bluewallet. You can also import Electrum seed phrase on Bluewallet, this makes it differ from most BIP39 wallets that support only importing seed phrase generated on BIP39 wallets.",

It is very important to take care even though android allows to take screenshots. We need to store the phrase in another place that is much safer in anticipation of not losing it for one reason or another. But what I'm getting at is a step in getting the address for android users who can't take screen responses while working on it like it happened to me.",

And I'm also glad that it's started as an open discussion, since (as Charles-Tim has pointed out very fast) some things are missing, incorrect or simply can be done better. I also recommend starting from the official website than the link for app (because one will be tempted to find the app on Play Store and end up with a clone sooner or later).Some additions/missing points:* if only the Android BlueWallet is discussed, it should be mentioned from start, in topic's title; BlueWallet exists also for desktop and iPhone. I would not be surprised there may be differences/missing features here and there.* BlueWallet supports hardware wallets and I think that this could need a special \"chapter\", especially as Electrum (which OP failed to mention!!!) on Android doesn't support HW* BlueWallet supports Lightning network (via a custodial wallet, however it's more than nothing) and that could use also a special chapter and workflow/tutorialOf course, all these can be added in time to OP (and I hope they will), although aylabadia05 should have been reserving 1-2 more post spaces for that.Edit: I've made a mistake/confusion, as Charles-Tim mentioned, BlueWallet also doesn't support well the hardware wallets, please read below.",

Both wallets have many differences that makes Bluewallet the better wallet to go for (better is even an understatement) when comparing both wallets.

Don't trust, verify for a maximum sovereignty.You can even still use wallet like Electrum to have some privacy, but you have to works towards that which will require many wallets used with different addresses using Tor. But if you really want privacy, you need to run your own node.Quote from: Husires on December 07, 2022, 04:40:05 PMI didn't like the user interfaceThis can be related to preference, because I like the UI very well. It is not even UI we need, but the functional aspect of the wallet and how safe the wallet is to use.Quote from: Husires on December 07, 2022, 04:40:05 PMThe wallet crashes in Huawei devices and this issue has not been resolved.It works well on my phone with Helio G96 processor, that is still by far a small phone of compared to iPhones and those expensive phones.",

If I remember correctly, I used Bluewallet on Android 9 phone and it worked, but I could not remember if it was actually Android 9 or 10 that I used it with because I upgraded the phone to Android 10 at the time. The new phone that I am using now is Android 11, I upgraded it to Android 12. I had Bluewallet on it when it was Android 11 and also now when it is running Android 12, no issue, maybe because it is mid-range phone. I noticed that Bluewallet is not light to load and it can crash anytime when I used it with Android 9/10, but my phone at the time was using 2 gigabyte ram and very lesser processor at the time. I guess Bluewallet may not load easily on low spec phones too and it may crash at times, but not all the time. Using Bluewallet on low budget phone is frustrating but outdated OS might have been the reason for it not working at all.Edit: Quote from: aylabadia05 on January 28, 2023, 09:52:37 PMHe mentioned that the Android version used is ColorOS V12.1 with the Helio G35 Octa Core Processor specification.Isn't that a high version of Android?He can use Electrum instead if the crash continues.
