It is often driven by negative emotions such as anger, frustration, and desperation, and it can be very difficult for people to control their impulses when they are feeling these emotions.There are a number of other reasons that people might engage in revenge gambling, including a lack of understanding of responsible gambling principles, a lack of awareness of the risks associated with gambling, and a lack of access to support and resources for managing problem gambling.",

So still 50/50, if you take it then win then good for you, but if you lose again, then it's a double whammy and if hard and very frustrated for gamblers.I guess to combat it is to man up and take your lose and play on other days, maybe next to take some days off first and when your mind is clear then maybe you will have to think whether to play again or not and not chase you losses.",

If you think that it is so easy to return the money you lost you are very mistaken and you need to reconsider your views on gambling.In general, you should try to play not to win, and for the pleasure of the game, but some gamblers never come to this understanding.",

People should learn to differentiate between moneybmeant for gambling and money meant for specific projects or plan as it would reduce this issue of revenge gambling among gamblers.",

Before during the height of my addiction, I wouldn't think of this so called revenge gambling thingy, I will just simply play as much as we can go to land base casinos and spend countless hours on the floor. And then comeback the next night, not thinking of the money I lose and that I want to win it back that's why I go again and play. But maybe for some they have this kind of mentality and it could be wrong as it could lead to more losses in the long run specially if you lose successive days because you want to a payback and satisfaction that you have recovered your money.",

Once you already reached or spend all your capital, better to accept that you lose and go home straight, don't ever think to gamble again in the next hour because the result might also be the same. In order to avoid any revenge gambling, better not to bring extra money every time you gamble this can limit your exposure and you can save yourself from losing more.",

If anyone thought like that, he should be prepared for many more losses and of course, it would cost more money. Controlling himself and not thinking about recovering losses is a way he can do so that he doesn't try to recover his losses by playing gambling the next day. But there were indeed some people who were able to recover his losses but compared to how much money he had already spent, the recovery was still difficult to achieve. So it's better not to think about chasing his losses and just gamble and have fun.",

People need to control their urges and there's really no better way to do it than recognizing early on that something is wrong if they're doing just this. Quote from: Obari on January 01, 2023, 11:31:35 AM~ what other reasons would make some indulge in revenge gambling?Desperation sometimes force people to look into gambling as a way to get some money to pay debt, or to gain quick money for other purposes. Apart from that, there really isn't any reason for a person to chase losses. Perhaps if that person really is struggling financially they shouldn't have gambled in the first place but hey, regrets always come last for a reason. Another thing is perhaps that person really is deep into their gambling addiction that they feel the need to always chase losses even if it cost them a lot more than what they can lose. If your brain is wired to react the same way on something that continuously happens to you, you won't realize that you're having the same response to address the same scenario over and over again, all the while expecting a different outcome in your mind.Quote from: Obari on January 01, 2023, 11:31:35 AM~ What are the measures to help combat revenge gambling?There aren't any straightforward measures to combat chasing a loss. You wouldn't really consider preventing it from happening up until you address that it's a problem that needs fixing. One way to prevent doing this is just setting a limited budget for gambling each month, and sticking with that strict budget no matter what happens. Mix with it your money for your needs and you'll have a hard time thinking of gambling more than what you have allotted for yourself because your next meal is on the line. Sure you may always borrow to your friends, but you'll have to really think before doing so because you will pile up your debt in no time.",

I know this from own experiences very well as I struggled for several years from revenge gambling. When I first started out with gambling 18 I always a fixed budget when visiting a casino. I never had a bank card with me and only used the cash in my pockets for gambling. To problem came when facing a loss streak, and after losing 70% of my bankroll for the night I got into \"I don't care about anything\" mentality. It was also my brain telling me that is now my turn to win. I ended up betting my remain budget on a single bet and would lose most of the time. So the last 1-2 hours at night I could only watch my friends gamble as I already blew through my budget. It took me several years to get rid of that behaviour. In my case it never let to me recover my losses and I would only lose more money.",
