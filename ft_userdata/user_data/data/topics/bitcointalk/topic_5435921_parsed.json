I have done that and quoted so that the image can be shown directly without opening the link of the image. One more thing I am very curious to know is how you get the information on this forum after being scammed and why you can't get this forum before being scammed.",

They don't care about it. They never come here to explain. So what I say always about the 1xbit victims that forgot it and learn from this lesson. Always try to do your own investigation before depositing on any platform. Best of luck",

Let's just wait and see if those representing the site in this forum will have anything to say concerning the issue laid down.

I hope you get quite valuable experience this time. once again, do not expect your money back.",

If you have long been existing here you should have seen the flags and tag attached to promoters of the 1xbit/1xbet promoters.They are scam and I am sorry to say this, I do not think you would get your funds back and also sorry that their is no possibility that you would get any assistance from here because it is a well known information here about the activities of the scam casino called 1xbet.",

I've turned once ublock to see what a favorite site of mine that I use to check prices looks like as it showed 12 blocked ads, and surprise surprise, who had the banner right on top? 1xbit! They trick a lot of users with that 7 BTC bonus or the one with 100% bonus on your deposits.They even get some paid articles in different crypto news outlets, like this one, so if somebody is not doing his own research deep enough and only gets though the paid reviews, and there are dozen of them pretty high up in google search results, and well, this happens.I lost hope with this one, seems like it will not end until they've scammed every single person in this world, maybe some of them even twice!Quote from: shasan on January 18, 2023, 04:49:03 PMOne more thing I am very curious to know is how you get the information on this forum after being scammed and why you can't get this forum before being scammed.Maybe because if you search just the name of the casino you end up with a ton of fake positive reviews in google (at least on this IP I'm using now), but once you're getting tricked and you ask yourself \"is 1xbit a scam\" bitcointalk is the third result.",

Trustpilot deletes bad reviews when those accused platforms give them money to do that. The same thing happened with 1xbet reviews. That's why they got a pretty high rating on Trustpilot.",

(Don't believe me - check it out by yourself)They are getting thousands of visitors because they are spending a lot of money in marketing. Since they are getting new customers and scamming them, they are able to cover these huge marketing costs. They are giving paid advertisements every day on various platforms including YouTube channels. They spend that much money to get visitors. As such, it is not surprising that they are getting daily visitors, so it does not increase the reputation of this website.",
