Not even Gambling Discussion so please to the relevant board. The sole purpose of Section 1 is Bitcoin Discussion. So from now onward, I am expecting you to never repeat the basic mistake because, from your Querrey and Tittle, it is not at all difficult to guess the Section where to post.",

Maybe Stake could put a list of alternative for users to use if some doesn't trust their own verifier. It's normal nowadays not to trust the casino they were playing.",

You could also just use another provably fair tester along with the ones that they sanctioned just so you'd have the peace of mind that they are not screwing you over. As for mines, I don't really know if such a feature exists since those games are randomized at best although you can try scouring the internet for answers for that. At the end of the day we can guarantee that your doubts over the validity of odds in stake are understandable and fine, but would be clarified once you find the proper answers you're looking for.",
