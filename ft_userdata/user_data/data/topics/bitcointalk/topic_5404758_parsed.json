Im not sure how much population is involved from the EU region but for the coin issuer it would be far easier to ban EU users than to agree to the rules like this. Crypto is so wide spread one can form the company in lets say UK and only allow the users from rest of the world to use it. Isn’t that’s funny?",

How many years have the regulation lawmakers been threatening scary new regulations?Its all a big nothing burger and will not have any kind of effect on the world of crypto now or in the future.Although personally, I would prefer a more responsible environmental law on energy production. But lawmakers do not seem to be ready to talk about that yet. I wonder how much money the energy lobby pays them to keep quiet.",

It's probably a positive thing that they're setting requirements for stable coins because when they aren't really backed up by much and people don't realize how fragile the stability is, it's a potential catastrophe waiting to happen. What I also like is that the new rules won't apply to Bitcoin because it's considered a coin without issuers. And, of course, the environmental thing is ridiculous when the EU is looking at coal amidst the Russo-Ukrainian war but thinking of restricting crypto mining because it's allegedly not eco-friendly.",
