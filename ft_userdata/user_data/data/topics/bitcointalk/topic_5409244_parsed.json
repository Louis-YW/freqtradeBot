That is what I would start working on if GOD Wills itMeanwhile there were certain people who wanted people to be killed/beheaded for treason. I hope we do not get to that when Power is given back to the Red King. I want it to be a smooth transition without anyone getting killed. So becareful.",

      "body": "As you said, be careful.The Revelation was written almost 2,000 years ago. The Old Testament prophecies were given well before that.The Revelation doesn't speak only of things in its future. Rather, it uses things from different times and places, many in the past, and some in the distant past, to show what will happen in the future. How do we know? Because, in places, it references things that were prophesied hundreds of years before it was written.In addition, Christian scholars of the Middle East often have a different view of the meanings of the prophesies, because many world happenings of the past and distant past match the predictions. For them, today's world is different, because they recognize that some of the things we don't know much (anything?) about, already happened in the ancient Middle East, and are written in their history.History repeats itself. That's why there are people who make money off the stock market and the Forex, etc. Perhaps what is happening is simply a repeat of some of the past. But it is difficult to determine for sure.I recommend the book, \"Revelation (Concordia Popular Commentary),\" by Louis A. Brighton - https://www.amazon.com/Revelation-Concordia-Popular-Commentary-Brighton/dp/0758617933.",

Thoughts and prayers for your fucked up head if you're being serious.So, you really don't understand that God is in control of this whole thing! He does what He does because of His own goals, and because of the requests of His people. But it's all in Bible prophesy.Bible prophesy is difficult to understand because the Bible isn't meant to be a book for fortune tellers. It is meant to be a book to save as many people for eternal life as possible. And since that is what God wants - the saving of people - He is the one who dictated the book according to Supreme Wisdom (Sophia - Jesus)... Wisdom beyond the understanding of people, so that unbelievers like you will think it's nonsense, because that's what you are asking it to be for yourself... God granting your request.Ucy has the right general idea, and a whole lot of truth. He is constantly sharpening his understanding about all of this.",

Trump said solving the opioid crisis was a top priority. His drug office’s track record suggests otherwise.Well, I would say your post leaves no room for speculation regarding the Post's article. And if anyone wants to have a great laugh, I really recommend watching the following from 5:30 to about 11:00 on Youtube:Trump’s Deposition on “Dangerous Fruit” & Biden’s $7 Billion Military Mistake | The Daily ShowEnjoy",

Jude 1:8-10:Quote from: https://www.biblehub.com/niv/jude/1.htm8In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings. 9But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, “The Lord rebuke you!” 10Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct—as irrational animals do—will destroy them.",

But we do have something that allows us to have wishes. God takes our wishes, and if necessary, goes back to the Beginning and tweaks Cause and Effect so that our wishes produce results for us. God maintains free will for us this way.",
