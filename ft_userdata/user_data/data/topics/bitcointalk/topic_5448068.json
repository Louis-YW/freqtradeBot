  "content": "Hey in the last year i started painting some bitcoin related art with acryl on canvas. It started with a painting i made for a friend but now there are a few more.I wanted to see if there are some people here that may like them and would like to buy them for btc. I am willing to sell both, the physical and digital versionsHere are some of my paintings:Matrix orange Pill (50x20cm):https://i.ibb.co/wwKt4rv/matrix.jpgMomo (Michael Ende) with ECB (50x50cm):https://i.ibb.co/LxmZN1Z/IMG-2961.jpgfollow the white rabbit (want to keep the original):https://i.ibb.co/19NppKg/rabbit2.jpgFightclub (18x24cm):https://i.ibb.co/tKjTS1b/soap.jpgSatoshi Nakamoto whale (original sold already)https://i.ibb.co/RTZJdHM/wal2.jpgCold storage (30x30cm):https://i.ibb.co/crcKcpS/IMG-2963.jpgoriginal (physical) prices depend on the painting. Mainly for me how much time i spend painting them. Just write me a message and we will find a fair price.The digital versions would obviously be much cheaper. You can then choose the medium to get the prints yourself (fineart paper, on metall, acrylic glas, canvas)A Guy i sold a digital version, made those nice prints with them and he was so nice to give me the pictures of the prints:acrylglas:https://i.ibb.co/GvThsXz/N1kzivbbkkpa1.jpg40x40cm print:https://i.ibb.co/gRGCHJd/Fmlqmvwbjkpa1.jpgmore detailed photo:https://i.ibb.co/52p41Hc/Kmzejnbbkkpa1.jpggreetingsblu3baeri also made a small twitter and instagram account in case anyone is interested. I post when i finish a new painting:https://twitter.com/blu3baerhttps://www.instagram.com/blu3baer/",
