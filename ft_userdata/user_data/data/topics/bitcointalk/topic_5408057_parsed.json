It's better if you are sending him a direct request about the job. it's clear if you shall PM him or he will not PM you for that. He's also inactive since a few days ago. Dropping him your application directly will become the best question if you wanna get direct answer. It's better doing that first rather than waiting him to send you a PM. good luck for that.",
