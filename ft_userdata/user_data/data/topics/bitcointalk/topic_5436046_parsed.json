Newbies should also not rely to any signal group because its not safe so learn on your own and trade on your own. Trading can only be profitable if you become more responsible with your decisions.",

A trader needs to know about the crypto market and develop trading skills to be successful. An experienced trader never thinks of getting rich quick, because he knows about reality. And those who come to trading with the idea of ​​getting rich quickly end their trading journey after losing funds badly.I think that in order to be successful a trader needs to think about the reality along with developing trading skills because many times that trader may have to face unexpected situations.",

Quote from: Obari on January 19, 2023, 06:30:48 PMWhat would be your advice for those wanting to trade as a newbie?My advice for newbie is that trading is not a get rich quick scheme just as you said, if you want to be a professional trader, it involves reading, doing research and constant practice. As a trader, you will definitely lose money sometimes, is not possible that you will trade and you won't lose money, but we should make sure our profit is more than our lose and we should always trade with the amount we can afford to lose. Also we shouldn't depend on trading signals, if you want to trade, learn to do your analysis yourself.",

Quote from: Obari on January 19, 2023, 06:30:48 PMWhat would be your advice for those wanting to trade as a newbie?My advice for newbies who want to trade is to do everything they can to learn as much about trading as possible before they begin trading. Newbies should always start at least their first two trades with a small amount of money, regardless of how they think they have gathered the knowledge to have their market experience, so from there they can start increasing the amount when they think they are getting it better and making profits from it.",

But it's not all about the success that they've made but the hardship before they reach that goal.Yeah, sure trading is very profitable for those that have studied and endured those losses in the favor of learning which they can apply in their future trades.Quote from: Obari on January 19, 2023, 06:30:48 PMWhat would be your advice for those wanting to trade as a newbie?Don't be hasty but never stop testing and experimenting with your trades. It's because you'll never know if it's going to be worth it in the future or not because you might stop. But if you really want to push for it, just keep going but bear the potential losses.",

Learning is the first step that must be done in order to at least have an understanding of trading. so it's not just understanding that by trading, we can get the money very quickly and a lot. This is like a false hope because it could be us who will lose a lot of money from the trading activity. Not many newbies actually want to learn, some of them just want something instant, so some of them choose to use free signals without knowing what the risks of these signals are too. They also do not hesitate to spend a lot of money on trading for the sake of high profits. but again, they forget that as you said, trading has high risks that must also be handled. Therefore, it is necessary to first understand risk management and funds before really jumping into the world of trading, especially for those who are interested in learning more.",

Embarking on a journey (whether road, water, rail or air) it's a huge risk on its own; but let's just stick to trading here. Yes, trading is a lucrative business but as well as a very risky one. The major nag in trading is that many would-be traders like to concentrate on the euphoria of making quick cash without putting in the works to acquiring the needed skills for it. Quite alright, even professional traders suffer losses from time to time but what matters here is the ability to record more profit than loss. Anyone who's scared of seeing red in their trade history isn't prepared to be a trader.",

It is very easy to learn trading but controlling emotion is not as you cant easily learn it online and also it is easy to read or say but very difficult to do.
