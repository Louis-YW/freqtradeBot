That effectively proves that even garbages can be sold as NFT and that will also make you a good amount of profit for no reason or effort. The entire NFT ecosystem is non sense and the biggest non-sense leader of all time, has joined the bandwagon! Like a match made in heaven.",

I see no issues on this. After all, he has to wear something on his NFTs...The worst part of the story is there are people willing to pay 99$ to own those useless cards. I think it couldn't even be considered an investment.",

It has something to do with the ticket attached to each cardQuote” He then says “each card comes with an automatic chance to win amazing prizes like dinner with me. I don’t know if that’s an amazing prize but it’s what we have.”Everyone wants to have dinner with Trump, of course, it can give you social media hype and if you're a social media influencer it will give you mileage and you can use it to promote your channels but many are surprised with the use of cheap photoshopped card unthinkable for the richest man in the world.",

They're hoping the collection is gonna to get shill on \"TRUMP\" social media.Make it FOMO, but I doubt he not gonna to do that.",

The entire NFT ecosystem is non sense and the biggest non-sense leader of all time, has joined the bandwagon! Like a match made in heaven. The super nonsense is the NFT items that are not worth it because they came from nonsense but still people are willing to sacrifice millions of dollars for it to create a temporary hype to promote to the people and when it happened, they will introduce their arts which will gonna be worth more than that and so on so forth. I think if it's only art from popular artists it would likely make sense and also they made the price not too high. Right now, the trend is the metaverse and it has lots of support from all over the world.",
