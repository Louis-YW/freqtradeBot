  "content": "Since it's the end of the year I got a note that in 2023 the bank that I have my safe deposit box in is raising the rates for next year.I have 1 of a X of Y SSS key in there and 1 device of a X of Y multisig.Nothing anyone would ever be able to figure out even if I told them they were in there and where they are.For security there is also a bunch of unrelated things in there (car title / passport / other paperwork) that if I just have to replace one for some reason the time and effort to replace them would be more the the cost of the box for the year so if someone was looking it was logical to have them in there......Until now.With the increase in cost I am going to look at other banks / credit unions. Just wondering what the cost is in other places.Online pricing is wrong, the 2 banks I checked still show 2021 (2020?) pricing.-Dave",

Apparently, this problem will exist all the time as long as crypto exists. On the one hand, this is a great advantage, on the other, a great responsibility to oneself.If someone really needs it, then without any difficulty they will open this safe (in principle, any). For the most part, this is protection only from petty hooligans.The $175 safe is a carry-on, so you need to mount or buckle it up. At a minimum, so that attackers spend more time and make it easier to find them.The solution with a safe deposit box (or other storage locker) is rather dubious, even if only part of the information is stored in them. Additional backups will be required here, in case access to the cell is lost (for example, due to confiscation or theft). It is rather reckless to consider a safe deposit box as the main place for storing a phrase. Why do you need the unique opportunity to personally manage the seed phrase if you leave it in the hands of centralized systems? It's like storing crypto currencies on exchanges.",

It's like storing crypto currencies on exchanges.Everything I have for long term cold storage is X of Y as I said. Keeping the seeds in there is more along the lines of EVERYTHING ELSE went to shit; like the condo burned down, fireproof safe failed, secure seed storage was destroyed by a heard of reindeer [it is Christmas] and so on. And it's mixed in with other documents that a lot of people have in SD boxes. Just things that are not 'critical' but difficult / annoying to replace.If it was just the seeds I would not keep, but since they are just one more thing in there I figured other people might still use one and have an idea on price.-Dave",

MY branch that rate-jacked me actually referred me to another branch of the same bank about 5 miles away for LESS then I was paying in 2022. Yeah, go figure. After I finished looking at the person I was talking to like they just popped out another head. They actually explained that they use market pricing in some areas and the branch I was sitting in was considered prime space since there are lots of homes / condos / apartments in the area. But, the one 5 miles east was in a mainly commercial area so they didn't have a lot of people who wanted boxes there. Which does have some kind of logic in the fact that you would want something like that closer to home then work.But....the price difference was insane. So yeah, from $99/yr to $219/yr keeping it where is was to $89 in the other branch.Thanks for all the suggestions. -Dave",

Hahaha.Softcopy is made as a kind of offline storage diversification on the USB that you are using. Having a copy is also very important, but offline security is my priority. make sure only you can access and open it. USB also has a feature to lock so that there will be a password that must be entered to open it. As much as possible, do not connect USB softcopy containing important data to the internet, to prevent viruses or malware from attacking.and for the safebox rented by the Op it might be too expensive if there is another increase. I've never made storage in a bank safebox and of course the rent is expensive. I prefer to save with a personal safebox that I can make myself.",

Yes I have a fireproof safe at home BUT it is a smaller one so it's more for things I may need access to on a regular basis.Car & motorcycle titles. Yes I can keep them at home, but I get a car a few weeks later the title shows up and then I don't need to see it for 5+ years.Into the box it goes.Passport might need once a year.Part of a multi-sig seed. Part is at another location (not home). The other is in the box. Brings back what a friend said decades ago when ATM cards were 1st coming out. \"Don't want one, if the banks are closed and I need cash it's probably a bad idea\"So even if \"the big bad government\" came in and took everything or the bank was robbed and all was lost it's a pain to replace, not impossible. And for $89 a year still, it's also got some paperwork that should not be stored at home like the paperwork about the home. -Dave",
