But you were not scammed but lose to the bet you played?It depend on the site you use, I will advice people to use the gambling sites on gambling boards of this forum, they are trustworthy, but using only the ones that other members are advising people to use which are the currently active ones except 1xbit.Gambling can be addictive and money can be lost. I have read many gambling site ToS that even include it that if someone know that he would gamble going beyond having fun, that the type of person should not gamble, that gambling should only be for fun and not for money making means.",

You played at the casino and lost 2000 dollars. There is no one to blame. As far as I know, the betting is provably fair on bitsler and there is no way to scam you with unfair bets.

The minimum wager amount is pretty much few dollars on every gambling sites then why you decided to bet big?You can't say this isn't happened because of the system, it happened due to your greediness and that's the truth even if you don't accept it.Gambling especially casino games are more favourable to the house all the time so learn that first before doing something crazy.",

It is not a scam when you lose money and keep in mind that you should have done your own research that most casinos have in place a house edge exactly to do that,keep the casino in a winning state over the long run.I know how bad it feels to lose even 0.10 Ethereum and let alone 3 Ethereums but unfortunately that happens when people become greedy,if you would have just hold those Ethereums and didn't play in the casino you would not have felt such great sadness,I know that feeling as I was once addicted but nothing you can do.",

But I wouldn't really say 95% of the casinos online are scams. Many of them are trying to get a legit business. I could roughly estimate the number of casinos in crypto more than half of it is legitimately real and not trying to scam.",

I mean were you expecting to gamble and win on a regular basis? If that's the case then it's not more a gambling but play and win, lol. Two things might be involved in your loss which I think are is either you're not well experienced in the game or you were eager to recover your lose which led to more lose. Making bet and lose does not mean it's a scam unless you win and they deprive you from making withdrawal or something of such.",

Making bet and lose does not mean it's a scam unless you win and they deprive you from making withdrawal or something of such. There are many ways to losses in gambling. The first I know is when someone is winning, the person may see it more exciting and play more and later start to lose and lose all. If the person has already won, he just supposed not to gamble again. After the loss, the person supposed not to gamble again too, but they would want to chase losses and thinking they can have luck and win back, this is the most reasons many people lose very well in gambling. People should not chase losses, they should just forget about it. If they use small amount of money, they will not chase losses.",

Jeez, losing money on spending something is not a scam, it's just how the world flows since services/products require a payment to be made. Casinos are the same. Casinos are in a way designed as you said, to take money from users in the long run due to house edge but it's also a choice for users to NOT play. If you chose to play, then you basically agreed to the chances of you losing your money (which was included in you agreeing to your money increasing).",

No, because you didn't make your research properly to know how reliable the site is before depositing $2k, then followed by you, how well and how sure your games are to be correct in that site. I.e, what kind of game do you place a bet in that gambling site and how correctly you know your games played or not before saying all gambling site are scammer.There have been some gambling site that has been existing for long and I have never heard a bad news or complaint about them.

If gambling is a scam, the government shouldn't have issued them a permit to operate in the first place. It's not even the casino's fault if you have lost $2k. I think you don't totally understand how casino and hoe gambling works. The term \"the house always wins\" refers to the house edge where they take a small percentage out of yourÂ  winning amount. Thus, you'll probably going to lose if you play longer. I knew people who lost way more than just $2k but they did not cry about casinos being a scam lol.",
