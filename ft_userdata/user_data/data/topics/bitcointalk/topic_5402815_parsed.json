Accounts with high Activity and 0 Merit have nothing to lose, because they can easily create new accounts. Worse: it makes negative feedback very common instead of reserved for scammers, which leads to more and more people (including bounty/campaign managers) ignoring the warning. So I don't think tagging them makes the forum better.If you think someone deserves negative feedback: do it! See LoyceV's Beginners guide to correct use of the Trust system. There's no need to wait for DT-members to do the dirty work.",

He's just think if there's any connection whether it's a transaction or somewhat are considered a worthy negative tag, but the truth is anyone can have multiple accounts as long as they're not doing a bad thing.@OP it's better if you provide strong proof to consider those accounts were controlled by a same person, you can search his address and social media accounts, if you search those accounts using same address or social media accounts, then post it here. Also bring a proof of those accounts were cheated in the same campaign, if those 2 requirements you failed to met, you can't expect a negative tag from DT members.",

So I don't think tagging them makes the forum better.The red tag I have noticed before about this is when the person joined the same campaign, if OP have enough prove and most especially if the alts joined the same campaign, I see no reason the bounty hunter do not worth red tag. Even if the bounty manager knows about that, he can also reward the alts with red tag, provided if not to join the same campaign is among the rules stated. But obviously, anything related to scam and trust is what trust system should be used for while DT members are obviously misusing trust system.",

Filing a petition for someone, you should have gathered the vital information or documents of the user by rendering exactly the wallet that is been linked together. With that someone will know what to state towards the petition. According to what tender here, their no way you can say that account is been linked without a proper evidence of the account",

Having multiple accounts and account sales are allowed, but account sales are discouraged.So far, you haven't shown us what rule the accounts broke that makes you think the accounts deserve to be tagged by DT members",
