This is something I know I've wanted in the crypto community and I'm super excited about getting it launched. It truly is an awesome product.Nudge is a new class of web server that I call a Web3 Server.Its has built-in passwordless authentication, access control, and a blockchain powered, encryption at rest database for ensuring whats private stays private.Nudge is the foundation of a decentralized web that works for everyone. We are making it easy for anyone (no-code, low-code, or developer skill set) to get our server, productize their content or services, and then monetize it. This means supporting crypto currency transactions in addition to the fiat support we are already building into it. I've always really appreciated this forum and I would love to get a conversation going on here about any additions to our product you would like to see. I hope you will check us out at https://nudge.io and support us. If there's anyone else you feel would benefit from knowing about Nudge, I would appreciate the share.Looking forward to feedback, and if you are interested in buying, the code BITCOIN-TALK-20 will get you 20% off for the next 72 hours.- Matt",

Does it have to be there, and can't you just make the docs public for everyone to see without going through additional steps?",

So, don't use that word if you don't understand it's meaning.",
