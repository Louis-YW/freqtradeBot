You can make a single line comment and it will be appreciated more than a seven paragraphs post.Most times the reason why newbies are being criticized is because of the type of post they make. For example you as a newbie come to bitcointalk that has been in operation since 2009 and start to make tutorial threads on how to create a Bitcoin wallet.",

It's only one who is not willing to accept correction who might take every little suggestion and correction as an insult and attack. Everyone here on the forum is a newbie; no one created an account and was promoted to Legendary or any Rank higher than newbie; everything takes time and processing. Once you realize what you are really here for and make yourself relevant, you will earn the merit you talk about. Merit will come when you write something meaningful that is worth meriting.I see your account is a few days away from reaching a year. You will have to change your mindset regarding how newbies are being treated before you can actually go forward in here. Having a positive mindset will give you positive vibes about things around here.",

The merit system was introduced to reduce spamming in the forum, which is why merit is a reward for quality posts and contributions in the forum.",

However, that joy of belonging to a community of Bitcoin know-how must be channelled properly before going against the rule. Do not see correction as attack,  I made some mistake while trying to understand how the forum works and thanks to those who corrected with love and those that pleaded on my behalf.  As I said earlier, there is one way to avoid been rebuked for posting low quality post; read rules and regulations guiding every board you want to post. Posting against the set standard is considered an infringement. If you do the right thing , then be strong to continue doing the right thing, avoid multiple posting or unnecessary reply and be selective in your choice of words.",

In all seriousness, I don't believe any senior members are attacking newcomers, but what I do know is that senior members always try to correct them. Members who are knowledgeable cannot passively observe while other members provide incorrect information.If any beginner has consistently been under assault on this topic, I can say that person is acting incorrectly on a regular basis and has been warned about it; nevertheless, because the person chose not to accept the warning, I wonder why other forum members will not take any action against him.",

In the forum here you can post in anywhere you like, nobody will stop you from anywhere, but your rank is restricted from posting in some particular places because you are newbie, and if you are looking for merit, if you are making contribution and someone sees the post or comment useful, then they can decide to merit and they might not also merit it.",

Some of the expressions you call attack are corrections and instructions that you need to grow in the forum. Sometimes these words might not come politely, but you should overlook the harsh words and learn the lessons attached. You are permitted to visit and post on boards you know about. You can attract rebuke if your post is substandard. That is why you need to read more and write less at this stage. Before posting anything make sure the information is meaningful and valid. If you keep on posting relevant information that contributes positively to the forum, you will be rewarded with merits. And if you keep bringing viable ideas, answering questions, and helping people solve problems in this forum, more merits that will help you to increase your rank will come.",
