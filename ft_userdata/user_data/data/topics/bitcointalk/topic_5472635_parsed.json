      "body": "Gideon66, Come back to this thread, read and re-read it again, and ask yourself: What is the real idea you have established in this thread you created? What's really for discussion here? Should we discuss the fact that you have a different topic title and your facts are contrary to the topic?OP, just lock this thread because it doesn't contribute any new ideas to the board. My honest advice to you is to stay positive, re-read the forum rules again, learn from other high-ranking members, read some educational materials about Bitcoin, and instead of creating a thread, only contribute to other members threads as you keep learning.",
