I see the price of sushi today only fell by about 5% and I don't think it's too bad when there is news of a hack that hit sushiswap. maybe in hindsight there will still be a lot of CEX or DEX hacking news as hackers keep looking for loopholes in every exchange. agree with what you said that we have full responsibility for our money, therefore we must keep our money in the safest place.",

I see the price didn’t dump that much, maybe Sushiswap was able to stop the hacker from getting more money. Hackers are still looking for a weak system, this could be a warning to Sushiswap t strengthen their security.",

There will always be some loopholes in the code of the site even it's built with advanced security. If exchanges are constructed with poor coding, filled with vulnerabilities, then they will most likely be hacked. Many of those swiping sites are not as secure as we perceive them to be, and any unfortunate occurrence like this can take place in the future. It is better to rely on reputable centralized exchanges, which excel in terms of security. Their security measures far exceed those of decentralized exchanges.Our present technology is still not highly advanced, and any website can have bugs and vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious entities.",

But man it was way more difficult.I remember that buy and sell walls weren't working \"cumulative\" so you had to hand pick orders to buy from. And because people didn't get how it worked, some people sold too low and some bought too high. Yeah, i have to admit that was a good example of weird GUI. People don't seem to understand how weird all this is to newbs. It's way better then years ago but still confusing operation, not to mention they get hacked.",

In addition, those platforms and their smart contracts have to upgrade with time. With each upgrade, new risk of hack on their newly upgrade smart contract will occur again.",
