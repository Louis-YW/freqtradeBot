The maximum number of friends I hang out with are unemployed. They are not uneducated they are all well educated in their respective positions but due to lack of adequate facilities they are unable to find any employment. When we walk together I talk to them about Bitcoin but they tell me that they have only heard about Bitcoin on various social media and they think that if anyone is involved in Bitcoin, the administration of our country will arrest them. Because it is through this kind of news that they are aware of Bitcoin. But when I tell them that I have a rough understanding of Bitcoin. Then they don't want to believe me when I tell them all about bitcoin they believe me. And I assure them if we all get involved in Bitcoin maybe our unemployment will go away. Because there are enough ways to earn money with Bitcoin.  Out of all my friends two of my friends have some savings and when I told them about the investment they became very interested in investing but I didn't tell them only the positive aspects of the investment I told them the negative aspects. And I know the rest of my friends would also be interested in learning about Bitcoin but I just don't know how to start teaching them about it. Because bitcoin crypto currency is completely illegal in my country. So how can I help my friends in this regard?  Hope you guys can give me proper feedback on this and help me move forward in helping them.",

What make you think you are the only person that have knowledge and use bitcoin, since Bitcoinbosa privacy incline asset and movement, its hard to know those using it or having basic knowledge about Bitcoin. So sincerely you cant be 100% sure that you are the only one that knows and use Bitcoin in your region/area, may be gou are the first to exposed your Bitcoin involvement and making public awareness.

But if you must go further to teach them about bitcoin, you don't have to go above your limits or only teaching them about security aspect and usefulness, it must not only be the investment aspect. Then secondly, investing in bitcoin doesn't guaranteed a total turnaround of becoming rich or wealth over night. Know too well that if they venture into bitcoin it could take about 1 year or more to get stabilized since the market is too volatile.",

But I always wondered where it says on the forum that we are trying hard to teach and persuade people to invest, especially people who are far from crypto. Why are so many people taking on the role of teachers to supposedly help their friends? Want to help? Give them money; moreover, if you can give some examples, as you write, about the many ways to earn Bitcoins, I will be grateful.I'm not against you, OP, but if a person is a doctor, for example, and he forces you to go and get a medical specialty, how will you react? Some are simply not interested; you should not be intrusive; bitcoin does not need advertising; as you can see, it has been very independent and sufficient for many years.Quote from: Fuso.hp on May 28, 2023, 01:43:49 PMBut when I tell them that I have a rough understanding of Bitcoin.",

The Bitcoin isn't a new thing anymore because nowadays, many people are aware of the thing, but some people like to keep it as a secret rather than sharing information about it to others. I have seen many people in my area who are into Bitcoin trading, but most of them somehow, make up stories to show that they have no knowledge about the crypto-currency.I must warn you if the Bitcoin is not legal or allowed in your country than promoting it to others are educating them about it can be a legally challenging task for you. It's always better to share them the online sources so that they can learn about the thing on their own because in this date and time there are so much material about Bitcoin present in the form of texts, and videos available free of cost. If you still want to promote the awareness of Bitcoin in your community then the best option is the guide them about this forum because they will learn so many things about Bitcoin when they start reading the posts of the forum.Do not guide others to invest in Bitcoin because if anything goes wrong then all of them will blame you for that. It's always a wise thing to just share the information and let them to decide. In this day even if someone faces a loss then the person will point the finger towards the one who encouraged them to invest in the thing. Although, I can understand that you're trying to help those friends, but I still recommend you to help them with information only and let them to decide whether they want to invest in Bitcoin or not. If they are still willing to invest in it then you should guide them the safest way to invest into the cryptocurrency. That's more than enough a friend can do for them, and they'll appreciate your efforts if they get profits from the investment.",

We are alive in the digital age - what problems can there be? Then they would not be under the false misinformation of the mass media about btc.It is extremely naive to believe that unemployment will disappear if everyone starts get involved in bitcoin. You are greatly mistaken. In the BTC-community there are not only those who have earned with the help of bitcoin, but also those who have lost. As in any business, you also need to work hard here, but if you don’t try to change anything, then your friends will remain unemployed.Quote from: Fuso.hp on May 28, 2023, 01:43:49 PMOut of all my friends two of my friends have some savings and when I told them about the investment they became very interested in investing but I didn't tell them only the positive aspects of the investment I told them the negative aspects.

You are attracting them to invest due to their unemployment and the tendency for them to chase profit is very high. They might ended up investing on shitcoins once they have more knowledge on crypto since you are looking for a source of income and not knowledge.There's no harm to put savings on Bitcoin but relying on it as main source of income is a terrible decision to be made. You really need to find a decent job then invest on Bitcoin. The age of faucet free money is already gone since Bitcoin price is already high.",

If that's your intention, then I don't think it's a good idea because, as you said, they are unemployed, and someone with no steady income shouldn't invest in bitcoin even if it's savings. Have you thought about the consequences if their investment fails and what happens when they are unemployed and have no savings left? You should encourage them to find a paying job before thinking about investing, bitcoin cannot get them out of unemployment by investing.",

If I were OP, I wouldn't recommend my friends invest in bitcoin because they need a steady source of income right now, and bitcoin can't help them do that. How can someone without a job invest in bitcoin? The savings will also be exhausted if we use it and don't have any additional sources. Not to mention the investment is very risky, there is no guarantee they will be profitable and out of unemployment.OP, moreover, it's not wise to give investment advice to others. Have you ever thought if the investment fails, what will happen to your friendship after that? As much as he care for them to have something to hold on for the future, they may blame OP since there is no assurance what could happen. He might lose these friend of him when things go south. I strongly suggest the maximum caution because BTC is illegal in the country.Getting employed is the first to worry before diving into BTC. You don't wanna see then sell in loss.",

Because there are enough ways to earn money with Bitcoin.  Point of correction, Bitcoin investment does not offer an employment opportunity of any kind, but rather there are ways through which one can earn money from its volatile market nature (i.e trading) of which at times you could either go into profits or lose depending on the market movement & your level of experience for that day.Quotebut I didn't tell them only the positive aspects of the investment I told them the negative aspects. And I know the rest of my friends would also be interested in learning about Bitcoin but I just don't know how to start teaching them about it. Because bitcoin cryptocurrency is completely illegal in my country. So how can I help my friends in this regard?  Moreover, Bitcoin is a very good investment option, most especially for long-term investments not affected by inflation. But rather, it is not an investment you try to pursue or force people into it so that if the market happens to go not as planned, nobody gets to blame you for introducing them to it. And secondly, there are a lot of \"Beginners guide to Bitcoin\" that explains all you need to know about this currency as a newbie, which you can get that from either Google or forum by using the \"search\" button at the top right corner.",
