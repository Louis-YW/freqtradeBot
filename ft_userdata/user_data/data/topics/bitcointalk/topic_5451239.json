Not that am supporting what ur EFCC is doing to Naija people that made their money in a genuine way, but dey just believed that every successful young guys in the town are yahoo guys which is not true, and this young guy case has proven to them that hard working youths are still making it in crypto. But we still need to advise our crypto users not to show themselves in public because, there is hunger in the land which EFCC and police don't use eye see crypto users.",

Dem shock leave the guy.I’m not in support of what EFCC did to him but this would have been avoided if he hadn’t posted about his income in public that made EFCC come looking for him. Even your close friends and enemies who are envy of you can set traps for you to see your downfall. It’s advisable you don’t disclose your source of income to the public until an occasion warrants you to do so.QuoteThe moral of this story be say make we just dey focus dey do our thing as relating to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

How una reason the matter?It is good to know what you’re doing and be perfect at your craft always because it is very important and can save you at any time. These days, you’ll see Nigerians are used to posting stuffs like (Active, Zelle, Cash App) on their statuses imitating other people that does that. And put a caption like, ‘I don’t know whether this thing dey bring money but make i post am too’. If they’re caught is such cases, how can they be able to proof that’s not their work or it’s their work which they can’t prove and knows nothing about them.",
