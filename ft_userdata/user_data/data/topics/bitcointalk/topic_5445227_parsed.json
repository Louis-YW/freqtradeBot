In trading, you need proper quality trades, this can be done or maximized if you have other things that you are doing other than trading. Trading is good if you go in the proper direction.Price action is good, but it is only meant for traders that are very patient. Many institutional and retail traders can even make use of it, but it has its own strategies that are used to trade it. Traders that are using price action to trade are patient, they may not open trade until they see a massive increase or decrease in the price of a coin, like bitcoin. If the price has increased or fallen very significantly, they open a sell or buy position so that they can make money and profit from it. They may not stay long at times because the market may first go your direction and start to go opposite direction later. There are some strategies that can be helpful for it like trend trading, trend after a retracement entry, trend after a breakout entry and many others. If you can learn about it very well, be patient before making decision, you can make money from price action. But you also need to set price alerts too to make sure you are notified if certain price has been gotten too.Lastly, you should always remember that you should not use the amount of trading fund that is more than the amount of money that you can not afford to trade.

My next plan is to become a full-time trader.Does anyone have the same method and goal as me?I guess that many are also using that method and if you're planning to become a full-time trader, it's more likely that you've been quite well in the market and you think that you'll be able to take the risky path of being a full-time trader. There's no need for you to manage your time but just need to monitor the market on a daily or every other day basis or any time you wish. But it's also best to learn more about the other strategies that are in the market and you should be aware of reading the charts and candles as much as possible so that, you can choose the best possible strategy that you're confident that you'll be able to use as you day trade. It may sound simple as it may seem but it's really hard to be one.",

Trading is not easy and there’s no assurance for profit here, if you want to trade full time make sure you are financially capable to do this.",

This is a good strategy for token that performing with same pattern for a long time like Bitcoin. I just don’t know if being a full-time in crypto trading is advisable since there’s a time which the price moves abnormally in a very volatile manner you can lose hard at some point of your trading that might cause you to lose all your profit that you earn on your previous trade. You might encounter a lot of fake sign on crypto trading because there’s always a risk of manipulation from whales. Stocks and forex are the best asset to  use this strategy because they are consistent. The only consistent in Bitcoin is the pump and dump based the fundamentals which is being disregarded by your strategy. This is not a good idea if you will do it in daily basis.",

In trading, I just try to buy low and sell high and if I can only make a small profit, that's enough for me but I will repeat the trade a few times.

Price action reflects market psychology that is very important for market movement so if you manage it, you can trade well. A next issue is manage your portfolio safely enough. By safely enough, I mean you won't use all money for trading and don't think you will get profit with every order you open. You will have to accept that if your order does not give you profit, you have to exit it to protect your capital as much as possible.A draw or a small lost exit is better than a big loss or a serious liquidation. If any trader can do it disciplined, he is a true trader because he can do a most important thing with a trader, protect his capital.",

I wouldn't say  full time trading is that kind of  bad things because now a days many peoples are doing it professionally and also gaining a good amount of profit and it has also created a potential market in today's world. So I would consider this as a possible way. But trading is a very high-risky subject, everything changes in a moment in trading, so one type of method has not to be used every time.  So I would advise you not to limit yourself to one method to become a full time successful trader.",
