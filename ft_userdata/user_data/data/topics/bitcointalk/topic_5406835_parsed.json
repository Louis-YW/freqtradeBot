  "content": "Over the weekend the price of Ether was trading in the green, extending a rise that began following the reveal of the schedule for the Ethereum blockchain's shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.Ether has seen more than a 40% rise in recent days, a move that has taken it above $1,400 for the first time since early June.That is also reflected in trading volumes, which have reached record levels. But for many in the crypto community, a key question remains: what happens now? Will ether keep its momentum, and is that the right call? While the answer will depend on the short-term price movements, the current bear trend is likely to continue.Check out our newsletter at https://ambire-newsletter.beehiiv.com/",

So it's good to see that both prime movers  is somewhat on a wild swing lately.Momentum though will get us that far, so we don't know what will going to happen in the future. Others might want to take a profit today at the price of Ethereum, but for sure majority will look at the long term. Next up is $1,800 barrier.",

However, since we are in a bear market, this development are not magnified. It's that that the rest of the crytpo market now are n a upswing and thank to bitcoin moving to $23k that's why it bring it with him other altcoins such as Ethereum. But nevertheless, there are no assurance that the price increase will continue.",
