I mean who doesn't love bitcoin that much and look whats its become today. If your wondering why I haven't logged in or used my accounts for so long its nothing more than the computers that hosted my accounts are fried and I didn't keep any backups as I was 18years old/19 years old when I bought these accounts.. If anyone from blockchain or bitcoin could get in touch with me that would be perfect so I can get access into my accounts again, im officially tired of them popping up as \"unclaimed\" and other people claiming these coins are theres to scam people... its a terrible thing to do and very illegal... Anyway have a good time guys thanks for liking my accounts and please feel free to comment... Thanks for all the donations also!! I really have been making good efforts to get back into my accounts lately now that bitcoin has skyrocketed to a reasonable 10,000$ a coin which I always invisioned since I first purchased these accounts.. ALSO one more thing, these are truly my accounts, not stolen from mtgox and not unclaimed and not tied to anything else... there is a lot of skepticism and rumours about my accounts but let it be known that as the days go by im getting closer and closer to accessing my long lost funds and WOW what a long journey its been since I purchased these haha! I will say 10 years flies when your having fun watching your money grow. I hope all you other bitcoin investors are doing as well as I and may you guys have a wonderful rest of your Labor Day.~Anonymous!~P.S. these accounts are too valuable to not be accessible again that doesn't make sense nor is correct. Far too much money to go missing and I must say I've been dealing with quite a lot since getting in contact with blockchain and bitcoin over recovering my accounts... Not the best experience and I still am yet to gain access to my accounts.. Quite the shame. Maybe after reading this message something or someone will figure out how to help me from blockchain. Thanks Again and LET ME INTO MY ACCOUNTS IM TIRED OF WAITING!! ITS LIKE CHRISTMAS WITH NO PRESENTS HAHA!!!",

Skies the limit with scammers these days.Im still amazed at how much attention my accounts have received over the past years and am in disbelief I have come so far with these accounts, my goal was 10,000$ a bitcoin when I first purchased any bitcoin period and here we stand as bitcoin wallet holders in 2020 and wow was I correct.",

And this would mean that you can prove you had an account there and they will provide you your private keys or a working account.\"Anyone from bitcoin\" clearly cannot help you. That's is not a private company and the only way to access those funds is if you have the private keys.",

This is a lesson learned for me because this could be me if I am not careful with my wallets, hope you can claim them and give us an update if you can.He has three addresses in Blockchain web wallet, which is as having one. Someone more sensible would have one there, another in a Trezor and another in a Ledger Nano. Most importantly, he would have the keys safely stored in different places, but he is saying he was 18 at the time so it's not so surprising.",
