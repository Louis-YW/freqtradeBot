IMO, you have to very ignorant at this point to think otherwise.Is Bitcoin really freedom money?I used to worry about this too, when BTC was flowing into the accounts of whales in this market instead of becoming a means of payment or an asset for everyone. This could really affect the level of market manipulation in the future, when the majority of the circulating supply is already in the hands of the wealthy and allows them to pump/dump to create volatility and maximize profits. I don't like this at all, I don't want to be just a small fish in the waves created by whales.However, BTC belongs to everyone, meaning everyone has the right to buy, own and use BTC, including large organizations with billions of dollars in assets. We cannot prevent them from doing so, just as they cannot prevent us from buying or moving BTC. I think this is part of a free market and it is up to us, including small investors and whales, to shape the future of BTC together.Right now, I don't know what the future of BTC will be, maybe it will become a global reserve asset, or just a financial instrument similar to stocks in the hands of whales.",

      "body": "If by \"infiltrated by the global elite\" you mean they are buying and holding Bitcoin, then yes I do.However they're not necessarily infiltrating anything. I think some people like to believe that the international system of money is controlled by elite people, but I don't think that's the truth. The reality is that the global system of money is very fragmented and disconnected, and it's like an old codebase which has slowly over time had millions of developers add their own parts to it, without ever really understanding how each and every part of the code works or why it exists. There are definitely people who understand the cycles of our money system in terms of debt, credit, inflation and interest rates, and with analysis use this to make better business and financial decisions, however I don't believe they have a \"control\" over it. Bitcoin can still be seen an escape from the traditional financial system, even by the elite. They themselves would understand how broken and disconnected it is, and investing in Bitcoin for them is essentially a hedge against everything collapsing",

It is true with fiat currency and is true with Bitcoin. They can accumulate a lot of bitcoins, become one of Bitcoin whales, appear in Bitcoin rich list but they can not control the Bitcoin network that is decentralized.Even if you have 51% of Bitcoin network hashrate, what will you do?Seriously you will not do 51% attack on Bitcoin network, because it only creates massive panic, fear on the market and value of bitcoins you have will drop a lot. It is not what you want by owning bitcoin, you want to get rich, richer with Bitcoin. You don't want to get poorer with it so no worry about 51% attack because it does not bring benefit to attackers.",

IMO, you have to very ignorant at this point to think otherwise.I do not know how you came to a conclusion that the participation of the global elite in Bitcoin market ecosystem has something to do with the control of the population but one thing is sure, they are here to take advantage and take profit on Bitcoin market.QuoteIs Bitcoin really freedom money?Not entirely because using Bitcoin in legal means still needs the regulation of the government, but I believe Bitcoin offers freedom of transaction where one doesn't need the approval of the government to do transactions.",

For so long a time, centralized exchanges have always been the dominant players in the market, but to those who prefer to stick to Bitcoin's decentralized and peer-to-peer principles, they can still do their thing. Although the principled members of the community as well as their spaces may be getting smaller and smaller, I believe they can't be totally erased. But rather than being passive, I guess some sort of active resistance is important. The wrong influence should be pushed away. I think education ang spreading awareness mean a lot.",

On the other hand, BTC is indeed one of the attractive investment options, both the public in general and the global elite in particular especially with the presence of blockchain technology innovations like today, then another point of view there is also great profit potential if you invest in it, but this will also not run away from the basic concept. The concept is free money, free from the control of any third party and is still relevant in my opinion.",

I don't think that they have any power in the system anyway, if they try and manipulate the market, a lot of us already knows what to do and it's not like we're going down without a fight if they've invested a lot of money to buy more bitcoins, we can slowly accumulate our own bitcoins too and it's not like we're going to be losing a lot, those that are trading futures might lose but the hodlers won't fall easily, depending on how brave you are against sudden price crashes and the allure of panic selling, you probably won't worry about how these global elites are invested in bitcoin.",

What I mean is, one of the major problems in the current financial system that we live in, is the fact that money isn't accessible to everyone. Yes, most people have access to a bank, but banks don't operate the same way throughout the whole planet.
