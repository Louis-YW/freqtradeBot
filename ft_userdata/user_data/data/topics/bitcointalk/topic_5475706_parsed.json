I'm afraid I have no choice to stay with adsenseThat's it, if your website's content is not crypto-related or say 40-50% of its content is not in crypto, you won't be accepted on these ad network especially in coinzilla. The site i managed is both run in adsense and cointraffic, but since most users uses ad blockers or browsers have built-in blockers, profit is not that good, especially in cointraffic. The number of site visits and number of displayed ads shows are not comparable in any sense.",

I'm afraid I have no choice to stay with adsenseI've looked around a bit in the A-Ads platform, although not from the point of view of the publisher but of a potential advertiser. When you create a campaign (you don't have to register, you can simply try it out), they offer traffic explicitly also from non-crypto sites, like entertainment, (non-crypto) finance, adult, \"community sites\", blogs, Goods and Services, Technology and even Science and Education. The pricing model seems to heavily favour sites which are visited by other visitors than the typical crypto audience, because only one impression per IP counts for the share you get from the rates (see this thread). So maybe it's worth a try.Unfortunately, for other reasons (no CPC pricing model is offered, only a variant of CPM with \"unique impressions\") it's not the platform for my needs so I can't provide experiences, and I've also not used it as a publisher.",

If I would be creator with website accepted on Adsense, I would stick with it. Unless getting paid in BTC is very important for you.And as said above, if yoyr website content isn't mainly related with crypto, most likely that best networks simply won't accept you. Offcourse, you can try alternatives like A-Ads, but when you have Adsense, it's just not worth IMO.",

All Bitcoin ad networks are primarily intended for crypto-related sites because their advertisers are from the crypto business and it is logical that it should be so. Unless you have massive traffic, you will probably be accepted anywhere, although again you have to have at least a roughly related topic of the site. For example, if you are engaged in exercises for weight loss, crypto advertisers have nothing to offer on your pages.You can try Bitmedia.io, they had perhaps slightly simpler conditions for accepting new publishers.btw. OP what is your monthly traffic?",
