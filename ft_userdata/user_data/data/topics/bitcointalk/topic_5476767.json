AI, Gaming and DEFI are popular and you should also add WEB3 and metaverse based coins. Get at least 3 of each kinds. Large cap coins are mostly stable and less risky while low cap and new coins have higher chances of bringing larger profits.Predicting the market is hard. It's said that current rise is due to the upcoming halving of BTC and the price fall around and after the halving. So, this is time for rising.But the bitcoin trend has not equally transfered to alts and we don't know if it actually it.In my experience, Bitcoin would surely test the 30K resistance after the halving.",

Any project that is making advertisement in the forum is a good project to invest in because before a project spend money to do advertisement they are ready to stay. Therefore I will recommend the following projects for you to invest. Eloncoin, Ethereum, dogecoin and Litecoin and add it with Bitcoin. Bitcoin will not revisit $30,000 again before the halving but instead it will be more than $45k.  Look well before you invest in altcoins.",

I think tokens in this category will also be well affected by the increase in Bitcoin (BTC) prices during the halving. This is just my free advice, don't think too much about it.Quote from: zigger33 on December 06, 2023, 01:34:12 PMwhat top 1-5 coins of each of the sectors would you recommend ?  which have a good background and solid fundamentals ?The tokens from the various sectors that you mentioned previously are neatly arranged on Coinmarketcap according to their fundamentals. Stronger the fundamentals, the higher a token will rank in the Coinmarketcap rankings. So no need to be confused here, you just need to visit the links below:AI & Big Data: https://coinmarketcap.com/view/ai-big-data/Gaming: https://coinmarketcap.com/view/gaming/DeFi: https://coinmarketcap.com/view/defi/Quote from: zigger33 on December 06, 2023, 01:34:12 PMwhat would be the best time to start buying them ? now  ore before halfing  ore after halving ?IMO, it would be better to go as fast as you can before the halving happens, because if Bitcoin (BTC) continues to rise, you will benefit from the pairing side.Quote from: zigger33 on December 06, 2023, 01:34:12 PMwhat do you think if the ETF would dissalow BTC how would this impact ALTCOINS ?  how badly would they fall ?Of course, if a bad impact happens to Bitcoin (BTC), then the whole crypto will also be affected, how far the altcoins will fall, I don't know.Quote from: zigger33 on December 06, 2023, 01:34:12 PMdo you think BITCOIN will revisit 30K before halving ?Dafuq, it has 0.01% to happen (IMO) .",

There are also meme coins like the one in my signature , to add to your curiosity or portfolio or other meme coins.Etf bitcoin is a good tool, I enjoy these two opposite directions, at that time I just tried and for me etf only adds to the fun, there are still loyal bitcoin traders even though there are those who like etf, with new price bubbles, like there is a pond in the pond.For price increases for me, of course there are additions if this etf is fully approved and buying altcoins with cold money / spare money is also good while waiting, all of this will have potential. although the potential for altcoin dumps is not only triggered by bitcoin, including pumps can also be with a smooth market capitalization in an altcoin or a solid community and the altcoin is very helpful for everyone.",
