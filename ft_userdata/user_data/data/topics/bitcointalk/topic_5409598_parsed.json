You know it's hard to believe what you're saying, actually it's easy to make up a story just to talk about something, but if you tell a story to make other people believe you, you don't show any proof that you actually bought something from an exchange that you took a picture of screenshot anyway, and when the price kicked 0.55$ each of Hex as you say and you have proof of screenshot that you have a balance of 500k HEX in the exchange, maybe in that matter I will believe in you dude. And it's not that I don't trust you, it's just that if you want the story to be credible and believable, you must accompany it with sources of evidence at least.",

But isn't it HEX is still a scam coins though?Anyhow, we have a lot of regrets and missed opportunities, XRP's I have a ton of that, was able to acquire during the bear market, but then I have to sell early because I needed some money.It could have been huge if I was able to sold off during it's ATH, same with ETH, I have bought when it went so low below $100.00. But I didn't hold that long and suddenly it went as high as $4k in 2021.",

I didn't have the courage to buy it while it was just starting. Worse, I even sold all my Ethereum in cash back then from all the bounties that I gained and sold for Ethereum. A lot of missed opportunities but I don't regret it that much because what I gained is more valuable and it's the experience.",

That's right, Hex is not a scam coin. HEX It's not made to try and make a quick buck. These are serious players in the crypto world, and you need to pay attention to what they are doing. I think HEX is a long term investment especially if you multiply your initial investment several times.",

However, I believe that it isn't late for me to invest in Bitcoin again so as much as possible, I'm accumulating more of it yearly because I don't want to have the same regrets again.",

The only thing that will always become my mistake is not selling at the peak price. that means if i were always selling after the peak price already reached and the price goes down a little bit. that's maybe my biggest mistake in crypto. i may do that so many times. Missing the biggest opportunity to make bunch money will always become a big mistake in my life. I must have learned to be careful with movement in the market.",

From bitcoin to shitcoins, I think I can include all of them, since there was a considerable fluctuation in price related to the cryptocurrency in question.In every bullish markets most of us have missed hundreds of opportunities in crypto. Partially because we aren't omnipotent and omnipresent, so we can't afford the whole market, investing in every cryptocurrencies at same time, but in fact we miss opportunities mainly because of fear and aversion to risk. We don't want to sacrifice our confort zone to make investments we aren't sure how long they will take until returning profit to us.And only after all, when the fluctuations have already happened we are taken by a regret feeling which makes us go back in time to change our decisions.If I could, I would simply purchase most bitcoins as possible for $400 each 7 years ago. 17,000% profit by 2021...",
