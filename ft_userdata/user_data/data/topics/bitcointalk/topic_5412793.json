Both have a shady history of selectively scamming their players as evidenced by the numerous negative reviews online. It is probably for a good reason that 1XBET is banned in many countries around the world, including their home country Russia.Quote from: dataispower on September 07, 2022, 10:18:46 PM~ nobody have state 1xbet have scam the before or run away with their fund.That is a completely false statement. 1XBET has scam accusations almost as much (maybe more) than 1xbit, and they are blacklisted on almost all popular casino review sites, including AskGamblers, ThePOGG, BTCGOSU, and many others.",

It is just a common sense that made me conclude firmly that they are owned by same individuals. See my reasons;If company A has similar domain name with company B, company A doesn't scam but company be does. If they aren't related, company A would make public notice disassociating itself from company B, it could also take legal action against company B.But in the case of 1xbet and 1xbit, both seems unconcerned and never had the strong will to explain their distinction without any trace of doubt.What I have to say is that the parent company decided to use one brand name for fiat casino and the other for online. While they are very shady to a high extent with the cryptocurrency version 1xbit, they seems to be doing nice with 1xbet the fiat version.Then, if you scam with one branch of you and become a saint in the other, you can't be trusted. The similarity they share apart from name is their ability to invest much in promotions. So, you can try as much as possible to avoid both.",
