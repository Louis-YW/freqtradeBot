I would love to know so I can see what people are interested and there reasoning for it.. Im stacking up on bitcoin and some few altcoins such as avalanche, fantom and this new evm evmos. I love staking and farming and I am keep staking on those projects.On fantom there are good farming projects like spiritswap with tons of pairing and even rewards for voting. Evmos has a good daily rewards and avalanche a normal L1 with a lot of improvements such as subnets. There are other choices but it will depend on what you like.",

      "body": "Matic has been growing even in the bear market which is why I am trying to grab more of it because there are also companies adopting the Polygon chain. There are others that I have bought but it's the Matic that I have been staking up among the altcoins. Jsut buying every time it dips back below 0.80 as I'm still unsure if I have to grab a ton of it since this slight jump in BTC price might just be a bull trap again as it always did in the past.",

We just touched the price of $21k right before the end of January, this could be a good start but of course correction can still happen for a more healthy up trend. Iâ€™ve been buying some top altcoins and Bitcoin of course, and I can say now its totally worth it because the market is getting better now and green days are coming.",

Now that crypto market is becoming interesting again, I'm not feeling confident in letting my coins in third party platforms. Greedy scammers are everywhere, especially at the command of exchanges, so we must be careful, as once they see the market pumping I don't know what might pass through their minds, but something like taking advantage of users' funds for more profit is not only possible, as also likely.",

So maybe we will not see that huge profit in 2024/25, but I'm going to take that risk.No meme or shit coins for me, so besides, ETH, I'm also deep on BNB as well. Good to have this altcoin as well to be some hedge in my portfolio as it could really be valuable as well in the future.",

I would love to know so I can see what people are interested and there reasoning for it.. I bought some Cosmos (Atom) for a few weeks or so when it was at around 10 $. Recently after the last dumps i could have even bought it for around 8,50$ per coin but so far i am pretty happy with that purchase. Right now i am pretty unhappy with my decision making to be honest, because i was monitoring NEAR for at least a few weeks now and when it was at 1,30$ i still thought it would go close to 1$ and then i wanted to buy. Now during the last few days i also was always close to buy a few near but i was always waiting for the setback because it went up quite a lot. Now we are at 2,20 per NEAR so yeah . If it goes below 2$ again i will buyÂ  a few i think.I don't think that this is the start of a real bull market yet.",

Your portfolio is different, I don't know if anyone is like you, but you are the first on this forum that doesn't invest in bitcoin and only invests in altcoins. Most people on this forum are very interested and focused mainly on bitcoin. You say you are happy for bitcoin to go up and hope bitcoin can hit 60k, but why don't you hold any bitcoins? While bitcoin will definitely recover and hit ATH, altcoins are uncertain, investing in altcoins is very risky, and many altcoins will never be able to recover.",
