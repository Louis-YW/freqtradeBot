  "content": "Does Africa need a single digital currency to prosper. 1) Transaction is instant. This eliminates cash flow issues for small traders in Africa. Transaction cost is minute, with no monthly bank fees. All transactions are visible for everyone to see on the Blockchain. No confusion about whether the payment was made or not. 2) By managing your own finances makes you understand money better. Once you understand the money you become more business savvy. Once you are business savvy your chances of getting out of poverty will increase. [. 3) The need to understand technology is eliminated since the whole operation is done inside the wallet. Makes it easy for a rural farmer with very little technical knowledge can still manage his own money properly. 4) The ability to trade internationally will open up a huge market for small businesses in Africa. Imagine the size of the market for a small trader selling local artefacts to 8 Billion potential customers. 5) Every African with a mobile phone can buy and sell products internationally instantly. On top of that these projects think Africa needs a single digital currency.Akoin | Oduwa Coin | AlkebuLAN | Sango  If you think Africa needs a single digital currency support these projects.",

Simply using Bitcoin wouldn't help them achieve what they are trying to achieve. For instance, Akoin is building a brand new city in Senegal where only Akoin will be the official currency, Sango has different use cases for their coin, and Alkebulan wants to build schools & other necessary projects in rural Africa. These won't be possible if they just adopt Bitcoin.To say that Africans don't have the knowledge to use such technology is very condescending.

I didn't generalize Africans, i am just saying that scammers hope that their prey is stupid enough not to see the scam. What you are doing here is the technique that scammers love to use and thats praising them for being smarter then others because they want to invest. I would be very surprised if this wasn't going to end up being a scam. Like literally all the failed city coins out there.",

I am not saying that we shouldn't have one, but officially there can't be because not all nations will agree to this and governments will not want to. Even something like euro which is used by many European nations but still a fiat currency, would have worked amazingly for Africa, because it would allow them all to grow together, and would allow them to walk free to each other in a European union type of stuff.But, they won't and that's the problem. And if we are talking about nothing official by the governments, like a legal tender, then we could always use bitcoin and there is no need for any other project at all, just let them all use bitcoin.",

A single digital currency can surely help but this is not the most important thing for Africa to prosper. It's can be seen as a cost cutting initiative which can also bring transparency into their financial framework. Only having a digital currency can't help!",

With the proceeds, he is building a crypto city in Senegal. Akoin will be the official currency in Akoin City. Sango is owned by the Central African Republic. CAR is the second country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender. Sango city is another crypto city which will enable any crypto project in the world to set up their company in Sango city. CZ of Binance flew to CAR recently to discuss a partnership with CAR. Two outcomes can come out of this visit. 1) Binance set up an African branch in CAR 2) Sango gets listed in Binance.Poverty-stricken Africa is fed up with feeding the colonials and starting to move toward a free and prosperous Africa. With a total population of 1.3 billion Africa doesn't need the consent of anyone to become successful. With the number of natural resources, it can easily overtake USA or China.",

And it seems that those coin mentioned hasn't prosper as well and perhaps the continent itself can't and will not have a single digital currency to begin with.So stick to BTC and for sure they will be just fine. Of course each government can have their own CBCD's an digital money, but if people are looking for crypto, it's better be the one - Bitcoin, no need to complicated things for them.",
