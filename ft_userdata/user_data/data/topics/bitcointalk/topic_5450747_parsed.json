  "content": "The journey so far on this platform has not been that easy. At first it was a panic and frightening one as I was afraid of being kicked out of the platform as a newbie who knows nothing much on how the forum operates.. I became nervous and also was careful of my words, works and activities here and gradually building myself on bitcoin information and education. I had to read through the forum policies, guidelines and posts from high ranked and reputable members here to keep abreast. In other to be a part of the bitcoin movement after the much studies here I had to take the bitcoin movement to my locality where I recorded many huge successes for which I uploaded here for the community to see some of my works while some I did not bother uploading them. So far the awareness and adoption I had engaged are very much successful (you are free to check my created topics on my bio to see my uploads)Achieving a thousand post here  isn't an easy task as It took me commitment, zeal, passion, dedication and encouragement from which I drew my strength. The following  board members I would salute for their encouragement; @The Cryptovator, @fillippone, @The Sceptical Chymist, @Yahoo62278, @Royse777, @CryptopreneurBrainboss, @Igebotz @Ratimov, @o_e_l_e_o, @DdmrDdmr, @JayJuanGee, @LoyceV @lionheart78 and lots too many to mention.I would not forget to talk about my campaign experience. At first, my first campaign I applied for was managed by @yahoo62278. It was very interesting and competitive so I had to put in all my best to making sure I maintained my spot a as member rank. It also sharpened and shaped me more on making good contributions in  posts and comments which I had built my base on till the campaign was finally over and it was a successful one as I rose through ranks and I was not removed. Secondly, @Royse777 managed the second campaign I applied for and I was successfully accepted into the campaign which is still currently running. I also have learnt a lot from his management as he contributed in making me good at my work. I further developed the passion  in continuity and exercise for which I had long started on this platform and achieving successes. Many would say a thousand post isn't a new thing as many have climbed above it but to me it is a fit achieved as the task is not as easy as they think it is. I know my activities are gradually building likewise my rank  which requires me more merits but commitment and good contributions are my goals as I appeal for a review on my works, post and contributions to be merited accordingly.Lastly, I will also use this medium to encourage new members joining bitcointalk platform to make it a priority by first reading through the forum policies and guidelines so as to be able to  make good contributions and know how the platform operates in other for them to be able to scale through without having any issues.",

It is very hard to work on this road but with commitment and devotion in reading every post words to words for you to be able to understand what they saying or what the board is really saying is were the problems lies, i have seen lots of newbies who just came onboard starts carving and crazy for merits while looking at their post they hardly make good contribution to the forum that could warrants them earn good merits that may likely positioned them to the next rank they desired. I won't have to go more further because I believe this is not your end rather is just beginning I believe there are more bigger things to come. So I join hands say Congratulations on reaching 1k post. Just as Nwada001 said earlier it will be ideal you move this thread to the reputation board here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=129.0 Goodluck!",

But anyway, I thought it would be great idea to post celebration like this in one of the provided thread, it will keep the reputation board main page views in order. @CryptSafe, keep up the good work and congrats on your new milestone. 1000 posts doesn't mean much if they are just spam or useless, but you look different. Stay consistent, your journey in this forum is still too young and you still need to get some more new milestones in the coming years.",

The thread created for this kind of thread is not necessary that user should post in there and follow the OP of the thread since it’s not an official thread for things like things. Creating a thread dedicated for someone achievement is not a daily event that can cause spam in the reputation board. This thread will surely be flooded after few days. Why not just give the man a spotlight for this moment. Having a thousand post in the forum only show how many hours dedicated here just to write the content.",

Uh, yeah.  Might as well say what I really think:  OP is posting about a milestone that plenty of shitposters have blown past in pursuit of whatever riches those bounties offer, and from reading the first line about him immediately being scared of breaking the rules....I'm betting this is an alt account of another one that got banned.I also think all of those names were listed (in goddamn Twitter format) because they're mostly merit sources and are well-known in the Meta section and OP is trying to get some merits by creating another one of these let's-all-get-in-a-circle-and-jerk threads that, by this point, are starting to get under my skin.Quote from: CryptSafe on May 01, 2023, 05:31:19 PMI will appreciate if you reconsider and do a review on my posts once more  for evaluation.I just un-ignored a bunch of sections and took a look at the first page of your post history.  Here's one of the first posts I came across (I snipped the quote you were replying to):Quote from: CryptSafe on May 01, 2023, 01:32:42 PMDoing business is a normal thing enterprises do but their interest is always paramount which we all know so they can go to any extent to protect it without thinking what it would cost them as long as they have a way to cover their shaddy deal that is ok for them. So manipulation of softwares at their own benefit to the detriment of their players is not a thing of worry to them as they find and derive pleasure in doing such. This makes me believe that games lost by bettors or gamblers are not just a lose game but a manipulative one from casinos as a result of their position in setting up the game for the player, manipulating game softwares and doing everything necessary to make sure they gain at all costs.You're the kind of member whose English matters to me when I'm giving out merits.  It's one thing to not know the language but still make a reasonably coherent post that's constructive, and it's quite another to squat and squeeze out a bloated turd like the above.  That's horrible writing, not at all interesting, and I doubt other members would find it valuable in the least.",
