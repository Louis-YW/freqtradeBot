The last archived page[1] of Preev was in June 21, in which it was still online. So is seems that this issue was just recent.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20220621203650/http://preev.com/",

About 24 hours ago, I saw the price of 1 BTC = 20,820 and I said to myself that the price looks good. However, I'm not seeing any chances in the last couple of hours and when I try to refresh the page it throw me some error. So I have to used CMC or coingecko for a quick glance.All we can do is wait for the owner and hopefully he will renew it.",
