What do you think about it?It's very interesting to hear the opinion of experienced players and people who are versed in this subject.Casinos hire streamers to gamble on their website and stream it. Usually, these fake streamers gamble with a lot of money that casino credits to them. Their duty is to express their emotions during gambling, to show anger when they lose and break keyboard and do some shit in order to make video go viral and collect many views. They have to be super happy and express happiness when they win. They have to look like real, genuine gamblers with genuine and heightened emotions.Think about it, these streamers create their channel in order to earn money, otherwise they wouldn't create channel. So, they earn money from youtube streams, donations, merch and also earn wage from casinos for playing on their website. Their streams are usually done very professionally. Definitely all of these streamers are fake. Watch them only for fun, never believe to their winnings and loses, they sometimes fake it to attract new customers.",

Streaming is a form of advertisement. It’s dumb to call the stream fake or misleading while they are just streaming for content purposes.",

Fake artists and experts are on top of the industry simply because they've been put there.The reason why they are so popular is, imo, a very well elaborated plan and design by their sponsors, and effective execution thanks to the resources that they have available. It's sad that many good professionals will desist early because the rules of the game are not the same for everyone.",

Some even argue that Kick started when Twitch started banning streamers promoting online casinos last year.QuoteWhy such streamers are very popular?It seems a lot of people have plenty of time in their hands so they watch these content creators and streamers. Maybe you can blame the change in lifestyle due to the advancement of technology. More people staying in their couch or room while watching streams and playing video games all day.",

Of a truth,  I never believe or watch any of those influencers because I already know what their aims are and how some of them have promoted proven scams in recent times.",

This is what the society wants to watch since they can express what they really want without censoring their content. This is the problem on mainstream media which there’s no control on the content unlike TV program and movie which being screen first before broadcast to the public.The first batch of streaming which is the casting is much doesn’t rather this current social media that has zero content and 100% garbage swearing especially on gambling.",

Especially in online casino streamers, there's no reason to stream your degeneracy if you're not gaining something from it. Take whatever they say with a grain of salt, and do not be tempted by the wins that these streamers are getting on their account. They sometimes have boosted rates which do not apply with the regular account. If you need to learn something from a casino, especially its games, fairness, and overall experience for users, seek out reputable review sites or this forum and see whether someone has already played on there.",

It's like a fake YouTube university and I mention this in every post of mine where peeps think that they can actually gain pretty awesome knowledge from such YouTube channels, Twitch streamers and basically anything gets published on social media. They show you what you want to see, they don't show you what can demoralize you.  The simple solution is to avoid such channels and never try to gain any motivating experience from the online streaming sites. You can watch the streams but only from the reputed casinos themselves. If you gonna fall for the individual infamous channels then man, you never know what green screen effects they are displaying to us.",

And often, the fake accounts that they always win in their livestreams are actually just dummy accounts.And they are also paid a lot, to be honest, for every time they promote a casino in their video. It's around 200-300 dollars; if you only promote five of their casinos in a week, you have 1000 dollars that are ringing; it's easy money for them.",

But those streamers became famous since they put an impression to new gamblers or to those people watching their stream that its easy for them to earn a lot of money thru gambling that's why they create an impression to few people that they became rich just because of gambling they stream. Don't know how that article define but for us watchers maybe we should ignore what those people trying to show us and let just be entertained on them for streaming but if they say something that we need to follow then its better for us to use our brain and never get ourselves got caught up by the any words they say.We should play according to our will and to the style we develop thru experience since those streamers are doing that activities just for the sake of their own profits.",
