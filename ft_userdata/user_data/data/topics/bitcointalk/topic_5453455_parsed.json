      "body": "But you needed to calculate 2^N candidates for N bits, and with no access to the private key and original nonce*, you don't know which of these 2^N results are the correctly reduced one. For finding nonces where this program might give useful results, BSGS or Kangaroo is much better and faster.I mean, it's a nice trick generating valid signatures (got k/2 working, still stumped on (k-1)/2) but it's not worth any money.* (I assume your program doesn't need this, because if it does, it's doubly useless)",
