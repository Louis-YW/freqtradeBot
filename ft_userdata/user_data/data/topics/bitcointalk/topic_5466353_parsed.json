Despite mounting gun control laws on the Federal and state level, school-related shootings continue to rise (2023 being the highest year yet, with 388 school shootings in only six months). Regardless of political affiliation or thoughts on well-regulated militias and the right to bear arms, one thing is clear; what we’ve been doing for the past forty years isn’t working.Each school shooting incident in America reflects one thing, children are vulnerable. Schools tend to be easy targets while simultaneously producing mentally ill individuals with an unstoppable intent to harm others.Unfortunately, we still have a lot to learn about school shootings. There are a lot of unanswered questions.

Of course, the clock is ticking down to the next horrific headline, so we need to start these meaningful conversations now.Continue reading Gun-Free School Zones & Shootings Statistics (2023 Updated) on Ammo.com!",

Democrats say it is the easy access to guns and Republicans it is anything but guns: mental health, demons, lack of a good uprising, etc. While I agree mental health has a very important impact on the occurrence of this mass shootings in American schools, Republican politicians and lawmakers still refuse to fund easily available mental healthcare. They must be that afraid of anything resembling socialism, to the point of not being coherent to their own theory on what originates this acts of mass destruction.If you say it is mental health, then the next time the GOP is supposed to do is pass as many laws as possible to guarantee anyone who feels depressed, suicidal or fantasies with murder gets the counceling and medication they need to save their life and other's.",

The best strategy to control these senseless killings should be to restrict gun ownership because the root cause of this problem is easy access to firearms. We have had cases of young children killing their teachers and pupils not because of mental health issues but unhindered access to firearms. If guns are easy to access it will make people with mental issues channel their grievances to shoot and kill people. In my country, many people are suffering from mental health but it is not expressed in shootings because nobody has access to guns except law enforcement agencies. There are powerful gun manufacturing companies and unions that are lobbying the legislature to block laws that will regulate gun ownership in the US. Except the government realizes that they need to take drastic action on this matter,  I am sorry the killings might keep increasing.",

In France, we have a different approach to gun ownership with strict regulations and limited access. This has contributed to lower incidents of gun violence. It's crucial for societies to engage in open dialogues and explore comprehensive solutions that prioritize safety and well-being for all.",

If you want no mass shootings, guns should be banned nationwide, which means giving up your 2nd Amendment and you guys are no longer \"free.\" However, no gun doesn't mean there won't be any violence in school since murder can be done without firearms. Here in 3rd world countries, students often fight with a farm sickle, knife, sword, etc., that leads to someone's death. It's just youngsters are still mentally unstable and the school environment isn't helping, or probably only makes it worse. If you only focus on the gun, you are missing the real problem. But yeah, a mad kid with a sword is easier to control than a mad kid with an AR-15.",

It would be more a job about looking for those who show the red flags of suffering from mental illnesses like depression, antiexy, social isolation, psychopathy, etc. Engaging those problems with medication and therapy so those affected by mental illness can look forward the future with optimism and hope, instead descending a terrible death spiral where they could end up deciding to take their own life or the life of others.However all of it requires an investement which the GOP does not seem to be eager to pass into law, as they are with  relaxing gun regulation. Sounds like a recipe for more murder, in my opinion.",

The shooters will be too scared to do their shooting there, because they will realize they might get shot;3.

I think the negligence from the part of the government is deliberate. Because, why can't they simply stop these things from reoccurring. I mean the government can actually reversed it's policies to put a gun control on the citizens at least for period of time whilst they understudy the cases to make available solutions to the problems. As of this year, alone, the news have reported over 470 mass shootings in the US according to the Gun Violence Archive. Now, let's pause a minute. From January 1st of this year to 16th of September (today) is approximately 258 days. If we are to remove the 258 days from the total number of mass shootings for the year as provided by the GVA, then there's around an average of 2 shooting incidents in a day in USA.
