  "content": "I have this token for two years now but it got me surprised today that it was exploited and got dumped to the ground by the hacker. The Poolz finance team announced that they will already taken action on the situation, halted the CEX trading, remove the remaining liquidity on DEX and flagged the hacker's address on explorer. Importantly they promised to fund the liquidity back of the exact amountÂ  that the hacker stole. Now my question is, will the price will be back after they replenish the liquidity back on DEX and resume the CEX trading? The price was $4 before the exploit happen.Hack announcement: https://twitter.com/Poolz__/status/1635900571512197120",

So even though the case already solved, the price will not recover until people's trust back like when it's not get hacked. The situation is quite similar with the LUNA hack, the price is still very low and there's no recover until now.",

The team has said that the project's treasury should be able to cover that amount without issue. Given that, I believe we could see some price recovery once the situation is resolved and the new token contract is deployed.",

The price was $4 before the exploit happen.Learn from the exploited projects from the past. There are many projects that attempted but the price never really recovered. Trust on the security of these platforms is vital on the valuation of these tokens so investors are likely to leave once that's gone.It's a must for you to read the report on the hack if you're still going to support this. What part was exploited and was the team made aware of this vulnerability prior to the hack? Third party audits usually informs project owners but they get ignored too.",

Some projects will close or be hacked, the price of some project tokens will not increase. And if several projects give a good profit, then you will eventually earn.Losses from hacking are small, it is likely that the project team will solve the problem.",

Looking at the chart, they also have had quite a hard time facing a bear market and coupled with the large theft there, this has indeed made them fall even more.Under these conditions, maybe the project owner will do a number of things to make the price return, but looking at the conditions of other projects which have previously experienced the same conditions as this, I think it is very difficult to return, it is even likely that it will not be able to return to normal.",

There's just too much incentive for criminals to try to hack them rather not trying because the payoff and risk ration is way more appealing then hacking physical servers of cexes.",

Most investors of it have followed the dumping scene and that has reduced a lot of liquidity from them and not just that, but also the trust from those investors that have made their decisions to finally leave the project. It's why I've said that OP should no longer expect anything from this project because it's a clear vision that it's already on that pattern of being dead. But who knows if the devs are truthful to their words and they can do something to drive its market off that dying path. With what we've used to see from these projects, the devs have got some influence for their liquidity and market but somehow, this might be the point of their lives that they can't do anything with it anymore.",

There basically is no other chance in such cases most of the time, then to create a new contract and just give that new token to the holders that had the old token before the hack happened. As far as i know this new token is getting audited right now by certik and three other audit companies and should be ready for trading pretty soon.A hack is definitely always a bad thing, but i think the Poolz team handled it as well as such a situation can be handled. We will see how the price will be once the new token is live.",
