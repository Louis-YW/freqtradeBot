  "content": "Heya all,not sure how this actually goes and how the merit source application should look like. I'll try my best here:Who am I?I'm a campaign manager (Cro2 team with Trofo). Together we run competitions (paid pools) in the gambling part of the forum and I spend most of my time there.I'm a BTT member since 2018, constant DT1/DT2 member and 170. in the list of most recognized BTT users.I write mostly in gambling boards (where I also work) and in the Croatian local section. We have enough merit sources there, so I'd spend most of mine in the Gambling boards.What I want to accomplishI want to do my best to improve the gambling section of the forum - to reduce the amount of spam and to encourage/incentivize meaningful discussion there.A lot of members think that the gambling boards are the cesspool of the forum and it would be great if we could try and change that perception a bit.Yep, it's full of spam and yep, people write there to fulfill their campaign quotas - but it's also the place of the forum where BTC is used the most - in pools, sidebets, etc.It has some great topics and great conversations, but it isn't really a part of the forum in which Merits are given that often. By changing that, I feel that we can improve the quality of the posting there little by little.How I'd like to accomplish thatI would announce that a new merit source is available there, exclusively for these boards, one that would merit interesting new threads/topics and meaningful conversations.I hope that, by meriting quality, there would be more incentive for the majority of members to write something meaningful and interesting - because they would finally realize that they can improve their account rank in the gambling boards as well.Examples of the types of posts I'd merit* please note that I just collected these in 10 minutes or so - there are certainly better examples.The posts that would be merited would be OP's of original and interesting threads and posts with some interesting infos/opinions.1. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5460971.msg62599353#msg625993532. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5438071.msg62734618#msg627346183. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5461543.msg62625683#msg626256834. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5461543.msg62657048#msg626570485. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5330519.msg62697565#msg626975656. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406159.msg62723627#msg627236277. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5462153.msg62734775#msg627347758. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5249415.msg54973910#msg549739109. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458296.msg62493294#msg6249329410. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288319.msg62713526#msg62713526Final thoughtsGambling boards are both a horrible place and a great one at the same time - depending on which threads you read.I'd like to tip the scale in favor of the great ones a bit.",

It seems that there is a kind of unspoken rule that no merits be given in the gambling section.

I didn't know that another person has the same mindset with me.It is true that there are alot of spams in the gambling board, especially gambling discussion mega threads but there are still merit worthy posts that are often buried so fast.",

I'm already familiar with your works and integrity that you have on the forum so you're good to go. I hope theymos look into this appeals and grant new source because it's looking like merits is begining to reduced or not circulating round the forum properly. It feels like merit is saturated on some specific boards and you can't expect everyone to be knowledge on one board so people in other board's should be granted sources to take care of those boards. I also spend time in the gambling board (sport discussion) although we have lost of spams over there but there are some users that spend time to composed their posts and you'll know they aren't spamming but contributing to healthy discussion. No board should be overlooked, every board should be accounted for therefore I support your application cryptofrk, good luck on your application.",

Those boards we claim are producing healthy posts and discussions are doing so because of the presence of merit source's allocated to those boards and every member posting their is striving to have his posts gain attention to be rewarded by putting in more work quality into their posts, and am convince same feat can be achieved at least to some extent if theymos make for a merit source to the gambling board.",

As far as I know you from the Croatian board, I believe that you will manage such an opportunity sensibly. Honestly, I'm not sure how much the gambling section is a priority for this forum so it is necessary to improve it with additional merits. What I noticed on the part of theymos (or who already approves such things), through merit sources, they tried to strengthen the discussion in the sections about the Bitcoin talks and after that the local boards. Gambling is already represented well here, if we ignore the bounty section, it seems that more than 50% of the daily posts come from there. Will this become a gambling forum?",

While I believe I gain merits there now, the majority of my earlier gains, to make legendary anyway, were from Bitcoin-only sections.I feel that is a good reflection of previous requirements for quality contributions to promoting and assisting, elevating Bitcoin use. But as OP points out, gambling continues to be a major utility area for Bitcoin. Even beyond the use of it as a currency, gamblers using and transacting in Bitcoin lead to discussions about its technical aspects. Fee specifications, coin control, even signing of txs. I am certain it has become a perpetual gateway for new Bitcoin users.OP knows gambling and the activities related, he would make a solid merit source in that board, in my opinion.",

As a gambling regular and organizer / contributor to many gambling opportunities like ⭐⚽⭐ Sportsbet's Bitcointalk Sports Fanatics League (BSFL) – 7000+$ rewards ⭐⚽⭐, cryptofrka knows very well which posts should be merited and in addition to that, cryptofrka is reading there a lot, so any additional sMerit is well spent there. There's so much spam, so giving out Merit for quality posts can be a factor to encourage people to create better posts. Our gambling section is really in dire need against Shitposters and their shenanigans. I've tried to give out some Merit on that board but it's quite hard to wade throught the spam sometimes (well, it's always hard). I believe cryptofrka will do a good job over there as a Merit source.  +1",

Everyone does not support unfair odds, ridiculous terms of service, or KYC checks to ban accounts. You are talking like whoever participates in the gambling section they are supporting those casinos.If so, you are doing the same thing, my friend. Do you always see people visit the casino ANN thread and praise like OMG, this is the most trusted casino, please play here. People visit those sections to check what's going on On those platforms. They criticize platforms if they see something unfair. I do not see any reason why you are calling it an unethical board. Not all threads are casino ANN.",
