      "body": "MicroStrategy joining the Nasdaq 100 is definitely a noteworthy event, and it could have positive implications for Bitcoin. As a company with a pro-Bitcoin stance and significant Bitcoin holdings, MSTR’s inclusion might lead more investors to look at Bitcoin as an asset class, especially since institutional investment is often driven by companies in major indexes like the Nasdaq 100. This added exposure could spark more buying interest in Bitcoin, particularly among those who are looking for indirect exposure through stocks like MicroStrategy.While the effect on Bitcoin directly might be gradual, the long-term narrative of institutional adoption and support for Bitcoin could receive a boost, reinforcing its legitimacy as a financial asset. Overall, it's a positive development for Bitcoin, even if the immediate impact on its price remains uncertain",

The allocation amount depends on the company's weighting on the list, and the weighting goes by marketcap.In the case of MSTR, they will use these fresh inflows to buy more bitcoin, which of course will pump the price of bitcoin.MSTR will have a 0.5% weighting on the list which translates to about $2 billion in initial inflows.",

With the business intelligence business they earn about 75 million dollars a year, and with bitcoin they earn thousands. You don't have to think too hard to see what their main business is. Some people even say that they shoul do a spin off to separate the two business.Quote from: avikz on December 17, 2024, 05:05:40 AMMy fear is that many other companies may actively consider investing in Bitcoin after this success of MicroStrategy.

Microstrategy's inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 feels like a big step toward normalizing bitcoin in traditional finance since thee company's so heavily tied to it.I mean, more exposure to microstrategy could indirectly highlight bitcoin to institutional investors who might've been on the fence before.Yep. It was happening even before this news - but with them at the helm, maybe even more big peeps will consider the possibilities for themselves.",

You are definitely right.Who would have thought that a Bitcoin-related company of such a scale would be put on such a list?I think this news is great on many different levels and even though it's a big company fella and its a victory, obviously, - but Saylor proved that there are people who are really into BTC, even on a stage like that. We are reaching new levels of acknowledgment for BTC.",

We can even call $MSTR as a proxy Bitcoin company for now, and with them joining, it will exposed Bitcoin to more investors and who knows, they might be buying secretly or being interested on Bitcoin for next year.",

I can definitely see that happen.however there has been fudders emerging saying that MSTR is at great risk of liquidation whenever BTC goes down deep enough, the thing is, I'm sure MSTR has considered all those things and if any this news just confirmed that MSTR isn't gonna stop DCA-ing BTC all the way to Nasdaq and will probably keep accumulating until their cost average go as high as $100k I guess.",

Yes for me, Microstrategy will be role model and some company may copy what they are doing and Bitcoin will benefit.The company is already a Bitcoin proxy, with Saylor the spokesman for us. And we have seen so many interviews of him saying that Bitcoin is really superior. So it's just a matter of time before some companies will copy his blue print, although it might not be big as Microstatregy.I remember though one cab hailing services CEO years back, when he says that he don't believed in a company putting money on Bitcoin because the high risk involved as Bitcoin is very volatile. But at least Saylor and his company has proven that wrong and on the contrary, they are buying in every dip. So this is another lessons learned for big companies.",
