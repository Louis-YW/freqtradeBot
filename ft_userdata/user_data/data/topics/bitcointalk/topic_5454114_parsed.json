No one gonnna pay the 1000$ for this script with based on your screenshot, the indicator can be repaint and there is no backtest there. at least give us a backtest with result on trading view or just share it your tradingview links with these indicator on itAnd Lasly if you can made on dozen of money by using this indicator would be great if you are using the indicator for yourself right",

Maybe you could post excel sheets in which it indicates what instruments you used like what pair, prices of your trade, timestamp, etc.To get that, you need to extract it from your exchange if it's in CEX or something. It's best to put more information, not just a single line \"win rate XX%\".P.S. I'm kinda worried about what you're saying. \"bankroll\" it's like you're funding your casino gambling.",

      "body": "Good morning allThank you for your replies and legitimate concerns:The code is written in Pine v4Like I said I have been making good money but have 3 figures on my account. Whilst it is rising at a good rate I believe if I can sell this indicator to a few people it will dramatically boost my account.I also see no harm in making the indicator available to a handful of people, especially considering they may not even use it on the same asset as me. I hope the premium price will deter people from wanting to give it away for free beyond that. I would be happy to use a trusted escrow for the transactions. Here is the 2 min ADA backtest:https://ibb.co/PZ5NjFHAnd the 3 min ADAhttps://ibb.co/Hd3LPkwI have found there are a handful of cryptos/ assets it works particularly well on - feel free to request any pairs and I will happily send the results.I choose to trade just one pair because the signals are so regular and correlated within crypto. I don't have the funds to split money across multiple accounts - It also works very well on the SPX on higher timeframes such as one hour:Spx 60 min backtest statshttps://ibb.co/5k1tt2CSPX Visual (I prefer the indicator version rather than the strategy view - for example - Tradigview won't take a second short after the 1st failed if there is no long in-between, but the indicator always shows)https://ibb.co/cb82snxTRX 3 min backtesthttps://ibb.co/prx1WfRTRX Visualhttps://ibb.co/h1vK13KAnd finally - 3 min ADA indicator as an updateHopefully you will start to realise how good the indicator is. Yesterday it seemed a trend started to form on Cardano, most scalping indicators would have been destroyed, mine just got me in at each top and the low to get long again. (Granted I missed the last two as I was asleep)https://ibb.co/kD4HVxDI also have another indicator I have made that works (this one designed specifically for ADA but I can tweak and backtest for other pairs if you are interested) to detect strength on a higher time frames and plots blue diamonds: Above price as a warning not to be long/ not to be aggressive with longs or to hold your shortsBelow price as a warning not to be short/ not to be aggressive with shorts or to hold your longsHere is an image of the backtesthttps://ibb.co/K2QKW62Here is an image as an indicator accompanying the lower time frame systemhttps://ibb.co/r2jKQf3I am happy to provide any further screenshots etc. I can try to do videos but it's a work Laptop I'd rather not be installing software. If anyone is interested I can share my screen via Teams though.I hope you can see that I am genuine and have a product that is truly valuable but happy to help further. I was browsing the forums and saw some idiot try to sell trading services - I also believe there are a lot of noobs on here (no offence) who I can greatly help. If I am in the wrong place and you uys know of anywhere else that my indicators may be better received then I would be grateful for that info.",

I have been working hard learning to code and perfected these scripts in hope of getting out of my situation.I would be happy to sell it for $1k despite you deeming that as 'cheap' I feel If I can sell 5 or 10 of them, It will be a substantial boost to my account which would have taken months to get from where I am to this point.I am happy to provide as much evidence as possible to prove I am genuine and the indicator works on certain assets - feel free to ask me.My conscious is clear because I know the indicator works. And I want to try to prove it to you guys.Thanks for contributing",

      "body": "Hi everyone - thank you for your replies.There's a few conflicting opinions so I will answer individually:'There are many free indicators out there but very effective in trading such as volume, RSI, Stoch and many more.

I would join mentorship program and learn a working strat with only $100, those are real knowledge and would help you on how to read the market's price action.

If you do, I think they might encourage to buy that indicator.'I understand there are programs for $100 but do not feel they represent the same value I am offering, above someone has commented that they wouldn't sell IP like this for less than $10,000. So I think $1,000 is actualy a fair price. And you should be able to see from the plethora of screenshots I have now posted that there is substantial value in this indicator.I also appreciate there are free indicators out there, you have mentioned a handful that requires interpreting to generate bullish or bearish biases. My indicator gives buy and sell signals. It's noob proof. You cannot compare my system to RSI or stoch. There are also free community scripts out there - I have tried many of these and never found anything to grow my account like I have done for 2 weeks using this.'If you are in debt why not use your script to get rich quickly and pay your debt? Why would you sell it to someone without giving proof that you own this script?'I am using the script to get out of debt - and so far it is working. But I stil have a small account. If I can sell the script - speed up my growth and help people that are currently not profitable but want to trade - it's win win.Here is a trade I took today on 2m timeframe on Cardano, I made 5%.https://ibb.co/TcZRhzz'If you are currently working hard to learn to code and perfect this script then there is a big possibility that this script is useless than the free script out there.'I have posted evidence of the scripts value - I am happy to post more if you would like to see anything specifically.

IMO I believe the default indicators and when I lose then I try again.'Right1 or 3 minute scalping is hard I agree - the trick is to know when the low or high is in, because then you can apply leverage. My strategy merely suggests that the low / jigh has printed already and is due for a reversion to the mean.Yes I am new - I have no reason to join the forum previously. But I understand you probably get this often, so the scepticism is fair enough.I am managing my debt but the result is that I do not have spare capital to trade with, unless I put my livelihood at risk.I am using the strategy - you can see above the trade I took earlier.'IMO I believe the default indicators and when I lose then I try again.'Sorry I do not understand what you are saying? Unless you are saying RSI etc works fine. I agree it does - if you can correctly interpret the outputs.Moving forward I am going to post my days trades daily on bybit in this thread. Hopefully you will see first hand the success rate, and ease some concerns that the indicator might be worth trying yourself.Thanks to everyone contributing.",
