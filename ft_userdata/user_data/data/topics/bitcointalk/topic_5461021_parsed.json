  "content": "We proudly announce the FelixCoin Seed Investment Round is open and LIVE. Get your FelixCoin by following the guide in the Home Page. Note this round will only be available during the summer of 2023 or until the first round tokens are sold. If you have any questions feel free to contact us at any time or join our Discord community channel.www.felixcoin.meJoin Our Discord Community https://discord.gg/FxPun5jrYJFelixCoin is a 10 million minted only governance token riding on top of the Ethereum blockchain.Our mission is to create a global financial ecosystem that empowers individuals, businesses, and communities to thrive in the digital age. By leveraging the power of blockchain and smart contract technology, FelixCoin enables fast, borderless transactions with minimal fees, eliminating the need for intermediaries and ensuring trust and security in every transaction.DO YOU HAVE AN EDGE?The FelixCoin project will build a binary outcome gambling website accepting the major liquid cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, et cetera).The players will be betting against each other – NEVER AGAINST THE HOUSE.This fun little platform will be available globally at any time and will allow our users to make a quick buck with their experience.Professional Sports, Global Events, Elections, Entertainment and more anything can come across the table.The design of the betting site will have ease of use in mind. We intend to create the “Google” of online gambling sites where any user can quickly and intuitively use their cryptocurrency deposited on the site to place their bets. Servers and the shell corporation for the gambling website will be domiciled in jurisdictions that will enable “permissionless” operation of our betting platform and “permissionless” use by the users of the platform. The beauty of the internet and cryptocurrency is that both are “permissionless”.DEVELOPMENT TIMELINEOnce our betting site is online and generating revenue, we will have FelixCoin listed for public trade on KuCoin or TradeOgre. This public listing will allow first round investors to exit, if they so wish.We will also use this FelixCoin governance token listing on an exchange to raise funds for our second round where the next 1 million FelixCoin will be offered for sale at roughly 10X the price first round investors bought in. Funds raised in the second round will be used to develop a hybrid CEX/DEX.In addition, profits from the FelixCoin betting site will also be used to code and implement the hybrid CEX/DEX. Registered users will be seamlessly and automatically registered for FelixCoin’s Cryptocurrency Exchange.The same innovative strategies we will be using to advertise, promote and structure the gambling site – will also be used to advertise, promote and structure the hybrid CEX/DEX.After the hybrid CEX/DEX is tightly integrated into our gambling platform, we will offer for sale another 1 million FelixCoin on the hybrid CEX/DEX for the third round at a 5X multiple from the second round funding offer.This third round of funding will be used to set up stablecoins in non-USD currencies. Running stablecoins are extremely lucrative and we intend on creating stablecoins for Chinese Yuan, Indian Rupees, Euros and Swiss Francs to start.Prior to the launch of these stablecoins, the FelixCoin governance token will start paying out rewards in Ethereum from the net profits the gambling site and the hybrid CEX/DEX generate.10 million FelixCoin ERC-20 token limited mintPermissionless gambling site that offers simple binary outcome proposition bets using the major cryptocurrenciesHybrid CEX/DEX cryptocurrency exchange integrated with the gambling siteERC-20 stablecoins in non-USD major fiat currencies integrated with the hybrid CEX/DEXFirst round investors in FelixCoin are guaranteed a 10X return on their investment when the FelixCoin token is listed on an exchange.For example: if the first round values 1 Felixcoin = 1.00 USDT, Then the second round of 1 million FelixCoin will be offered for sale at 1 FelixCoin = 10.00 USDT on KuCoin or TradeOgre. The third round of 1 million FelixCoin will be offered for sale at 1 FelixCoin = 50.00 USDT on our hybrid CEX/DEX.The free floating price of FelixCoin will depend on 2 factors: Speculation and the net profits generated from the gambling site, the hybrid CEX/DEX, our stablecoins and any further projects developed by the FelixCoin team.Once the hybrid CEX/DEX is up and running, rewards in Ethereum will be paid out to holders of the FelixCoin governance token on an annual basis. The amount of Ethereum distributed will depend on the net profits for all FelixCoin projects that year.Our Discordhttps://discadia.com/felixcoinTo verify that you are indeed talking to QNam, please note the red “Chairman” tag role that the authentic QNam has.The Seed round has started.",
