  "content": "I came here out of desperation. I am looking for an emergency USDT loan. My funds are being held in my TRUST wallet until I pay capital gains taxes. I have confirmation from customer service, once the taxes are paid, my funds will be immediately released and even are giving me an ETH award that is double the tax amount once paid. I obviously have no collateral because these funds are being held. Is there any company that provides such a loan? Thank you.",

If another person is involved that you do not know, know that the person only want to scam you.Although Trustwallet is a close source wallet and not reputable because of that in my opinion, but you have your seed phrase and you still have the full control over your own money on the wallet. Although, we can not fully trust a close source wallet.I have not heard that Tether Lab seized USDT on noncustodial wallet because of tax before. If you sell or trade, you can be taxed, but no tax for sending crypto according to what I have known before.",

Thank you.When any sites ask for a small amount of deposit (eg: 1$) then it might be acceptable but when it ask a good number of amount or large amount then it is 100% scam. Think yourself  if they can give you double of the amount then why they will ask you for such a large number of deposit.",
