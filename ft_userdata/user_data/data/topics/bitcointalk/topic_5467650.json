What is the level of authenticity do you give to trust feedbacks that doesn't contain a reference link to serve as evidence, be it positive or negative/neutral trust.",

You may not be able to. If you more trades with the person with good outcome of no complaints, you can give the person a positive trust without any reference link. There are other reasons you may not add reference link, but if possible you can add a reference link, it is better.",

Although there's that but some would still put a reference link to redirect people who check the feedback and see what that forum member do. Well, for known forum members that are doing bad things then no reference link is okay since the user is already known about what he/she does. You can also refer to the post above mine.",

Every case will be different, for example if you say someone is a scammer without any proof/reference and no other user has had any complaints about the said user, such feedback should be ignored. In other words, what i mean is that feedbacks related to trade risks or the possibility of someone losing money should they deal with a certain user, ought to carry a reference.But if you are leaving a neutral/positive feedback because you think someone has been a net positive to the forum and has contributed so much to the forum (without you trading with them), that might not require a reference (if you don't have any), and any user that has been in the forum for awhile would be able to verify that feedback.",

What is the level of authenticity do you give to trust feedbacks that doesn't contain a reference link to serve as evidence, be it positive or negative/neutral trust. It depends on the members that you trust because sometimes we don't really have a reference link when we leave positive trust rating for someone. Let's say when we interact with a user and views him/her for sometime and if we find that such user is trying to help others and is playing very important role in the forum then it's our choice to leave a trust feedback for that user or not. Most of the times we would love to support the users who are doing good on forum and are helping others sincerely and when they gain our trust due to their decent actions then we can leave a trust feedback for them.Another particular reason that why people leave non-reference trust feedback is when a user gets accepted in a campaign that's managed by a campaign manager and gets his/her payment on time for 2-4 weeks. That's another reason for the members to leave honest feedback regarding a manager who has been sending them the payments for their posts on time. In this case the user shows appreciation to a manager who has helped him/her to participate in a campaign and sent his/her payment on time. Finally, when someone does a private trade with a user and the trade gets completed without any third party involved then in that case once again the user will leave a non-reference feedback about the trade they have done. Those are some reasons for a non-reference trust-feedback and there can be some other reasons as well. You just have to keep in your mind that if someone is doing well on the forum and is helping others and is doing his/her trades in honest way then that user will get trust-feedback from the users who appreciate the efforts of such users.",

Ideally, any trust rating should be captured with it reference to make a complete trust rating that could also be trusted, inserting the reference to the rating is to give more details about the position that grant you access for such rating, others could know why you're making such rating and the reason will be well backed up with a link, using a reference link on ratings does not apply to the positive or negative ratings alone, neutral ratings could also be rated and properly referenced, the only exception i may see is when you're not the first to rate a user on the trust list, if the previous ratings already carries the reference link on the same reason for giving that trust rating, which is not also a genuine reason not to include your own reference.",

      "body": "Buddy, you can check by yourself why some trust feedback doesn't have any reference link, as in the trust system when you are giving feedback it doesn't require the reference link it is clearly mentioned there, that that field is optional. So if you want to give some any feedback you actually don't need to provide the reference link but with the reference link others can verify that weather the Fedback is authentic or just a trust systems abuse.If a person is an active trader and other traders have already made some successful or failed deals with him and give feedback on the basis of trade results the third person who wants to offer a deal can verify the feedback as authentic with the reference link. So its better to put a link with the trust feedback.",

A reference makes a feedback more specific on the trust system, but a feedback without a reference is still a feedback. If it a positive feedback without reference, then it means the person was given because of something good, and if it is a negative feedback without a reference too, it means that you should also be careful if you must deal personally with these people because they have shown some negative attributes to have earned a negative feedback.",

But just as the first comment of @_act_ stated above, there are circumstance that may take place between persons that can't be linked with particularly a one on one business deal outside the corridors of the forum. And such trust  feedbacks at times can be questionable as there's no evidence to prove your reasons for the trust feedback be it a negative or positive one.Talking of abuse, oh yes, abuse is likely to happen with trust feedbacks but I don't think that's always the case as most feedbacks are legit and deserving.
