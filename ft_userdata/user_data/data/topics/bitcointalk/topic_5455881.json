So my best options is Bep-20 selected network is always BETTER and faster transaction also very faster Bep-20.",

      "body": "When we look at both networks, it is possible to see that both are of high quality. But ERC20 network is more reliable than BSC network. Because tokens or their owners, which are released for fraudulent purposes in the market, prefer the BSC network because of their costs and gas fees. Because of the transaction costs, they produce tokens in seconds and make their sales. However, since the costs are high in the ERC20 network, investors do not invest in every token that is issued. Naturally, in this case, it makes the ERC20 network a bit more reliable than the BSC network.",

      "body": "I will only speak from transaction fees perspective, everyone knows bsc has an incredible low transaction fees hence it is easy to move tokens around in the network on like the ethereum network which is very expensive and congested. I believe what makes a token better is the team behind the project and not the network it was created. Since both network servers almost the same purpose in terms of launching a project, it will be better to consider the one with the most lowest fees coz in the end that is what 99% of the crypto community are concerned about.",

In view of the history of the activity of each network, ERC20 has proven its efficiency, which contributed to the launch of many projects with the same degree of efficiency, while BEP20 is considered relatively recent.Users generally prefer the BEP20 network because the fees are very low compared to transfers on its ERC20 counterpart, in addition to the speed of transaction confirmation. The ERC20 network is more efficient for launching applications, but it still suffers from the power of miners who demand more fees as the network becomes more popular.",

BEP-20 tokens are a variety of crypto assets that do not have their own blockchain, but use the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) smart contract blockchain. Although BEP-20 is considered to be an improved analogue of ERC-20, however, I believe that this was justified when Ethereum experienced difficulties during a period of low scalability and renewal of its network. Going forward, Ethereum blockchain tokens appear to have a better chance of increasing demand and liquidity. Therefore, BEP-20 tokens are better suited for work now, but ERC-20 tokens are still in the future.",

And you could just use L2 like arbitrum for the fees until eth scales to more user friendly prices. And faster and cheaper is not always better. Decentralization level of BSC is questionable at best. Also ecosystem in ERC20 is better and more mature and attracts way more developers. So my bet is that big adoption will happen with ETH, not with BNB.",

Bep-20 is based on the same system as ERC20 with the replacement of the decentralization with 21 validators all connected to Binance and thus they can freeze or stop the blockchain in exchange for giving you a cheap fee.I believe using of Bep-20 reduces the risk of scam from the network or in bridges, but you may lose your money if a hacker steals it.",
