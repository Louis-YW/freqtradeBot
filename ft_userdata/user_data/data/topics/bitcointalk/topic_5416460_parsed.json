A bear market is the best time to buy miners at the lowest possible price.Our marketplace (https://marketplace.zionodes.com/marketplace/) provides hosted mining solutions with a minimum order quantity of one. If you are satisfied, you can later use our trading desk (https://trade.zionodes.com/en/marketplace) to place bulk orders from a variety of industry-leading miners.I see. Thank you",

Especially if the company is relatively unknown and has no prior deal/transaction history on the forum. If you don't have enough capital to buy and manage your rig, maybe try looking for other options such as GPU mining or staking. It still has risks, but probably a better gamble compared to giving money to unknown mining sites.",

There's many risk if you're looking for mining hosting, I think if you're just looking for stranger without any reputation in this forum or someone that you doesn't know on the real life, you might get scammed. Other thing is how you can sure if he's really good to take care of your hardware etc since it's need regular maintenance.I don't know why you seems to force yourself to be take a part to become a miner, just buy Bitcoin on an exchange and hold it, you will get benefit too for the return.",
