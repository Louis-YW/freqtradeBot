You have to get someone interested in buying it at the given price in order o be able to sell it.",

You have to get someone interested in buying it at the given price in order o be able to sell it.I believe the only way this business format can work in a sustainable way is if they are running a cloud mining system. What means rewards investors receive by holding the NFTs will decrease within time until reaching to zero, as it has been already seen before with several platforms of this kind.On the other hand, if rewards don't decrease within time, like in every BTC mining businesses, there are serious chances it can be a ponzi scheme.",

Who supports him? How do exchanges and heads of the crypto community relate to it? In my opinion, the project of GMT looks good. The site has localization into different languages, and this is not bad. I rarely see this in such projects.",

They are not even supported anymore by the mass since their reputation had been stained. There might be some good ones, but they are too rare to find. The Greedy machines have the same service as I checked it. They may have combined it with NFT but it will always be the same ending. I wish you can try to imagine things because NFT's are mostly lively because of pyramid schemes. One buys the product and it will be distributed to the other but it should be continuous or it won't work at all. Keep in mind that there's no such thing as free satoshis unless we go back 1 and a half decades ago when faucets are done.",

      "body": "NFTs are suffering from an oversupply problem. The barrier of entry to release an NFT project is way too low, resulting in scams and abandoned projects. This is why functionality is important. When thinking about buying an NFT (or any crypto in general) ask yourself why you need it. What added functionality does it bring to your life? If the answer is none, it’s probably a worthless NFT or shitcoin. Don’t buy things you can’t or don’t need to use for anything. This will save you from losing lots of money.",

Now it's NFT but in the past there are a lot of projects that is hype, and for me one formula is that you get in early, you might enjoy and get some profits in the future. Just like the hype in P2E before, lots of money to make in bull run until it gets saturated.So it's just the question on when is the NFT market get saturated and if there is a new hype coming in to displace it.I'm not totally sold with this NFT craze to be honest.",

I tried NFT-related games in the past. And it's not because they're fun to play but because you could get NFT items you could sell. I didn't last long though. If you have received NFTs, research more about it. Does it have potential? Is there demand? Can you sell it? But never spend too much on NFTs. They're everywhere and they could be done by everybody.

If it comes from the money of new investors as I suspect then such a model is bound to crash and leave you holding useless NFTs.",

Because holding that NFT give me 20 Hook per every month.  So my advice is don't buy NFTs that thinking this will go up future. Because trust me it won't happen unless you are lucky.",

But after I did a quick search, I thought it was like a cloud mining project but with a new model different from the previous cloud mining program. I have no idea whether this is good or will be a scam, and you should be careful if you want to invest in the project. I suggest choosing other projects that have more potential to provide benefits in the future.",
