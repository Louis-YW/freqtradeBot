It was a KO but the ref called it slip https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8y_4r9VuNLMWith Benavidez, he can find an excuse to back out or he will just keep hugging Benavidez for the whole fight duration. Either that or Andrade will be KOed before his last hug and it's gonna be Canelo vs. Benavidez instead after this fight.",

Andrade is on his way out while Benavidez is at the top of his career. At least Andrade will bow down and have his first loss under the hands of a fighter like Benavidez. That's gonna be worth it. Despite both being undefeated, betting ML for Benavidez won't probably be worth it, so perhaps I'll just go with a Benavidez win via KO no more than 10 rounds.

Both fighters are undefeated, have impressive records, and are known for their knockout power, aggression, and aspiration to fight Canelo.Andrade is the more experienced fighter and is known for his slick boxing skills and ability to counterpunch. He will need to find a way to slow Benavidez down and use his boxing skills to outpoint him.Benavidez is the younger and more aggressive fighter. He has a devastating right hand and is always looking to knock his opponents out. However, he will have to be careful not to get caught by Andrade's counters.This fight is likely to be a back-and-forth war with both fighters looking to land their big punches.I have Benavidez winning by knockout. He has the power to knock out anyone in the division. I think his power will be too much for Andrade to handle.",

And so with this observation, I think Benavidez will go on to win either by unanimous decision or just knock the hell out of Andrade.I'm expecting a lot of trash talk though, both are trash talkers so we might hear a lot of words trying to demoralized each other and trying to get to each other heads. But with Benavidez father behind, this is going to be interesting when they face off. And if David Benavidez wins here, he could be next for the great Canelo Alvarez as we have been also waiting for this fight to happen, most likely if everything works well with David, he will be next for Canelo in Cinco de Mayo, both Mexican warriors.",

That's why I believed that he has a good chance to win against Canelo though or at least give Canelo a good fight like what Bivol did. He could be a heavy a a Light Heavyweight during that fight. So just imagine the power behind if he added more weight and rehydration close to his best version during his fight against Andrade or even Canelo.Quote from: coin-investor on October 05, 2023, 04:29:31 AMDemetrius is also good but he has not faced a fighter like David, David will only look at Demetrius as an ordinary fighter like David did to Caleb Plant, I'll watch the fight not because I'm excited to see who will win in the fight, its more on how David will overwhelm and beat Demetrius.I'm sure Canelo will closely watch this fight, especially David because he will be his likely opponent.  He has a good resume but I will say that Demetrius might have been in the sunset of his career, meaning that he could be in the downward path or past his prime. Of course during the course of the promotion we might see him like having rejuvenated his career. But he is close to getting knockout him by David Benavidez. Waiting to see what the odds are though in my crypto casinos, but I wouldn't be surprised if Benavidez will be like 3:1 favorite going into this fight.And with that, I voted for: Benavidez by KO",

And maybe if Benavidez here will win big like a knockout or totally dominate a experience boxing like Andrade, maybe Canelo will consider him as his next opponent. Canelo though is running out of time and he almost had clean up this division for good. So he needs to fight someone with fresh blood and maybe Benavidez will be the one. So let's see, it seems that majority here sees David as the better boxer and so he wil be the favorite and hopefully win by a knockout and then calls out Canelo in the post fight interview.",

And his inactivity is also a bit of controversial as he goes on the mental health issues, similar to what Ryan Garcia undergo. So we really don't know if he has overcome his personal issues that have kept him away from the sport over the last two years. So there is a big pressure on his shoulder since his brother has lost to Canelo. But in any case he has regain his confidence then this could be a 50/50 fight in paper and it's hard to predict who's going to win. The 2 defeat of Benavidez Jr, comes from the hands of Crawford and Danny Garcia. So it seems when he faces a great boxer, he lose that fight. But let's see how it goes for him vs Jermall.",

And we have seen his doing that as well during in real fight. Not just the speed though, the power behind that punch is really very scary that if it hits someone, for sure he will either get knockout or David scoring that knockdown in that fight.And it's very interesting what David's father said in Canelo vs Charlo, He said that the power of Canelo is no longer. Anyhow, it's really hard not to talk about Canelo vs Benavidez future fight though. That is what the boxing fans want, and hopefully in the bigger picture we will see that fight happening in the future and hopefully that Canelo is willing to fight another Mexican again to defend his belt and he has no other choice as well specially if the young David Benavidez won this fight.",

D. Andrade is already old and maybe close to being shot as a fighter. So this is his last chance to proved that he can still fight at the very top specially against a young lion in David Benavidez. He also wants to target Canelo, so maybe the winner here could be next for Canelo. So we will see.

Let's see how David will respond against a southpaw in Andrade.Yes, there is mutual respect between the two sides, however, we all know that during fight night, this two will like to try to get each other heads off so for sure at one point all their respect will be thrown out of the window. But I do agree that this is a great fight, as compare to Canelo picking up a 154 lbs champion and make him come in weight and fight in at his best at 168 lbs. Both Benavidez and Andrade are undefeated, both are champions, Andrade 154 lbs and 160 lbs and seems that no one wanted to face or avoided him. But Benavidez really has some balls to call and willing to challenge Demetrius so this is going to be one hell of a fight. I do think and for sure everyone will agree that Benavidez has the advantage if terms of power here. But Andrade will pose a challenge because he is a lefty and very slick and moves a lot. While Benavidez is flat footed so he might have a hard time cutting the distance. But if Benavidez lands that one big punch, it might be over in an instant.",
