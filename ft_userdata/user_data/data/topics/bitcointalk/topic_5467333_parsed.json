  "content": "[1] Elon Musk plans to charge users a monthly fee to access X[2] Elon Musk says he will start charging people to use X-TwitterIt's no news that the economy of X has been dwindling and I wouldn't say I was shocked when I read the news from CNBC that Elon Musk in a live stream conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated to start letting X charge every user a small amount monthly to combat fake account and bot dominance.I believe his style and excuses are not genuine as I wonder if his X is the only social media platform with fake accounts and bots, and has others started charging users for the fight other than from the revenue they generate from ads and other means. His arrogance has cost X a lot and might continue to do so.As much as I respect the fact that Musk needs ways to monetize the microblogging app, there are some things I won't take. I won't pay for a service that others will offer similarly for free, not when I don't earn a penny from it.If he makes his deed good, then someone like me will surely excuse myself no matter how little he charges.My main reason is that I don't earn from the platform and have an alternative to what I get from it. Secondly, this will serve as a protest to dissuade other platform owners from following suit. If this is successful, I'm sure that with time, others will begin to make sure people pay for social media platforms.What about you? Are you willing to pay for X?",

All I can just do is to click on a link to visit what I want to visit.This may open ways for competitors. If no one can be able to access the site unless payment is made, I will not use Twitter anymore.",

      "body": "Introducing a fee, no matter how small, indeed creates a barrier to entry, which could potentially limit the diverse user base that the platform currently enjoys. It indeed feels somewhat unfair to suddenly have to pay for a service that has been free for so long, especially when other platforms continue to offer free access. while I do respect the necessity for platforms to explore different revenue streams, this move seems like it might not be in the best interest of the broader user community. It seems more like a gatekeeping tactic than a genuine effort to improve the user experience.",

Business competitors will create applications that are almost the same as X to attract all X users to switch to their product. Of course users will slowly leave X due to the greed of Elon Musk who has changed Twitter's identity and wants to charge them a monthly fee. If Elon Musk's plan really goes through, I'll say goodbye to Twitter or X.",

But smart and rich people also make mistakes sometimes and right now I'm getting the impression that they are making mistakes, and even more with the idea of charging for the accounts.

But the latest news about them thinking of charging a monthly fee has me feeling pretty bummed.Twitter is like my main squeeze in the social media world. I mean, aside from some forums and Telegram, it's the place I hang out online. I've met friends, laughed at memes, and had some cool conversations.But here's the thing – if Twitter starts asking for cash to use it, I might have to hit the eject button. I get they need to make money, but it could mess up what's great about Twitter. It's open to everyone, and that's awesome. Charging money might shut some people out, and that's not cool.So, if they really go through with this fee thing, I'll have some thinking to do. I mean, I love Twitter, but I also love not spending extra money on social media. We'll see how it goes, but I really hope they don't push me to say goodbye to my Twitter crew.",

It's not going to prevent the trolls or bots from opening multiple accounts but the increase in likelihood that they'll be dealing with real accounts is attractive. It's not easy to build followers or subscribers in a new platform and it could be more costly than the monthly fee. There's also no guarantee that the free apps won't charge in the future.",

Now Twitter became X if the case you'll have to subscribe first for you to access other features that were free before, I would not pay for it as I would find other apps much more convenient without fees. But I think those monetizing is mostly from people who us Twitter or X as their money sources just like advertisement, artist, news and etc as long you could make money from it. So it's like a fee as they benefit from X, X would also benefit from them. Cause for sure even the users complain, they have no choice but to pay cause that's where they could get money.",

And it is not impossible that if X decides to apply tariffs to its users, sooner or later the users of the X application will leave this social media and switch to other social media.

Some members will continue using the old one and only cost-sensitive user will shift their focus on the new platform. I am not so sure but thread can be a good alternative. It suppose to be a competitor of twitter and this can be an opportunity for the thread team to attract users from twitter. May be they can offer something unique for users who wants to shift from twitter to thread. Something like new sim company who offers their customers the same old number if they change their old operator.",

He seems to see it as irreplaceable, but many platforms have fallen in the past, only to be replaced by others and Twitter does not have any special intellectual property that would prevent this. The very fact that he renamed it \"X\" which can be construed as super negative, is indicative that he just wanted to use the domain and is literally trying to smash Twitter into the mold that he wants to create. He's going against so many parts that made Twitter what it is today and charging users will be the final nail in the coffin, because people simply won't tolerate paying for a social network when they can use free alternatives that have been able to monetize effectively and not destroy advertiser relationships.",
