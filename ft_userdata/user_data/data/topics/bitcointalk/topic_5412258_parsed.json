  "content": "At the moment, I'm still using the older version of ledger live 2.42.0.  Reason being a while back people said the next update or update after that had issues with the balance not being correct so I didn't do any updates etc.  I did however do transactions with it though.Now each time that I am ready to do the ledger live update on the top right corner, it seem like every few day later, there is always a newer ledger live update.  For me, I prefer waiting a few days before doing the update.  But now it seem there is an update almost every week or so?At the moment, it shows update ledger live to 2.46.2 and that is just recently right?  There is no issue clicking download update on the top right corner since I already have ledger live downloaded a while back right since I had verified it already?  Anyone having issues with the balance not being correct?  Does clearing the cache always solve this issue?  Read on reddit not for everyone?",

Every single version you have to verify hash and PGP signature.As for not updating; typically, the easiest and best thing for users to do in terms of improving their security, is to have everything up to date at all times. That's OS, packages, libraries, everything.Worst-case, you can always downgrade / download an older release or wait a few days for a bugfix.I have no experiences with Ledger live and would always recommend Bitcoin Core, Electrum or Sparrow, instead. Most hardware wallets do work with these, as well.",

Can't verify as I don't use it.Quote from: jerry0 on September 04, 2022, 12:18:21 AMOkay but how long should one wait once ledger live has an update?  The latest update seem to be 2.46.2 and that was just recent.  So if I wait a few days, there might be a 2.46.3.  So how long do you wait till other users say okay no issue with it and then you download it?Any software, you should update as soon as the update drops. That's what they're for. They are tested before release to the public (if the company writing the software has any competence, that is). Nobody (serious) tests in production.Quote from: jerry0 on September 04, 2022, 12:18:21 AMAlso there is no issue at all continuing to use ledger live whether sending or receiving coins while using an older ledger live correct?  I didn't update ledger live since 2.42.0 because almost every single update after this, I heard people said there were issues with the balance not displaying correctly.  So is this one correct?I can't say for sure, but try it out - if it works, it works, right. Don't see a reason why it should stop working; I'd be mostly concerned about security issues, but you can also just read release notes to know exactly what the versions 2.42+ have added.Here's a page with the releases and their release notes:https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/releases",

There are no issues with balances now. And if you see any issue with balance, just delete the cache and it will work again.No reason to use an outdated software, and waiting a few days is useless.  You will see another update again, as ledger launches a new version every few days.",

For me, as long as there is an update available not only for Ledger Live but for the firmware as well -- I immediately update. In fact, before updating them, I am always 2 weeks behind after their release as I am not frequently using it.",

Quote from: jerry0 on September 04, 2022, 12:18:21 AMI heard people said there were issues with the balance not displaying correctly.  So is this one correct? I haven't noticed any issues with displaying the balance on my end. Just because some people experience certain glitches or bugs, doesn't mean other people will. Software malfunctions, that's the way it is. Even if you notice an issue with the balance, you can use Electrum and double-check everything.",
