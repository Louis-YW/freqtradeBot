  "content": "So I know gemini earn still hasn't paid back any of their customers.  I remember gemini earn was one of the most trusted because they were gemini but with the issue with genesis, any customers who had GUSD earning interest still hasn't gotten their money back.What about blockfi, nexo and Celsius?  I'm curious if many Americans had money there and did that to earn the 12% interest and if so, did they pay them back?  I remember they didn't allow certain US states or if they banned all US customers.  But I remember early on, they did allow US customers.  Also anyone with money with FTX whether US or non US still hasn't gotten paid back right?  So whether it was crypto or FTX tokens or whatever, nobody got paid back?  But they will eventually?  Were there coins that people put in FTX where they earned a lot of interest similar to Celsius or like gemini earn?  Or there wasn't?",

      "body": "They are to some extent providing not full but a compensation amount to users who are able to provide proper documentation. But most of the required documentation is absurd and most people are not being able or not willing to provide it.Of the four, I was active in FTX, Celsius and Nexo. I bought FTX token during the hype and FTX was my primary exchange due to the low fees.After the first news, I sold my FTX token at 80% loss and withdrew just before they stopped letting users do that. It was a good choice.I would have never been able to provide the absurd documents they want like my salary and tax statements.I was saved from celsius disaster to some extent. I had a good amount of USD on their platform staked for interest and they eventually blocked my region. I needed to use a VPN to withdraw all my USD to nexo. I lost some of their tokens which I held for better rates.After the bankruptcy of Celsius, I was wise enough to empty my Nexo wallets.",

I'm just gathering this stuff from this tweet [1] Celsius posted. If you held funds there you better check on app itself than asking a question, tbh.

      "body": "FTX withdrawals from the claims are not available yet. For Nexo and BlockFi, nothing thus far. Celsius users can currently withdraw around 72% of their assets as long as it is not classified as \"custody assets just as @libert19 posted. An interesting twist is that Celsius is trying to get into the Bitcoin mining business with what's left and FTX are planning to revamp the exchange and relaunch it but under a new management.The reason there isn't much about these startups/projects that filed for bankruptcy is because these court proceedings are usually slow and span over a lengthy period of time.",

I didn't even bother. I had dust amounts in there and some locked Luna 2.0 that had been airdropped. I am pretty sure lots of people were not able to file for the claimsQuote from: jrrsparkles on December 02, 2023, 01:34:01 PMLesson: Don't take the risk that isn't really worth the risk.Exactly. I don't know how people ended up trusting those lending and borrowing platforms yet APYs were really so low. Not worth it.",

It's either a hack, regulatory issues with a government or bankruptcy, in the end customers mind is not at ease except their coins is in their none custodial wallets. I hope that FXT for instance will get their acts together and restore customers confidence.",
