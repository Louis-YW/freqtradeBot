Are you even aware that Twitter is doing a pay to get verified model?The legacy verification policy is still active and it's not going anywhere. Rather than linking to Twitter's help center, I'm going to point you to Google, which has all the information you need. Furthermore, Twitter Blue and Twitter Blue for Business are still being rolled out as announced a week ago: https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/twitter-blue-for-business.htmlPrior to the new ownership, customers could only obtain a blue checkmark through our service. As of now, everyone who was previously verified but did not subscribe to Twitter Blue has a gray checkmark. Businesses that qualify can now apply for Twitter Blue for Business (which consists of a golden checkmark rather than a blue one).Currently, what we can do for our customers is enable them to apply for a golden checkmark even when they are not eligible. To be clear, there are requirements in place - roughly the same as with legacy verified accounts. We can provide more information on the service and its requirements to those who are actually interested.",

That means we don't get paid until the client is satisfied and releases the money. If this is not enough to convince those who are interested in our services, please feel free to look for other sellers! Thank you.",

Simply post \"DISCOUNT PLEASE\" below and you will receive a PM containing your discount code.What are requirements at user ends for Twitter verification apart from 1k fee? You need a registered company with a solid web presence. Please contact us or refer to the website for more details.If we all this why should we pay you 1k? Why cannot we do it ourselves? What is so unique about your service? Requesting the verification via the app has a very thin chance of success, even with a strong web presence. On the other hand, verification requests submitted by a media portal are reviewed manually. This is the same method used by artists, politicians, actors and other public figures.",

That was before Twitter and Meta rolled out the paid verification plans. Moreover, you do not get the \"Twitter Blue\" verification that can easily be purchased off the platform when buying our service.If you simply click the link and visit the website, you will notice that our page for the Twitter verification service refers to the golden checkmark for businesses. If you did read the thread, you would also know that the $999 price merely refers to the minimum deposit.There are multiple reasons why companies and individuals are willing to pay $1k+ for such a service when they do not meet the official requirements. Therefore, there is no nothing that needs be corrected. Just to clarify, the thread clearly states: \"Please note the prices listed above may be outdated, for the current prices you can refer to our website\". Anyone who is actually interested should refer to the website for updated information.",
