  "content": "with these 4 slides i would like to discuss with you the topic 'eclipse attack' and give you some information about it.an eclipse attack targets specific nodes on a network by surrounding them and obscuring their view of the entire network, thus isolating them. for example, if a Bitcoin node has 8 connections to other nodes and an attacker controls all 8 of those nodes, the attacker may refuse to forward any new blocks that miners produce. although the rest of the network will continue to process new blocks, the victim node will not know that blocks are coming in. to prevent or eliminate this, you can use a hard-coded list of seed nodes. if they are unreachable, the node uses dns seeds and returns a list of ip addresses of active nodes when queried.also, nodes can exchange peers by sending a 'getaddr' message and receiving addresses of the peer  https://twitter.com/BTCillustrated",

As the name may suggest, the attack aims to obscure a participant’s view of the peer-to-peer network, in order to cause general disruption, or to prepare for more sophisticated attacks.https://medium.com/crossfi-official/eclipse-attack-in-blockchain-1531f6e9c20aQuoteEclipse attacks occur when a node is isolated from all honest peers but remains connected to at least one malicious peer.https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/however, even if the nodes in the table are corrupted, the currently running nodes have already found all their peers, so they cannot affect the network and in addition, there is also an option to specify the desired peer, through which you can get the addresses of other peers",

What's impossible is to \"fake\" a transaction if it isn't against the protocol rules. Double-spending a transaction doesn't count as \"faking\" if you redo the work.Quote from: digaran on October 01, 2023, 03:48:39 PMUnless the isolated node is mining there is no use of doing fake tx, even if it was mining, it wouldn't accept a fake tx unless you feed it with a fake longest chainThere is no \"fake longest chain\", no matter how much we'd want it. There is the difficultywise-longest chain, and it's always the correct chain. If another one comes up, with more work, that becomes the correct one. What is needed to be emphasized is that an eclipse attack isn't going to be effective if the attacker doesn't spend a significant amount of resources to redo the Proof-of-Work, which in that case, the network would be under threat anyway. The reason is that the attacker must maintain an entire chain themselves. If your node receives no blocks for hours, or days, you can make out you're under an eclipse attack. The attacker must solve blocks every 10 minutes to go unnoticed, which requires to redo a lot of work. They cannot re-create their own, little-worked chain, because node software comes with checkpoints.That is my understanding as to why an eclipse attack shouldn't be concerning, but please correct me if I'm wrong.",

They provide an example based on the Neutrino protocol. But they also provide some insightful stuff for Electrum Light clients. \"By default, Electrum tries to maintain connections to ~10 servers.\"This is not a whole lot compared to the example given for the Neutrino protocol in the paper. The required number of attacker Sybil serving nodes to achieve reasonable probability for success isn't that high. But all of this is no reason to freak out as there is a number of other factors that have to be sorted out first before an attack 1) can be executed and 2) makes any sense at all. But dealing with potential security issues is fun as I think it contributes a lot to expanding one's knowledge about the technicalities of the network. And trying to understand its vulnerabilities contributes a great deal to understanding Bitcoin's robustness. Because most of the attacks that are discussed here on the forum have never really led to publicly known large-scale damage, which means Bitcoin is really resilient because there is no lack for people trying to attack it. They do, but they can't get it done in notable ways. Yet, having some good talk about security can never hurt.",

Communication with \"honest nodes\" is key to security of funds, aka for funds to stay with the rightful owner. To BHC , thanks to Dump3er quote as you are ignored now like your \"friend\" . Let's consider an example of the attack in a massive scale . Let's say that i flood the network with a massive amount of sybil nodes ( 90% ) . In that way the probability of your \"full node\" to be connected only to malicious nodes is very high . So your \"validation\" has nothing to do with the real ledger which is produced by the mining nodes . You can understand that mining nodes are unaffected by that kind of attack as they give a shit about your node .  Bitcoin isn't a democratic network where everyone can change the consensus by running a \"full node\" . That's why it's called PoW and not PoMN( Most nodes ) . Bitcoin provided a solution to the problem of byzantine generals , not byzantine soldiers . Troops have a by far low number of generals than soldiers . Imagine a troop where every soldier would have to decide if the attack ordered should be executed . Do you think that there be a consensus ? That's what you (and most here ) don't get , that you are part of the consensus but just acknowledge it . It's like i use a bucket to take water from a river and by throwing it back i believe that i'm contributing to it's flow . But as i said to you many times , you only look bitcoin from the coding side , you can't extend your thought to the philosophical aspects behind it .  To Dump3er . The problem with current model that btc uses is that there's no economic incentive for non mining nodes to be honest . If you could use a service of a honest node that gains money by earning a small amount (less than a cent ) each time you use their explorer to see if the transaction you're interested is double spent , would you use it ? Of course , with the current fee market created by the 1 MB limit that's not possible . If you could create such a node that earns you money everyday would you be interested to give fake results for a double spend that doesn't affect you at all and you don't get any profit from it , while on the other hand you would lose the profit from the service you are providing ?   SPV's was the solution satoshi provided for massive scale . At some point we shall see if that model can work . If it works no one will want to use the current banking/credit system . Companies will earn insane amounts from fees in the long term as visa/MC has at least 1% fee + 10 cents per transaction . Quote from: ETFbitcoin on October 08, 2023, 09:20:47 AMThe only source of truth? Bitcoin isn't centralized.Define centralised and decentralised . I can provide examples of a 5 nodes network that's decentralised and a 10k nodes network that's centralised . Decantralisation comes not from the number of nodes but from the incentive nodes have to not collude .QuoteMalicious node would be banned quickly, so anyone who want to run full nodes for non-malicious purpose (e.g. perform full verification, need whole blockchain data) also have incentive to be honest.How do you know in a network flooded by malicious nodes which one is the malicious ? How do you know which one is honest ? If the truth in the network is the one provided by the malicious actor isn't the real truth false ? Who are the only CERTAIN trusted/honest nodes in the network and why? Mining nodes because no one wants to kill the golden goose just to earn a double spend . QuoteI already know that. Although FWIW one mining pool may have multiple full nodes.Not just multiple , multiple HONEST nodes that many for profit nodes can connect .",

I will still cover all the BSV bullshit. Quote from: HmmMAA on October 09, 2023, 08:35:05 AMThat's why it's called PoW and not PoMN( Most nodes ) .Nobody argues that the number of nodes helps in the consensus process. As I previously discussed in our local board, the choice to run a full node is largely driven by individual preferences. There isn't a strong incentive beyond concerns for security and privacy. What people argue, is that the average person should be able to run such a piece of software, a perspective differing from what you and your BSV associates propose.Quote from: HmmMAA on October 09, 2023, 12:07:03 PM2. In an environment where the majority of nodes are mallicious , -i think- you will verify a false ledger .Wanna try out spinning up fifty thousand nodes to beat the air? Go for it. We've covered in literally the previous page that a malicious node without doing Proof-of-Work, is essentially a harmless node.",
