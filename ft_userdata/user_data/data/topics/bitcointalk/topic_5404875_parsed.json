Right from the subject of the thread to its content which is rather empty. I don't know if you've gone through most of the dedicated threads to some of the popular leagues on the forum. If you haven't, you might want to take a look at these:Africa Football Discussion Thread || Current discussion: AFCON 2023 qualifiers.[Boxing] Canelo vs Golovkin 3 (September 17)La Liga (Spanish League) Prediction Thread 2022/23It doesn't take much. Just a few listing of the teams amongst other detailing would do the trick. Meanwhile, woman football I not one of the most appreciated in the world but they do okay. France women team would be my pick for now as I've watched them play a few times in the past and they weren't disappointing.",

      "body": "I'm not rooting for any country in EURO 2022, I just support my country national team which where far from qualifying to main tournament. But I'm definitely going to watch this tournament, which already starts this Wednesday.I really enjoyed last World Cup, I watched some Champions league games too and level of game was way higher than I expected. Main favorites to win EURO is Spain, England, France, maybe Netherlands and Sweden.Quote from: swogerino on July 02, 2022, 07:21:01 AMNot rooting for any specific country but in this competition what is common is the huge number of goals scored in a single game.A lot of games in the women Euro end up with tennis results more than with soccer results that is why I think they are not as popular as men soccer competitions.The visibility even in the most famous sport TV channels is really low compared to the men visibility and this I think is not going to change because in women as I said the games become boring by being scored a lot of goals only from one team,the differences here are even bigger between teams than that between men.You're right about high scoring games. Usually it happens because level difference between teams is big, there isn't that many equal level teams like in men football. But women football is gaining popularity, it was amazing to see Barcelona women playing Champions league games in Camp Nou with over 90 000 spectators. Other teams also started to play in big stadiums, rather than in some training pitch.",
