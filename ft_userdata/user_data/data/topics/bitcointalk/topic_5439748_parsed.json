People have been using the bitcoin logo without complaining, so the slight error is not enough to raise an alarm. Interesting how anything about bitcoin make it to the news blogs.

If you've ever seen some very large printed bitcoin images on some object on the street where the imperfections of the logo are not visible at all, is that also using the raw logo that Bitboy did or designers even have their own perfect version?Actually, this is not the first time I realized it, a few years ago someone pointed it out on this forum.",

It is a backdoor to the blockchain put there by the devs. If you can manage to get the fitting key, you can access the source code of the Zio-I mean bitcoin but I don't recommend this because you may screw the balance of the universe. Think about all the children that will starve because their parents can't reach their coins. Luckily for you, neither you nor any of us have to worry about that because these keys are in the safe hands, the bitcoin devs.",

He haven't posted anything since 2014, but he did loged in to forum last September.I wouldn't call it imperfection. I would say that Bitcoin logo is imperfectly perfect .",

That imperfect curvature is funnier, though. These microscopic discoveries are either accidental or these two must have so much time to spare that they started to zoom in on the Bitcoin logo to look for something interesting.

I wonder if this news reaches to this person and he comes back He is definitely alive because his original bitcoin wallet isn't abandoned: 1BcQPKcvgLtBp8ZrRSHWewpd3h97BqEQb3This forum is quite a strange place. A person comes out of nowhere and creates revolutionary coin, then somehow he disappears and another person becomes a forum owner, then someone comes out of nowhere with logo for bitcoin and it becomes a global standard.
