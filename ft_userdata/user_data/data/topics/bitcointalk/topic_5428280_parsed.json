I just on my own understand that, because i believe even with any other currencies which is not cash that corporation you are making reference of, will still be paid, do you realize that any transaction of Bitcoin you made theirs is a particular fees attached to it.",

We have come to a time where we are completely controled by corporations. Fiat is controled by corporations and we as social beings are demanded to use it not because we need to havea means of exchange but as an imposition. Nowadays, we can still use fiat to payanother human hand to hand and withthat you will not be unser the scope of a given corporatio, but Now that CBDCs are becoming a reality, this situation will be even more upon us as fiat cash will be taken out from circulation. Once that happens we will become total slaves. Hence the uttermost importance of Bitcoin, as it will be the only form of financial form humans will have access to.",

I totally agree with this statement of yours, because the less cash we use, the more money we pay in terms of \"fees\" to host finance firm's when trying to execute a transaction, but thats where Bitcoin comes into play, offering us the ability to execute transactions directly without the need of middle men (banks) involved, fast and borderless. But you just have to know that there are two kinds of Bitcoin wallet (i.e Centralized wallet hosted by an exchange & Decentralized wallets independent on its own). Which means that if your have your Bitcoin in a Centralized exchange wallet it simply means the exchange has control over your funds, but if it's in a decentralized independent wallet, it means they have no control over it. Which is why is always advisable to save our funds on an independent wallet",

BTCBitcoinWhile I would agree that this certainly does seem to keep becoming more and more the case, I can't say I agree with you in full for how much this is actually happening.  I still know of a good amount of businesses where people actually request cash in hand.  For example my dry cleaners will charge something crazy like 5% if you decide to use a credit card instead of cash, which essentially forces you to use cash.  The laundry mat down the street only takes cash etc etc.",

BTCBitcoinIf I may get you clear and from your own point of view I was able to get the fact that you do tipping by fiat most when it gets cooperate body involved and you have a regular payment through Bitcoin which has long been your routine or culture if you may wish. Well I am not surprised because bitcoin was initially designed for the alternative payment which is a p2p form and that has been the stance since it's inception as a digital recognized currency. Bitcoin was built to avoid third party and to encourage digital payment with speed and transparency without any form of irregularities as the usual pattern of delay and others. I think this step you have taken in payment is a good one and it definitely would yield positive results soonest. Keep up with the promotion in your own way and watch as others follow your step.",

BTCBitcoinDigitalization has been introduce and this one became more famous when pandemic came where many find a solution not to create more physical contact to other people. Many people like this idea because they don't need to bring some cash on their pocket anywhere and they can use their phone directly to pay so this is totally perfect with bitcoin since it can be use as that to.But I don't think cash/fiat will gone since government will still backed up and maybe digital payments will became just an option.",

When you're able to stop the flow of money you're able to force people into submission. They want to gather somewhere and protest? Take their money so they have to walk there and ask others to buy them food. With no money they can't even pay their Internet bill. You take their money you stop the flow of information. They can't send a letter with no money, they can't can't print leaflets, can't buy weapons to protect themselves. Money is power.",

In each transaction, the corporation is taking their percentage but also controls and monitors your transaction. BTCBitcoinYour comments are quite right because although cash is issued by a centralized organization called the central banks but it reduces to some extent the influence of middlemen. This cashless economy has introduced and increased the number of corporations that serves as a link between the banks and its customers. And the most annoying part of this whole scenario is that it is the citizens that bears the cost of these transactions fees. With these centralized corporations our entire financial lives are now directly or indirectly been controlled by the government. I think the best form of a cashless economy is a decentralized one. A financial medium that is less expensive, fast and promotes privacy should be the bedrock of any economy. But the government wouldn't want to introduce or accept such kind of payment systems because it would give them less control over its citizens.",
