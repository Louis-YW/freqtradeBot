  "content": "To be honest I don't have any problem if I receive my signature campaign payment longer than before due to ordinals transaction spamming in bitcoin network, right now the fee for low priority is 345 sat/vB or worth of $13.66, the campaign manager obviously will pay higher than that because there are many participants/receipt addresses.However I haven't see any campaign is paying their participants through lightning network, using native segwit will make the fee is more cheaper, but it's not really the best choice.So I have two questions here:1. For campaign manager: are you fine to spend more money due to high transaction fees right now? 2. For participant: if you have two options to choose, are you prefer to receive your payment in your native segwit address or lightning network address?",

Quote from: Apocollapse on May 08, 2023, 04:19:43 AMSo I have two questions here:1. For campaign manager: are you fine to spend more money due to high transaction fees right now? I don't think any campaign manager or company team making payments will be fine spending high fees just to make campaign payments, this will have a long term negative impact on the entire campaign budgets. And just as some platforms are already closing down their bitcoin withdrawals, some campaigns may be forced to halt payments for weeks or even pausing the compagn if these issues continue. Quote from: Apocollapse on May 08, 2023, 04:19:43 AM2. For participants: if you have two options to choo from are you prefer to receive your payment in your native Segwit address or lightning network address?I don't have any problem with that even though my campaign payment is done on the casino which doesn't require any fees tipping from the platforms, but then if I were in a direct address paid campaign, I won't mind receiving payment through lightening networks address since it will solve the current situation until everything goes back to normal.",

The difference is it reaches new ATH that is much worse than before. Fee might go down but not too soon.Quote from: Apocollapse on May 08, 2023, 04:19:43 AM1. For campaign manager: are you fine to spend more money due to high transaction fees right now? Coinomize just recently sent the campaign payment and it has 0.0055 BTC as fees which is more than $150, so i guess managers/owners can but not as always as this.Quote from: Apocollapse on May 08, 2023, 04:19:43 AM2. For participants: if you have two options to choo from are you prefer to receive your payment in your native Segwit address or lightning network address?If there is an option,  why not. But the main problem is your tx fee when you send it later on to an exchange or wherever you want. Most recommended fee is $55 as of writing, might be better if exchanges supports lightning deposit too,  well, there are already some like kraken and bitfinex but im not using them for KYC requirements reason and it's unfortunate.",

We can't still use the funds in this current state while the transaction fee on both our sides is high if we will gonna spend it now. We will think about that, problem is at this point things could get worse before they get better. FOMO is always strong in crypto and it is difficult to predict when the transactions would get better.
