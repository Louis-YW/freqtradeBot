I have reported him to the bounty manager BF-Fi but still waiting for response as they do not have a Telegram group for this bounty.Do you think we should give him a negative tag for using my content without permission? Coz' this is unacceptable considering my time and effort in doing this content. Thanks!",

At first I did not know there was a bounty program for JOT because I was too busy with a lot of important stuff. I did made and uploaded the video without any knowledge of the bounty because of a separate KOL deal (which ultimately turned out that the deal did not continue) until I have found this thread myself. So when I have checked the spreadsheet entry I am surprised that Apt2022 used my video without my permission or consent.Yes I have already sent my proof to him that I am the legitimate owner of this video because of my POA placed in my Youtube description. I am still waiting for him to take action, maybe he's asleep.  I'll just wait and see then. But for now I'll give Apt2022 a negative tag to catch his attention. Plagiarism and copyright infringement is something that we cannot tolerate nowadays.There's no way I'll be removing the negative tag and it's gonna be permanent to teach him a lesson that he'll never forget. Even if he says sorry or apologize, the damage has been done and I'm not changing my mind.",

Yes, it is a bounty manager's duty to take action against abuse like banning the user from their future bounty or reporting to reputation thread so a more severe action can be taken against the abuser, but it's every members's right --or should I say \"duty\"-- to report the same abuses of forum rules if they found it and leave a negative tag if they deemed it necessary, disregarding their DT status.Since OP is directly involved on this case, as the victim, I think he has the full right to not trusting Apt2022 and express it in form of leaving the said feedback. I am failed to see the logic behind, \"it is not up to you to tag him with a negative trust.\" Sorry if I sound rude and consider this an apology in advance if that that what you need to help you swallow the pill, but I simply dumbfounded by that statement.I am not sure how copyrights works on YouTube, whether the owner of the content has the full rights or they automatically relinguish the right and it is then reserved to youtube, but I am somewhat sure whichever rules applied for ownership of a content on that platform, taking someone's work and claimed it as yours still considered as stealing, and as such, not to be trusted. I am leaving negative tag as well.OP, if you want to, you can change the thread title from \"someone\" to \"Apt2022\" so anyone taking a glance at topic list on this board would get a better understanding of the situation. Second, though I am not sure how he can get out of this situation, I also advised you to at least invite Apt2022 to this thread by PMing him, so he can defend himself or give his side of story.
