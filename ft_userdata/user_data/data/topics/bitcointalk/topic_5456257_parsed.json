It will be careless of you to just buy ahead of this sale. If it's true you better just wait for the price to dip below $1.If there is something like this, I think Bezos would be the first to have said a word. But there is nothing I can find on the internet. This could be a scam.",

I’m just worried that they can be the next target for SEC, so better for them to follow all the regulations on creating their own coin and make no mistakes, or else they will lose a lot later on. Let’s see if they will push this through, big companies are preparing for this moment for sure.",

In this case, it isn't even the youtube account that OP linked, it's an account named \"Christopher Tacon\". Not to mention literally everything about the announcement was last year, where btw Amazon token scams most often made the news. If those stuff doesn't scream of scam to me, I don't know what will.",

If Amazon released their own coin I would venture to say that would be the news of the year for this market and every single reputable publication will take the time to analyze why this is the case and what it means for this market going forward.But since this is not the case and other users have found out that your sources are wrong then we can tell this coin is being released by a scammer, which unfortunately will be able to convince a great deal of people that this news is real even if it is not, as it could even convince you this was the case.",

The simplest way to verify if this news is legit or not is to waite for an official announcement from Amazon. Till now they have not said anything about this token. There was a scam presale of the same token that was launched last year. It went on to trend for sometime but later was found to be scam.",
