Do Kwon's literally being bombarded by allegations and court cases right now due to a lot of retail(and institutional lmao) investors getting burned.According to the tweet that I read recently, Terra did not spend their Bitcoin reserve for buy-back just like what they are claiming, Instead it went a cold wallet and just chilling while everyone is in panic. Do Kwon is a master scammer and using this Luna drama to exit scam. He don't have any plan to save UST at the start and now he is claiming that Luna is greater than UST to support i scam fork coin. Jail time is what he deserves.All the BTC currently sits under this address: 3M219KR5vEneNb47ewrPfWyb5jQ2DjxRP6Source: https://mobile.twitter.com/CryptoOracle88/status/1527325921933266945",

A lot of people got rekted by trying to seize this \"opportunity\" and were buying the dip, thinking that it has to go back up. Well, it didn't and if they bothered to check why LUNA/UST is tanking so hard they wouldn't even try that. After all, there is an old trading rule that says \"don't try to catch a falling knife\". My advice is to stay away from it and if you have urge to gamble, go to casino. You will have better chances there.",

Some people would have done the same thing when Luna was around $1, all the money invested is now nothing when it got to less than $0.0005. Not new but another lesson from altcoins.",

Honestly I really doubt someone can trust LUNA or UST again after the CEO disappointed them. Many people already commit suicide, some people gambling with the current LUNA/UST price.

If they wanna burn they couldn't effort the fund for this. So I think its true that they will loss more share in future .",

The Luna team is doing its best to revive their coin again, as they have new plans and proposals to compensate Holders of the coin for their losses, but for the luna coin to reach a dollar is illogical, since until today it is still losing its shares in the market and the supply of it has increased to 6 trillion in addition to it has lost the confidence of investors.",

Just remind you if UST has not pegged. it's not even backed by any assets. The asset that used to peg UST has gone and this will become a useless token for sure. The price of UST already dumped so hard. There's no way for both to recover from the dump. Luna and UST were garbage token since last week. people are only buying both to gambling with the market. This can be a very bad choices for people to invest. There's no way for luna to recover from the bearish market like this.,",

I will pick bitcoin as my choice and hold it because this time, bitcoin is down again and back to $29k. Instead of choosing Luna/UST, you can search for the other coins or bitcoin as I choose which have more potential to increase higher. But if you still want to buy Luna/UST, I suggest you not to use too big money and only use the money you can afford so when the price still gets down deeper, you will not be too sad.",
