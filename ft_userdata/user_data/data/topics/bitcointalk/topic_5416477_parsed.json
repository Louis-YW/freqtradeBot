  "content": "If you have a older wallet which had mining capability and  has generated coins on the old 6667 network which was P2P ..and its seen in the balance of the old core client....  how would you be able to move them over to the current 8333 network?Is there a difference or a certain process to do this, as they dont seem to be transferring over ....  just wondering if there is a way to do this or is it too old and now lost ? .... Thank you.",

It should update the wallet and then download the current blockchain (~450gb) and you should be fine.Depending on how old the wallet is you may have to do some jumps from older versions to newer ones, which is why you should make backups before doing anything.-Dave",

      "body": "Make as many secure backups as you can to start with. You can also copy and paste the addresses (beginning with 1, if you have them) you have on the old version with balances in them to check the funds are still there - once you've done that there's then no rush to actually update your node to the current software/download the blockchain.Then I'd follow either of the above recommendations to actually restore your wallet and access the funds.",

      "body": "The exact P2P network used shouldn't matter, because its the wallet.dat that stores your funds.My advice is NOT to directly insert this file into recent versions of Bitcoin Core, but instead, migrate it to a 2012-13 version of Core or an old version that supports wallet version 10500 (the earliest format recognized by Core 23.0 - for comparison, wallet encryption was introduced after wallet version 10500, so that's a long list of compatible Bitcoin versions supporting 10500).And once you load it into the slightly newer version, then you can add it to the latest Bitcoin Core.",
