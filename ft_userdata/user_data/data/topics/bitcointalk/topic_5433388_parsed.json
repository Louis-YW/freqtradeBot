First was their attack on fiat exchange companies now this bans are very unnecessary.Well this is the best time to go for independent online banking application if you must do fiat.

Some months ago I wanted to buy something from AliExpress and my Access visa card kept declining, so I had to reach out to my bank to find out why and I was told that they had stopped international transactions with cards and this was in compliance with CBN directives. I was told to apply for a dollar debit card but I had to decline because of the annual maintenance fees. I resorted for a virtual debit card from Chippercash, the exchange rate is the same as black market but I had to close my eyes and go through with it. I wish these online merchants like AliExpress, Amazon, eBay are accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it would have really saves one stress and cost.",

I will return to postI think that will be helpful, because most person that are used to buying and getting stuffs from the international market with their cards can really do anything and the spending for some card or i no know if the spending limit na every card because I saw one time in the news that spending limit has been reduced greatful for any foreign and international transaction. So i don't know if i have knowledge of any virtual Card having such high spending limit , please anyone with such knowledge should drop and share",

First, it was redesign of Naira notes, next thing, it became unavailable. Now they suspend Naira debit cards, along with other new impositions just to hold the country down.

Why we no go find alternatives?We will always find an alternative, that's true because its just human nature to adapt to changes all around him. Nigeria don dey condition its citizens no be today but omo no matter how dem carry us go we dey ready for their matter. This reason months don see so many things wey don happen for the Nigeria financial and banking sector wey dey even surprise me. At first I thought the cbn have finally come to the acknowledgement that the naira don really depreciate and are putting all this new rules and regulations to help revive  and give its currentcy a value. But now that you have come to mention it, i also feel maybe its just part of their political game to find a way maneuver their way around this years elections for their propose candidate.",

Your bank will support dollar card, and its daily limit is $1000, no limit for POS.Bro, Nigeria imports way more than it exports, and that is what is putting pressure on the naira and making it less valuable. Nigeria may export a huge amount of petroleum, gas, cocoa, beans, and gold, but it also exports a lot of other things, like cars, tires, and different kinds of food stuffs. I read in an article online that such activities were what led to a foreign trade deficit of N1.94 trillion in 2021 as the country imported far more than it exported, causing an imbalance that has made the naira weaker. This problem was mostly caused by some high-class businessmen and women and some government officials, but now it's people like you and me that are going to suffer more, while we don't even export anything too serious. Now that they (the government) have limited or canceled international transactions, I hope they have also made sure to limit those businessmen and other government officials that are playing more significant roles in the importing business because they are the ones who matter more while others who just buy a few things are going to suffer under these new rules.But Boss, do you think this rule, will affect those big business men and women who are really importanting more goods and way too much?",
