  "content": "So I asked a question in another thread but it was deleted because someone said I didnt have bitcoins. I don't know why you would post here if you didnt but thats beyond me.So lets pick up where we left off and if that person could post that list I was going through when the thread was deleted AFTER I proved I had a coinbase account.No drama just answers.I copied what I had in my last post for completeness. So I have been in BTC since it was around $1000 but my account was compromised due to me being lazy and the scammers got it all... or so I thought. I decided to open a new coinbase account this jan. but in the process (understatement IT WAS PAINFUL to reopen) I found the scammers left about $600 in XRP or ETH that had grown over the last few years.BUT... I also had a Monera (?) account I think? It was like a coinbase type exchange but located in south korea. I tried to reopen that one but sometime when the FTC or SEC began regulating bitcoin they said I had to live in south koreaI cant seem to find where you can upload an image (I know you are going to say isnt that convenient for your scam post to get merits/brownie points or or what ever)So I tried to copy and paste the text. Normally I would even bother but I found I like using this site when I get stuck trying to google.

This topic has nothing to do with the Bitcoin discussion, and as such it would be moved to a less visible board if by any chance someone reports it or maybe does so at some point. Having this nonsense moved to Off-Topic should suffice.Quote from: Lucius on March 22, 2025, 11:37:53 AMAnyway, I agree with you that there are a lot of made-up stories on the forum, but that doesn't surprise me at all - some people are willing to do absolutely anything for a few $ more.I refuse to believe this story. As far as I am concerned, this was an attempt to register a new account and try to build it up over time with an eventual hope of enrolling it in campaigns.Quote from: lexinexi on March 22, 2025, 12:05:57 PMOK 1st off I'm legally blind. Using this forum isn't easy so I often miss things. Of all the years I have been using the forum, this is something totally new. Legally blind?Quote from: lexinexi on March 22, 2025, 12:05:57 PMWould you like screen shots of my CB account?Yes, I would definitely like to see screenshots of your Coinbase account.Quote from: lexinexi on March 22, 2025, 12:05:57 PM I don't know why I would make up something so trivialAttention-seeking and merit fishing are two reasons worth considering. You don't know what legally blind is? Its a medical condition and nothing to do with how ever many years you run a forum unless it was an eye doctor forum and I have keratoconus (ICD 10 H18.6)  Google says: (why cant you google legally blind?)\"In the United States, someone is considered \"legally blind\" if their best-corrected visual acuity is 20/200 or less in their better eye, or if their field of vision is 20 degrees or less. Here's a more detailed explanation:    Visual Acuity:    This refers to the sharpness of vision. A person with 20/200 vision can see at 20 feet what a person with normal vision (20/20) can see at 200 feet. Field of Vision:This refers to the area a person can see while looking straight ahead without moving their eyes. A field of vision of 20 degrees or less is considered a limitation that can lead to legal blindness. Best Correction:This means the vision is measured even with the best possible glasses or contact lenses. Implications:Being legally blind can open up eligibility for various government programs and services, including vocational training, rehabilitation, schooling, disability benefits, and tax exemptions. Not the Same as Total Blindness:Legal blindness is a specific legal definition, and it doesn't mean someone is completely unable to see. Many people who are legally blind can still see some light and shapes. Low Vision:People with vision impairment that doesn't meet the criteria for legal blindness are often described as having low vision. Ok you want to see my coinbase I will entertain that if iy means I get answers to my posts. Im notgoping back and fourth but you say this is to attain \"merits\" on your site? Why would I want that? I come here once a month when I have a question. to access my account or something to that effect, Also they didn't have an AWESOME customer service 1-800 like CB's. (yeah sarcasm)This is all from memory as I have no access to my old email, computers or accounts.So is that exchamge called monara? I google'd and found a coin called by that but not sure if that coin is one the exchange uses like coinbase's USDC(That they try to trick you into buying by refunding your fees, but thats a comment for another post).TLDR: Was there an exchange called monaera? and how to access your account if its before they split USA accounts and Korean accounts? Also I am aware that these exchanges probably makie a $h!t load of money by closing little accounts people forgot about like when you throw away a gift card with 50 cents on it.",

Maybe you used that coin before and forget about it.Its hard to trace something especially if you forget about everything especially those important details. So this is really a big challenge also for sure you will get a lot of headache if you pursue this investigation since its like nothing will happen in this case.",

Monero is another cryptocurrency, it is not an exchange. You are probably getting confused by that.You can look at this list by blockspot which has a list of over 1,600 cryptocurrency exchanges. Nothing there matches what you're describing though. The only South Korean exchange starting with M is MecaCex according to that list.",
