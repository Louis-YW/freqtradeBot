Remember the brrrrrr money printing that they've made and other countries did as well during the height of pandemic. I am not an expert on this but I think also their adjustment of interest rates also contributes to the inflation and it all depends to what they think they should done to stimulate or control it.Combination of many factors, the war, opec controlling oil supplies, food shortage, etc and all of those do contribute to inflation of each country.",

Inflation occurs because the IMF family provides financial assistance to countries that request assistance for stimulus. As a result of covid. Then the IMF family creates a Ukrainian-Russian war (thus fossil oil and wheat) steps across all importing countries.And the effects of money printing by the IMF and the Ukraine-Russia conflict have begun to appear, which were deliberately created by the IMF family.

The more each country relies on one another, the more intertwined they become financially. In my opinion, I believe that the banks and the money that the banking system created unnaturally is what not only accelerated globalization, but the economic catastrophe to come.",

Then the IMF family creates a Ukrainian-Russian war (thus fossil oil and wheat) steps across all importing countries.What did the importing countries do with the fossil oil and grain they had while the Ukrainian-Russian war was still hot? Because when Covid was going on, almost all activities and work were always stopped and constrained because of this, so there wasn't much work that could be done by everyone around the world when Covid conditions occurred.QuoteAnd the effects of money printing by the IMF and the Ukraine-Russia conflict have begun to appear, which were deliberately created by the IMF family. When a secular economy is used throughout the world, this is how inflation happens all at once throughout the world.This is interesting to discuss further because I don't know much about what the IMF actually did in the past and also now or during the covid period and also when the Ukraine-Russia conflict started because I also believe that the inflation problem also arises from two reasons for this although I don't think that it was deliberately done by the IMF.",

      "body": "Current era inflation, is a perfect storm. Where a number of environmental, economic and private sector variables align to produce a negative cycle which occurs only once in 50 years? 100 years? 1,000 years? It all depends on how bad things get. Some of the damage is environmental. Elevated cases of earthquakes, flooding and natural disasters destroying crops. With elevated drought also destroying crops. I think every aspect of current state of affairs is known and reported on by journalists. Its not hard to use a search engine to research, map and blueprint the minutiae of how things are broken. The overwhelming majority appear to not follow news trends. If they follow them, they seem to not remember much of past history. Which makes it difficult for us to recognize most of the main contributing factors. Much less address them.Ancient rome used a silver coin known as the denarius around 200 BC. Which was known to be an era of high inflation for rome: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius#Debasement_and_evolution They reduced the amount of silver in the denarius over time, which led to inflation. That could represent a good text book case of inflation. As well as an excellent example for how gold and silver standards do not prevent inflation. Apparently we live in a strange world where we can put a man on the moon and achieve technological miracles. But when it comes to solving problems like inflation. Our developmental curve is probably lagging behind where we could like it to be.If you were the architect of a system designed to reduce risk of inflation in the future. How would you approach it? If 1 ounce of prevention is worth 1 pound of cure. Then prevention might be a goal worth pursuing. But somehow we have not seen much supply or demand of that type of mentality in the 2,000+ years of inflation wreaking havoc with the world's economies.",
