I find that this is not possible unless the investors rely on a third party for storage, which poses many complications, especially since those users can easily store their investments in private wallets that the government cannot know anything about.- It can be read that the German state encourages investment in crypto in the long term, but ordinary users (who do not want to store in the long term) still suffer from the taxes imposed on them. I don't know if there were reliable stats.",

I don't know if there were reliable stats.I think the strategy is actually good for two reasons, one this will stop all the illegitimate or grey market trading of Cryptos as people would be incentivised to buy on exchange or institutional exchanges so that they get this tax incentive, similarly if you see from one perspective people will now be able to report crypto related crimes as the government is recognising it as an asset, crimes can also be caught and therefore criminals can be punished as well, but yes data collection of users is one disadvantage but honestly I am ready to bear with it as long as you are having these advantages.",

We all know that criminals can use untraceable methods in addition to the money laundering policy.These decisions affect a wide range of users and it can be said that they benefit directly. What concerns me is how this small group of senior users will find solutions to overcome the disadvantages of such a process.",
