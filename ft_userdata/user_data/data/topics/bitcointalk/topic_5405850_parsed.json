  "content": "I believe there's a need for us to analyze the common reasons why many engage on cryptocurrency scams, the rate at which this occur and how the percentage of affected users contribute to either adoption of bitcoin or create more disbelieves among other people about cryptocurrency, there's no doubt about it that many assets had suffered great losses due to the  fraudulent activities of scam and hacking using various techniques and mode of operations, but I've take it a challenge to engage on the discussion to hear from the the community the reason why there's an increasing rate of scam.The challenge here is to everyone of us, that we all complained of the daily increasing rate of cryptocurrency scam some were affected while other not yet, but have we not in one way or the other, directly or indirectly involved or contributed to scam rate, how have we found ourselves being in the best position to take full responsibility in fixing this challenge of increasing scam rate. Why People Engage in Scamming Some reasons to why there's an ever increasing scam rate in cryptocurrency are listed below, I don't need to explain those points further, they are direct and explanatory.∆ Improper Education∆ Iddleness and Joblessness∆ Friends and Environmental Influence∆ Lack of Parental Care/Bad Upbringings∆  Uncontempted habbit and Greediness∆ Bad Government∆ Hunger and Poverty∆ To Avenge/Revenge on someoneCommon Examples of Scam and ApproachesDiagram illustrations on some ways they penetrate on users to launch their attacks and scam people.     Not being careful enough leads to misinformation by the crypto influencers because they are always finding an illegal means for survival, imposters on social media platforms pretend to be what and whom they are not and make use of games and collectibles, fake crypto investments platforms to launch a Phishing attack on crypto users.References:https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-avoid-cryptocurrency-scamshttps://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/common-crypto-scams/amp/https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/privacy-and-security/avoiding-phishing-and-scams/avoiding-cryptocurrency-scamshttps://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scamshttps://www.coindesk.com/learn/2020/12/16/new-to-bitcoin-stay-safe-and-avoid-these-common-scams/",

      "body": "Is there actually any any solid evidence to suggest that crypto scams are increasing ? It may be that they are reported more as crypto becomes more main stream? If we look at this …https://www.vox.com/recode/23153469/bitcoin-crypto-scam-report-ftcSome factors that may skew any evidence to suggest they are increasing include 1. Just because a ransom is asked to be paid in crypto doesn’t mean it’s a crypto scam 2. Reported losses v unreported losses 3. Romance scams are still romance scams whether they are pid in crypto or FIAT4. business and government impersonation scams- again these have been going on for years and have nothing to do with crypto - FIAT or crypto accepted !I don’t mean to derail your thread OP, but It would be nice to have some solid evidence - which I’m sure would be hard to find ?",

Scammers moved to something called \"cash mailing\" where they package the money and send via courier to someone who picks it for them and then forwards it to them in wherever location they may be, this method is also very risky and tasking for scammers. With the start of crypto and how transactions can be made seamlessly to anonymous accounts directly eliminating the banks and their middleman,  scammers knowing this are taking full advantage of the crypto space and now channeling efforts to finding out new dubious methods tailored around cryptocurrency. This is a reason to me why crypto scam rate is increasing amongst the others listed.",

I believe the reason for such isn't far fetched too because it's the attitude of giving a dog a bad name just to hang it. There's so much bad press on cryptocurrency and the proponents of such are trying to run it down by making sure every little negativity of crypto doesn't go undetected.Come to think of it, OP missed the most important thing that triggers scammers when it comes to cryptos and that's greed.

But apart from that, the reason they commit fraud is because of greed, laziness and unemployment, so scammers create shortcuts to be able to make more money quickly.Crime in crypto is on the rise, but crypto users are also more vigilant. some new methods of crypto scams are starting to emerge, but most of them are still using the old methods to target new users who really don't know anything about crypto.No money and free gifts, if you get them without doing anything, please be aware.",
