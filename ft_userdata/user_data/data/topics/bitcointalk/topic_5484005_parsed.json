      "body": "well lets spin the argument aroundif custodial services do not treat CUSTOMERS coins as liabilities custodians owe to customers.. are custodians to treat customers coins as the custodians assetsthink about itid rather have it that custodians dont claim bitcoin as the custodians assets and instead legally be known to be customers property a custodian has where the custodian owes the customer(custodian liability)i do understand that by listing it as a custodians liability it makes custodians not want to gather coin as it harms their asset:liability accounting sheet. but those liabilities are never considered as \"realised losses\" to be of real harm to a business and instead are just a line on a spreadsheet. a line on a spredsheet that actually treats customers as fairly treated creditors should a custodial business get into financial trouble for other reasons. without customers coins being treated as the custodians own assets to then be syphoned off to pay other creditors that are not the customer, thus meaning the customer only get pennies on the dollar when making claims",
