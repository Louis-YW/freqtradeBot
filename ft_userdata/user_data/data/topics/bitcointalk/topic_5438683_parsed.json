Its someone watching or spying on you. Just clean your PC and reset everything before making new accounts anywhere again.I also suggest you to DM theymos amd Cyrus frequently to catch their attention for your case, so you can get back access to your account one day, hopefully faster.

If i can, i will sign too today but yeah i can't it anymore.

Yeap i have an intention to buy an account back then, i mean i'm just graduating from the highschool and found some place to earn money some money while discussing and learning some stuff with fellow crypto, so why not?But overtime i see some stuff and rules on the forum so i discouraged my intention to buy it and as you can see rather than buying this account if something harmful was happens just like today. About \"bought\" phrase it just some reference price on the local facebook bitcointalk forum here https://www.facebook.com/groups/1557899881188998 you can check it yourself. Yeah, it's my fault too and breaking the rules but i'm truly didn't buy anything, but it's up to you to trust me or not .Quote from: FatFork on February 08, 2023, 01:48:45 PMYes, I checked the BPIP.org data as well.

First, i didn't use that merit for joining, farming on some bounty campaign, selling account or anything. The simple explanation is1. You can't send image when it's newbie and i actively engaging with other people back then, so that the first reason why exchange merit with that account since it's still newbie back then when the merit implemented2. You can't send link when it's newbie and i actively engaging with other people back then, that the second reason.Yeah it's not allowed to exchange merit with my own account but that's my reason, why i use second account to engage other? the reason is a little bit stupid. I like \"GabrielKiara\" name rather than \"dhemasm\" so i try to focus on that account but yeah it's get hacked, but it's up to you to trust me or not .Basically i'm not even have a lot time to doing a full time account farming, i'm just regularly joining some proven campaign like digital gold campaign and rarely joining other campaign like from bountydetective, lauda, royse or some reputated manager also trying to busting some scam project/scammer just like you =)) as you can see on my post and thread, it's just i also have full-time work and joining bounty so it's just some side income for me while updating with the crypto condition/trend today and bountyAnd dude i'm not evading the ban, the reason was on the first post, it's said that my account was hacked and used for creating malicious ANN. I mean i'm not dumb enough if i want to farm the bct account and sell or using it for bounty but using same name with my personal Steemit and Twitter was same with Gabrielkiara and this account.Well, it's ok if i didn't get back my account that's means it was goodbye. Thank you for this 5 years i learn a lot and even get a real job because of this forum, i just want to share a clarification here, Cheers!",

I mean i'm not dumb enough to post it with my main address account if i want to \"farm\" the account, for what? and is there \"connected\" transaction from there? ethereum is decentralized, you can trace if there any, he/she posting a lot of random address there. And i didn't even know who the hell was that, we have search feature and basically if i want to remove the \"proof\" before, i can login to that account and removing that post before i posting this thread since the account was not banned on the bpip, i suppose?  There is 3 simple reason.1. People want revenge because i reporting their alts (You can see my post and thread history though), i'm also just like you but don't lucky enough who have \"a lot of time\" to do research and report it after, and boom get a merit or some trust, but for this one you guys are rock clearing the community!2. Copy and pasting PoA, you can see his post above, there's a lot people posting same format and maybe a same people, sometimes people lazy enough to change the format such as address or anything and yeah you see my address there even it was not me.3. He/she managing to much account and forgot to change the PoA was copied from my PoA as you can see here for reference https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2544574.msg52552928#msg52552928Anyway, just some leaving stuff here. I'm also doing same back then, reporting alts but yeah what's i got was my almost negative trust from timelord here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2544574.msg57949855#msg57949855  Just want to share a quote from lovesmayfamilisQuoteA loud enough accusation, without clear evidence. You claim that these 2 accounts avoid the ban and use multiple accounts, but for this, you have to provide evidence that I cannot see in any way.Conducting single transactions is not evidence. Do not forget that you are on the forum, as well as on the Internet, and users can communicate with each other.In the future, please be sure of your accusations.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2544574.msg57950705#msg57950705Edited: In the first post we can see clearly there was dhemasm account \"Posting\" an random [ANN] with malicious file, did you even see that YOSHIE? Maybe you should click that link and download, maybe you should try that before and make an accusations later, And i'm truly sure my account was \"Hacked\" and not \"Doubting about it\", see on ninjatic websitte.Quote from: YOSHIE on February 08, 2023, 03:54:45 PMDid you sell @dhemasm or did get hacked but a little doubt hacked.so we can see if i sell it to him for making an [ANN] or notCoz i see another thread about that stuff toohttps://ninjastic.space/search?title=RadiumX%20New%20PoW%20coin%20.%20No%20ICO.%20No%20Masternode Cheers!Edited 2, February 08, 2023, 05:18:39 PM: I'm truly sure i didn't even know who is that Casini guy and his \"alt\" but yeah your choice if you are trust me or not   and yeap the prove was there where \"Casini\" using my address but basically let's use a simple logic, not an essay though. Let's say If you or us are a account farmer and becoming a people that managing \"A lot of that account\", are you going to use the main address, even multiple times as you said where it's used basically on the main account to register on the campaign and risk it to getting banned? I mean, we aren't a dumb enough, are we?But Yes YOSHIE let's wait and see how the admin decision for that hacking stuff, Cheers!",

I mean i'm not dumb enough if i want to farm the bct account and sell or using it for bounty but using same name with my personal Steemit and Twitter was same with Gabrielkiara and this account.Your alt account GabrielKiara has been banned since July 6, 2019 and you are evading the ban by using other accounts. You haven't offered any credible proof of a hack. Additionally, I have easily challenged the explanations you have given so far with verifiable evidence.Quote from: AnastasyaKiara on February 08, 2023, 03:05:09 PMWell, it's ok if i didn't get back my account i just want to share a clarification here, cheersIf you truly wish to do so, it's best to stop lying to begin with.",

Additionally, I have easily challenged the explanations you have given so far with verifiable evidence.Nope i'm truly sure that i'm not evading ban for this one even some i lying there, The email and password was changed but not by me, it's truly hacked though not sold or whatever is it, we can wait mod/admin for it to see the access history. I'm not using it anymore when it's banned and yeah i didn't any effort to recover it and just let it go back then, Trust me or not your choice but that's the fact. I'm not forcing you or the others.Quote from: FatFork on February 08, 2023, 05:39:19 PMIf you truly wish to do so, it's best to stop lying to begin with.  Hmm, yeah it's my mistake. But it's normal for people or just me (?) when someone pointing my past \"disgrace\" or not sure how to spell it even though it's happen more than 4 years before? Yeah you got me, but still the fact was above, i'm not lying though for that one.Basically, before i'm just expecting to doing normal stuff like before though, nothing more nothing less on this forum just same in the last this 3-4 years, getting some \"small\" side income, trying to helping the community by bust some scammer/scam project or dicuss with each other (even though i'm not really active in the past 3-5 months), learning some new stuff (I learn a lot mining stuff here especially GPU-based algo), etc. But it seems it was end, Well thanks bitcointalk really got a lot and learn good stuff in this 6 years.",
