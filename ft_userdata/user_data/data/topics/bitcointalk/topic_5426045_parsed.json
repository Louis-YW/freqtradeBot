  "content": "Some few weeks back, I started a topic/thread in the gambling discussion board, it was welcomed and housed alot of contributions from the community.Topic/Thread was about the currently ongoing Qatar 2022 World Cup, it was one I am supposed to keep updated as new developments show up, and of course I had that in mind..So today, something new came up and I needed to update the topic/thread, but unfortunately, I can't find the thread anywhere in my  topic history, I've searched all through but could not find it or any sign suggesting it was moved, so, right now, I am assuming the topic was deleted.But then also, I follow my email mailbox and messages on this forum very closely, there has never been any notification telling me a topic/thread of mine was deleted.Because in the past, I used to get a notification in my message inbox and email that a comment or post of mine was deleted either by forum admin or the OP(in the case of a self moderated topic), but recently, like for some weeks now, I come online and notice a significant decline in my post count without any notice of the post or comments that was deleted, I never really saw or considered it a problem, but finding out today that a topic I started was deleted without any notice, I think this one got my attention and I would want to really know why it is so...Is it ideal that a topic with up to 3(three) pages of comments would be deleted without notifying  or any form notice to the OP.What do you guys think about this?, I really don't know how this makes me feel right now, sad or happy I can't tell, really.",

We already have a topic about the World Cup opened in April and is not moderated, so why would we need another one?Nothing to feel sad about, smile, just how you have made us smile with this thing:  Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on November 29, 2022, 08:24:35 PMHow possible is it that two world cup matches are being played at the same time?Current match I believe is between Iran vs USA, but stake is reporting that  Wales vs England match is also live, how is this possible on the same stadium?Also, what the gambling board needs is not  \"updates\" on what the score was or who was playing but actual gambling discussions, odds, handicaps, sure betting, lay betting and so on before the match starts, the 100 posts on who won the previous game and who scored are just useless quota posts.",

And messages moved to trash can be reinstated by the admin to the board it was posted.Mods act at their discretion and you would not always agree with their decision.",

The WC discussions are already being held in more than one thread in the gambling discussion board, and it doesn't matter if every new one takes a different subject title, they are all discussions about the WC, and no more is necessary.",

I think that's the reason why it is deleted in the first place and about the notification like email, that I don't know of. Actually, I actually experienced the same thing but mine wasn't about a thread/topic being deleted but a post of mine got deleted and I also didn't received any email in my message that it is deleted and I am sure that I have post that is deleted since I checked it yesterday and the total post made that day is not the same as when I checked it later on.",

It is a must to check everything (existing topics) before creating a topic (thread), so don't blame the moderator removes it if we made a mistake. I guess you know the reason is, the moderator doesn't need to inform you, mate.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on December 06, 2022, 06:34:37 PMWhat do you guys think about this?, I really don't know how this makes me feel right now, sad or happy I can't tell, really. Why feel sad? It is something usual, almost all members ever experienced the same thing (got deleted comments).Just take a lesson, mate!! Be more careful before creating any thread.",

I believe the user was told that mods do not notify the author of a deleted post or the commenters on that post, and that it makes no sense to send hundreds of messages out of a deleted post to all users who commented on that post. You'll be notified if only one of your comments is deleted from a forum post, rather than the entire thread, as in this case.",

There's many pointless thread created almost everyday by signature campaign participants and the user is always him.
