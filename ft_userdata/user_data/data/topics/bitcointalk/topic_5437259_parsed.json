Because I saw there are many knowledgeable members whose posts will increase my knowledge and will bring a extra speed to my work. I know users can be followed particularly but I think it wastes a lot of time and sometimes misses a lot. Also, since there is an ignore option in the forum, How would it be? turning on an option for following.Also, I would request to @TryNinja to create another option in that telegram bot to track user's posts option like the track topic option .",

Follow a user (i.e for every time he posts something). Thinking about including an option for disallowing others to follow him.2. Some kind of mailing list. You go to the bot and create a mailing list, you get a code that you can share on your topic. Other people can send the code to the bot so they enable notifications for your list. You, the list creator, can notify everyone by adding something like \"notify myMailingList\" on your post.Unfortunately, this won't go live until I come back from my next trip tho (1-2 months).ETA is I’ll be back at home in less than a month.",

I don't think that bot is engineered to follow or monitor users. It's for mention. There's another bot in the forum that also monitors bounties – https://t.me/btt_bounty. If you're looking to follow a particular user, the way I do mine is to constantly check up their profile for new threads or posts. If it's to follow topics started in threads, just click on \"watch\" and you will automatically get notifications whenever someone replies in that thread.",

You can manually check those pages daily if you want. Using this following way, you will have to filter who you actually want to follow. It is not like Twitter, when you manually follow too many members, you will waste  more time to check their post history pages.",

      "body": "This would be a great idea if implemented on the forum or a third party server. There are lots of knowledgeable members and many boards, this makes it difficult to keep up with everything that's posted over time. Having a system that notifies you when a user posts would be great. Extra points if you can choose the boards on which you would want to read their posts, for example, I might want to follow a user, but not want to be notified of their posts in Meta board.Quote from: digaran on January 29, 2023, 07:26:25 PMThis should be on forum, not using a third party tool,It can be either. Third party tools have been useful in many areas of the forum.",
