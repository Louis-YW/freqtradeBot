  "content": "Hydranet is for some absurd reason going completely under the radar for most people, and I honestly don't understand how a project as this one is valuated anything LESS than 200-300 mio marketcap, without exaggerating  They've built their own multi currency light wallet, supporting: ETH, BTC, LTC, USDC, USDT, HDN and more will follow. Within this wallet, you can send/recieve/trade your assets without compromising on your custody of these. This project makes use of The Lightning Network, and Connext (similar to Lightning, but built for Ethereum), meaning you can trade for PENNIES, pretty much instantly.  This means, you can trade native BTC for ETH, without bridging between chains, or by using wrapped assets, such as wBTC. For anyone who has ever traded on Uniswap, especially during the bullruns, fees can run up to CRAZY amounts, which sucks! This beast of a DEX is going public this quarter, which is why it has been one of the most appreciating assets over the past week. Hydranet is built on Arbitrum. The token itself is not needed to use the DEX, but holders are getting up to 25% fee reduction while trading, which is pretty awesome if you're running bots with huge volume. The DEX itself will also use the trading fees for buy-backs, similar to how Binance does it. Only difference is, fees collected are used to buy HDN, which is then burned from the total supply. Website: https://hydranet.ai/Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hydranet/This one is a hidden gem, the potential here is massive, considering it's insanely low marketcap still. If it gets a marketcap similar to Uniswap eventually, you're looking at $26/token, and that's in a bear market  The only down side for this project is, that the DEX itself isn't web-based. There's no such thing as web-based Lightning nodes (yet), but who knows, the possibilities are endless. If you remember the Exodus wallet back in time, where you could swap your coins whenever you felt like it, without KYC - This works practically the same way, using the \"Simple Swap\" feature, which is for newbies, who don't want to use the actual DEX.",

      "body": "Yes, that's exactly what I think too! I've been following the project since 2018. Back then it was still XSN, or Stakenet, and they had developed their own Layer-1 Chain, which apparently tied up a lot of resources. Reinventing the wheel in this regard might have been a bit over the top! Since they rethought and reoriented themselves a little over a year ago, everything has been running perfectly and the development of their main unique feature, the Layer-3 DEX, is advancing incredibly quickly. I also feel that the team has matured over time and is now working at the highest level of professionalism.And I can only agree with the previous speaker: the potential, or the technical advantages that this project brings, are in no way proportional to its current market capitalization. The security and transparency of a DEX paired with the efficiency of Lightning/Connext... plus the first-mover advantage. I don't know what more needs to be said about that.Telegram: https://t.me/hydranetofficialDiscord: https://discord.gg/hydranet",

      "body": "Of course, I can only speak for myself at this point, because I don't know the OP. To ensure 100% transparency on my part: I have been accumulating tokens of this project since 2018, so I am definitely biased. However, I have no connections to anyone involved in the development of the project and I'm not paid for writing here. I'm just a silent reader on Discord to keep myself informed about the status.. sometimes I ask questions.The reason one specifically has not heard anything about Hydranet, or the token HDN at this point, has different reasons, in my opinion:I became aware of the project in 2018 through a user named \"Jumperbillijumper\". At that time, I was particularly interested in the topic of consensus building in conjunction with blockchains and this project then had the intention to develop its own Layer-1 Chain, with its own consensus mechanism \"Trusted Proof-of-Stake/TPoS\". Here is a very old video of the user on this: https://youtu.be/suM6EQG9QXgLater, other YouTubers from the German-speaking area also addressed the project: https://youtu.be/dyL0hasDGT0But as already mentioned, the team bit off more than they could chew with the development of a complete Layer-1 Chain and had no spare resources to focus on the actual feature, a Layer-3 DEX based on Lightning/Connext. Therefore, the project was relaunched and rebranded a little over a year ago. Stakenet/XSN then became Hydranet/HDX.A few weeks ago, it was decided that the token symbol HDX was unfortunately chosen, as it was already used by another project. Therefore, the symbol was changed from HDX to HDN.It must be said that marketing was not the team's strength so far. Add to that, Cryptopia and LiveCoin had a significant share of the trading volume at times, both of which, as is well known, were \"hacked\". Token Hodlers therefore did not necessarily always have luck with their investment, regardless of the project. Although we all know: not your keys, not your coins!Nevertheless, one has to give credit to the team for not being deterred by any bear market since 2018. The foresight, the perseverance and the uniqueness speak for me personally primarily for the project!Of course, these are only the impressions/experiences of someone who has invested in this project. As always, do your own research!There is also a Medium, but I don't know how frequently they update it: https://medium.com/@HydranetQuote from: jrrsparkles on July 25, 2023, 05:59:28 PMI want to ask you that how does it really make it as DEX if the trades are happening off chain? because it says assets can be traded without the L2 layer which seems impossible.May I ask where exactly you read that it is possible to trade without L2? Because as far as I understood, the exact opposite is the case: different L2s are connected (via Lightning/Connext) and that's exactly where the magic happens:https://docs.hydranet.ai/blog/how-does-the-hydranet-dex-workhttps://i.ibb.co/b2C21rw/Hydranet-Workflow.png",

This project solves ALL the problems I see with crypto right now, which is why I'm SO confident that it will be a HUGE performer long term. 1) It puts and end to outrageous trading fees, compared with other DEX's, since they use 2nd layer channels. 2) Easy to use, convienient. Anyone who used the Exodus desktop wallet back in 2017, remembers how EASY and convenient it was to exchange assets on the fly, without KYC. Hydranet built a feature called \"Simple Swap\", which is pretty much the same. 3) The marketcap is ridiculously LOW. There are projects in the top 50, with a marketcap in the billions with NO product, and here you have a project with one of the most ground breaking products in the crypto spare, with a marketcap around 20 million. The upside here is, insane, which is why I wanted to share as much info as possible, so anyone reading this can do their own research, and ask questions etc.",

It seems interesting.  Is the max supply capped, or do the devs have any plans to change it later? The supply is capped at 300 mio. Fees on the DEX will be used to buy-back HDN, and burn them off the total supply. So depending on volume, the supply will be deflationary. The DEX is ready when it's ready, it has been stated many times on their Discord, that they dont want to release anything that doesn't work like 99,9% of the time. Should be ready by Q3 at the latest I believe.",
