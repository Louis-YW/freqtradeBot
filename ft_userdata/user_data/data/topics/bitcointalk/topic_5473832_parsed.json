Does anybody know of a better way? Thanks!Binance is the best place to short since it’s their native utility token. Do you have any specific preference on the exchange you are using since it’s odd that you missed the most popular exchange to short it for e-Toro exchange that is not originally crypto exchange.Dydx offers decentralized perp trading but I don’t see BNB in there just in case you are looking for exchange that doesn’t require KYC.",

KYC is not a concern - the opposite is the case, the more regulated and trustworthy the exchange/brokerage, the better.I guess there is nothing like a smart crypto swap with btc/eth as collateral?",

Tell me the metrics you use to determine if a platform is the most trustworthy. Personally, I don't like how brokers like Etoro operate. They have far too many limitations for retail traders, including subjecting them to tedious KYC verification.I would rather use another crypto exchange that has BNB perpetual futures listed on it. There are quite many around.",
