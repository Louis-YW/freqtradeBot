I want to withdraw funds but they tell that I must pay tax at 18% in Singapore - is this right? And are they reputable please? If you have any money you deposited in that scam site, then consider it gone. It's not the responsibility of an exchange to collect the tax on behalf of your country's taxing authority.I wonder how you came to know about the exchange because its domain doesn't even show up on Google search engine.I am also surprised at how they have already built apps for Android and iOS. Probably malware that people shouldn't trustLinks to the apps.1. iOS – https://apps.apple.com/us/app/statiayex/id64490680172. Android – https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.syeax.papp&pli=1.And here is another lie. The domain is just 2 months old, as already discovered.QuoteFounded in 2013, Statiayex is a leading global player in the digital economy industry. Its mission is to break through the core blockchain technology and integrate blockchain technology with other industries.compliance and diversification",
