I do not know of now but when WazirX was hacked, the exchange was unable to pay their customers and the exchange was shutdown at the time. But I know of BingX, the exchange continued to function and their users have access to withdraw. BingX is functioning good till now.But not your key not your coin.",

Only an idiot.Fixed that for you.Some exchanges are much better than others. For example Coinbase and Kraken the two oldest exchanges in the world have never been hacked.I wouldn't leave my funds on any exchange, but the reality is many still do because they have no idea about self-custody and will probably never learn.In reality such people are probably more likely to lose their funds by losing their private keys or by mishandling self-custody, so it may be less risky for certain people to leave on the exchange than to self-custody, depending on the quality of the exchange's security. So if you're going to leave your funds on an exchange the least you can do is research its track record and do your due diligence.Millions of bitcoin have been lost forever simply because people lost their private keys or mishandled a self-custody transaction, etc.",

Overall, there are a lot of risks that we will face if we store bitcoins on centralized platforms but that does not mean that storing bitcoins in personal, non-custodial wallets is completely safe. I believe there are also hundreds of personal, non-custodial wallet hacks happening every year but most go unreported. Therefore, we should also be careful in protecting personal security when using non-custodial wallets, do not be subjective that we will be absolutely safe with it.",
