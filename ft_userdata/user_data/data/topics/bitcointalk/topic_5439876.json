Most commonly they use YouTube and blog reviews to make a list of top 5 or top 10 mixer sites but in actual sense, all the Bitcoin mixers listed are scamUnfortunately, some people fall for this kind of scam because they do not do proper research.",

On the footer of the second website from the above list, they claim they have a bitcoin Ann and campaign threads, which is obviously not true. I wonder how would someone trust such fake websites and send them his money!Some of them are already on the list of known fake mixers created by LeGaulois, as decodx has mentioned. You can post on his thread so he can update to let him know about the other ones.",

You will not be able to file a complaint against them to any government agency.So the only way is to warn users about these scam mixers before they fall into their trap.",

Many must have likely be scammed of their hard earned resources unknown to them that those mixers listed are not what they thought they are but I had a second thought over it, OP have not yet presented any evidence to back the claim of scam accusations and I would also ask op if op have hadany experience with any of the mixers mentioned on this thread.  I think presenting an evidence too would help go along way to back ops claims.  There are still good mixers out there that you can give a try such as [banned mixer].

Proven to be reliable and trustworthy.Yes, there are a lot of good mixers as well, such as [banned mixer], which is in my signature, but it is the responsibility of any user to do his research and does not depend entirely on anyone’s recommendation because in the first and last, these are his assets and he is the first responsible for them. There have been many scam mixers that try to appear as legitimate and offer desirable features to anyone, and in addition to that, there are scammers who create sites similar to the official legal mixer, so we have to pay attention to the official mixer domain link that we will deal with, also what falls on us is to report their scam domains so that more customers and users do not incur Potential vast losses of their capital.",
