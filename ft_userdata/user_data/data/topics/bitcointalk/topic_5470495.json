I can understand the reasoning behind this; an exchange that operates daily is more susceptible to hacking. The fact that they continue to operate reflects the effectiveness of their security measures. Additionally, I believe exchanges like Binance offer insurance on the funds deposited with them. In the event of a hack, which has occurred to Binance before, the SAFU fund, if I recall correctly, would come to the rescue.Exactly the SAFU funds idea was created around 2018 and it is said that 10% of trading fees will be going into it and as at of last year it was announced to hold around 1 billion in coins like bnb and btc. But if you look at the logic of how this SAFU funds are save you will be your own bank. The exchanges themselves safe their funds on cold wallets, a clear example of this is that the SAFU funds it self is saved there. Now do we all think that the cold wallets can still be hacked from exchanges? I doubt. The vulnerability of using cold wallet is almost similar even if it is set up by you or by an exchange. And we all know that this SAFU funds, the amount the exchange announce to users are just to keep them at peace and trust them but in a nutshell it is not the right amount there just like the FTX reserve funds reviled during this their saga. Even if an hack happens it usually just take plenty of court time before even half of the funds are refunded. So I believe that there are other hidden things behind institutions trusting exchanges to hold their funds for them rather than trusting this SAFU funds. Institutions have the ability to set up a multi sig cold wallet by them selves and protect it from hackers better than trusting exchanges that use similar method of storage",

I would conclude that large and ordinary investors consider CEX as some kind of crypto bank, which of course does not make much sense when it comes to Bitcoin. Although such funds are always at risk, perhaps considering the knowledge of these people, it is a safer option than non-custodial wallets. Being your own bank is not easy and carries with it great risks, and sometimes it is much easier to leave those risks to others.No matter how we look at this question, the fact is that there is only one correct answer - that regardless of the custody storage method, the well-known saying \"not your keys, not your coins\" still applies.",

While there could be the insurance that they give or allows these institutions to avail it, another reason could be is about liquidation.",

Also, the full results show that 33% hold coins in cold storage and 18% use hot wallets. This means that the responders use different storage methods simultaneously. And without knowing the proportion of allocated coins, this poll is not very useful. It could be that many investors hold the majority of their coins in self-custody while having a smaller share of their coins on exchanges for day trading.",

On the other hand, institutions that understands that it is only them that can keep their bitcoin safe, will use a hardware wallet so that they can be in full control of the safety of their coins.

I don't think there is something special that institutional investors use to secure their crypto assets than these two options, but there are other ways to keep your keys safe too whatever you plan to do, make sure your keys are stored offline. These investors are big players in this space and they are more powerful than retail investors, so they don't always move all their funds off the market, they can also manipulate the market if they have the chance to, and that's why they always lose money some times if a centralized exchange collapse. I remember that this was why Kevin was mad with CZ when he exposed the FTX exchange, the main point I got from Kevin's mouth was the millions of dollars trapped and gone, he was a big investor but not really pained about the atrocities committed by Sam but he was mad that CZ ruined the corrupt exchange.

The next thing that comes to my mind is a custodial wallet as they do not want to take the pain of setting up a new wallet. I believe custodial wallets are what they use to store their Bitcoin as they are third-party responsibility and if anything happens they would blame the wallet provider. The next they would do is to insure those wallets as they do want to get profit in case the wallet gets compromised. Isn't this what they have been doing since the day centralized governance started?",

It's complete madness to store cryptoassets on exchanges.

Or rather, they live differently from small crypto holders.In essence, institutional investors use cryptocurrencies like some kind of stock market shares and are a speculative instrument. Therefore, storage also turns out to be original and appropriate. Shifting the responsibility of storing crypto assets to exchanges, even in a sense, into the hands of institutional investors. No matter how paradoxical it may sound, the risks with secure storage are reduced, because they place all responsibility on the exchange and hope that the exchange will enforce guarantees (compensation for damage in case of theft or hacking). Also, in this case, there is no need to create own secure storage system, maintain it in working order and bear your own risks. It seems that institutional investors are even better off this way, unlike ordinary cryptoholders. Although, for sure, there will be many of these among ordinary holders. It seems to me that the cryptoindustry is increasingly becoming centralized and dependent on big platforms like binance, which is not good at all.",
