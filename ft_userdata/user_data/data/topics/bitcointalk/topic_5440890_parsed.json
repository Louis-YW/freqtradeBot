Most nodes will reject any new transaction spending those same UTXOs due to the fact that an existing transaction spending them already exists (ie. rejection due to double spend).",

But even with zapwallettexes, other nodes will simply keep your transaction in their mempools.Your current option is to enable \"full rbf\" by adding the line: mempoolfullrbf=1 to your bitcoin.conf file which should enable you to (manually) create a replacement without the flag.However, not all nodes and miners are configured with full rbf so the chance that it'll get confirmed before the previous transaction is quite low.(so far, AFAIK, there's only one mining pool that's enabled full-rbf; but it's not one of the big pools)",

Most likely, the money is gone, anyway. So even 20sat/vB or 100 would be better than losing it all.Since nobody asked yet: are you sure it is an Indian scammer? How were you confident about the deal in one second and right after sending you immediately knew it was an Indian scammer and that you need to abort the transaction?",

I'm not familiar with such platforms, but I guess they have a built-in payment method which is more expensive due to fees. So he was able use that as an excuse to move the trade off-platform where there is no protection.Anyways, without a transaction ID, there's not a lot we can discuss. The money is gone most probably, anyway, so all I can say is I hope you learnt your lesson. Bitcoin is not some PayPal thing with customer support. Payments are final. It is a feature, but it has to be used consciously. It is the reason escrow services exist on this forum for instance.",

I suggest enable RBF in your wallet as suggested above so that you can easily reverse the transaction. Anyway, about the guide from my post above check this https://blog.coinb.in/guide_double_spend_rbf",

You were lucky that your fee was as low as it was to be able to have as much time as you did to solve the problem. It's a shame that you could not solve it in time...I'm sorry for your loss.Also, you really should be keeping your client up to date. Using a client out-dated by over 2 years for any application let alone one that is finance-related is generally not the best security practice.",
