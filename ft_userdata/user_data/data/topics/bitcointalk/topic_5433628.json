  "content": "i am new in bitcointalk forum., but after joining I feel happy because my insight has increased little by little because I always see and discuss about bitcoin and crypto. so joining this forum makes me happy and more enthusiastic about investing in bitcoin.but of course in discussions there are always obstacles in between, there are always those who disagree with us, even many of our posts are criticized, but that way we will think and learn so that in the future we will become more mature, and become people who have quality discussions.and that's my experience as a beginner in bitcointalk.so for beginners newer than me have to be ready in between.1: don't be shy when we express opinions, or questions.2: you have to be mentally strong when someone criticizes you harshly.and don't be hurt.3: when discussing, don't get carried away by negative emotions.4: if our postremoved by moderator don't be discouraged. so by deleting our posts it should be a lesson, so that in the future we will be good and quality in posting.I hope my post is useful for all of us, especially beginners who are newer than me. I'm ready to be corrected, or if my post is not useful, I'm willing to delete my post by the moderator.",

Additionally, since this is not a physical gathering, I don't anticipate new members acting that way. However, I advise beginners to always grasp the question they are attempting to ask, which means they should also try to formulate the inquiry in understandable ways.Quote from: Solokan on January 09, 2023, 02:50:25 PM you have to be mentally strong when someone criticizes you harshly.and don't be hurt.Anyone who is willing to learn will never be subject to criticism because everyone makes mistakes. Just always strive to put other people's behavior ahead of your attitude. You will occasionally feel wounded by other people's actions toward you, but accept that it is just a fact of life.Quote from: Solokan on January 09, 2023, 02:50:25 PM if our postremoved by moderator don't be discouraged. so by deleting our posts it should be a lesson, so that in the future we will be good and quality in posting. This why newbie are expected to read and comprehend the forum rules before posting anything. Once you make a valuable post, it cannot be removed. Removing a post  should be inspire to the user, not depress them, since the user should be aware of the error that led to the removal of the post so that they can learn from it and move on to make improvements.",

Newbies to the forum usually have a certain perspective of how things work and can easily feel frustrated if certain discussions come off as too harsh to them or if they are not getting any merits despite their perceived efforts. Lots of this comes down to how they were introduced to the forum and what they expect from it;Those who are here to learn would likely not feel to attached and would take it as just another forum where they discuss Bitcoin.Those who were told you come in hear to earn would be more desperate and are more likely to feel frustrated.Relax, learn and have a bit of fun while at it.",

People generally won't call you names here, unless you have an established negative reputation (I'm talking not about the reputation score here, but the actual reputation). If someone doesn't agree with your point, it doesn't mean they are \"criticizing you harshly\". Countering someone's arguments and defending your arguments is the whole point of a forum, if everyone just agreed with each other, there would be no need to talk about anything.",

For example there are cases where certain people intentionally spread misinformation by using technobabble and repetition of well known FUDs, the response such things get are always deservedly harsh.But of course there could be exceptions to what I said. Like a beginner who unknowingly spreads FUD and is treated harshly, but we are all human and fallible.",

But not sure and time will tell. You just join the forum this month which has not even up to a month but you know the forum more than even a senior member in the forum who has been in the forum for one full year. All the things you said to some extent are correct I repeat again, a newbie of two weeks in the forum will never know all things. So I asking you a question how do you know all these things within two weeks as a newbie? I believe it is possible to learn about the forum before participating in its activities.The forum rules and regulations are there to guide us; if thoroughly studied, all of the points mentioned in the OP should have been known before beginning to post in the forum. Nonetheless, you may have a valid reason for saying all of this, but I consider your response to be one of the critics he may be referring to; rather than suspecting the OP as an Alt account, why not offer some advice to the OP as a senior colleague?",

I understand because I can immediately mingle here very easily. we better set a good example than have to express futile doubts. i agree with @Hyphen(-). it would be better for us to provide good advice for the newbies. because I see you are @Mate2237 and I am actually still new to this forum. that is not even a year. and let's work together in building this forum to make it more active and more fun and more lively.Quote from: Solokan on January 09, 2023, 02:50:25 PM   1: don't be shy when we express opinions, or questions.Your're right. feelings of shame and fear of being wrong are certainly felt by some beginners. because even at the beginning of my experiment in making posts on this forum it succeeded in making me quite tense at first. it's not shame that I feel but a feeling of fear of being wrong. because I'm a person who always doesn't want to make mistakes the first time and even I always want to make a good impression on the initial meeting. so the right step for beginners so they can immediately mingle in this forum is to read and understand the rules on the forum before starting to interact. and if there is still something you don't understand then don't hesitate to ask on this board.and I think you're saying this because it sounds like you're feeling that way. But it is also necessary to know that in order to survive in this forum we must have motivation and passion in this field. I even have someone I admire in this forum, namely @fillippone. I was very impressed with him, because he always presents quality posts and contains knowledge in them. and the way in which information is presented in his writing is very easy to understand and comfortable to read for those of us who are new here.",
