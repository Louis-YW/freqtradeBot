I don't care whether the SEC act against the NFT projects or not because 99% of NFTs are just shit, this market in crypto is not at all productive except for a few use case scenarios, such as loyalty tokens, and authentication. Haha for SEC I feel sorry they put the hand in every hold and when they just try to bring some results they fail.",

I hope the SEC doesn't try to claim all NFT's are securities, that would be way too Draconian, imo.Based on the argument made by the SEC in the news link above:QuoteThe order finds that the NFTs offered and sold to investors were investment contracts and therefore securities. Accordingly, Impact Theory violated the federal securities laws by offering and selling these crypto asset securities to the public in an unregistered offering that was not otherwise exempt from registration.This means they could use this same argument against almost all NFTs and claim that they are contracts and therefore securities.The problem is that Impact Theory was very weak and did not object to the decision and agreed to pay a fine and harsh measures, according to the same news:QuoteWithout admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Impact Theory agreed to a cease-and-desist order finding that it violated registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and ordering it to pay a combined total of more than $6.1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The order also establishes a Fair Fund to return monies that injured investors paid to purchase the NFTs. Impact Theory agreed to destroy all Founder’s Keys in its possession or control, publish notice of the order on its websites and social media channels, and eliminate any royalty that Impact Theory might otherwise receive from future secondary market transactions involving the Founder’s Keys.This is very bad and will open the door for the SEC to attack more NFTs companies.",

There is no need to worry that all NFT tokens will be banned. Most of these projects will not survive this regulation because they do not have enough resources for the courts. And in principle, this is good for the crypto market, because after the precedent, similar projects will be closed.Unlike coins, the price of NFT tokens is very easy to manipulate and reduce or increase tax profits.",

At the end of the day, people's awareness is key to solving this issue, sadly most people just fall for them easily. As long as the SEC doesn't blindly define every token as NFT or every NFT needs their control, I also think what they are doing with this is okay. Not sure how long my opinion will stay the same though, since the SEC is unpreditable nowadays.",

The regulator usually works with the major violator to ensure that all minor violators of the law read the practice and try to comply with the regulator's requirements. The regulator should not kill projects, but regulate markets and indicate the rules to players. There are thousands of projects in this market that have violated US laws, but the SEC apparently has its own vision.",

Yeah, but the thing though, crypto market is fairly young an we really don't know what's their regulation about the market itself. And we have seen them making contractions as well, so I will say that we are in the gray area as far as crypto or for SEC for that matter.But if there are clear cut laws, then for sure NFT or projects are going to carry it out within the boundaries so that they won't violate any laws established. But for now, it seems that we are in the western type of era. SEC can swing at anyone they want, and then projects, some of them might be pulling out scams after scams.",
