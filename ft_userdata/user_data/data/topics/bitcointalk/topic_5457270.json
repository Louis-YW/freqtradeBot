      "body": "So far we have had three halvings, and the fourth is fast approaching, and funny enough, we always do have some sort of crisis, or will I say some price dump, on or before the Bitcoin halving, which usually drops the price of Bitcoin drastically to its lowest level compared to its ATH. 1. As we know, the first halving happened in 2012, and during this time, the price dump happened just a year before the halving, which was In 2011, when the price fell from $30 to $2. And this was as a result of the Mt. Gox exchange hack incident, in which a total of about 850,000 Bitcoins were stolen. 2. The second one was 2016, and the price dump was in 2014. After the price pumped in December 2013 and reached a new all-time high of $1200, the next month, January 2014, the price fell below $550, and this was as a result of the Announcement made by China, who have always been against crypto, which states \"Bitcoin was not a currency and could not be used as a form of payment.\" 3. The most recent halving occurred in 2020, which was the one I experienced, but before the halving, the price had already reduced from its all-time high, which it achieved in December 2017, which was about $20k+, but within a period of a year, there was a global regulatory attack on ICOs (Initial coin offerings), just as the SEC is attacking Security tokens. Back then, the regulators requested exchanges comply with what they called \"Anti-money laundering (AML). This, I believe, was when AML and KYC became mandatory for most of the centralized exchanges out there. The pressure that came with this resulted in the price crash from $20k+ to its lowest of $3,500 in December 2018.",

I don't blame them for doing this because they are aware of how long this bear market has lasted.As a Bitcoiner, I have never personally experienced Bitcoin halving; instead, I only hear that the Bitcoin price do go above its all-time high. Since I've learned a lot from this forum and am actively looking for ways to acquire more Bitcoin before the price starts to rise, nothing can make me consider selling my current Bitcoin holdings.",

It reduced monetary inflation from 25% to 12%. Thats a big deal. Second halving decreased monetary inflation from 9% to 4,5%. Now we are getting closer and closer to the 4th halving that will reduce bitcoin monetary inflation from like 1.5% to 0.7%. Both numbers are negligible compared to 8% official CPI in US, 10% in EU or 80% in countries like Turkey. So my bet is that halvings fundamental impact on bitcoin price is getting lower and lower with every next halving in oppose to macro data, FED decisions, interest rates, recessions etc. Bitcoin will be more like an asset that act sometimes like gold on steroids sometimes like sp500 on steroids rather than it will fallow \"bubble x days before each halving scheme\"Also the characteristics of the average investor in 2012 are completely different than in 2023.",

Its a time where you find users fixing there eyes on the price rather tha  the many FUD that would be tossed around.Then you would have those who wished they ha invested early and those who wished, they didn't sell when they sold and the rest who wished, they had held to them precious sat and not looked at it to be worth nothing.",

I have also been listening to many discussions about the halving, honestly I believe that bitcoin will increase with that trend, maybe the recent problems caused panic, I also understand the problem. While many in this market don't fully understand what's going on inside, we're just tools for influencers who want to manipulate prices through tools. Thinking about the future and believing in the goals set can be seen as an experience that we already know, the market will always appear new people and cunning people want to manipulate price to pump/dump, even though we know that the market has grown strongly in the past time, the reality is that compared to the financial environment, we are still small enough to be easily manipulated and caused volatility.",

The market is sensitive with news and we always have positive and negative news in this market. When your psychology is well (positive), you ignore negative news and be more easily affected by positive news. The opposite psychological reaction will occur when you have negative psychology, you will be more sensitive with negative news, fud and not care much about positive news.Have to mention that in bear market, negative news are more than positive news. News are all prepared behind the scene and only wait for right times to be released and make us panic or FOMO.",
