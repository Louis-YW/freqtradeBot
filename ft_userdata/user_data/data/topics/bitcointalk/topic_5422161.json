With respect to Google Adsense ads, it is possible to carry out a detailed adaptation, but nevertheless, the business sense would be lost and we do not even ensure a successful approval.But don't worry, we have a list of reliable advertising companies with great rates so you can monetize from the beginning ensuring immediate approval. We also remind you that we have integrated monetization methods such as the collection of commissions for withdrawals, the acquisition of items, memberships and captcha rewards.Contact our support team for a demo and cost: https://faucetsoft.com/contact",

Of course our system has high security measures and private key encryption considering the calls from data collection. In any case, our provider such as CoinBase also offers high security of funds in terms of API Integration.Regarding the Staking system, we do not manage or have control over the funds, it is clear that they are retained both for the user and for us.
