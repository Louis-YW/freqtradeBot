  "content": "QuoteTwo-thirds of Europe is under some sort of drought warning, in what is likely the worst such event in 500 years.The latest report from the Global Drought Observatory says 47% of the continent is in \"warning\" conditions, meaning soil has dried up.Another 17% is on alert - meaning vegetation \"shows signs of stress\".The report warns that the dry spell will hit crop yields, spark wildfires, and may last several months more in some of Europe's southern regions.Compared with the average of the previous five years, EU forecasts for harvest are down 16% for grain maize, 15% for soybeans and 12% for sunflowers.The drought observatory is part of the European Commission's research wing. Responding to it, the Commission warned that preliminary data suggests \"the current drought still appears to be the worst since at least 500 years\".The ongoing heatwave and water shortages have \"created an unprecedented stress on water levels in the entire EU\", Research Commissioner Mariya Gabriel said.\"We are currently noticing a wildfire season sensibly above the average and an important impact on crops production. Climate change is undoubtedly more noticeable every year,\" she added.The report warned that nearly all of Europe's rivers have dried up to some extent.Apart from the obvious impact on boats, dry rivers are also hitting the energy sector, which is already in crisis. Hydroelectric power has dropped by a significant 20%, according to the report.A \"severe drought\" has been present in many places all year, but \"has been further expanding and worsening as of early August\" it says. The conditions are likely to last until at least November this year along the European Mediterranean.The report warns that the situation is worsening in countries including Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Romania, Hungary, northern Serbia, Ukraine, Moldova, Ireland and the UK.The researchers' stark warning follows rapidly-sinking river levels across Europe which have exposed relics of the past - including so-called \"hunger stones\" warning of potential famine and the sunken remains of World War Two Nazi ships.And in the UK, which had an official drought declared in several regions, some trees have turned an autumnal shade of auburn - in what's considered a \"false autumn\" due to the heat.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62648912....500 year drought.There certainly appears to be an uptick in the amount of doom and gloom being published.While there are a few metrics and statistics cited here. Most of these published pieces are slim on details. There isn't a narrative published on how we got here. Its portrayed as if this crisis happened virtually overnight. \"No one could have predicted this disaster.\" Even though I remember reading about water shortages in yemen 15 years ago.There is a long list of events which led to this eventual outcome over the past 50 years. Which could be useful for learning purposes. To address the issue. We must first defined and comprehend the issue. Somewhere along the way. It seems that people became thoroughly convinced they do not need to understand or define issues to solve them. And so the next few years will certainly be interesting. It will be interesting to see what solutions people come up with.",

And climatic changes mostly occur due to some human activities. Such activities that could lead to climatic change should be observed and reduced to minimum. Also water conservation should be taken into consideration to avoid excessive waste of the little water available.",

Some ethnicities might also have sevear effect as well, other than that this might change the long term temperature as well, even right now the temperature in the UK was way more than the temperature in Delhi which was shocking.",

It is true that many rivers are at record low levels and that some long-hidden secrets have surfaced for the first time since the Second World War, and that agriculture in some countries has been severely affected.However, this is not something that happened overnight, it is a process that has been going on for at least two decades, as long as I have been following climate change, although the situation with dry years and rising temperatures has intensified in the past 10 years. Considering the war and inflation, the drought could not have come at a worse time because food prices have risen even more.And how to change things for the better is a question for the whole world, not only for Europe. Some say that it is a natural process, but people with their behavior certainly have a big part in all of this, and if we don't all start to change, we shouldn't expect things to get better.",

IMO, nuclear energy seems to be where things should be headed. Not considered a renewable energy source, but the evidence suggests it's the most efficient energy source there is relative to its environmental impact.Seems every year there are scientists warning of the impending doom of climate change, yet their proposed solutions cannot even create a measurable impact on global temperatures. Why the complaining from the scientific community if they cannot propose level headed solutions that go beyond banning plastic bags and straws. Electric vehicles don't even have the impact on the climate over the next 50 years that people think they do. Yet they're being pushed by the EU and US as a unilateral solution. I don't suspect these people are serious about finding an actual solution. Crying wolf gets the media attention.",

Though I believe the change might differ from how we thought. Before, we used to say it was the developing countries or countries near the Equator that takes the worst of climate change. But from what I saw, it seems like Temperate countries or developed countries take the worst. Temperate countries see more drought, low water on rivers, and hotter summer. Tropical climate countries have more rains and more floods but it's still manageable with proper floor control. The storm/typhoon is their biggest problem tho. Your vision of the \"wars for water\" could only happen between developed countries cause developing countries will have plenty of water.",

The harvest in Europe is going to be bad and the food prices won't be going down anytime soon.I would disagree with you, although it is debatable what you mean by Eastern Europe? The situation in some parts of the east is perhaps even worse than in the west, but in general it is bad everywhere. Some countries were lucky to receive a large amount of rain in the form of heavy summer showers, but this only eased the drought a little and means little in the larger picture. I agree that the media likes to exaggerate things, so maybe this drought is the worst in the past 100 years, and how difficult it is will be felt by everyone who will pay very dearly for every agricultural product, or even for the water that we all use in our daily lives.Source",
