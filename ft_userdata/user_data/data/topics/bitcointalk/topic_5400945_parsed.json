And the things that made you regret your decision? Can you share your thoughts, guys?My feelings are still very good for cryptocurrency so far although there is a bit of regret that I experienced for being late in selling my assets before the market dump occurred, but I have never really worried about my assets for now because all I hold is Bitcoin, BNB and ETH. The rest is just the USDT stablecoin that I got through trading in the market before the dump happened. I thought that was all I felt and nothing else bad had happened to me.How about you ?",

Just like when ETH was it's lowest in early 2018 or 2019, just below 100$ and me thinks that it is still expensive. And then we have a good bull run and it reaches a new all time high of almost $5k in 2021. That's crazy profit right there if I have invested a lot of money on ETH. But it is what it is, just have to learn from it and move on. And then wait for the next big opportunity in this bear market to fill our wallets with cheap alt coins again.",

A lot of investors must have been a victim of this but you have to take a stand knowing why you are investing and what you are investing in.",

These are examples of the mistakes we usually did in the past but its not like we can always get the actual or perfect timing to sell or hold isnt it? Sometimes a good pump arrived on the least we expect it.",

That's the same mistakes as the others and you'll hear that at most times.And that's going to come from new investors and as well as old investors that have been there for several years. This mistake for sure will happen again in the next upcoming years.",

I were only watching the market without try to take the profit from my investment. this is the worst mistake that i have ever made. I can make my portfolios 5 times even more right now if i were doing it in the past. I have been learning a lot not to hodl anything for long term. The best thing to take the profit when it was reaching the peak price.",

I made the most mistaken investments at the end of \"the golden age of the ICO\", at the turn of 2017/2018, when, encouraged by past profits, I invested dozens of ETH in projects that turned out to be total mistakes. The main thing is not to break down, but to learn from mistakes.",

We all know that how much volatile the industry is. And the things that made you regret your decision? Can you share your thoughts, guys?Many mistakes are made by people in crypto, especially regarding investment, for example it is not right in choosing coins to invest in, there are even some people who invest not meeting knowledge standards, so coins that have reached ATH or at high prices are not released, until finally the price of the coin fell at a low price, this error was caused by a lack of knowledgeMistakes like that I think always exist from year to year and they have to take responsibility for that decision.no doubt knowledge is very important and we cannot rule it out,continue to learn and gain experience then it will let us know what to do in investing",

And the things that made you regret your decision? Can you share your thoughts, guys?I lost a lot of money when I was liquidated on an ETH loan. From now on I'm not using lending platforms. Fortunately, during that time I found out about Candle Chain, which is superior to Ethereum in that it has 0 transaction fees, two second finality, and 80k TPS. I completed their bounty program and got 25k coins. I also realized that there are a lot of superior L1s out there compared to ETH, so I'm not sad about my loss. I will make it back in spades.",

Can you share your thoughts, guys?I think most people have committed a series of blunders when it comes to their investments, in my case the biggest one was that I did invest in a new altcoin during the ico craze of 2017 and lost roughly 40% of what I invested there.Now the investment I made was small so it did not destroy my capital, but even then it is something that bothers me as I left myself be influenced and become part of the hype that was so high at that time.",

I know this is what the market craves, but I'm very slow on it, if I have to be at least one early big and then get out before it goes down, I could have made a lot of money already.And just like the rest, not buying during the last bearish market because they are very cheap. And now that we are again in this cycle, although the price is not that cheap as compare to 4 years ago, I wouldn't like to make the same mistakes so I will buy solid altcoin projects.",
