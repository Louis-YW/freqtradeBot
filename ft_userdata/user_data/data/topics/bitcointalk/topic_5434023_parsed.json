Thank you shasan.QuoteHi. I'm looking for a $250 btc loan to cover a mix of personal and online shortfalls.I do not have any collateral to offer. I do have domains (which I have learned in the past are not great collateral or of much interest for lenders) however if it is absolutely necessary to escrow them then I am willing to do so. I am not very interested in having to go through the hassle of putting my domains in escrow and I have no doubts of the loan being repaid, I hope that this is enough to receive the loan. I am expecting to receive more than enough to cover the repayment from some freelance work I did in less than 1 week. The problem, and why I am creating this request, is that a variety of things are expiring in a matter of 1-2 days, which will hurt my workflow and cause some inconveniences offline which I would much rather avoid.If for some reason I do not receive what I am expecting, I have Terms (B) as a backup plan. This will repay the loan with my income and add some additional interest for the wait. It will take less than 3 weeks to put away enough to repay the amount and the interest, I put the time within 1 month from lending date just to be safe though. It should be noted that it is quite unlikely that I will not receive what I am expecting from the past work.Loan request: $250 btcTerms (A): Repayment amount: $275 btc (10% Interest)Time: Within 1 week from lending dateTerms (B): - It is unlikely this will be needed, however if Terms A is not fulfilled, Terms B will be used.Repayment amount: $300 btc (20% Interest)Time: Within 1 month from lending dateAddress for loan: bc1qg7pq8646ymapn3qqwzg6aysg34zke3ftjua67fThank you",

Thank you.You can count on it being repaid. As said in another thread, I would love to be apart of this community again and hopefully one day join a campaign to make it an incentivized hobby. I have no intentions on defaulting hence the level of thought I have put into the safety nets. I will let you know once it is repaid, thank you again.",
