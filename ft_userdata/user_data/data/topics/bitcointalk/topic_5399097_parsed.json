Until you learn enough to decide which risk to take and which not to.Your choice about Bitcoin is good but the idea of putting everything in a single coin or investment was not a smart move. I suggest for you split your funds to some altcoins, but not shitcoins. You can see a lot of potential altcoins, putting some chunks on them gives you some peace of mind that whatever happens to other investments you won't lose all your money, and they're still a way to help it recover. As newbies, we need to widen and enhance our knowledge about crypto investment as there is no excuse for being not able to understand the risk.",

A strong fiat currency like USD and Euro is not going to lose its value overnight. Inflation is predictable. What I just see is that it is ignorant of people that are leaving money in fiat because the government like to do one thing to fiat, to decrease its value. For spending, you are right, but I can not call it stupid, I will call it necessity because it is hard for some people to buy directly with bitcoin and they do not have option than to convert to fiat.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on May 17, 2022, 10:53:24 PMRisks should be managed in a way that a potential reward is higher than the downside.

(all triggered by the Covid crisis, now deepened by the war)To be sincere, bitcoin is a speculative asset, its price is volatile, but I understand your point, after long time, bitcoin price will have more value but fiat will have less value, which means you mean safe haven, not stable. For any fiat, what the amount of the fiat can buy today, it can no more buy it in 10 years more after, 10 years is even long, in 2 years especially in countries that have high inflation rate.Quote from: examplens on May 17, 2022, 11:16:29 PMit would be very interesting to see some analysis of BTC vs FIAT in the last 2 or 3 years.Next 2 or 3 years, I am expecting bitcoin to hit all-time-high above 100k.",

Until you learn enough to decide which risk to take and which not to.Considering it was never crashed and turned the price to zero but you must understand the volatile nature of Bitcoin.  You didn't predict when the correction will occur and will it will pump, so the best thing that you can do is wait for the perfect opportunity to have a profit.  So my question now is, are you willing to wait for that perfect time that will come?  The comment above was right, invest only what you can afford, an amount that you're willing to spend, not the source of your daily need.
