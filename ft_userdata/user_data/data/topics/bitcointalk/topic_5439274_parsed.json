Even if gamblers knew that most likely they will get from that fund to satisfy their gambling needs and this is the nature of a gambler,telling a gambler to save money is like to say to a prostitute to start having morals meaning it does not work like that.If a gambler were to save money for a better tomorrow he would not be called a gambler but a wise investor,something a lot of people want to do yet very few achieve it.Gamblers gamble to make money fast and they don't think for long term.In countries like Nigeria then it is even more emphasized as a phenomena due to this country from what I know and read being a poor one.",

Not that gamblers do not have savings but there savings are for gambling. But there are some gamblers that give money to their family members and friends, all gamblers are not the same. Even though a gambler does not give money to his family people he give it to his GF, if there is no savings there how will he give to her. So not all are like that.

In the past there were these kind of gamblers who ruin themselves and their families. Now things have changed and most of them used to spend what they can afford to loss. At times when luck doesn't favour, they go for borrowing and things go out of control. Gambling with limits is enjoyable, and when things go out of hand it will turn to be big problem for the person as well as the family.",

He also barely has any money, despite having a decent job. He drives the most destroyed car I've ever seen where seats are ripped to the point where he sits on bare foam, but he always has money for smokes and beer.

Gambler's especially those that are impoverished, gamble because they want to get out of poverty and live that lavish life. The connection between lack of savings and gambling is a stretch if you'll ask me. It's like saying why are poor people gambling? Moreover, gambling in a poor man's eye isn't a form of entertainment, it's an avenue to get rich quick without taking the grueling path of working yourself to death for financial freedom, which I can get behind since who doesn't want a few million bucks on their bank account just because you're lucky that you guessed the right numbers yeah? But it all comes full circle. it basically warrants the fact that most marginalized gamblers will not have savings, not because they are dumbfucks who aren't financially literate enough to save money for their future, but because they would rather focus on making sure they don't starve to death, before putting up money for savings and investment.",

Also, since you're a gambler yourself, does that mean you don't have any savings also?QuoteI just stick real Madrid to win Valencia with my last $100 and the odds just increased woooHmm, look who's calling the kettle black!",

There are many reasons why gamblers doesn't have or lost their money savings in their possession. One common reason for it is because of addiction, Most likely they try to gamble or spent their savings  on casino trying to recover from the original loss they have an didn't recover from it, After that they just don't think of building the saving funds again for thinking that they can easily build it again if they somehow won. Second common reason is lacking financial literature, this applies to all who don't have savings even you are not a gambler. We all should be responsible  for our future and savings can surely save our lives when dry season comes.",

If you are a gambler, you would want to use all the spare money that you have. Some gamblers even go to the extent of consuming their money for basic necessities, making their families starve for hunger.This is the reason why most of the addicted gamblers have family problems, because they are thinking first their gambling before the needs of their family.",

Instead of feeding and meeting their obligations, they would rather choose the selfish route of personally satisfying their greed for their addiction in gambling. This definitely also affects ultimately their savings and emergency money, which is also the reason on why majority of gamblers are high on debt.If you know someone who is a gambler, then now is the time to at least educate and support them in solving their addiction in this dangerous habit. Not only are they slowly destroying their lives, but they are also affecting the people around them.",
