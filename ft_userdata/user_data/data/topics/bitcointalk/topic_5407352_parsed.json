Cheaper to change thermal pads or install additional cooling.If there is a very good exchange offer, but where can he find it now?Next time he doesn't need to buy hot video cards or buy closed cases with powerful fans.",

In a bull market, you will sell graphics cards for a high price and buy other GPUs for a high price. In a bear market, you will sell cheap graphics cards and buy new ones at a higher price.It's a good option to sell the GPU at the end of a bull market and buy in a bear market, but we don't know when that will be.",
