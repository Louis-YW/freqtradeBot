  "content": "Hi everyone - long time BTC hodler, first time poster.I want a permissionless, multi-chain, multi-sig wallet but can't seem to find one anywhere even after scrolling through dozens of threads here on bitcointalk. Does this exist?- Must be permissionless because I don't want a government or company to deny my access / de-platform me- Must be multi-chain because I believe in smart contract platforms, like ETH, and hold some of those tokens- Must be multi-signature because I don't want to take any chances with the loss or theft of a hardware wallet / seed phrase, want to play around with giving my family members spending allowances, and will need permissionless inheritanceThere are wallets that can get two of the three requirements, but not all three.Thanks!",

The best I can recommend is Electrum as it is also very easy to make use of in addition to the fact that it is also open source. Op I think you are probably mistaking an exchange multisig wallet for a custodian wallet. Also op it is important to understand that although Bitcoin is decentralized, centralized exchanges can also offer crypto services including Bitcoin.As for the multi sig wallet you can easily download electrum and set up one without any governmental restrictions. As for altcoins I don't know of any wallet that supports multisig for altcoins and is also open source. In fact I have come to notice that a majority of altcoin supporting wallets are not open source.",

What kind of wallet were you using for your holding...You said you don't  want a government or company to deny your access ,If so then you are definitely  using a custodial wallet which needs permission  from third party to make your transaction (this is how I understand  you word \"permissionless \" correct me if I'm  wrong \")If you need a multisig wallet then I only know of BTC-only wallet ( Electrum  and Sparrow) you could create multiple cosigner  probably two and you can make the two accessible  to you which means for every  transaction  make  you need to sign it in two places .  You need to understand  that Electrum and Sparrow are noncustodial  Btc-only wallet , which means you have full control over your wallet to the extent of determining  the kind of fee you want for your txn, What do I mean by BTC-only wallet: you can not store any tokens along with your BTC",

You will need your private key or seed phrase and the cosigner public keys to set up the wallet. The cosigners will need their own private key or seed phrase and your public key and other cosigner public key to set up their own wallet.Example is 2-of-3 multisig.

For ethereum, you should use myetherwallet but make sure it's from the correct site and be wary of fake websites. It supports different erc-20 tokens and if you want something from binance smart contract is you could also use the same private key or seed phrase to import the same wallet but in different network because I actually tried it myself. I wouldn't recommend that you use trustwallet, although it supports different crypto and also non-custodial but it is not open source wallet. If you are not aware about the differences between open-source and close-source wallets then you should learn about it.",
