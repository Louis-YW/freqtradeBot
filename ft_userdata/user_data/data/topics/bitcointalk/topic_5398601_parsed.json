  "content": "Freebitco.in has been the longest paying website around and trusted by the most online users. Just recently, a friend of mine just got frustrated with her freebitco account. She played the multiply game as normal and increase the balance to a humble sum.She then requested withdrawal and was excited about it, told her daughter about using the fund for graduation celebration. I mean, yeah this kind of platform really gives impact in a good way to users who get their ladyluck on their side.But, now she was kind of feeling sick about it, kept checking the confirmation of payment sent through email like most user would get when requesting withdrawal, attached in the email is  the transaction id where where she supposedly could confirm or verify the status.Here is the screenshot: https://i.ibb.co/zFDC7VF/emailsentbyfreebitco2.jpgI checked the email confirmation she received and I confirm that it returns an error status. She even asked the wallet address where she'll received the payment about the transaction if  she could anticipate any transaction, and here is what the wallet address provider has said.Screenshot: https://i.ibb.co/cDWp1xn/coins2.jpgHere is the transaction id: https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/tx/a1a98a09b8def5cb04d4d0e2b67c36efb06b4456e4c5ac6c0e20a2040c897606Prior to going to those steps and sharing this post, she has use the contact us form in freebitco.in website for about multiple times without any single response. At least, freebitco could say a bit of something why it is happening which is unlikely in the past or email her to assure it will be reflected in her wallet.I trust freebitco.in for the longest time, and I hope this is just an isolated issue which can be resolved because for a user like me upon knowing this kind of problem, I fear now to deposit money the platform and play their game. I don't intend to offend or discredit freebitco.in in this post, but I hope they could understand the frustration my friend is feeling right now.Receiving an email confirmation that a payment is successful yet the transaction id is unsuccessful seems absurd because if something is not verifiable, it is fake. I could understand if it is stuck or unconfirmed but at least she could check the status in the blockchain. But this case is different, I hope freebitco.in doesn't do what this whole picture is telling us. In the back of my mind, I hope freebitco remains and still stand as a trusted website.",
