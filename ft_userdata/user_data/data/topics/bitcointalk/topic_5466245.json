I do not know how it even works. It does not support TOR by default and most wallets does not. You can go to settings to enable Tor and it works as usual. Unstoppable is not for bitcoin. It is  supporting bitcoin but people using bitcoin wallet can not use it because it is a shit bitcoin wallet. It is made for shitcoins.",

The last time I used Electrum wallet because the wallet do not have RBF. I could have used the wallet but the RBF it does not have for bitcoin will not let me use it. Even if I am using Electrum, I still use jochen-hoenicke.de or mempool.space for fee. There can be a good wallet that do not estimate the fee accurately too. If you send to the wallet, the address will change to another one but you can not see all the addresses, that is true. It is a good wallet for many coins but not also supporting many coins like that. There are many coins that it is not supporting and it is support just only the peg of some coins like doge. If you want me to begin, I can name many coins it is not supporting but I like it because it is open source.",
