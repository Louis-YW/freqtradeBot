Why not simply post it on Youtube in that case?",

If you do it well you will be surprised to get turnups for your services.Remember \"what is worth doing is worth doing well\".",

I don't know how you intend to handle the copyright issue and I am wondering if your country is a wartorn and natural disaster-prone nation. I just wonder how you can get videos of harassment and battles because it will be very risky. But it also seems that OP has been working on this project for a long time which is why he could boast of having these videos. Anyway, I wish you all the best in your business.",

I seek to place you here, convey to you what it feels like and what is observed when living where I live. Added to that this is without censorship and expressing freedom of opinion without falling into ramblings and lies. As I already mentioned, tell me I want to see how a certain thing is and I make you understand, see and explain to you why it is so. I'm from Colombia (although I didn't want to mention it now, it was a surprise) I have found considerable acceptance and mixed opinions, I like that. I agree to have introductory material for this weekend, stay tuned! Your comments make me understand many things, including what you would like to see. Thank you for your kindness and keep proposing.

They are selling the experience you get in being in that third world country and just like you guys said, I think it will be much better on a documentary videos.I've seen vloggers do these experiences in other countries as well and they are indeed not that great. I view it as them chasing clout with the ridiculous things they do in a foreign country which many locals don't even really do.IMO, since you mentioned that you are a passionate historian, you can just sell your service as a tour guide of some sort for foreigners wanting to visit your country. You can show them the videos you have as examples of what you can help them experience during their stay in your country.",

No one would like to see videos of these countries, rather people will love to watch vlogs of developed countries as those are the places where everyone loves to go and live their lives.I guess OP knows this, so that is why he didn't start any channel of his own, rather he is willing to make videos in case anyone still needs these videos of underdeveloped countries. By now, I don't see anyone looking to buy these videos, maybe he needs to try other platforms like Fiverr to sell his services.",
