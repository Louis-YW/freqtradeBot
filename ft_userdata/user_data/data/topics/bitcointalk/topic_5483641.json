  "content": "We know that Crypto transaction fees are paid when you do an action on a blockchain. The fees prevent blockchain networks from being flooded with transactions and  to prevent legitimate usage of networks.The reason behind the transaction fee could not be limited to;1. Faster confirmation time: Bitcoin transactions are processed by miners, who prioritize transactions with higher fees. We know that every business oriented person is after profit and the highest bidder is welcome first. As we look forward in promoting and spreading the usage and acceptance of bitcoin, this fee should be reviewed.2. Network congestion: During times of high demand on the Bitcoin network, there may be a backlog of unconfirmed transactions. The fee will discourage many from using the network so as to decongest the server.There should be alternatives to these motives for general adoption. I researched that on a Monday (one day), the total value of all transaction fees paid to miners hit an astronomical sum above $11 million on that one day, according to Blockchain.com data.If this issue is been addressed, bitcoin will prevail. The fee is deterring the adoption especially in our rural and local areas.This transaction fee may stand as an obstacle and a repugnance to the widespread of bitcoin acceptance.",

The fee is deterring the adoption especially in our rural and local areas.This transaction fee may stand as an obstacle and a repugnance to the widespread of bitcoin acceptance.I have been watching the bitcoin network since past 2 weeks and I have noticed a little decline in the mempool, it has not excwd more than 300k pending transaction since 2 weeks now, this could be because the mempool aren't congested with ordinals, I don't know if this is temporary or permanent but for now, it seems the hype around BRC20 tokens has cool off the crazy fees has stop.Short term, miners has recovered from their losses and many of them sold plenty of their Bitcoin stash above $45k but long term, they will have to endure for another time to see this profits again because in less than 2 months time, the rewards will be halve the original amount they are earning right now and if you should put the cost of operation into account, many of them will close their mining rig as it wouldn't be profitable to mine.You are the first to raise concern the congestion of the network neither am I going to be the last to reply, it's left for the community to speak on that, you can see that almost everyone are paying huge amount to be included in the next block, when nobody pays these fees, I don't think the fees will even will even go up but they are ready to pay them and as long as the keep paying, miners will do their job and comfirm the ones they can.Miners could also be looking at the future incentive of transactions when the block reward are no longer enough to settle them, it wouldn't make sense now if rewards are tiny and then later they somehow make people to fight for transaction fees if block of transactions are limited in the future again.",

These people are making money from these inscriptions so they don't see it as an attack but as an opportunity. It might benefit a few people but it is hurting more Bitcoin users. It was very easy to advise people to try using Bitcoin payment because the tx fees were cheaper than some bank charges. I see it as an attack on the Bitcoin ecosystem because one of the outstanding benefits of using Bitcoin use to low transaction fees but this is not the case again. However, it will take people who look beyond financial gain to come together and repel this attack.     Quote from: Z-tight on January 31, 2024, 03:03:17 PMHigh tx fee is surely a problem and it makes BTC unusable, especially as a currency, but i think it is a temporary problem.

Yea, that is what I am worried about, because if something is not done to stop these inscription so that we don't see this reoccurring again in the future, and who knows maybe in the future the fee will be discouraging.This is why your transaction output should not be less than $500, so that in future when such high transaction fee comes up, it wouldn't be a problem for you to transfer your bitcoin. But if you have $50 that you sent to your wallet, often to make up $500. You might end up spending a very high amount for transaction fee when you want to withdraw all the $500 in one transaction.",

Experts believe that it's a coordinated attack by the guys that want these ordinals and now that it's fading out with time, they might even be forgotten just like other useless trends in the past.QuoteThis is why your transaction output should not be less than $500, so that in future when such high transaction fee comes up, it wouldn't be a problem for you to transfer your bitcoin.

This is not accurate, you can have $50 in your wallet and be able to pay a little amount especially when you have a single input, a receiving wallet address of segwit format, if it were a wallet address like legacy, you will be paying more if you want to send a transaction in bitcoin network.

It is going too far to talk about bitcoin prevailing or not, just because of this attack. But you are right that this is affecting the adoption negatively. The small group that you're talking about are people that are benefiting from all this problem with ordinals and high transaction fees, most likely they're miners and NFT people that don't have anything better to do besides leaving garbage on the network. I don't believe that it's because of this groups refusal that are causing the slow fix for this vulnerability, it's more likely that the devs can do it but they choose not to because they're probably somehow benefiting from this too because the vulnerability is already identified right? So how come they're not fixing it quickly? They probably got a long time already to fix it so what's the hold up right? I do think it affects the adoption negatively but for me, I don't think it's that big of a deal, ordinals are just like an NFT anyway, they'll eventually lose their hype and people will find new ways to get others into crypto.",

This can only happen in a decentralised system where no one can do anything unless to follow such a process already structured. This is ugly to me and whenever I think about it, it is so annoying as Bitcoin encourages a monopolistic system, which I know that Satoshi didn't plan well, and had it been he didn't leave everything like he did, he would have resolved it justifiably.$11M in just a day? That is so huge, and that means that within a few months, they would have each pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars and this is unchallenged because the system has already favoured them unless the whole overhauling will happen which I know sooner or later this will happen. To make matters worse, these miners don't care about Bitcoin itself but the business they make around it, if not, they would have voted for developers to do something about the high fees associated with it.
