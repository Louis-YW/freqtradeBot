If someone buy bitcoin when it's price is at 90-100k range is that they should do DCA to accumulate more bitcoin and wait for next bull run. It's good that you earn profit since as you have said that you bought your bitcoin when the price of bitcoin that time is at 50-60k and if you compare the price today then it's 40k more than the price at that time.",

We can't blame them as well for telling that but you do you. If you believe on the long term holding of Bitcoin, you'd pretty much buy at any price levels doing the same DCA strategy of MicroStrategy, they don't mind about the prices, they just put where their money is. And, you're a lucky guy, how I wish I still got some dust balances on my old wallets.",

This is actually a condition that always repeats itself where there are people who say that bitcoin is too expensive and too high to buy but in the end when we talk about the progress of bitcoin which is getting higher and higher in terms of value of course we know that in the end that conclusion is a mistake.",

They didn't consider the future developments and other contributing factors that can help Bitcoin price to grow. This is the reason on why we can always see people regret not to buy Bitcoin while the price is at $50k or any figures that they think expensive before but cheap right now when the price pump especially @$100k+ ATH reached.Sometimes its really a blessing in disguise when you forget about your BTC in your old wallets and you will just get surprised when you accidentally found it and gain a lot for many many months of years sleeping also when Bitcoin price goes up for more than what we expect.",

Perhaps they were also among those who sold their holdings early when last year's bull run started due to low patience or being slow hands and now they haven't bought back because they kept waiting for the price to drop while it continues to rise. It's possible they are also unfamiliar with DCA or simply have a short-term perspective. For me you can buy Bitcoin at any time depending on your purpose, how you gonna use or spend it.",

I'm not sure of it, but there are predictions coming out that bitcoin will reach one million and so on. Only time can give the answer. The limited supply is stated as the major reason for the growth for the future. Different countries and corporate networks getting into the accumulation of bitcoin is a reason for the future growth. At the same time, things can go centralized when a certain group of ventures holds a major portion of the mined coins. Right now it is not late for people who think of multiplying through DCA. Also, it has turned out to be a rich person's investment, though it can be invested with very few dollars.",

If you are really that wanting to accumulate as much as you could then holding will be your other option on which this is indeed less stress since you wont really be needing something but to hold up your position and just simply buy according into your available money. The key on here is that you should really that invest into the amount that you can afford to lose,so that you wont really be ending up on having that kind of impulsive reactions at the moment or time that the market do make out it price swings on which not all will really be able to handle it out. So it will really be that situation on this aspect because each person will be having its own approach and actions that will be taken into.",
