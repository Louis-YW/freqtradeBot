  "content": "Hello community.Since it's carnival season and I have participated in a bunch of giveaways in the past weeks I have decided to make a small giveaway myself.The lucky winner will get the “grand small price” of 11.11$ in BTC.No need to post the wallet right now. Just the winner at the end should post the address here so I can send the price.How will the winner be chosen? Guess the $ amount of my daily reload at Stake. Closest guess will win. Hint, the amount is between 2.00-6.00$ .First answer with correct pick wins, 1 pick per user. If 2 or more members have the same gap to the right amount the price will be split. I have made a screenshot and if some DT member wants to be the judge I can send it to him/her.The giveaway will run until February 23rd , 11:11pm GMT +9Only users with accounts of min 25 merit and 6 month history please.Note: my reload is set until next Saturday, so it will stay the same over the week, in case somebody wants to check. The $ amount won't change over the week.EDIT: I edited that the price will only be in BTC, thanks to CoinEraser for the hint that ALTs are not allowed.",
