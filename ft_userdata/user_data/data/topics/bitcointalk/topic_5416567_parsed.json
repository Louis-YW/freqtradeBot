STEPN depends on moving around, and clients are furnished with NFTs as Shoes.STEPN (GMT) Price Prediction 2022The GMT price was swinging from $0.6350 to $0.7138 subsequent to going to its most reduced of the month at $0.6331. Quickly returning from the help level, GMT is currently going sideways, and we can anticipate that the market should break out from the sideway soon.In the meantime, our drawn-out GMT price prediction for 2022 is bullish in the event that it can't break the help level. We can anticipate that GMT should reach $1.2 this year.",

The remaining bitcoins to be minted by miners are slowly going down. That means bitcoin will become a deflationary coin. Im sure that will give a very big bullish trend to the market and expecting new ATH from GMT makes sense when such moment will come in the future.",

As soon as people stop earning decent profit, they will stop walking. No one would intentionally walk for free. The growing amount of competitors or imitators are only helping StepN to die.

It can be seen that it, like previous trends like P2E, will not last long when users decide to leave. These trend tokens are not long term investment and should not put too much expectation on them, once profitable should sell, look at axie infinity, the top game in the P2E trend also failed to hold up and announced the game's closure when revenue was too low.",

But already now we can see that the largest profit was received by the first Stepn investors at the expense of those who joined later and thus it becomes more like a ponzi scheme.",

Another example that trends in cryptocurrency dont last for more than one year, no matter how much was invested in promotion. As soon project imitators started to appear, people start to spray between projects, funds spread between multiple projects and first or primary projects die without new customers. If I am not mistaken, tokens of early investors arent unlocked yet. Even if their tokens will be unlocked tomorrow, they will be in huge profit anyway. I predict that each and every of they will sell their shares immediately and that day we can mark as a death of StepN.",

Even if number of gamers or runners reaches its peak and drops after that, selling pressure from previous gamers or runners is still exist.I don't think it is realistic to predict price of STEPN till 2030 and we even don't know will that project be lively in 2030, not mention the token price yet.",

The price of GMT is quite stagnant at this moment and remember from the latest report if revenue has been falling so hard. I hope you can see how yearly chart from GMT looks so bad right now. This one dosn't have good volatility at this moment. I think that GMT will have good performance when crypto market will be doing so good but it will always be following what bitcoin does",
