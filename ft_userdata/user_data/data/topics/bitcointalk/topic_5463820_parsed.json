  "content": "Fiurycoin Unleached is a cryptocurrency Bitcoin v0.21 fork with modified block parameters. Fiurycoin Core is an open source software that allows anyone to operate a node in the Fiurycoin blockchain network and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work mining.Fiurycoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Fiurycoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Fiurycoin Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the Fiurycoin Core software, see https://fiurycoin.onlinePorts=====================================Fiurycoin Core by default uses port `12132` for peer-to-peer communication thatis needed to synchronize the \"mainnet\" blockchain and stay informed of newtransactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, whichdefaults to port `6537` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to notexpose RPC ports to the public internet.License=====================================Fiurycoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license for moreinformation or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.Websitehttps://www.fiurycoin.topBlock explorer https://explorer.fiurycoin.top:448 Â SSL portWallets and Sourcehttps://github.com/soulistyces/fiurycoinUNodesaddnode=nomp.flyhash.xyz:12123addnode=89.163.221.18:12123addnode=5.199.138.46:12132listen=1Mining Poolshttps://miningpoolstats.stream/fiurycoinDiscord https://discord.gg/ftkTKxYWBNExchangeshttps://xeggex.com/market/FIURY_USDTLiveCoinsWatchhttps://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/FiuryCoin-FIURYCoinPaprika:https://coinpaprika.com/coin/fiury-fiurycoin",
