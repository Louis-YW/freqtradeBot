  "content": "Undoubtedly, hashrates are what keep BTC secure. And one needs at least 51% of all the hashrates in the world to comfortably brute force Bitcoin. And to benefit from this, one has to purchase a reliable mining hardware, as it just doesn't depend on price or cost of power alone. I get all these. But where I'll need guidance and more inputs is how then can I get a good hash rate suitable for mining? https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-current-hash-rate-required-to-mine-Bitcoin-and-Ethereum-on-a-daily-basis&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj89Iimgar4AhUG4oUKHWrPDL8QFnoECAoQAg&usg=AOvVaw3HVjtVdr_Q-4v5MD7vzW5F",

To mine bitcoin, with the present difficulty adjustment, you will need powerful ASIC miners like Antminer S19j Pro, Antminer L7, Antminer Goldshell KD6 to mine bitcoin. You will have to join a mining pool. To summarize this, you will need to make sure mining bitcoin is legal in your country, calculate the electricity cost and also if your area have cold weather.I hope people like philipma1957 will give you better options to go for about this.",

The last two are litecoin and kadena miners.Quote from: Majestic-milf on June 13, 2022, 09:00:59 AMAnd to benefit from this, one has to purchase a reliable mining hardware, as it just doesn't depend on price or cost of power alone. I get all these. It mainly depends on the power costs, then the efficiency of the miner, and then the price of the gear in order to get the money spent on the miner back in profit before the miner breaks or becomes unprofitable. The electricity price is from the start something that can turn people away, right no I would say even 10 cents is too much to even think about starting mining, then it comes to your budget for starting mining.Quote from: Majestic-milf on June 13, 2022, 09:00:59 AMBut where I'll need guidance and more inputs is how then can I get a good hash rate suitable for mining?There is no \"good and suitable\" hashrate, there is just a profitable one.",

But still over priced.you can clock this to 1100 watts which is about 28 kwatts or $2.24 a day burnt they would earn 40 x 9.1 = 3.64so 3.61 - 2.24 = 1.37 a day so on 1000 days you make 1370 which is almost break even. still not good. deal but the best I could find in the last two days.I would not buy an asic that needs 1000 days to break even but it is better than buying an asic that need 2000 days to break even.I freeze daily numbers to get the days to break even sometimes it stays very flat sometimes it gets better some time it gets worse.that's why I like ASICs at 300 to 400 days to break even not 1000 to 2000gear is stupidly over priced for an 8 cent minerbtw it is over price for a 7 cent minerand it is over priced for a 6 cent minerif you were a 5 cent miner the sold out s17 pro on ebay would pay off in 700 daysif you were a 2 cent miner (very rare) it would take 459 days to pay off still shitty.I am a low power cost miner but closer to 5 cents not 2 cents. So I did not get those units.",
