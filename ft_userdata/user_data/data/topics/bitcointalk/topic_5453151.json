Also, viabtc is free accelerator with paid option.As for OP's option only is to use a free accelerator that viabtc offers that i don't think any services offer the same. But if it cannot be accelerated in viabtc due to its minimum requirements i guess that there's nothing OP can do but to wait. Unless shoppy.gg accelerate the transaction by using paid service or rebroadcast if RBF is enabled. The thing is they should do it already knowing that those transactions sent since march. Technically it should be dropped by the network already, but if the transactions are still exists and still pending, unfortunately it means you still need to wait til it get at least 1 confirmation because there's no other option for you but to wait.",

Can you still see the transaction in any block explorer?",

I would not add new btc to accelerate the transaction, I would rather contact the platform and try to get assistance from there. Without them, we can't know the exact reason for the withdrawal delay, I tend to suspect that the OP is a victim of some kind of scam/hack.",

Probably will not accomplish much but at this point in time no service should be sending TX out with fees that low.Do you control the private keys to the 1HbnW4MoCMCFQE26GGmPF5qc18i1ue5Bny address? If you do just use coin control select those TX and send them to another address you control with a high fee. The problem is do you really want to spend $9.00 to get $27 and since it's the same low fee everywhere you would have to spend the same $9 to get the $18 payment.  -Dave",

The best thing to do is to contact them and inform them about your case. Purged is a nebulous term. There are many nodes that never ever purge. Others have the mempool size set very low and are purging at a higher value.However, nodes that have the default mempool size are probably purging transactions below the 9 sat/vbMost pools, perhaps all of them, have the mepool set to a very large size.Because if you do drop the lower value TX then if someone like the OP comes in and does do a CPFP TX with a *massive* fee then that pool would see that TX as invalid and discard it, but a pool that kept a larger mempool would get the TX and and the fee.-Dave",
