With the path it is taking, bitcoin has everything to be a kind of digital gold, so it is up to the person to study the fundamentals and then make the decision that they think is most convenient. For example, I don't buy gold, only bitcoin, because I believe that the ease and convenience are infinitely superior, after all, I'm not going to walk around with gold or keep gold at home, bitcoin is much superior in my opinion.",

Gold is less volatile. Bitcoin is also having high liquidity. Just that gold has higher marketcap and also can be more liquid but if you want to buy or sell millions dollars worth of bitcoin, you will be able to buy and sell it right away. I prefer bitcoin investment after a significant bear market but it is good to diversify.Quote from: anarkiboy on August 13, 2024, 10:54:14 AMThis question has been asked here too many times and it doesn't make sense to ask on Bitcoin forum which is a better investment because people here will naturally be biased towards Bitcoin.To ask this question you would need to find neutral forum for investments.Not that they are biased.

Realistic in investing and being able to manage it, people tend to take it as an opportunity to enter early. The way of thinking of the whales is when we are busy and hesitant to weigh this and that, so in my opinion if you have adequate finances, gold and bitcoin are worth investing in, but if you can only choose one, then choose according to your suitability in controlling it efficiently, safely and without the need to involve other parties.",

QuoteBitcoin or Gold which is worth investing in?Both of them are good investments, but gold has lasted for a longer period. Bitcoin is technologically driven and has the advantage of promoting privacy. A good investor would diversify his portfolio, and both of them are good areas to invest in.

But can the less volatile time be very frustrating as it frustrated people in 2010 to 2015 in a way its price behaved like Fiat price? I think it may be possible at anytime.

Low volatility is preferred by practically every rational investor. The graph that you're showing is overly simplified, which is basically a cherrypicked time period.Quote from: _act_ on August 13, 2024, 01:21:22 PM I think it may be possible at anytime.

The economy was generally better after the financial crisis and the demand for gold dropped as people are more willing to invest in other investment vehicles. Similar to how most people argue with Bitcoin, 5 years is too small of a sample size to compare performance.You need to understand how the general market works relative to each asset before you make your assumptions.",

However, it cannot be denied that both assets have their respective advantages and disadvantages. For example, gold is an investment asset that is familiar to everyone. Maybe everyone in this world already knows what gold is. Gold has many uses, such as for making jewelry, electronic devices, health, and even food. So, with the many uses that gold has, it has its own advantages that make gold very good as an investment asset. However, the drawback is that gold has quite a lot of price supply, so the price of gold does not rise too quickly. Even within 10 years, the price of gold has not changed much. Maybe if we invest in gold, there is a possibility that the money we have could decrease in value due to inflation.In contrast to bitcoin, although it doesn't have many uses, in my opinion bitcoin is more suitable as an investment asset and store of value. Because bitcoin has a clear cycle every 4 years. Apart from that, the price increases that always occur in bitcoin can also be said to be quite significant, so our money will definitely increase in value and of course we can definitely avoid what is called inflation. Apart from that, if we look at the era that has advanced to the era of digitalization, bitcoin is certainly superior to gold. So for me personally, Bitcoin is a better investment asset for now.",
