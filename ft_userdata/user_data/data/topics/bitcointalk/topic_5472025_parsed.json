The figures can even go higher but in recent times my only hope is Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Well, LTC halving has already occurred but the bull run started and LTC does have the potential to break the $100 price tag again. But should we only depend on the halving event? I mean, it obviously does not depend on this indicator only, last time when LTC made an ATH (by last time, I mean in 2021) the day at which it set ATH, the price of BTC was also around $60k well not near to ATH ($69k). I think yeah, LTC has some potential, but what about BCH? The halving of BCH has yet to occur. Overall, all the assets look nice to have in the wallet but on what basis you (op) is saying it can gain 300%.",

      "body": "I'm also a supporter of Litecoin, and I believe in its capabilities. It's one of the first altcoins ever created, and even though it has been in the shadows for the past few years, it has been performing quite well despite the bear market. In my opinion, the upcoming bull run will push its price up to $100 for sure. It's certainly not the most promising investment currently, but I believe that it's capable of providing a relatively safe option that may yield up to 100% yield, doubling in price within the next 1.5 to 2 years.I'm currently buying small amounts of it every week through Binance's auto-invest option, aiming to soon acquire at least one Litecoin for the sake of it being a historical altcoin.",

When bitcoin finally hits the peak and everyone has finally taken their profit they go for altcoin to increase their profit by buying altcoins, isn't that how the altcoin season starts? I haven't been buying any altcoin in a long time, had my share of failures with bad altcoins that I just want to secure the long-term with bitcoin.",

However, better-known crypto influencers like CoinBureau don't shill their own bags, so it's okay to watch them, even if it's more for entertainment purposes.

Who are these self-proclaimed \"experts\" - even I can be one if I wish to LTC is a better alternative than ETH, even though things have been so ETH has been second to BTC and LTC has trickled down the top list and is trading at much lows last month. But relying on someone who says that 300% gains are coming, I would take that with a bag of salt.It is possible that after this bitcoin bull run, the prices will rise, but instead of going for the short term flip, LTC is a candidate for long term gains, so focus on that.",

But in last two months of this year, I think it makes sense if you can take a bit of risk, to invest in Litecoin and speculate profit in last two months of this year. When capital flows out of Bitcoin, it will find other assets among altcoins and Litecoin can be lifted up.",

I did expect it to make an upward run after Bitcoin did or during the time it was climbing up but not much really happened.

But I am not giving up on this yet, I will patiently wait for its return and I think it can possibly be dragged up when the BTC ETF is approved. Litecoin is still used in a lot of places, especially in the gambling industry. So yes, I will probably just wait longer but it will be a fruitful one at the right time.

I don't care who says what about anything. As long as it's not my analysis and prediction, I don't care. Have you done your research? And what does it say? And every bull run season there is a time when only Bitcoin thrives. It is the season of Bitcoin. So it is wise to focus on Bitcoin for now. And when it's done, then comes the time for the altcoins. Everything has a time and you need to search for the perfect opportunity. The crypto market nowadays is affected by sentiments. People have created a connection with all the other coins with Bitcoin. So the market moves the same way Bitcoin does. It will not be perfect, but a bull run in the Bitcoin market could create a bull run in the whole crypto market. So wait for Bitcoin to reach the peak and then you can focus on other things if you want the maximum profit.",

It's the same here. You are just sharing your opinion, but you have nothing to back it up. Well, holding some for the upcoming bull run might be a good option but I don't recommend holding it for the long term knowing that there are little to no updates on the development of the project.",

So it is either BTC, ETH or any other major altcoin that we should be more focused on. LTC, ETC, EOS like projects won't do any miracles any more.

Bitcoin exists as an alternative to money, ETH does same but serves more in terms of minting NFTS and the likes. What was on the white paper of the Litecoin? What's their vision and mission as regards why they exist? What vwas the original idea as to why the founders initiated the Litecoin idea, is what should be considered, because I believe it's in the direction of the vision already clearly writing and can be understood, that they operate. No sleeping giant saga, I just believe it's their vision and goals as a company that defined their spot currently.The bull run is the bull run and although the potential for LTC to bounce back may be certain, the issue now that crypto enthusiasts/investors/traders are focused on is which is a more profitable crypto to invest in right now with the best return. I don't think so many people know about LTC as much as BTC or ETH or even USDT.  The aforementioned coins are more rewarding coins in this bull run with a bit more stability and demand.",
