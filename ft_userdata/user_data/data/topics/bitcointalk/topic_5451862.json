I'm not sure the category you fall into but I hope you get the knowledge that you seek.QuoteOur light matter nor dey affect the mining machine?I'm not sure how well electricity is supplied in your area, but if you're the type that receives constant electricity for more than 12 hours a day, it might not be a problem for you, but if you're the type that receives \"two to four\" hours light, it will be a huge hindrance for you unless you have another alternative to generate your own electricity to power your mining rig. Remember the cost of electricity also matters here.Quoteif I wan start mining wetin go b d challenge wey I go faceApart from electricity, the only obstacle you'll face is funds to purchase a mining machine. You should understand that you cannot mine bitcoin with any system. You've probably come across some website advertising that you can mine through their mining cloud by just paying a charge and leaving your PC connected to their server, but you can't.To mine, you'll need to invest in some ASIC hardware.QuoteI find out say many people here dey code abeg coding dey important to mine Bitcoin?Don't be suprised when you find out that your claim is not totally correct as majority of people here don't really know how to coding most just know only the basic of some programming languages nothing more. And to your question, yes, you can mine without knowing how to coding.",

You see ehn, gone are the days when person fit use him laptop mine bitcoin, you no fit use that lapi levels for mining again as the mining equipments and gadgets don change levels too.  For we country, I no think say government dey into this bitcoin mining matter as Dem never really talk anything about am but the only thing I hear wey government talk be say make bank no dey allow trade for Crypto currencies which also includes bitcoin.For your mata of teaching or learning about bitcoin from schools, I no think e go dey feasible because bitcoin no get curricular for that mata of school issues. Even some teachers and lecturers are still yet to comprehend the blockchain to know better how it works.",

Let me explain further:Bitcoin miners needs miners (ASICs) and electricity. If the miner can not be a mining pool, he will need to join a mining pool. A miner should know how to calculate the electricity he is using and if it is going to be profitable. This is more about basic mathematics and basic physics. There are even mining calculators on some online sites or mining pool sites.",
