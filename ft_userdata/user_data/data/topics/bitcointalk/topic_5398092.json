  "content": "That's one of the weird news I got from their newsletter. Bitfrefil created SaveTheBankers with the goal to help the bankers to preserve their lifestyle. Since Bitcoin is a threat to bankers, as they earn less money, the poor guys won't be able to eat caviar at a luxury restaurant. I found they created a fundraising campaign to collect donations (I believe it's hosted on gofundme or a name similar, I don't remember).To me, from the middle class, do you think I'm ready to donate money to someone to finance his lifestyle so that he can continue to live in a big house with 25 rooms.There are starving children in the world, who do you think I would rather give to? To someone who is starving or to someone who drives a big car and is going to make $200k a year instead of the usual $250k.? oh no! I'm less rich, please help,...QuoteSave The Bankers‚Ñ¢ ¬†is an organisation devoted to preserving the unique lifestyle of Wall Street's richest bankers. A Lifestyle currently under growing threat from crypto currencies and decentralised finance. QuoteWhy save the bankers?Much Like the pharaohs of Egypt, or the kings of France before them, Wall Street's bankers are the crown of our civilization. With their 100-car garages and $10,000 breakfasts they give meaning to the lives of even the most boring peasant or nurse- just by letting them fund them!I have prostitutes to pay, it's ruining me, what about you finance me instead, so I can keep my lifestyle?",

I'm pretty sure banks and investment funds are terrified of crypto, that's why they are pumping money so hard in them and making tons of money, that's why they probably laugh so hard hearing how crypto will cut the middleman while they are making millions in wire transfers. But yeah, poor bankers, we need to replace them, we need to replace all those senile old farts who know nothing, imagine where we would be if instead of Jerome Powell we would have Do Kwon in charge¬†  One dollar would be worth one cent by now.Quote from: LeGaulois on May 10, 2022, 09:45:27 PMI have prostitutes to pay, it's ruining me, what about you finance me instead, so I can keep my lifestyle? I almost typed get married but that would have earned me one decade of sleeping on the couch, so no!",

      "body": "There's no chance that this is a sincere campaign to rescue the bankers. As stompix mentioned it seems like this was meant to be a bit more tongue-in-cheek; on top of that it seems like the timing couldn't have been more ironic. Although I agree that the concept of bitcoin could make the concept of bankers obsolete, we have a long way to go before that is a reality. The traditional banking system has more infrastructure and resources than anything - it won't be going anywhere without a fight and we aren't even in the same league yet.Seems more like the bitcoin elite poking fun at the banking elite than anything else.",

This is, to me, obviously pure sarcasm. Bitrefill is clearly making fun of bankers and the system more than being truly concerned about them. I mean, come on, you can't be serious! Look at the words and the phrases; they're all satirical. They're telling you to read between the lines.",

Set up by the head of their fundraising team, Bitte Refillovich. I'm curious to know what they will actually do with the money, since they've already raised around $3000, although $2,500 was from themselves. Their bitcoin donation page states the following:Quote from: https://www.bitrefill.com/buy/save-the-bankers-real-friends/We want to stress that despite any humorous undertones you may detect, both the donation request and the intention to give it to bankers are actual features of this campaign.Maybe once they raise some donations they'll make a video of them trying to donate x amount of bitcoin to a few bankers. It's obviously all just for their own publicity, but it's funny nonetheless.",

But i wonder how will they use received \"donation\".Supporting the prostitutes that LeGaulois has to pay? I mean he started the thread he should get 1st crack at the money.Seriously, I like the campaign but the payout is tricky.People are weird like that, give it to the wrong / charity or group and you risk pissing off a bunch of people since you didn't say at 1st where it's going when you took the money.Personal experience:I have over the years run some auctions / raffles here that I donated the money to a local food bank. I got crap from some people because it was a local food bank and not doing 'enough'. So I just stopped telling people what I was doing with the money. For the little amounts I was generating it really did not matter.-Dave",

I can pay 480 prostitutes with it. üòç¬† üòç¬† üòç Look at the video posted above, collecting money from 'poor' people in El Salvador to get fun. I don't know what to think about this. At least for sure, this 'joke' looks like more about an adverting campaign while getting the buzz. Nothing wrong with that but there are other ways to do it, starving children for example. In Africa, with $25,000 you can feed 25,000 children for a whole weekQuote from: DaveF on May 11, 2022, 11:54:24 AMSupporting the prostitutes that LeGaulois has to pay?
