  "content": "The Birdhouse project launched this year and offers a truly community driven experience for those interested in crypto-token experimentation. We've elected to start some digital scarcity experiments on the Evrmore and Ravencoin blockchains, and those tokens will be available to the world absolutely free! If you're a long time Ravencoin fan, come down and be a part of a new wave of experiments with digital scarcity. If you've never heard of Ravencoin, Evrmore, or the many tokenization projects around the codebase, we will gladly welcome you and are happy to get you started in the ecosystem.Check us out while we're still at the ground floor.https://discord.gg/ZtV5rvYPtBAlso feel free to check out the promo video for our first experiment, Jackdaw: https://youtu.be/5ZSy_2dhQocThis token will be available on Ravencoin this month. Only 50 Jackdaw will ever exist on RVN, 100 were generated last year on the Evrmore blockchain and distributed socially. Soon users will be able to elect a chain to store their Jackdaw on without the need to step outside a p2p transaction. While Jackdaw was originally launched on the Evrmore blockchain (a fork of Ravencoin) in 2022, those that currently hold it will be eligible to swap between chains later this month. This is only a simple example of the types of experiments we hope to run in the Ravencoin ecosystem.Each of our simple projects comes packed with the open source infrastructure available on Ravencoin..For those that don't know what separates this code base and its ecosystem from the rest, we're happy to help. Feel free to reply with any suggestions or criticism, this is an active thread.Noblesse oblige.",

Come take part in a truly unique digital scarcity experiment built on the Ravencoin code base.Announcement video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEWqSYIXlVwThe Jackdaw projects' distribution phase is off to a great start! We've distributed roughly half of the total supply of Jackdaw (limited to 50 tokens) to over 8000 Ravencoin addresses making Jackdaw one of the most widely distributed, yet limited, tokens on the Ravencoin blockchain.Today we announced a public faucet for those who missed out on Jackdaws initial giveaways and airdrops!That being said the faucet is open to everyone, if you've been able to get a fraction of a Jackdaw this will be a great way to increase your holdings, or if you've already got a full Jackdaw, this will certainly help you creep up the richlist . Both the faucet and Jackdaw are experimental, so let us know if you have any issues. Huge shoutout to the RavenRocket team for putting the tool together, it makes it super easy for anyone to run a RVN faucet!Quick links:Project Discord: https://discord.gg/ZtV5rvYPtBJackdaw Announcement video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEWqSYIXlVwFaucet: https://www.rocketraven.net/u/TheBirdhouse/faucetDon't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions about our token experiments or the Ravencoin ecosystem, we're happy to help!",
