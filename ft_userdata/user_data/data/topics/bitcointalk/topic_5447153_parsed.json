This ledger is never stored, but rather exists on the ‚Äúchain‚Äù supported by millions of nodes simultaneously. Through encryption and decentralization, blockchain‚Äôs database of transactions is incorruptible, and each record is easily verifiable. The network cannot be taken down or influenced by a single party because it doesn‚Äôt exist in one place.Blockchain technology provides a platform for creating a highly secure, decentralized, anonymized, yet auditable chain of record, used presently in cryptocurrency systems. this same technology could also be used to record and report votes and prevent many types of voter fraud in elections.Since Blockchain deals with a digital ledger that is saved on the chain, it can not be edited or stored in the office of the government body in charge. So true security is sure that all data from the vote can be store on chain and can't be tempered with. Its transparency means anyone can track the record. In terms of security, it also means individuals can stay at home and send out their vote without going out and facing violence in the election scene, because in some countries there is usually violence in the election scene.Quote from: cafter on April 01, 2023, 12:53:53 PMis that type of voting tested or implemented anywhere?Yes, Sierra Leone and Moscow has.QuoteSierra Leone conducted a Blockchain-based voting system on March 7 and became the first country to become so.

Guess you're the dumb ass who knows the links means I have some content from the article but yet chooses to check via plagiarism checkers. What did you expect to see?Quote but other two quoted lines are helpful Well, I take credit for this. üë∫",

But it can only be as effective as the system implementing it; we cannot expect a corrupt government to implement a transparent umpire to oversee the election.Do not expect blockchain to be used to prevent election malpractice in coubtries where it is prevalent, there are other means of improving transparency in different countries, but they are invariably rendered ineffective by the ruling government if it's corrupt.",
