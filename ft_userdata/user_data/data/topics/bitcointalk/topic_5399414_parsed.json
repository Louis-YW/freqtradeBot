Here he is asking if El Salvador will be the richest country in the world in 8 years and for that I think it is justified to create a separate thread.As for what you ask, OP, no, I don't think so at all, and I would like to but I think that raising that, as crazy as it is, would have made more sense last year, when many still believed that the price cap in this cycle was going to be $200-$400K. But even then, that El Salvador could end up being richer than the top producing countries in the world due to Bitcoin is simply laughable.",

The country suffers from great economic problems there, and Bitcoin can be a solution to these problems, but it will not make this country rich.",

It all depends on the human resources in the country.While limited bitcoins will always be the object of competition from people around the world, the founders of fintech companies are constantly looking for friendly countries. If the Salvadorans don't rush to adapt and keep up with this revolution, then bitcoin means no direct impact on them and only benefits non-natives.",

If they can spend their own reserve to invest in Bitcoin and hold it for 8 to 12 years, I believe they will become a damn rich in future.If they over leverage, I see a future they can get rekted by liquidations.Next 8 years is 2030 that is close to a year 99.2% Bitcoin will be mined. If you can hold until 99.2% Bitcoin is mined, you will become billionaire.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply",

Basically they have to stick to the right path and continue putting a lot of effort into changing decades of bad mistakes and revolutionizing their country in economy and culture to be able to get past the problems and first get out of debt then start building their wealth. I'd say this alone could take two decades.I wish them success.",

A corrupted minority will become rich, but the majority of El Salvador will stay poor. Corruption is a major problem in the underdeveloped Latin American countries.",

Answer : People use bitcoins to pay for products and services. I underlined the word \"use\" because it is very important, because there is a difference between \"use\" and \"hoard\". If the bitcoins are circulating between people and they are using it as a currency to buy and pay for services, you will find that a big spike in the price will not benefit those that spend the bitcoins. If on the other hand, some of those people \"hoarded\" some coins, you will find that their wealth have doubled or even tripled in a very short time.

For El Salvador to even escape the labelling of 'developing country' requires so much more than prudent investments (Bitcoin is not one) but also sustainable and rational steps.",

Is this for only that the El Salvador approved the use of Bitcoin as legal tender ? Yes it's positive site because it will increase the reserve of Bitcoin in there country but This does not mean that they will become the richest Country in the world. I viewed their GDP , Per Capita Income Rank and I think they still have a long way to go. The biggest problems are corruption and terrorism. I think they can go to a better place as long as they can get rid of them. And in the end I will say  this country not only 8years It cannot be the richest country in the world even in 18 years.",

El Salvador is the fifth poorest country in North America, the country needs to expand its coffee and sugar production which is their most source of income and they also have to improve their educational system which will help them to do away with violence that is when the adoption of Bitcoin will be fully effective there In regards to them becoming richer than some countries.",

El Salvador will be rich if they hold and Bitcoin price goes up. The funny thing is that the price won't grow unless more people are buying, so Salvador in order to become rich needs the wealthier countries and their population to provide the cash inflow, otherwise, they will end with the same value even after 20 years. And if others do purchase, we're back to square one where they will be just as wealthy if not more. It's a game where you can't be rich alone and not without some serious help.Quote from: Ale88 on May 20, 2022, 04:06:16 PMIt doesn't make a lot of sense that article, there are single people who own more bitcoins than ES, does anyone think that there will be individuals worth more than the US or China?
