But then also we have to take note of the risk associate with this and to know when exactly is the best time to jump on them since buying at the wrong time can lead to loses on the long run.",

The real question is after the halving, maybe a year or month, we might see the big changes already. LTC is still a good coin, try to hold more and wait for you to take profit, I’m also bullish with LTC.",

I am thinking of throwing in a bit of money in the hope it at least does a 2x in the next month or so.Anyone else into Litecoin and will it rise during the halving next month?I say 2x in a month is kind of too much of an expectation? Just based on what its chart is, its peak wasn't even anywhere close to the halving, it was like 2 years after, and the prior halving (if I looked this up correctly), the price actually started dipping after the halving. And while it did go up prior to it, I don't think a 2x would be an amount you'd honestly expect. While you can expect some profits imo, I reckon you should DCA on it instead, at least maybe for the next year or 1 1/2, or wait for a longer time frame instead when investing right now.",

If it were in the early days of litecoin back when it was still one of the favorite altcoins on people's list, then maybe it would've made a big deal. However, with the level of traction it has now. Not so much. But as other altcoins, the fundamental impact of this might cause a surge in the price since a lot of people would be inclined to buy hoping for the price to increase prior to the halving.My play would be to to monitor rhe price on futures and manage to get some positions in with moderate leverage.

We can't blame them either because even me, it never encourages us to invest. Because it was not just the halving is our metric to see if that project has the potential to grow but we are looking at its monthly performance and sadly, Litecoin doesn't make it well which it means that there are no active trades happening. And even if the halving comes next month this won't hype the project and see no impact on its price.",

Then scale up from there. Litecoin used to be in the top five coins in Coinmarketcap; although it has lost interest the past few years, LTC has gained decent ground throughout 2023 and has been performing quite well the past few months. Despite the current upsetting market situation, it has doubled in price in less than 12 months. Certainly, the halving won't affect its price as much compared to Bitcoin, but I'm quite positive that Litecoin is preparing for a great comeback in the cryptocurrency scene. Only in the past seven days has it been met with an increase in price of over 15%; that's a great number, if you ask me.I'm not expecting miracles to happen after the halving, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see an even larger recovery that will at least increase its value to half of what the ATH was (approximately $400).",

Litecoin is also one of the best crypto in the market and I guess having this on your wallet while litecoin is about to happen is good decision since price might have a good chance to pump.

It will happen only if bitcoin will be going to increase too. You shall not expect something big to come from litecoin halving. It's not the same like bitcoin fork coin which has been pumped so hard recently. Litecoin will not do 2x in a short time. It will be waiting for bitcoin to be done with its next halving.
