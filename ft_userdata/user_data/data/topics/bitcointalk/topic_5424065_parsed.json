  "content": "Hi guys you might have wondered that in 2021 Elon Musk was making tons of tweets about crypto and Los dogecoin. And when he made a single tweet than he was making tons of money and also making highlights day by night. So now after one year what happened to him. What he is not making such tweets. And why he is such silent on this. And also another Tweets where he is making Headlines and that Sucks a lot to these people. So I think that he is a Big Threat to Us Cause he can manipulate Maktet. Now it's Twitter is Public Company and now no one can even give shit about its tweets cause everything is it's own.",
