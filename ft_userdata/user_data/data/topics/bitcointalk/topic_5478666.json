ORDI is just one of the BRC20 tokens but there are many of them. There are many to come is be what people are predicting. So let us expect more congestion if nothing is done.Not only ORDI that caused the recent congestion, SATS is also part of it and other BRC20 tokens.With what I am thinking, Ordinals will stay. Bitcoin developers need to look for means to make the transaction fee cheap as it was before. BRC20 will likely grow and the onchain transaction will increase if nothing is done.",

I haven't obviously seen any possibility to reduce the congested blockchain but only probabilities that are not up to 70% surety for working out. I'm not sure of this thoughts in my head that it might also be that high transaction fees are initiations from the high profile personals or the so called government(s) inorder to maintain the social strata, because Bitcoin has powered social mobility which might force some of them to drop from their statuses. My interest is how do we as a community influence the transaction fees to reduce? knowing too well that nothing has been done since the complains of high tx fees.",

The thing self is, it is not the price of bitcoin that actually causes the high transaction fee but rather the mempool congestion that does that. We have had bitcoin transactions fees at 1-5sats/vbyte when the price was around $30k-$40k last year and a fee of around 20sats/vbyte when the ATH then was not upto $40k",

Cursing the miners and what not!The Bitcoin network is already congested a lot and it will continue to survive with that congestion. The problem with those high fee is that the normal payments with Bitcoin aren't feasible right now and that made many users to switch to alternative blockchains. I would say that the ordinals are the worst type of attack on Bitcoin network and unfortunately the developers can't do anything to stop the growth of those ordinals. So many new BRC-20 tokens are getting ready to be listed on exchanges and if they somehow succeed to get listed on exchanges then the network will get more congested day after day.The exchanges and other platforms are promoting those ordinals to earn trading fees and extra and they don't care much about Bitcoin's network. The only possible solution to combat the ordinals issue is to go with LN but no body talks about that anymore and it's usage isn't that high. That's why the ones who used Bitcoin as p2p payment solution are switching to altcoins and if it continues like that then very few people would use Bitcoin as p2p payment system and most people will consider it as an asset only.",

Also that there is nothing developers are doing to make this type of transaction not to be on bitcoin blockchain.

You are too pessimistic considering that in the past there were also big challenges when it comes to spamming the blockchain and when the fees were more than twice as high as the highest recently. The Bitcoin community, to which the people from this forum and everyone else belong, can't do anything about it, and if you follow what prominent members of this community write, then you probably noticed that they mostly do not support any form of censorship that would go in the direction of banning what is currently happening.We don't have many options, there is LN as an alternative, or maybe some altcoin until the situation stabilizes - although in the long term we all have to know that in less than 10 years 99% of BTC will be mined, and that even before that, miners will increasingly depend on fees that will no longer be as cheap as we are used to.",

Everybody is in the Bitcoin ecosystem to make more money and miners are taking advantage of these opportunities.

Big Bitcoin mining firms like Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc. have made so much profit this season.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-19/bitcoin-nft-ordinals-craze-turns-into-revenue-bonanza-for-miners-mara-riotQuoteWhere are we going as a Bitcoin community?
