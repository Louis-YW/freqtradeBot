Doge was started as a joke and never made any promises other then 'much coin'But, and this is just me saying this just an opinion, they did a lot of things in terms of marketing, promotion and what not that made them a target.There are a lot of other projects out there that are still around and not being bothered. I don't want to say just another shitcoin scam, but this one got the eyes of the government on it. But, I can't think of any other way to put it.Just my opinion.-Dave",

There is no point in continuing to discuss Ethereum. They'll have the best lawyers if there's ever a trial.Larger ecosystems will probably pay a heavy fine, and other projects will be forced to close forever.",

Projects do not sell tokens, but attract investments to their fund. It does not violate US laws.There is a lot of crap and politics in the crypto industry. Sam Bankman-Freed wasn't punished for fraud. I heard serious people discussing this situation, and the reason for these events was that Sem was allowed to hold several billion, and he began to say the wrong words and get into politics. But maybe it's a rumor.Maybe you can find out the possible real reason for the SEC's aggression against the LBRY. Many projects that sold their tokens no longer exist, but there are still a lot of similar projects that can be closed or fined.",

I understand we're on bitcoin forum and any form of sh***ting on ETH is encouraged, but in reality, it was made clear that the so-called 'pre-sale' was not an investment (you had to accept a disclaimer in big, bold, red letters saying so), that you were not buying anything, that there was no guarantee that the devs will actually develop anything and that any funds raised were donations to the project and any participants were to be rewarded in ETH tokens, proportionally to their donation, should the project be successful.Objectively speaking, they've done pretty solid work there.Quote from: MarathonA on November 13, 2022, 06:38:33 AMMany projects will simply avoid the USA.This.",

It is hard to believe they just take the raised ICO numbers as punishment as you mentioned above without considering anything else.These events happen frequently because many tokens are securities under US law. Some companies are less affected by fines because they prevented US residents from buying tokens, or used licensed intermediaries who monitored it.Another question is what investors bought for: fiat or cryptocurrencies.One of the punishment options is the amount of sale of tokens (shares) on ICO plus interest and penalties. For most companies, this is bankruptcy.",
