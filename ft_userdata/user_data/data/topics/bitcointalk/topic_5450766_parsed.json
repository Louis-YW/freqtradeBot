  "content": "As the title says this is of people who have Pi in their Mainnet balance. I mined my pi for years! And i finally got KYC and migration and friend of mine told me that i can sell on instagram.com/buypinetworkI sold all i had that migrated since i locked 50%. So around 200 Coins (not a lot but very good) How much did you guys migrate??I sold mine for very good price and i wish i had more. If you have pi on your mainnet wallet, my advice is to sell  since price is amazing, and i receive payment on crypto so WIN WIN Hope i helped someone! Cheers",
