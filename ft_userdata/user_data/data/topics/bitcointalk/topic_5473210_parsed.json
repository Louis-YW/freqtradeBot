Search both platforms and you will see those with large followers. On the other hand, you can use Google to get specific names and reduce the stress of search the previous platforms. I don't know what you need influencers for but if it is for information of what to do at this time regarding Bitcoin, I don't see the need because you will either get over excited to take irrational decision or discouraged by fud.",

But also make sure to do a research regarding on those influencers so that you will not get a pure shillers which main intention is to market all the project they get and they would not care about scam so you should not follow them since they are financially risky. But if you can able to handle and want to play with risk since maybe you are a type of the guy where feel excited when there's something like that involve then you can test them but make sure that you do some extra precautionary measure so that you will meet the real ones which share their knowledge to their followers and not those influencers who fakes everything so that they can take advantage of people then lure them to invest on what they are trying to promote to his people.",

      "body": "Hmm, I think it's quite hard to find such a platform. I would suggest trying to seek or ask the guidance of social media agencies. Certainly, that is their domain, so they should have a map about some particular influencer in some domain, cryptocurrency in this respect.Another manual solution is to search around the influencer by yourself. for example, Twitter has some guidance about where to find influencers. Take a look at https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/micro-influencers-and-where-to-find-them.html.Other social media like TikTok, offer a platform of creator marketplace in which you can search or filter influencers, but sadly, I think this is quite not the place for cryptocurrency.",

This will take your time in researching and checking them and seeing how many impressions and engagements they make for each of their posts and videos. You can hire someone to do it for you and have the list based on the personal research or you can do it on your own and list them.",

You could recognize them yourself or are you trying to build a project and wanted to get a recommendation from them which one to hire or utilize as promoters? Cause if you are active on Twitter you could see whose the influential one that might be recognizable in the crypto community. More like a hunting ground for these influencers is a skill or talent too to pick whose the one gonna be helpful.",

More like a hunting ground for these influencers is a skill or talent too to pick whose the one gonna be helpful. I strongly agree with your point. The idea of crypto infleuncers has been made a laughing stock as people now buy followers and parade themselves as influencers, when, in reality, they are having bots as followers. If you want to know the true influencers in the space, you will have to consider being more active in the social media space and know those who truly influence projects. Most of them aren't actually influencers doing the influencing business, they just arrived at some positions by doing other things and then they decided to explore crypto knowing that they fall into the category of influencers",
