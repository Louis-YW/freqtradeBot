I just want to learn how it all works.",

How  did you   feed SEED  into Electrum, manually or via copy-paste from somewhere.  The latter results sometimes in wrong syntax due to the difference in coding while manual input may bring the typos. Try once more with manual input paying special attentions  to typos that may crawl to SEED. Don't use copy-paste.",

      "body": "I just installed HODL wallet to see how it works. (I had to use a phone with an old version of android, since it was not compatible with a newer version of android.)The seed phrase generated by HODL wallet is BIP39. So, if you entered the seed phrase correctly and checked \"BIP39 seed\" option, it should allow you to click on \"Next\" button.The error you got means that you entered the seed phrase incorrectly. Check to see if you have made any typos. Quote from: Scorp810 on September 20, 2023, 07:38:06 PMApp support suggested that I install the Electrum app and move everything to it, as it allows me to increase the fee to speed up the confirmation, when their app does not.  If your transaction has been flagged as RBF, you should be able to increase the fee with electrum easily. I haven't ever used HODL wallet, but since they suggested increasing the fee using electrum, I assume it automatically flags transactions as RBF. Did their support tell you what derivation path you should use for recovering your wallet?I created a wallet on HODL wallet and imported the seed phrase generated by it in electrum and got different addresses. Edit:According to their github, HODL wallet uses the derivation path of m/0' and that's what you should enter as derivation path when recovering your wallet from seed phrase.",

I recently downloaded the current version on my Android device and you are again correct many features are missing.
