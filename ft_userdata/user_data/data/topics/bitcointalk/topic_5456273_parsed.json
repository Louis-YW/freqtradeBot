  "content": "So I was reading something interesting in the Red Book today, on page 10, it talks about Bits on the spanish dollar system, the pieces of eight. Well, you learn something new every day because I wasn't aware that 1 bit in the spanish dollar monetary system is equivalent to 12.5 cents, and 2 Bits equals 25c and so on. I thought that interesting because now we're talking about the evolution of money here, and as far as the spanish dollars are concerned people have been exchanging bits for centuries now! Just not bit coins up until recently  I know that isn't any coincidence, because it would be very funny to think that Satoshi had the pieces of eight in mind when he invented bitcoin. How funny would that be if thats how he got the name lol. The units in which data is also measured uses the bit system, with so many bits making a byte, and so on. I have just been thinking about this recently as I was looking through some of the finer 8 reales coins that popped up in my employers inventory for sale, and so I turned to the red book and learned this about the bits. It is commonly known for 2 bits equaling 25 cents I read somewhere on google. If thats the case then lets just use our imagination here. if 1 bit was to equal 1 satoshi and there are 120 million satoshis in one bitcoin then you do the math and tell me what you get",

I think Moonbits used \"bits\" as a reference to the BTCC chips. My own mind definetely works in sats and 1.0000000 BTC, not in bits, though.If Bitcoin ever reaches the masses, maybe the official term for the lower denominations may change. I will always refer to the (currently) smallest unit as Satoshi or sat. It's unique and shows respect where respect is due. Just my 50 sats on the topic, though.",

In the end it doesnâ€™t much matter because everything is priced in dollars anyway. I still talk in terms of bitcoins as I think it would be weird to ask someone for hundreds of thousands or even millions of sats, but if itâ€™s an amount in the hundreds of sats I would say sats.

I enjoyed the history, it's pretty cool that Satoshi himself favored the term bits. On another interesting video I was watching yesterday on the Townsends YouTube channel there was another one referencing the similarities to the Spanish coinage and bitcoin. He was mainly talking about the very popular milled pillar dollars and also the pieces of eight, but he described how merchants and traders kept a Ledger.

Bits was never used to describe 1 sat or 1 bitcent. you are suggesting to call sats bits and that would be completely off.edit and if you check the forums - there are plenty of uses of the term bitcent but that was still never used by satoshi here on the forums - at least not that I have ever seen or found.",
