Can you prove in any way that you have designed and built the Blockchain ?",

I almost had a brain seizure going through Op's post history. Quote from: BitcoinMoses on November 14, 2017, 08:10:41 PMHello Bitcoin Forum ! Today I announce the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology. His true identity and brand name is Thomas Phellen. Thomas Phellen invented Bitcoin and Blockchain technology in early May 2007.Quote from: BitcoinMoses on December 27, 2017, 09:44:29 PMSatoshi Nakamoto is actually Theymos. Theymos is actually the impostor of real Satoshi Nakamoto. He is literally an Artificial Intelligence. Satoshi Nakamoto is 'Bitcoin Jesus'  Roger Ver the impostor has pickpocketed the second coming of Jesus Christ's title 'Bitcoin Jesus' from Satoshi Nakamoto.Quote from: BitcoinMoses on May 12, 2022, 06:49:29 PMYou are saying Satoshi Nakamoto is one of the great mind. But you need to know, that Satoshi Nakamoto is my Pseudonym. Theymos is also my pseudonym. When I am Satoshi Nakamoto, how can I am trying to steal my own pseudonym ?Quote from: BitcoinMoses on March 28, 2022, 01:06:41 PMYes, you can claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Please make your claim today and get free ticket to attend Coinbase Summit 2022. I am going to give free ticket to 32 Satoshi Candidates to attend the Coinbase Summit in London. Quote from: bitcoinmoses 25th December, 2018.Today is Christmas but very few Christians knows that Jesus was born on 13 April -4 AD.Today is the 'Happy Birthday of Satoshi Nakamoto'.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5083789.msg48882398#msg48882398Quote from: BitcoinMoses on September 29, 2019, 03:19:37 PMSatoshi Nakamoto himself has decided to reveal his true identity on his Japanese Birthday this year in Bangkok on the 5 April 2019.
