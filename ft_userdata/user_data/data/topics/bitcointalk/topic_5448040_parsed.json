This is your first topic, if you want to earn merit, you must be productive in terms of helpful posts and replies to other members in the forum. Learning never ends, even in these forums where knowledge is not determined by the rank of members. Although there are also a lot of high-ranking memebers that are very knowledgeable about technology, Bitcoin technology, economics, politics, and other important stuff, perhaps if you are able to post with quality and any memeber or merit source finds your post helpful to them or other memebers in the forum, you can receive merit.At this point, OP, merit should not be your priority; this thread is far beyond mere curiosity; it seems like you have other hidden intentions. But what ever, well, every one here was once a newbie, with a few having gabs as their thread. As a newbie, I suggest you should be asking questions like, \"How can I find my way around the forum?\" Start by reading those thread suggestions from @tranthidung.You can also report some good merit worthy post to merit  source for you to receive merit but before then, you need to have quality post before you apply.[Merit] Share your best posts/threads with Fillippone to be merit assessed",

Thank you and happy holidaysOp good day and welcome to bitcointalk.org,No further a do I would say that this topic is already been taken and also already been solved Op no offense but you must use the search button first before you make a topic. Yes, you don't know yet about the forum, but as far as I analyzed your topic it seems that you already know this forum before you created an account because the first topic you made is about merit and most real newbies don't ask that question cause most of a real newbie asks for advice what they gonna do since they are already here in the forum. But anyways about your question about how you get merits then one thing I can say is to stop asking about merit, and focus on your contributions then achievements will follow soon including merits. Since you claimed that you are a newbie here then you must read   rules and regulations here in the forum to avoid any mistakes and lead to a ban. There's a does and don't here in the forum you must be aware for that too. Anyways when you have enough time you can make a research about the topic you want to know and if you can not find then you are freely to ask.",

There is nothing wrong with entering contests like carving a pie or baking pumpkins, or even a drawing contest. The main thing is that the beginner is active and has an incentive to receive merit. After all, it is the merits that will push him to action, which, perhaps, will result in good posts and the birth of a future famous forum user. Would well-known bitcointalks' members appear if they did nothing and only whined that there was no way to get merit? OP understands what he needs to progress, and therefore, has a chance to achieve what he wants.
