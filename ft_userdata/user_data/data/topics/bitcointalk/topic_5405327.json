  "content": "All I will say is that the box will be worth about the same (to me, you may think the items worth more) as the auction price. Will prioritize new items, then descend in condition if I run out of new items or the new items can't add up close enough. If the auction price is sufficiently high & my biggest box can't hold everything, I'll split everything across multiple packages.Auction Terms (should go without saying, but: if violated, negative feedback with risked BTC will be left)Only bid if YOU will receive my mystery box in 1 of the 50 United States of America.Minimum Starting Bid: BTC0.005Minimum Bid Increment: BTC0.0005Shipping: Free packaging, but the cheapest shipping service based on dimensions, destination & weight counts towards auction priceEnd Date: At 23:59:59 (by my clock: https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/los-angeles) on the day of the first valid bidPayment Deadline: My BTC addresses (if you don't specify 'SegWit' or 'standard' next to your bid) will be sent to winner at end of auction, and payment must be at least broadcast to the network within 8 hoursLate Payment Penalty: Negative feedback, which will be removed after you pay 2x the amount of your winning bid (you'll get 2x the mystery box)Local rule: anyone who replies to this topic without an eligible bid agrees to be lifetime-banned from Bitcointalk.org immediately.",
