Joke aside what most people failed to realize is that creating a successful meme coin requires a lot of work, the guy that create Pepe tried more than once before he hit it big. The reasons people are creating these Memes is because they feel it is a get-rich-quick thing and it would attract new investors to  dump on, good luck",

Pepe was a legendary internet meme that has been around for years, it makes a lot of people laugh with the memes online so there’s a reason that did so well & went viral. Floki is just a copy of SHIB, people tried to jump on the coat tails of SHIB. You’ve put the two memes together, hoping they can go viral. I’m doubtful it’ll gain a lot of buyers but good luck regardless.",

First bitcoin, now DOGE. All this puts a shadow over the cryptocurrency industry itself and in the eyes of many people, especially those who are just getting acquainted with this field, it all looks like dabbling and some kind of dubious scam.

The only thing that is not clear is what our help should be? I understand that you created the coin, but you don't know what to do next?

Secondly no project on this planet could get close to another one by just sharing the address and that's it, this is just a way of asking money.It would have been wiser to open up a topic, saying you are poor, and you are starving, and you need money to survive, and you could show proof of it with some images, and then ask for money, handout, donations basically in charity way. At least that would be honest, if you need money and I mean really need money there are places in the crypto world that can help you, if you do not, then why would anyone give you money anyway.",

These upgrades aren't really for the people but for those selfish ones that sees profits in it. The mempool as for these brc20 tokens has never made the network to breathe again. Although compared to the past weeks, the fee had dropped a lot but still it was not the fee that we used to see before these crazy tokens have came out. There's so much to learn from these tokens and that is not to invest on them if you don't want to lose money as these are just tokens made out of hype.",
