The only problem is that when your keys are online they are more easily compromised than when they are stored offline. One has to even be careful when storing keys offline as theft and burglary can also compromise them.Majority of people that use cold wallets for Their Bitcoins actually do it for their hodlings since they don't have to visit it frequently.",

You can even plug your device in an infect computer and your coins will be safe. Unless if you do some mistake like phising etc...",

Now as to the choice of wallet, there is no better way choice in terms of security other than a cold storage just like you have written but Hardware Just like you have pointed out isn’t the best because you can use a software wallet better than an hardware wallet and that is by airgapping it. Even this hardwares also causes problems sometimes like company change of policy but with an airgapped device you set it up and if done properly is more secure than even an hardware. But the reason why most people advise newbies for hardware is because most of them will mess up the process of setting up an airgapped device with a software wallet. Another thing we down play a lot is sometimes after the choice of a wallet is made the problem lies on how we actually safe our seed phrase. Some wallets get compromised not through phishing but through physical access to the wallet key or seed phrase",

I used a software wallets and it doesn't make me stupid because the bitcoin on the wallet is small, not large and the wallet is open source which means it's likely to have zero backdoor where shady things can happen but you downloaded a crapy software wallet and making it seems all software wallet are garbage, yours even included email and password, in 2024, that's pure scam.Nothing is different that has never been discuss since bitcoin has ever existed or not discuss before, we just don't pay attention until we bight ourselves on the fingers and they cry victim. Not your keys, not your coins. Use a open source hardware wallet to manage your bitcoin and private keys and if you must use a software wallet for Bitcoin, use reputable ones that are open source like Bitcoin core and electrum.",

And with recent news of them using cloud to backup users data, it shows how untrustworthy ledger is.

Any wallet that stores your keys for you is considered unsafe and not trustworthy. Remember, if you don't control the keys, you don't control the coins. This should be a lesson for you.I don't see how difficult it is to write down your seed phrase and keep it in a secure place. If you think software wallets are unsafe, you should reconsider. There are good wallets like Electrum and Blue Wallet. As long as you can keep your seed phrase offline, your funds will be safe.",

      "body": "As they say there is no 100% safe wallet based on some biased points but there are wallets that are more secured than others. At your level I don't think you should be making this kind of mistake because even from the first week I got here (when I started participating in discussions) I noticed that almost everyone suggest electrum as a good wallet when ever it required wallet issues and with the time you have spent here you most have heard of such too, so I'm not expect a person of your rank to make such silly mistake. Even with a little amount like $500 we are always advised as newbies to start considered better wallets like Electrum, Sparrow, hardware and cold store wallets and from such you should have moved yours to this preferable wallets that you can be confident woth your stash. Online wallets can still holds so big amount of Bitcoin but it's will more safer if one acquires a hardware wallet or a cold storage wallet but this two wallets are mostly used long term purposes. If you need to make a day to day transaction then you should have considered better wallets. At the end I'm really really disappointed to see a senior colleague make such mistake. A 10k is an insane amount that you could toy with, if such mistake was made by a newbie it should be understandable because he/she lacks better wallet know at that point but for someone of such position is very disappointing. To think that you did even write than your recovery seed phrase, so sorry to day is that not insane?. Well everyone has lessons to learn and I suppose this is yours.",

Why? because im not really that holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin and this is why buying one wont really be that relevant. Well, i do have some few though and some altcoins but i can say that there are wallet which are open source. Yes, its software but as long you do possess its keys then you could actually be able to access that wallet compared into those custodial ones which does requirethose email log in or whatsoever. It is really just that sometimes you would really be needing to make use of your common sense for you to be able to differentiate on which one is better andwhich one is really that risky.",

Even then, hardware wallets do not guarantee 100% that your funds are completely safe from hacking. The security of your fund depends a lot on you. If you are holding bitcoins on your device and not browsing safely, then no one can save you from being hacked. In case of a hardware wallet, you must be careful when connecting the hardware wallet to any device. That device should be safe. However, the latest layer to provide the best security for holding funds is to use hardware wallets, but those who maintain security and use hot wallets for holding, I will not call it stupidity.
