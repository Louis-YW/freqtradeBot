To be good, a community has to operate, work = solve problems with little to no issue.  Such is not possible with people who do not completely depend on their CREATOR. But you may be lucky to find a community/forum ranked above normal World's standards. It would need to have very principled people who try as much as possible to operate or build things according to Bitcoin ideals.Imagine a transparent forum where anyone is free to join with little-no permission, the forum has fair rules, members can be anonymous,  can have unlimited account derived from their main accounts, no one is trusted.. as the trustworthiness/authenticity of everything is proven before it's accepted, the state of any public post before it's changed is immutable, merit & reputation based grading allowing all contributions/deeds to go through compulsory grading, the best members lead via merit based ranking, has a deflationary currency, has marketplaces for interdependent economic system, has different offices/departments for people or groups of people with special talents/skills, the forum leaders bring  talented people together to build great/good things, job is always available, workers are paid according to how well their works are done, etc I think such a community or forum could operate as a parallel society based both in cyberspace and physical world.",

Here are a few popular ones:Crypto Forums: In addition to Bitcointalk, there are other crypto-specific forums where you can engage with the community. Some popular ones include CryptoCompare Forum, Bitcoin.com Forum, and CryptocurrencyTalk. These forums provide spaces for discussions, project announcements, technical analysis, and more.Even though this was posted by garbage AI spam at least it provided this bit of information which is fairly decent. Thanks because now I'm checking what \"Bitcoin Forum\" is.",
