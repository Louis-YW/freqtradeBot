  "content": "I present the facts as I see them.I make no assertion that any of these users are aware of what EFS has done.Also, I make no assertion that any of these UID's are alts.TL;DRAS with Dabs and tranthidung, I believe EFS (who is a Staff member here on the forum) is engaging in Trust Feedback self scratching albeit nearly all were already a minimum DT 2 when they were DT trusted by EFS.  Some of the more recent additions by EFS have been promoted via EFS' inclusion of them and they appear to have mearly copied EFS' trust feedback trust and distrust lists, then been \"rewarded\" by EFS with promotion.This month, EFS' trust feedback score is +8 / =1 / -1 with their sole negative coming from Lauda (who indirectly plays a part as you will see)In week 22 EFS' DT Trust list looked like this:QuoteTrust list for: EFS (Trust:  +4 / =1 / -2) (188 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP) (created 2019-06-15_Sat_13.30h)Back to indexEFS Trusts:1. theymos (Trust:  +25 / =0 / -0) (DT1!

(43) 1119 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP)Then, a week later, EFS added Lauda to their distrust list:QuoteTrust list for: EFS (Trust:  +4 / =1 / -2) (188 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP) (created 2019-06-22_Sat_05.50h)Back to indexEFS Trusts:1. theymos (Trust:  +25 / =0 / -0) (DT1!

Untrustworthy.(Don't forget my neutral trust feedback concerned EFS attempting to buy accounts while Stunna's OP is interesting in that at some point in the past EFS was known as EAL and they have since July 2015 changed their user profile name.)Week 104 sandy-is-fine has been added to EFS' DT trust list:Four out of eight are now trusted by EFS.Week 147 - xzone is promoted to DT2 by EFS taking the tally to five of the elven EFS trusts.  (Five of nine if you don't count the first two they had trusted prior to week 70)xzone's trust list mirrors EFS' in week 147 when xzone was promotedbut if you look at week 76, xzone has, for the most part, simply copied EFS's trust listLachrymose's trust of xzone does not promote xzone to DT2 as Lachrymose is only trusted by nine users and from what I can tell, they had not been DT1 before that week, so it is EFS' vote that promotes xzone to DT2 enabling EFS to have an additional positive trust feedback.We come to week 183 where EFS promotes two users.  For context, I have done a screen shot of week 178 for Gencecikmen, week 183 for EFS and this week 187 for user pÃ¼sÃ¼rConclusion:It would seem to me that EFS has, bit-by-bit been rewarding those users (i.e. self scratching) who have either left positive trust feedback, or in the later examples mirrored EFS' DT trust and distrust lists.Comments welcome.",

      "body": "If EFS is self-scratching it seems to have taken him a long time to get it done.  I'm not so sure that it is self-scratching, there are too many other possible reasons that are purely coincidental, and plausibly innocent.  I don't see any reason why he wouldn't add members of the local community where he's regularly active, and it could be totally coincidental that they've left him feedback.  Also the numbers aren't blatant enough to definitively say this is self-scratching.The newer members mimicking EFS's trust list isn't that surprising, either.  When I first set mine up I mimicked the inclusions of a handful of member whom I found trustworthy.  It's not a bad way to get started for newbies, and if EFS is their primary example-setter since he is active in their local community, it would make perfect sense for them to copy his list.In all honesty, I'm not seeing much here.  I haven't had much interaction with EFS, but I see he was accused of some shady behavior in the past.  That all seems so long ago, I'm not sure any of it is still relevant unless there's recent evidence of similar behavior.",

      "body": "Gencecikmen, xzone and püsür are in my trust list as I know them in real life and I totally trust them. They are important part of local community. Why wouldn't I trust them? Why don't you trust them? You think you can slander people you have no idea who they are?sandy-is-fine is in my trust list because he did a great job in Digital Goods section.My trust list was on 9 people because I was tired of all these DT, merit source etc. stupid drama. I feel trust and merit system do more harm than good to crypto community here. Then theymos made some changes and I built my trust list again. Thought it would be more useful this time.Instead of checking 188 weeks of trust list and create conspiracy theories you could PM me and I would tell. But your job is this and you are one of the small reasons many people left the forum. Creating unnecessary drama and failed witch hunts are all you can do. This is why I don't trust you and any of your feedback and you are in my distrust list.(That you is not directly at you, but all users who thinkalike and do the similar.)It's funny you opened this thread after another old time ban evader multi account troll resurrected one of his accounts two years later to make funny accusations in local forum. Coincidence? I don't think so.",

I don't think so.Forgot to point out earlier that in the last six months EFS has only posted just nine times (in the last twelve months just seventeen times) yet they imply they have been active in some sort of \"local\" board.How? - With an alt perhaps?To be fair, EFS has been handing out merits - but it's predominantly those same user profiles that are listed up above in the first post that EFS seems to favour over others.Speaking of merits:Quote30 July 2022, 10:20:32: 50 to satoshi for Re: They want to delete the Wikipedia article@theymos - Is this *really* the best use of merits?...and do you need to be a Staff member when all you seem to be doing is handing out merits?QuoteGencecikmen, xzone and püsür are in my trust listThey might be, but I never mentioned püsür - unless you're saying pÃ¼sÃ¼r is püsür in which case, @LoyceV will have to amend their records.",
