  "content": "We have positive news from Japan already, where they are going to perform a fundraiser to support the WEB3 applications in the country. The target of the fundraiser is set to $100 million, and the news which I already shared in the past week I guess. However, it turns out Japan's friendliness towards crypto sector acceptance is yet to be set with proper guidelines. Recently, FSA has issued a warning to one of the major exchanges such as BitGet, BitForex, and MEXC Global who are said to be operating in Japan without proper registration. They concluded the business was being run unlawfully and for now, they are just under warning. BitGet is a global player in the crypto exchanges and they have carefully stated that BG limited has proper registration in Seychelles and they would never operate without proper licensing.A similar warning letter was issued by Japan FSA in the year 2021. Now, it's time to see how these regulatory frameworks will work in the future considering the nation is friendly towards crypto but always has some issues with exchangers or crypto companies at another end. QuoteJapan's Financial Services Agency in a warning letter published on Friday said foreign crypto exchanges Bybit, BitForex, MEXC Global and Bitget are operating in the country without proper registration.The regulator said at the time of the notice the exchanges were violating the country's fund settlement laws by \"conducting crypto asset exchange business without registration\" and also said the list of unregistered traders \"does not necessarily indicate the current state of unregistered business.\"Although Japan is working on new regulations for the crypto and Web3 sectors, the country hasn't cracked down on the industry as hard as some other larger economies such as the U.S. following what was a turbulent year for the markets in 2022.When reached for comment, a representative for Bitget said the exchange will be getting in touch with the FSA \"for more information.\"\"Bitget operates through BG Limited, a Seychelles-registered company. As a global crypto exchange, we are following the rules and regulations in Seychelles. All our operations and services remain normal at the moment and we will update our customers when there is an update,\" the representative said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.The FSA issued a formal warning letter to Bybit for operating without necessary permissions back in 2021.Japan Regulator Flags 4 Crypto Exchanges Including Bybit for Operating Without Registration",

      "body": "So basically all exchanges that serve Japanese customers right now are operating based on following ambiguous rules (or no rules at all)? Else, how do they define operating without proper registration? At least they don't just fine exchange and people left and right without providing enough regulatory basis. So it makes sense that some exchanges are stopping their services for Japanese users if what I've heard about strict regulations is real. Looks like they believe following the regulators is a pain in the ass and not worth the effort. If their rules regarding customers' fiat are true[1], I guess we'll see more and more exchanges interact closely with banks. I won't be surprised if banks or government will launch their own exchange for full control if a private entity can't do this. Would be interesting to see if P2P trades will happen more or not if there is no good centralized platform that can serve the demand for Japanese crypto trades.[1] https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/01/26/japan-embracing-crypto-industry-web3-dao-nft/",

      "body": "The Japanese government doesn't mess around with the rules they have released against crypto exchanges, not only the BitGet exchange gets love letters from the FSA, There are four other exchanges that received warnings and terminated payment services from the FSA for Japanese citizens.For example:QuoteBybit, Bitforex, Bitget and MEXC Global received a warning from the FSA of Japan, for being accused of providing unlawful derivative trading services.All crypto exchange sites operating in Japan must officially register with the FSA, and every crypto exchange entity operating in Japan is no exception: if they don't comply with the rules that have been implemented by the Japanese government and they ignore them, all the wayward crypto exchanges will leave their name in Japan, they can't do anything, I think BitGet still has a chance to register with FSA Japan, if they want to stay there, even though a love letter has been sent by FSA to BitGet.",
