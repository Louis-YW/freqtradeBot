This one na my views, my people how una see am?My brother watin U talk make sense but e get one or two things way I go like point out for you.As a citizen of a country, there are lots of basic things way government to suppose set in place, for citizens to strive.1: ELECTRICITY. Government supposed generate electricity for SMEs and multinational Business to grow, if MTN tell you how much them dey waste on top diesel because there is no sustainable electricity u go shock.  If that your hair Babber tell you how much him dey waste on fuel everyday, because say light no dey, u go shout. Now ask yourself how much dem dey gain.2: UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNDEREMPLOYMENT.I believe say, this particular matter we can all relate.Person go spend years for school, when him finish him go come still go service and come back,  yet no job. Job way person go try see, them go wan under pay the person.  Because say industries no dey, to employ, Government no wan even hear anything about youth empowerment and growth. Meanwhile for other country, once you no get work, e get social support system way go dey pay till you find job.Guy make I stop here, because If say make i list the problems way government don put people, we no go finish am. So brother no blame us say we dey always call government, because na them dey incharge of our money to use run the system.",

If your government too, it gives you you positive vibes and reduces negative ideas but if your government bad, it breeds and nurtures negative ideas. This na just as we always say environments they get effects on lives.But my advice to people be say whether the government good or not, make you yourself just think good and practice good vibes to profile yourself positive income because government way no good no send you so you owe yourself how you want your life to be.",

Is it you or myself ? The truth is bitter and it remains the fact. Our leaders are the cause of this bad economy that we are experiencing because they don't care about us,but only themselves and they only implement what they will benefit from only and not the masses. Nigeria leaders has done a big harm to our economy and it might take a very long time to build it back or never. We voted and our votes don't count. We needed a good leader and INEC chairman gave us his own leader. Bro why we no go blame leaders. The president from Obasanjo till date are borrowing money from foreign countries all in the name of Nigeria but at the end this money wouldn't be used for the purpose but for their selfish desires.Nigerians are hardworking and tolerant, if not these country wouldn't be a happy place for everyone. If it is in the second world country all these dubious acts would have been put to stop by the citizens. The youths are peaceful and hardworking people who out of nothing creates something for themselves to survive with the harsh weather. It is normal to complain about the hardship but have you seen anyone that is eating without working in these our present days. No",

However, it is also fair to hold them responsible to some extent. In Nigeria, for example, the government has not provided adequate basic amenities, there are several challenges such as high unemployment and various other shortcomings. These issues have made it particularly challenging for the people expecialy the young people to achieve their dreams and goals. I normally say Naija government no get plans for the youth, so I advise we the youth strive hard and go extra mile to achieve our goals.",

Finding something legit and giving it your very best3. No shame to hustle even if it means starting small. This one na my views, my people how una see am?Good governance start from individual, local government, state government and upto federal level but when you check all this sections, everybody dy contribute to the bad governance of the country in one way or the other, we don't help the country but we're always quick to jump on any government officials for any of their mistakes but meanwhile, we don't do what is necessary for good governance. I go elaborate am for you.Individual case: Corruption eradication start from individual, from home to home, from work place to work place but not everyone that is ready for this discussion. Take a look at Nafdac and organic creams has been trending over some weeks now. There is this guy that has been calling out entrepreneurs that sell product without properly registered With Nafdac. Checking most of tbe nigeria start up that are into sell of consumable goods don't register their products, they are not tested and verified for the public use but entrepreneurs go behind to put these products on shelf for sales, even brand influences collect money to advertise these products. This is how we are doing our self, nobody want to follow due process anymore, they want shortcut which is illegal and illegal process is a crime which people need to put to stop.Local government: If you know the numbers of ghost workers that are registered on monthly payroll without going to work sometimes even exceed the real employed workers under the local government, they are been paid by the government and the don't show for work, we plenty of them accross 774 local government we have in this country but when they hear that minister embezzle money, they are the ones that do quick to react to news forgotten that they are also bad of the bad governance. Money that was supposed to be use for development of local areas are been siphon between them and they will cry later that the government don't support the local areas.State Government: The state government are not different from the local government in money mismanagement. However, the corrupt under the state government exceed what happened in local government, they have ghost workers that don't show up at work, some of them work with the state government and also work with the local government and under the law, you are not allow to work under the two levels of government, you have to chose one but there are people that chose more than one. In addition, there is high rate of project fund mismanagement but people will close eyes on them because they are guilty of sharing the money among them.Federal government: The federal government by looking at them looks clean but are more bigger in corruption and embezzlement, jobs that are supposed to be given out by merit are sold for applicants in huge amount, mismanagement of funds and hate to take accountability of stolen funds.If all the levels of government are this bad, I don't see the legislators, judiciary and executives doing the right thing for the country, let the change start from individual, when everyone is ready for the right path, everything will fall under good path.When we address this issues, personal contributions and business will work, everyone will find a place to start something and help the country, the country will flourish and husle go dy pay.",
