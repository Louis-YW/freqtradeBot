We appreciate your contributions and mindfulness and will take this majority vote as a decision. All pools are therefore required to implement measurements to limit their hash-rate share to a maximum of 40.00% of the overall network. Albeit pool operators are free to decide on how to enforce this requirement, we also have prepared code snippets which can be used for simplicity. The planned network upgrade on July 27th, 13:00 UTC is an optimal deadline for these measurements to be implemented. Healthy hash-rate distribution is a core requirement for any successful blockchain, we would like to thank everyone for being supportive and understanding.\"https://t.me/dynextg/46388",
