      "body": "With all due respect to us as humans, I personally think that machines are more reliable than us. This is because machines do exactly what they are programmed for. Unlike humans that have emotions, we might change our minds from instructions that is given to us. Machines can only refuse instructions due to human errors.",

Machines should surpass humans at tasks like number crunching, following instructions with all corner cases covered, etc. I believe humans do better at exceptional cases, handling emotions, and handling emergencies addressing the exact cause in the best possible way rather than going through a defined route which will not guarantee the best timing or unique solutions.",

      "body": "Well since computers themselves require a human to function, I really do not think that the human population is ready for this. Nor I think we will even see a government system to allow the takeover of humans. There are so many risks that this can take over the world. Just imagine this example from a show that I recently watched where a robot delivery was making its rounds. It was backing up and it did not see that there was a human standing behind it. As the robot driver backed up, the human was smothered to a wall, just to move along and move forward with the rest of the deliveries. That robot was in machine mode, and it did not even bother to stop and seek medical attention for the human being. There is still perfection and only time can make machines more reliable than humans.",

      "body": "Machines and humans both have their strengths and weaknesses, and it's difficult to say definitively whether one is more reliable than the other. Machines can be more reliable than humans in some ways, such as when it comes to performing repetitive or complex calculations, executing precise physical movements, or working in environments that are dangerous or inaccessible to humans. Machines can also work without rest or breaks, which can make them more efficient and productive in certain contexts.However, there are also many tasks and situations where humans are more reliable than machines. For example, humans are better at tasks that require creativity, critical thinking, empathy, and emotional intelligence, such as writing, designing, teaching, and providing healthcare. Humans are also better at adapting to new situations and handling unexpected events, which can be challenging for machines.Ultimately, the reliability of machines and humans depends on the specific task and the context in which it is being performed. In some cases, machines may be more reliable than humans, while in other cases, humans may be more reliable. It's important to carefully consider the strengths and limitations of both machines and humans when deciding which to use for a particular task.",

However, humans possess intuition, creativity, and contextual understanding, making them more reliable in complex, ambiguous, or subjective situations where judgment and decision-making are crucial. Don't think machines can replace humans but can be a good fit to work together.",

On a delegate job delivery machines are more reliable than humans because they operates diplomatically according to the programmers command. Machine is said to function in a more prolong period of time than humans. It has a tireless functioning capacity than humans and it has the ability to deliver an excellent job with less risk or errorsÂ  and excuses as long it as it was excellently programmed.But humans are likely fluctuating with excuses and less stamina's to job delivery.",
