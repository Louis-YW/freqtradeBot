  "content": "Hi everyone,I'm a full time experienced FA/TA financial analysis and trader (Scalper/day trader and swing trader) and now I am looking for a crypto trading job.I have no access to any funding resources like loans, debts etc. so I have decided to take my chance to find a trading partner here.I had launched my CEX platform in EU on 2016 whereas I had no any financial backer so I had to close my CEX exchange company in a golden time. Anyway let's introduce my skills.What skills do I have?I have a good enough knowledge about:1. Completely know the crypto/blockchain ecosystem since 2013. (Mined BTC(Avalon & Jupiter ASICs)/LTC/DOGE in 2013/2014/2015)1. Classic trading, indicators and patterns.2. Macroeconomic analysis. (PMI, CPI, GDP, Unemployment rate, Geopolitics situations, commodities, Â )3. Fundamental and Technical analysis.4. Risk management.5. Fund/asset management.6. Portfolio management.7. On-Chain analysis and metrics like SOPR, MVRV, NUPL, I/OFlows etc.and 8. I can find every dip and each top to open a safe long/short positions with good R:R.I completely control my emotions in every single trade in my life (after thousands liquidations), I can explode your trading portfolio with highest profits.I would like to working with trusted partner/s who has been experienced in Forex/commodity/stocks/crypto trading and making the payment Â on-time and daily.For your trust I would prefer to using subaccount on these exchanges Binance/ByBit with NO-access to withdraw function.If you think that this is something you would be interested in, then please do not hesitate to contact me on Telegram via my handle:@iamnode69Cheers, ðŸ¥‚",

This story won't be easy to believe because if you claim so then you show prove of profit you have made, not only few profit but consistent trading achievement that will convince traders. Your store of knowledge should be able to transform you. I won't advise you to get a loan because you may lose it and become indebt. You can save some money and trade for yourself so if you lose it you won't have anybody on you for repayment of funds.",

In my honest opinion i do not see this as a viable/sustainable source of income for you. if it's were possible i advise you trying out your energy into seeking ways to get your own money rather than looking for another person's to use. Since you claim to be a professional trader you can show results to the extent that people would want to offer you the money to trade for them. It is not enough highlighting your own skills, you may just be hyping. It makes more sense when someone offers you their moneyÂ  on their own to trade for them rather than you seeking for someone to give you money to trade for them.",

The max level for stocks is 3x and with options your leverage is even higher. However for certain small cap stocks there is no leverage or just 2x.Crypto however has leverage up to 125x. You can just borrow $100 from someone and if you know what you are doing you can easily turn that into 4-5 figures within a few weeks.

I got liquidated so many times in past years, so I did my back test a long time ago.- I cannot applying on a trading firm because I don't have any certificate like CFA (I'll do it asap).- I'm actualy using leverage in all of my trade.- Technically, I can turn $200 to $100k but it will take a lot of energy and also a long time to do it. It's not easy as y'all know. I have so many expenses in my life and I have to pay all of them in a short period of time.- It's sheer lunacy to using 100x leverage with all due respect.- @sheenshane I'm here to build a mutual trust with a long-term relationships. I'd trust my partner. It will take 5-6 trades to trust each other.- There is NOT even one financial loans around me. They are going to pay loans to wealthy people, not to any skilled people, so I had to borrow a little funds from my friends.FYI I combining Ichimoku, PA, VPVR, RSI for any trades which it doesn't matter doing scalp or day trading or swing and using on-chain metrics for any type of coins (#BTC, ADA, ETH, ICP or DeFi, NFT etc.).Market sentiment is the most important factor to me to find the right way.IMO, we've facing big situation since 2008 so It's normal we are in a bear market in a mid-term period cause of inflation rates after covid-19 and fear of recession which it's not confirmed and happening right now. Â (I believe that we always are in a crypto bull cycle, You get it when you zoom out the chart) so who are the fighters? they are #BTC, #DXY, #US10Y, #CrudeOil. So these are my index's and I'll do trade given that macroeconomic situations.I'll trying to learn every day from you all and I'm not kicking my heels and doing my best.
