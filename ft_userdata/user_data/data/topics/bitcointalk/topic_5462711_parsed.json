They might be fooled into believing the DMs since the account is verified and is probably a public figure. This happens all the time on Twitter and YouTube.Maybe you could team up with other people to report the account so that it gets taken down or temporarily blocked until the owner recovers it.",

      "body": "One place these scammers make mistakes is in the aspect that they hack people's accounts and use a verified account with a huge number of followers to DM a person, which ordinarily, with the way all these social media celebrities behave, they will hardly DM you over an offer, so sending a DM first is sometimes a red flag. And secondly, hacking the account of someone who has nothing to do with Crypto all of a sudden because they started promoting or advertising some fake airdrops in order to scam the original account owners is also another way to easily identify a hack account and change of ownership. With the rate and manner in which influencer accounts are being hacked on a daily basis, it should at least enlighten people to not believe whatever is being posted by their favorite celebrity without doing a little background research. I was just wondering if the OP has not been familiar with a similar method of scam here in this forum; we could have been talking about another scam victim here.",

The most logical question is, if he already has strategies to earn between $10K-$15K per day for free, why would he need $300 for the course from his followers then it would be better for him to keep those strategies that the course contains to himself. What I saw from his account is that he posted pictures of luxury cars, thousands of dollars, luxury watches.. etc. and it seems that he is using his wealth to entice followers. I do not have conclusive evidence of his accusation, so I advise anyone who feels suspicious about the famous accounts he follows not to deal with them in financial matters or open any links that they send him via DM.[1] https://www.instagram.com/p/CvtAR8CL20T/ | Archived",

People who does this kind of tactic wants to isolate their victims as much as possible so no one can call out the red flags in case someone sees them and the victim doesn't. This kind of tactic is most prominent among online sellers who are trying to sell their products at an overpriced rate. As @albon has mentioned, provide some proof like Chat logs to make your scam accusation more credible.",
