  "content": "Hi to all. I decided to create a token meme in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto, no programming skills, no investment, absolutely free, it will be called \"Satoshi Nakamoto\", I was inspired by the story of the Shiba-Inu token. I wish there was a meme token like this and it became popular in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto and everyone had it. I decided to create a token based on \"Polygon\", there are cheap commissions and I can create a token for free. I currently have a telegram group t.me/satoshi_talk that I want to get at least 5000 i want to attract at least 5000 users, after that I will create a token and distribute part of it to the community, the other part, if successful, I will send it to the liquidity pool, if someone is ready to buy tokens, then I will send the received amount to the pool, this is necessary for so that the token is not an empty place, but has a certain value. I don't know what to do, where to move next, so that the project does not stand still, maybe you have ideas???",

I mean how can someone invest on your project when it simply is a meme coin and you will be using Satoshi's name?So for sure you will get a lot of heat from the community about it. Maybe you can have some \"investors\", but they might used it for pump and dump purposes.Anyhow, I can't stop you, so best of luck to your project.",

It must have some back up utilities and used case that everyone can use in the crypto industry. Unlike Shiba Inu, it came from a meme coin to a utility token that has lots of features like DeFi, NFT, metaverse in the platform that makes it top of the competition to all meme token projects.Well, it all started with a simple meme coin, shiba is successfully developing, yeah. I think it will be possible to do something similar with my token as well",

To be honest i prefer to see utility token rather than a new token that being claimed as a honour to the satoshi nakamoto but yeah you hope that it will become another shiba but you shall remember that if it needs elon to make it happen. by the way, I don't know if a simple token meme in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto will be popular. we will soon find out if it will be useful",
