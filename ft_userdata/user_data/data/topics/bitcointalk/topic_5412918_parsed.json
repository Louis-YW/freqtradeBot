  "content": "Hi, I have a significant problem with the Electrum wallet. I have created lots of bitcoin addresses and sent them to my customers. Important: when I created the addresses, I received a message saying that I have many unused addresses and that if I wish to continue, I'll need to upload the address manually. I ignored that message and I continued to create more addresses. In the meantime, my old PC crashed ( can't work with him anymore...). I have a new PC and I restore my Electrum wallet from Seed. I see only a few addresses. My significant problem is that few customers send me payments and I can't upload them. I can see them on Blockchain, But I can't get the coins. I have spent days trying to change my wallet network and load the transaction from the Blockchain. As you might guess, I got nothing. Please assist ASAP.",

      "body": "Sounds like you've simply exceeded the gap limit. Open your Electrum wallet, and click on the console tab (you might need to click on View -> Show Console first). Then paste the following:Code:for i in range(0, 100): wallet.create_new_address(False)If the addresses still don't show up, then repeat the command a few times, or increase the 100 to a higher number. Note, don't generate tens of thousands of addresses or you will crash your wallet.",
