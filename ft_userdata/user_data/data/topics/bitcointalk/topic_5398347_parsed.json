Never click on the phishing links they sent you in the email and never put private key or wallet seed words on these sites. Do not download any wallet applications on your phone except through the official sites, as there are many fake applications on Google Play and on the fake sites. Please be careful",

      "body": "If it is a decentralized wallet then there's no need for KYC before you can use their wallet. If you are not sure about the domain then better stay away from that site as it could be a scam site pretending to be the real site you just visited. I also receive an email regarding TrustWallet but to be honest, I don't have any problemsw with Trustawallet so that's why I know it's a scam attempt to get my funds out of my wallet.",
