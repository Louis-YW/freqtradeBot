The last hash in the chain is: afa3dfc17cc60a23b7aaa3daa9023f62097dc857733dbddf1d6ed6916cb19a99The formula for generating the game result:Code:const slides = [...];const gameHash = hashChain.pop()const hmac = createHmac('sha256', gameHash);// blockHash is the hash of bitcoin block 745,480hmac.update(blockHash);const hex = hmac.digest('hex').substr(0, 13);const num = parseInt(hex, 16) / Math.pow(2, 52);const int = Math.floor(num * slides.length);const result = slides[ random ];blockHash used is Bitcoin block 745,480 which has not been mined at time of posting. We are using the hash of a future bitcoin block as a client seed so players can be certain that we did not pick one in the house’s favor. I’d appreciate it if someone could quote this post so this is all set in stone.",
