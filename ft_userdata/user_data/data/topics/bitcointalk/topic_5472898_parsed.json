(Who would write about responsible drinking on a page for alcoholics?) At least you came so real trying to solve a problem that's not solvable, not like other platforms that claim that everything that has to do with gambling is bad and as such people should stay away from it. I guess there was one such topic here in the gambling section, if I can remember correctly. I have not checked your site yet, but I will do so one of these days to see the details myself, so I can recommend it to anyone who needs to get off the addiction page. In everything that has an advantage, there is always a disadvantage. One can always choose to be on the positive side and continue to gamble responsibly, which will also contribute to his mental growth. Those who choose to turn their gambling life into a hobby instead of doing it for fun are chasing after big wins, which leads them right into getting addicted. Those kinds of people are the reason why most people see gambling as a bad influence.",

It is better to stop than to continue to be addicted.Too much of everything is bad, but being in control of whatever you are doing keeps you on the right track, and no one will criticise you for that. Unless those who have already made up their minds see such activity as bad, there is no point in stopping gambling. If you can learn how to come out of the addiction page, then there is no problem with continuing to gamble. That's only if you are sure you can't go back there. The main reason why people are advised to leave whatever they get addicted to entirely is because there is no guarantee that, at the end of the day, they won't get addicted again.",

The people who are addicted to gambling, I am sure their family and friends must have asked to stop the gambling frequency.

So how come a text website will be able to help get rid of gambling addiction???Anyways the first thing, they ask you is to have a happiness test. Has anyone given that test?

To be fair to the donators though, it's important that any charity should have a transparent auditing of all the donations that goes through their organization so people will be more encouraged in donating to whatever cause they're trying to act upon.Quote from: Wapfika on November 05, 2023, 10:03:32 AMI hope that I will NOT use this someday but it’s really nice to have this kind of service available on gambling board of the forum since I’m almost become like this on my previous gambling activity.  I'll hope with you too that me and you won't have to use this to solve our gambling addiction but I think it's not a good thing for us to say that it's not for us, these kinds of organization are the kind that looks like you don't need but when you need them the most, you'll be looking for them.

This website is unable to make you quit, just like any mental health website is not capable of treating your mental illness. You need professional help from a psychologist to stop any kind of addiction; I don't think someone is capable of managing it on their own.
