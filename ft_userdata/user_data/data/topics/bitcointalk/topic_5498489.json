Because, I personally feel that most of the people fail and they will never share their story.Most of people lose money in the market as traders or investors and even successful investors do have times when they made mistakes, bad decisions, bad capital and risk management so that they got losses, even big losses.If you notice, actual successful and honest investors, through their speeches will sometimes share their painful lessons from their past losses. Because they can not be mediocre speakers and educators if they don't share their losses, lessons they learned with newbies who want to learn from them.If any successful investor only says about success, there is hidden fact the person does not want to say and it's hard to trust him or her words.Warren Buffett’s failures: 15 investing mistakes he regrets",

What is your opinion about this ?In my own estimation, I think that investors are more likely to share a story about a loss than about profits in bitcoin. Their stories of loss are everywhere on the internet - on blogs, forums, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms. And they do it for two reasons which may be intentional or not. They are, to garner sympathy from the public and secondly for it to serve as a example to new investors to carry out a thorough research and understand the market before they make any investment. I would say that for security reasons most investors unless the big ones are very hesitant to share their bitcoin success stories.",

Never get to carried away listening or reading about these stories, most of the time, it's the fault of the people that would read these stories that they fail miserably in what they want to achieve, they're already an adult that can think for themselves and they should know by now how life for each individual is going to be different no matter what and it's already a common sense that these stories serves as an inspiration and not the exact blueprint to a successful life.",

That’s what I learned from these stories at least. Just because you read them, doesn’t mean you will be like them and some if those rich people went broke later too so there is that. Meaning, everyone has a unique story even though they look alike at the first glance. In the end you should focus on what you are doing instead of having too much interest in what other people do. Otherwise you’ll lose your own way.People read books to learn from other people’s mistakes and experiences but only a few actually learn something unless they experience the same stuff themselves. Reading a story doesn’t affect their thinking in any way. Then obviously reading a book is a waste of time for these people. They can read lorem ipsum and they won’t notice a difference.",

What is your opinion about this ?No one is completely perfect; from the beginning of the crypto journey, no one knows if it will be as it is today. There were a lot of bad investment decisions back then, and a lot of people were also lucky. If you go online and check out anyone sharing their success stories about Bitcoin investment and do not add about how they failed on multiple occasions, then the person is not entirely to be trusted, and the information given out by him might all be fabricated.  If you read a lot of the success stories about investment and trading, if you read them very well from the beginning, you will notice that they first start by talking about their past mistakes and their determination. Knowing what they want is what keeps them pushing further until they arrive at the level that warrants them sharing their success stories.",

They should know that there really are risks involved and that they shouldn’t really believe in everything they see in social media or in the internet. We can’t prevent people from sharing their success stories and personally it gives me lots of hope too. But I also know it’s not all like that so I try to control the hope.",

What is your opinion about this ?We can derive inspiration from the success stories of others but we shouldn't assume that it was a smooth ride for all. Reading these success stories serves as a motivation for people to keep hodling regardless of the FUD that is spreading in the crypto space. However, anyone who assumes that everyone who invested in Bitcoin made a profit is either blinded by ignorance or greed. It is only a small percentage of investors made a fortune from Bitcoin. Many of them sold or lost their hodling before the price increased. New investors are advised not to focus only on the benefit of investing in the sector but they should also consider the risks involved.",

So, most of the stories that new guy searches , he will find only good success stories. But that is not correct overall picture. One should keep the limitations of crypto in mind as well. What is your opinion about this ?No doubt that Bitcoin investors have enough good stories to tell and testimonies to share. This is however not the oldest and older stories alone but also the most recent ones, yes, I mean the ones that happened in less than a year. This is because Bitcoin is the epitome of testimonies, it happens daily, except that it is not everybody who will be able to share such a testimony for many reasons whether is caused by Bitcoin or not. But, if you use the aggression of the oldest stories of Bitcoin investors to judge and hence invest with that mindset, you will be making a whole lot of mistakes because, the coin was very low in price at that time, so some people even made more than x73000 of their investment in it.The fact now is that can that happen again? This is the reality that anyone trying to invest in Bitcoin should take into consideration. The price of Bitcoin is high now, it takes wisdom and good speculative power to earn from it. People may still invest and gain money easily through it, but be sure that it can't earn you as multiple as you might have read online, no, that can only be in your dreams and imagination as Bitcoin may even find it difficult to move past $100,000 in this bullish cycle and I wonder what its fate would be in the bearish cycle coming.So no one should entrap themselves in the name of the success story of Bitcoin as the conditions are no longer the same, or else they will regret it.",

Those who overcome difficult challenges and hold on to the investment in the end, but those who do not understand anything related to investment, only invest and within a few days they get excited and sell the investment, but in this case, they have very little chance of achieving success.

For you to become successful you have to pass through many failures therefore we should not only be expecting good results when we invest in Bitcoin. Sometimes the market will fall and if you do not have patience you will be tempted to sell. Some investors did not keep their Bitcoin safe and they lost it so you have to be very protective of your Bitcoin so you do not lose them. We have to learn from all the stories that we heard as it will help us to become successful too. Listening to their success stories should motivate you to want to be like them and prepare you for the worst that you are going to encounter. To avoid losing you should do the things that are right by not storing your Bitcoin on exchange but buy a hardware wallet and keep all your Bitcoins in them.",

For those who regularly share their losses in the market, what they want is to give a warning to newbies rather than seek sympathy. Because most of us come to the market to make profits, not to seek sympathy or friends. The second type of investors are those who often share huge profits, talk about their philosophy of life and say they like to help others… often people without good intentions. These people want us to join their signal group, sell courses or entrust investments...So we should be more wary of these types of investors than type 1. You are right in thinking that big investors often do not like to appear in public, but not everyone chooses to stay silent and ignore the community. Many people still join social networks to share experiences and make market predictions because joining social networks like Facebook or X does not require them to reveal their identity to the community.",
