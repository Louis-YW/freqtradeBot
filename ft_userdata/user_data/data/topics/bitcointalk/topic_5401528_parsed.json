  "content": "China seems to be quite serious about taking Taiwan back completely. The US has promised protection for Taiwan. The US has made a serious mistake in promising this protection, so here is what the US is doing to fix the mistake.Besides China being a world power, the US does a lot of trade with both, China and Taiwan. Protecting Taiwan from China jeopardizes US trade relations with China, in addition to potentially making China an active enemy.Enter Russia. Under top secret agreements with Russia, the US is supplying her with military equipment and funds to start a war with China (if necessary), to take China's eyes off Taiwan. To make it look good, the US is sending the $billions in military aid to the Ukraine, as well as $billions in funding (that is not being accounted for). All Russia has to do is beat down the Ukraine military, and take the equipment and funds as a reward.Since this is the way the so-called war is being played out - Russia beating the Ukraine - and the media is spouting lies both in favor of Ukraine at times and Russia at other times, all eyes are taken off the fact that Russia is being supplied with $billions in aid, mostly in US military equipment that they capture.Since the US is weakening itself by doing this, I would warn all countries of the world to prepare for war. Why? Because nobody knows when the US or Russia will break their secret agreement about China. It could happen, because countries are breaking agreements all over the place. Russia just might use US war equipment against the US and conquer America.",

Russia considers Taiwan part of China and will not interfere in China's internal affairs. Russia's interest in the southeast direction is rather connected with Japan. Now Japan is under US protectorate, but US influence in Asia is noticeably weakening and it would be a great diplomatic achievement for Russia to take Japan under its protection. Because if Russia doesn't, in the foreseeable future, China will invade Japan and kill them all, in retaliation for the genocide that Japan perpetrated on China in the 20th century. I predict big geo-political shifts in this region over the next 5-10 years.",

      "body": "It's about how much the west would push China economically. The day (Taiwan+Russia+non-US allied business)>(Business with US and it's allies), China would invade Taiwan.And the response from the US and it's allies would be same as it's in Ukraine. And Russia would be as indifferent in that conflict as China is now towards Russo-Ukraine war.",

      "body": "Seems like a lot of people don't get what I was saying. The military might that the US is sending into the Ukraine is going to Russia as Russia gradually conquers. Any body who thinks that US leaders don't know this has to be pretty slow on the uptake.So, why is the US giving its military wealth away to Russia? I suggest it is being done under secret agreement, that Russia will use much of it to antagonize China if China decides to attack Taiwan. This will take the Chinese focus off Taiwan.The fact that the Ukraine is the method through which the transfers are made - Russia conquers more and more of the Ukraine on a regular basis, just to get the US armament that Ukraine has been given - is a ploy to hide the secret agreement from the eyes of the world... and particularly China.Why doesn't the US simply threaten China directly rather than going through Russia? To many trade agreements with both China and Taiwan. Using Russia to protect Taiwan from China lets the US have its cake and eat it too.",

Taiwan imposed sanctions on the supply to Russia, Russia restricted the export of inert gases, the Chinese Foreign Ministry recently made a statement that \"Taiwan's attempts to create problems for Moscow are doomed to failure.\" From Russia's point of view, this is China's internal affair, so China will have to decide the Taiwan issue on its own, with Russia's tacit support and consent.",

You're suggesting that Putin works for Biden, and that Putin is willing to plunge his country into poverty and sanctions, make himself an international pariah, humiliate himself by failing to take Ukraine, sacrifice huge numbers of soldiers and military equipment, and start a war with the one country that can stand with Russia in opposing the US... in exchange for what? Military equipment and funds that can only ever partly offset the huge loss of military equipment and funds that he's suffered due to the invasion? Seems implausible.",

Seems implausible.If you ever had a job, you would realize that you aren't working for your employer... unless you love him, of course. Rather, you are working for yourself. If the job dried up, you would go out and find another one. You are working for yourself and your pay.None of us knows the number of deals that government officials make, or who they make them with, just to earn big bucks for themselves and their country. With your inadequate little pieces of knowledge about what is going on, a good deal might seem like a foolish mistake to you.",
