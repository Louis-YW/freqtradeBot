  "content": "Gareth Southgate is set to stick with the 4-3-3 formation that served him well in the group stages.Gareth Southgate plans to remain with the 4-3-3 shape that worked effectively for England's last Group B match against Wales, in which Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford scored, but is expected to start bukayo saka against Senegal in the round of 16. Rashford faced an all-out World Cup absence in September after being left off of England's 28-man Nations League roster. The 25-year-old has been passed over since November 2021 after failing for form at club level, even though he was already a doubt due to what he characterized as a \"untimely injury.\" But just now, nothing could be more different. Rashford is now making an impression for his country on the grandest platform after excelling under new Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag this season. His spectacular free-kick against Wales, which was also his first of the World Cup, showed off his special talent for set-pieces. His efficient pushing assisted England in doubling their advantage moments later, and his directness and tenacity made it 3-0 to ensure victory.After this performance, the England manager has a simple decision to make. Rashford deserves to start against Senegal on Sunday.",
