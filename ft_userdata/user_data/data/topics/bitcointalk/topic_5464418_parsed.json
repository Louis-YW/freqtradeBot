  "content": "Hey! Brothers from another country and another parents. I will like you to help me out from the above topic phrase. My elder brother has this wallet \"PLCUC WALLET\" with coins inside and he  doesn't know how to transfer the coins to an exchange and sell it so he showed me to help him. But ironically I have not seen such wallet before, so I was trying to use my wallet knowledge to transfer the coins but I could not. The coins were in the PLCUC balance in the above image and there was a description says that, transfer coins to main wallet so I clicked on the transfer button and the coins were moved from the balance to minting which you can see it from the image below.The total amount received was 0.00166667 and when I tried to help him to transfer the coins, the coins enter the minting side of the wallet and the amount was reduced, and as it is, I can not do anything again, in fact, I am not seeing the coins again, but can only sight them, in the minting balance and not the main balance and I can't do any thing. So please if you have any idea direct me to move the coins from the minting balance to exchange.",

      "body": "I would say don’t bother yourself on this because even those centralized exchanges that list everything have not even listed this shitcoin, the coin is only on LBank and Coinsbit. And according to coinmarketcap the price is $46 dollar which if you look at the number of this coin you have it is not worth the hassle. Moreover I see this wallet as those wallet created during testnets for certain tokens, and frankly speaking it is very hard to withdraw anything from this kind of wallets. It was just a way to lure people into this shitcoins has many of have tried to do the same thing in the past. Sooner or later your brother will be ask to buy more of this shitcoin for him to able to withdraw so I will advice ask him to stay away",

      "body": "The comments above were right, dont waste your time on this wallet, this is a shitcoin that steals people's funds.  In an Apple app store, I don't see any good comment it was all about last year, so it might be already dead now. Search it on Reddit, you will find out how many statements there stating that it was a scam wallet.So move on to that wallet and forget it I think.",
