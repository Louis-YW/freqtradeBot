  "content": "As I started my bitcoin journey last month I observe say bitcoin knowledge is very backward in the country and bitcoin knowledge na wetin everybody go fit acquire in a simple way. According to wetin Satoshi Nakamoto talk bitcoin is for everyone and people who become part of the technology, and that's why I'm using p2p. I come dey wonder for naija way we so I no know for your area but for my area i no too dey hear bitcoin, the thing no dey popular for my area. Most people never hear the word bitcoin for their life self, so how we go do?Last time I wrote about a topic will Nigerians marketers accept bitcoin if legalize. I saw different comments say them go accept, but to accept bitcoin no be the problem, them get the knowledge about bitcoin? Because wetin person no know big pass am by far. People need to get a solid knowledge about bitcoin first before using it and how to secure their coins/wallet if possible make them get guide wey go guide them through because if bitcoin dey legalize for naija scammers go dey invent new methods every day just like the way scammers dey for fiat. In essence I wan talk say make we dey teach about bitcoin for our area because as bitcoin dey grow so countries go make bitcoin dey legalize as the world dey develop with different technology and Nigeria no go dey left behind, I believe say Nigeria go make bitcoin as their legal tender one day. So make we start to dey teach the knowledge about bitcoin so that the thing no go dey new for people ear.  students/children I have seen many threads on children education and I also want to contribute my view, one thing I observe about children them dey very sharp when it comes to learning especially learning about technology. I go like say make we start to dey teach the younger ones about cryptocurrency(bitcoin). Teaching them about the advantages and disadvantages about bitcoin, the risk involve and everything wey person suppose know about bitcoin. Some go say wetin concern small pikin and bitcoin, so as long as the pikin don know good or bad that pikin fit learn about bitcoin, so creating the awareness of bitcoin to our children is one of the best idea. Here are some threads about educating children about bitcoin: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5438924.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5432314.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5454984.160 business owners: I think if you're a business owner maybe you're into selling of goods, clothes or supermakert, is best if you accept bitcoin as your pay in return. By so doing you're creating the awareness of bitcoin to your customers for example a school principal accepting crypto (bitcoin) as a school fees payment, he also stated that he believe that one day digital money will gain more acceptance than paper money so he wants to be part of the technology now.https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigerian-secondary-school-will-accept-crypto-payments-despite-regulatory-uncertaintyLastly bloggers, if you dey into blogging, make your site dey talk about cryptocurrency(bitcoin), cause everyone makes use of the internet everyday.",

You only picked up topical sentence and discuss on it because other statements make up statement. And from my understanding to op. He is trying to say that, we should educate our students and children so dat they will also be aware of the technology. Op has stayed in the forum for one good month plus and that means if he is serious, he can teach his children and students. A serious learner can teach someone even in one day. And he is not even talking about himself but those who have known should teach to children. Look at di topical sentence here Quote from: Miles2006 on October 30, 2023, 08:58:28 PMso creating the awareness of bitcoin to our children is one of the best idea.  and as you can see I highlighted the Pronoun \"our\" meaning me and you and him. He has the confidence that he can orient them with the basic. So lolz you don't have to crucify him. I believed I started my bitcoin teaching when was still young in the forum. When I was a Full Member last year. Bitcoin Class in my Village High SchoolThis one I don entered Sr. Member Bitcoin Class in the Church (14TH August, 2022) all what I am trying to say dat if im go fit do am den no problem. But make im know di risk nd tell dem di risk too. Weti im tok na correct thing. Satoshi Nakamoto know say, Market people and awkers go get wahala if dem use centralized system and nai make im do as p2p so di thing for dey very easy for everyone. Op dey tried. No be every newbies can create threads like this. Keep it up.",

Some fit say, this one (Bitcoin) just gain prominence in 2008 while the use of fiat don dey over the years and to Dem dey reliable pass this digital currency. How you wan explain give the mama for village say instead of holding her money for wrapper or to hide am for tin, she fit keep am for wallet?

I thank the work of some of this company and crypto Community way day organize seminars and classes for people way no get idea to learn more. Na so ee suppose be more seminars need to day happen, I know say no be every part of niaja way get access to internet na there the fuck up come be cause at this technology era way we day so at least an average person suppose get phone way day browse, because without the internet even your knowledge self go waste.   Bitcoin education day very important, plenty things day way we need need about the space. Plenty opportunities way fit change person life day inside the crypto space. We way get access to internet no need dull from this one. No allow laziness and ignorance do make you sleep on am. We don already see watin bitcoin do few years ago before we enter this bear market, way some people day regret why them sell their coin before it last all time high. Na because say they no get knowledge about am and they no see the potential way he bring. Now those same people don come back again hoping say it go skyrocket again. If to say they get the idea that time nothing for make them sell at that time. You see why Bitcoin/cryptocurrency education day important, knowledge no day useless ee go always day useful some day.",

I think that bitcoin is like our way of life in that you learn something new every day and see new things. If a bitcoiner is really interested in bitcoin, he will constantly want to learn more. Teaching crypto is problematic when one lacks the necessary knowledge because one cannot impart what one does not possess. As a beginner, one must exercise extreme caution when dispensing information because some people pick things up quickly and find that sharing what they have learned is not that difficult.  Majority of people don't want to pay the price of learning that is were there problem is coming from.There are still things that might sound new but if a question is asked the best thing is if is something you have not heard before then very simple just do your research as simple has that. And the best is actually to learn more doh.I received a lot of questions when I conducted my own awareness campaign on a radio station, but the most of them came from parents, who were generally misinformed about bitcoin. It was an interactive portion that I really appreciated.",

I no get I understand your post bro and I know the angle you're coming from but I also know wetin I Dey talk. Na Nigeria we dey and we know how things dey be. One of my friend during my camp show us his account balance during argument and the guy was later attack on our POP day. Dem collect his phone and also force him to transfer the money which he no get option than to do. Na wetin I dey try talk be that. People believe say money dey bitcoin and when you begin talk about am dem go think say your wallet dey loaded. Na why I say you need to dey careful. And the truth be say majority of us here na single and even the ones wey don marry never get child wey don reach to learn bitcoin (15 years and above).CryptopreneurBrainboss, Igebotz, Charles-Tim, Mpamaegbu, Issa56, Upgrade00, Agbe and the rest wey be senior men for this our board, I no fit call of una but I wan draw una attention to how we dey drag, attack and shade each other for this board. It's alarming and if anything dey wey una go do to address am e go make sense. I believe all of us are here for survival and putting sand for another person garri no go make your own garri sweet. The last thing I go do for this forum na to attack person for wetin no concern me. Most of the thread here get case of attack in one form or another. E no necessary but I need to talk am because the thing dey pain.Our politicians don divide us outside the forum and I don't want us to be divided here. Abeg we need to coordinate ourselves and be a brothers keeper. Imagine one naija guy (the person go come across this post and he knows himself) wan the campaign manager to comot from the campaign. That's too bad bro. I don't know what you'll gain if dem remove me from the campaign. I no support crime, fraud or any other form of cheating but if you notice something unusual, why not pm the person and call his attention or for explanation?The truth be say if we continue dey go like this with all this attitude of attacking each other, Omo we fit no go far ooo.",

You know why, i they feel say the majority of people wey know about Bitcoin well well nah the youth and our leaders nah old men. If nah young boy they dat sit him for done legalize am tey tey. Normally blockchain nah new technology so only people wey understand how e they work and wey like the existence of technology and its revolution go fit support anything wey get to do with am.",

This article will provide information on what Bitcoin is, how it works, and how people in Nigeria can use it.For starters, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography to secure its transactions and control the creation of new units. It's not controlled by any central authority, which makes it different from traditional currencies like the Nigerian naira.Bitcoin can be bought, sold, and exchanged for other currencies and goods and services.One of the key benefits of Bitcoin for Nigerians is that it offers a way to bypass the often-unreliable banking system. Bitcoin transactions are processed through a peer-to-peer network, meaning that users can send and receive money without having to go through a bank or other financial institution. This can be especially useful for those who live in rural areas or who don't have access to traditional banking services.Another benefit of Bitcoin is that it's a hedge against inflation. The Nigerian naira has been subject to significant inflation in recent years, and Bitcoin can help to protect against this.",

Me sef wen i first enter dis forum as anewbie, and come gain small knowledge about bitcoin matter, I also start similar topic like you, i even go further to say we need to get bitcoin association for Nigeria, to help create awareness about am. As a matter of fact i begin to de preach about di benefits of bitcoin, how di currency take bi digital and de decentralized wey no get boundaries like fiat, say you fit trade and invest am and make plenty profits. But in di end over ninety percent of di people wey i passionately tell about bitcoin and cryptocurrency fall my hand, some liken am to ponzi schemes like MMM, new method of online scam, wetin government don ban, some just no send di talk, and others think say I don join yahoo. So after all dis experiences, i just relax, now if I see person wey i reason say im get genuine interest to learn about bitcoin, i go impact di small knowledge wey i don gather so far give am.Aldo i de sometimes see adverts wey de talk about blockchain, cryptocurrency seminars, i believe say na anoda way to take spread di  adoption of bitcoin.  Anoda wey na for our government to encourage di usage by endorsing and accepting bitcoin, dis one no go need to de tell person, everybody go just key in  for di adoption.",

But the thing be said,  as weak and unwise as the government through the central bank is,  with their stands against bitcoin it has made it easy for Bitcoin /crypto users in Nigeria to avoid tax on bitcoin and other cryptocurrency earnings. The fact is that the government of Nigeria lack the where weather to regulate decentralized currencies like bitcoin and that is why they tend to either pay a deaf ear to it or make a blanket ban on its easy excess through bank but decentralization gave birth to bit P2P,  which make the sell and buy of bitcoin and other digital assets easy.",

According to wetin Satoshi Nakamoto talk bitcoin is for everyone and people who become part of the technology, and that's why I'm using p2p. I come dey wonder for naija way we so I no know for your area but for my area i no too dey hear bitcoin, the thing no dey popular for my area. Most people never hear the word bitcoin for their life self, so how we go do?Last time I wrote about a topic will Nigerians marketers accept bitcoin if legalize. I saw different comments say them go accept, but to accept bitcoin no be the problem, them get the knowledge about bitcoin? Because wetin person no know big pass am by far. People need to get a solid knowledge about bitcoin first before using it and how to secure their coins/wallet if possible make them get guide wey go guide them through because if bitcoin dey legalize for naija scammers go dey invent new methods every day just like the way scammers dey for fiat. In essence I wan talk say make we dey teach about bitcoin for our area because as bitcoin dey grow so countries go make bitcoin dey legalize as the world dey develop with different technology and Nigeria no go dey left behind, I believe say Nigeria go make bitcoin as their legal tender one day. So make we start to dey teach the knowledge about bitcoin so that the thing no go dey new for people ear.  students/children I have seen many threads on children education and I also want to contribute my view, one thing I observe about children them dey very sharp when it comes to learning especially learning about technology. I go like say make we start to dey teach the younger ones about cryptocurrency(bitcoin). Teaching them about the advantages and disadvantages about bitcoin, the risk involve and everything wey person suppose know about bitcoin. Some go say wetin concern small pikin and bitcoin, so as long as the pikin don know good or bad that pikin fit learn about bitcoin, so creating the awareness of bitcoin to our children is one of the best idea.
