I then tried to calculate what BTC1,130.53 is worth today according to Bitcoin's current market price, and I am indeed overwhelmed.

Makes me kind of asking myself where I was and what was I doing at this time 13 years ago   How does this make you feel? This chart makes me feel nothing because i know it was impossible to know the potential of bitcoin at that point of time. I did not know about bitcoin in 2009 but even I did, i would not have wasted 1 dollar in money which had no value at that time. I am being honest here.No one is a fortune teller to know that bitcoin will be over 50K to 60K, If everyone knew this, wouldn't everyone have sold everything to buy bitcoins only in 2009?",

Mere looking at this image makes me realise how important it is having the right information at the right time, because you aren't the only one amazed by this, because i too, of which if only had we invested just this $1 back then which was very common, by today we will all be millionaires with the current pump in the price of Bitcoin. But however, it's basically not too late to still invest in Bitcoin, because in the next 13yrs from now so will people compare the price of Bitcoin and regret wishing they had invested this day when it's price skyrocket to $100,000 per BTC anytime soon.. So, its never too late to invest in Bitcoin",

But this is not really important imo.Bitcoin wasn't the same 13 y ago. You wouldn't be able to set up a wallet easily like today, it was problema hard to use. The solutions we know today, like electrum, seed phrase, etc are much younger than 2009. This was something for people very interested in cryptography and new technologies. What we can do now is to keep an eye open for new opportunities.  There is not going to be other bitcoin,  but there are other opportunities out there. We are in a tertrible bear market all over the world, plenty of opportunities and risks",

I do always have that feeling of regret and have the same questions on mind on how the heck i did miss this one? Considering that im always on computer shops into those times when im still in college.I was really just too that careless but well its not really that good on always looking back on the past.It would really just give out that kind of stress deep inside. If we were able to buy even just $1 price then seeing the price as of today then its really good to think and imagine on having that financial freedomthat we could have if we do able not to miss out those chances.",

Imagine if one point Bitcoin still dip at that low one day though. I would not really look into it, but I can imagine the opportunity I can get to get more than 1 BTC at that point, lol.Too bad my teenager years really hindered my learning to crypto.",

They will feel wowed that they missed the opportunity to know or invest in bitcoin then(2022).

Most of us that call ourselves a trader or investors are so scared of the market reaction that we are only interested in the present price or making few dollars because we sell our holdings. So investors can even sell their holdings after making few dollars from the market thinking that is the best way to trade the market. We need to have the habit of holding for a very long time before selling our holdings so that we can benefit in a long run.",

Nothing.Questions like this lead to FOMO, and that's not good. Previously, I often asked similar questions, considered lost profits, often used the phrase: WHAT IF I THEN ...... Only this makes no sense, all this reasoning after the fact makes me discouraged, so I never fill my head with reasoning about what would happen if I then ....etc.In general, it is not a fact that if most of us got acquainted with bitcoins at that time, they would have bought as much as possible and held until today. This understanding comes with time.The Nothing part of what you said got me a bit surprised though until I took my time to read down to the end. A lot of people have been ignorant about Bitcoin. Imagine people who would have turned a million dollar owner's that's quite painful if I should input my own opinion. The New Liberty Standard was the first to offer Bitcoin purchases. People were able to buy and sell Bitcoin through Paypal.https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xx6bv7/the_first_website_to_buy_bitcoin_went_online_13/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_buttonThis lead to a user sharing his pain of how ignorant he was after he blatantly refused and rejected the offer of becoming a millionaire in college, his buddy mined 2000 Bitcoin in 2010 and in the year 2013, he sold over 1000 of his staked Bitcoin and became a millionaire.But does the past matter now , yes it's good he now knows the benefits of that and must have started buying and stacking during the lows.",

Once upon a time when I was seeing things like this still, but now I see that the returns that were obtained the first few years we are not going to have them going forward, which is becoming clear in this cycle and in facts like even Saylor and others are giving much more moderate predictions for the future.I care more about owning Bitcoin because it is uncensurable, for example than thinking about what it was worth and what it became worth. Plus as has been discussed on the forum, almost everyone who bought at those levels, sold when it made x10 or x20 at best. Others as it was worth very little got careless and lost the private keys.
