You can do this offline, not make the Electrum wallet sychronize with the blockchain:If you are able to export the private key (child private key, not master private key), of the address you use for purchase, you can import it on Electrum, sign a message with the address on Electrum.After you have successfully done that and successfully make the purchase, you can delete the Electrum wallet.",
