If @Op is an affiliate and wants to spread his link to get new members who will join under him, he needs to be more active in discussing and maybe he can, at the same time, be a sales representative of the casino. He can work in the casino and get more payment than just spreading the affiliate link.But whatever it is, if he is really a sales representative of the casino, he should promote his site well in this forum because this forum has become a one-stop place to find the recommended casinos.",
