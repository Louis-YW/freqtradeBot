There are a total of 3 free states in Germany, and according to what I learned is, each of these three states has its own government and its own president, but it's not that they are independent of Germany's government but they are bound to it as they have a parliamentary democracy. So, should we say Germany was selling or dumping the market all this time or it was Saxony? I mean for me it's the same thing. But for news outlets seem to be very concerned about it, because people on X were saying different things about Gernmany's authorities that they have no sense, and blah blah while new outlets are making sure it was not Germany but one of its free states.

Is there a difference? It's like we were to say that it's not USA that sold but Alaska. Does Saxony have it's own army, does it have borders, do they elect their own president, or chancellor? If the answer is no, there's no need to differentiate. The real problem is someone in that independent state is manipulating the market by moving bitcoin to exchanges and back to spook investors instead of selling it since they apparently want to do that. Why not sell OTC if they had such offers and this would be more profitable to them? Or maybe the deal is that they want to lower the price because they have short positions open? The longer it takes before they actually sell their coins the more you can be sure it's a manipulation.",

We cannot expect bitcoin to be divided equally among everyone and avoid falling into the hands of corporations and governments because they will not stay out of this game. Michael J. Saylor, el salvador or the US government is also holding a lot of bitcoin, not just the German government. Additionally, without the participation of governments, corporations, and large funds, I don't think bitcoin can become bigger than just retail investors.",

The thing is if the news outlets have actually carried out the news that it was the Saxony that was selling it wouldn’t have generated the much needed attention that they wanted rather the news had to just stick to calling it the German’s propaganda. Most of the bitcoin whales tracking sites like ARKHAM had actually labeled the wallet where the sized 49,860 bitcoins (to be exact) where stored to be that of German and when a movement was happening from there it was easily reported as the Germans selling.

This has been on repeat for like the 25 days now that they have been selling, yesterday the $13k bitcoin was also been moved to exchange and then only 4,925 was returned back to the their wallets.

But I am glad that the selling is now over after there were news of Germany being done with the selling and that is also reflecting on the market as it is not dipping anymore for now as it was doing when the news came out and there was actual selling going on. What ever the Germany government wanted to achieve by selling when everything was looking very good for Bitcoin has failed as the market did not lose value that much.

If I'm not mistaken, it is similar to the USA, e.g. if Texas was selling BTC, would you say that it's not the USA because it's the state of Texas?This was what I was thinking too because you can say the country is selling instead of saying the state. The world will understand what you are trying to say when you call the country name. Or in a more simple terms you say the German government are selling which is still the same thing as saying Germany is selling. But I am glad that the selling is now over after there were news of Germany being done with the selling and that is also reflecting on the market as it is not dipping anymore for now as it was doing when the news came out and there was actual selling going on. What ever the Germany government wanted to achieve by selling when everything was looking very good for Bitcoin has failed as the market did not lose value that much. Bitcoin dripping is always expected after the market has gained some profit and that is what only just happening.I also agree with you both on this. Since the state is under the German government, whatever they do will also go back to the federal government, which means the public is still not wrong for saying that the German government has been dumping all their bitcoin holdings, even if the sales are just done by a single state.  The market is correcting gradually, but let us not be too sure if they have sold out all their holdings; they might just be laying on the exchange without being sold, but never the less, as long as the wallet is empty in public eyes, and we can all see that there is no more panic selling. I guess that news of them selling off is good for the market.",
