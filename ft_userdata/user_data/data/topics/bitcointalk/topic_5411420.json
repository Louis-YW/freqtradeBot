To put this in context, @SerhiyN3 account has been active for many months with only freebie claims (many many of these), just the one deposit made recently, and withdrawn similar amount to deposit (about $8). Unfortunately we do have many fake users who are just trying to use 8BET for freebies only, many of them making multiple accounts to try to make even more profits - and so the system has multiple safeguards and protections against these types. In good faith, we will ask the support team to clear this user's withdrawal despite the flags of multiple accounts, and their funds will be released. However we will respectfully ask this user @SerhiyN3 to no longer play at 8BET and will no longer be welcome to the regular freebies.",

The official forum representative has confirmed that to be the case but you haven't showed it in the thread. This image for example, https://postlmg.cc/627qFg9w, shows a balance of 84 Doge and the slider is not positioned all the way to the top. That means your latest account activity is missing and we can't see it. The casino hasn't provided any proof of their claims that you have multiple accounts, but since you are trying to withdraw $8 worth of crypto, I believe them more than I believe you. Abusing bonuses with multiple accounts is against the rules of all casinos and you are actually lucky you get to keep your money. If, of course, it's true and you are using multiple accounts. But that's not something you will admit anyway.",
