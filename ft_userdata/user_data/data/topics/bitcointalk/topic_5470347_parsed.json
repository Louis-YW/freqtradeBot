Same with exchanges, if you don't gamble you may miss the issues that started happening with your favorite exchange since it buried within all the other posts.Just a thought.

It would be good to have an individual sub forum for this. However, I would rather attach this sub-forum under the Gambling section. I guess that's where it would better suit as we see a lot of newbies post scam accusations on the gambling section.",

Even many have not presented relevant evidence, especially newbies who just came to present the problem and ask for help.Perhaps a more straightforward solution is to write on the subject of the topic for example [Casinos], [Exchange] etc... But even that would be too much, because hardly anyone even emphasizes [Solved], which is much more important because it directly affects someone's reputation.",

If it's not in the scam report format: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=260073.0 or something close to it the mod has the duty to delete it and tell the poster to try again. Kind of like messing up an assignment in school and having the teacher tell you to do it again.Might be a bit harsh, but it could clean up a lot.-Dave",

I agree that such kind of sub-board is needed in gambling board so that any casino that frauds with its customers will be reported at that board instead of scam accusation board. But, I think that it would be better to add that sub-board in scam accusations as that would be more suitable for such board. There have been many scam accusations against gambling sites and I believe that a sub-board dedicated to gambling scam accusations is highly needed. Most of the accusations are against the gambling sites because most of the frauds take place at gambling sites. We really have to think about such board and I'm pretty sure that such board will help so many users who get scammed by gambling sites. That way users will be able to find all gambling casinos scams easily by browsing that sub-board.",

I feel the way he/she was trying to emphasising the use of that AI based exchange which i don't think so much reliable in way he was trying to promote very hardly. The funniest thing i found there he was doing it with newbie account. At the end i would say your idea is quite Good.",

Possibly a separate board about gambling scam accusations under gambling and all the others in a generic scam board since it does look like 75%+ of the scam complaints are about casinos. Separating the gambling accusations from the rest of the scam accusations seems like a pretty good idea to me.  I was not around back when the board was first created, but looking at some of those old topics it definitely seems like it started off being a place for people to call out scams happening between members here on the forum.  But over time, especially once we got that whole Gambling section and tons of crypto casinos popped up everywhere it kinda shifted to be all about shady stuff those casinos are up to.  But not everybody here cares about gambling stuff.  So cleaning up the scam accusations board to just be for non-gambling scams could make things easier to follow for most folks.Plus it will keep things more focused instead of having accusations about like a million different things all jumbled together.",

Yeah that is the easier way for users to effectively finds those gambling site that are trusted although it can be regularly visit at that section than the accusations board where it is now, it will be easily accessible to gamblers and most at times there could be a highlight of the most reputable casino and gambling site.From my personal view, that is the only way people can be very mindful with those site, to me the sections where it's now seems to be hiding those site with their evil did but if it was moved to gambling section believe me no one would chose a bad casino to gamble knowing too well that they had a bad records over the years or months than creating additional subforum instead it should be added over while the scam accusations section can be for either users and some altcoin or loan defaulter although someone mentioned this above.",

Since the highest percentage of scam complaints are in casinos, there is a need to create a separate board for such complaints in the gambling section since most of the casino users are always active there. They can easily get the information quickly and take caution, as the case may be.But not all reputable members do visit the gambling section, and for good and quality judgment, these reputable members need to interfere in order to get a possible solution. I think if that is the case, then leaving all the scam complaints on the scam accusation board will be better, but there should be a separate subboard for each, just as you explain in the Op.Quote from: DaveF on October 14, 2023, 05:05:07 PMInstead of just Scam Accusations should there be:Scam Accusations  -> ExchangesSame with exchanges, if you don't gamble you may miss the issues that started happening with your favorite exchange since it buried within all the other posts.I think that of exchange has became more easier since we have users that are very active in the Exchanges sub board in the service discussion board.
