This is a greater achievement than if it were used on a daily basis as was the initial purpose. It will not dethrone the Dollar or other state-controlled currencies. But it is clear that it is the best option in the next digital world where we will all live.",

This is very reasonable because the calculation of the value of the assets owned is much larger even though it is only 3 -10%. Based on the survey conducted, it appears that the level of interest of large investors such as the rich realize that in cryptocurrency anything can happen and I believe the assets they allocate are among the successful crypto projects this year. maybe",

Billionaires are billionaires for a reason. They know how hedge against any upcoming risk. So it's no wonder that they have chosen cryptocurrency as an asset in their portfolio. I strongly believe that the number will be increasing only because cryptocurrency has the capability to provide extraordinary return compared to any other asset class. We have seen that twice already and you don't need to be a genius to guess that such time will come again when bitcoin will outperform all other assets. It's all about mindset. Common people goes by FOMO while ultra rich people buy based on potential and past records. cryptocurrency is an excellent option here!",

There is room to grow and develop, big capital and funds have started to turn their attention since 2020 and this attention is constantly growing. Also some large funds, which are known in traditional markets, are starting to look towards offering their clients to invest in cryptocurrencies.

The only thing I can't say is that people don't invest in crypto for lack of opportunity, because I've never seen before a highly profitable investment disponible for everyone, with very few exceptions, like cryptocurrency.",
