  "content": "Greetings,can somebody give me information about linbtc.com platform. Is it a legit platform for trading? I received an amount there via a \"Secure deal\" in the platform it says I have the amount in my wallet, but when I check the wallet in the blockchain explorer the amount holding is 0. Also when I try to transfer the amount outside the platform it asks me to make a payment of 0.125 BTC to \"verify\" my wallet there.All information will be much appreciated!Thank you in advance",

I would recommend that you do your own research and due diligence before using any online platform for trading or investing. It is also a good idea to be cautious of any offers or deals that seem too good to be true, as they may be scams designed to steal your money or personal information. Additionally, be sure to only use reputable and well-known platforms.",
