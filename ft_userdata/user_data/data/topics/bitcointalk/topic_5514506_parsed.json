Actually, the majority of their Bitcoin has come through mining. Bhutan's renewable energy sources, such as hydro, have been used to power mining that has been ramping up based on partnerships with companies like Bitdeer. So, their approach is more about producing Bitcoin themselves rather than buying a lot.https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/09/from-mountains-to-mining-bhutans-780m-bitcoin-portfolioWhile about Germany selling their Bitcoin, it mostly about their concerns about Bitcoin volatility and act of risk management seeing how the world economy lately and less likely have anything to do with their focus on automobiles. Germany has traditionally been conservative about cryptocurrency, which now is in contrast to this bold move by Bhutan to mine Bitcoin using green energy.",

But actually, that was just the total value of their mined bitcoin, which keeps changing due to bitcoin's price volatility. If he had watched the video in OP's link, he might understand it better.",

I am sure Bhutan is bullish about Bitcoin and since they have abundant hydro energy available, they are putting that to a good use to boost their economy.

Today, where many of the big countries do not dare to invest in Bitcoin, countries like Bhutan have certainly led the whole world in investing in Bitcoin. But I see relatively small countries investing in Bitcoin first. A holder has the right to sell his assets at any time as per his wish. I think the decision that Germany took is up to them, but almost everyone now realizes that they took a wrong decision.Many changes happen because of a decision and fall also happens by the decision. Today, while the world is singing the praises of Bitcoin, Bitcoin is loved by many, while many may also revile it. Today the United Arab Emirates has legalized Bitcoin in its country El Salvador has officially approved all things in cryptocurrency so that citizens of that country can get a better idea of ​​Bitcoin. Recently Such initiative of Bhutan must be followed by other countries of the world.",
