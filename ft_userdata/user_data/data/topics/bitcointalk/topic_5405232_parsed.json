At the trough of volume levels, WazirX, CoinDCX, and Zebpay took in a combined $21,649 per day.The tax will be in effect for three months as a test to determine the impact it has on the market. While trading volumes are low now, policymakers want to see its results for a longer timeframe.Only gift cards used to obtain goods or get a discount, mileage points, reward points, and loyalty incentives without monetary considerations, and subscriptions to websites, platforms, or applications are exempt from the tax.(Source: Cointelegraph)",

      "body": "Exorbitant taxes will only encourage HODLING coins, avoiding transactions, and trying to circumvent the system. Therefore, I do not think that traders will be highly motivated, but the societal adoption of using services to buy and sell products will be killed.Also, peer-to-peer trading will decline significantly.The confusing thing is, does the Indian government have plans or infrastructure to track crypto transactions, or will it rely on data from the platforms?",

Taxing the transactions and then the income on top of that is non-sense. Not even talking about the business (exchanges) that get ruined.",

Most people wanted to give crypto a try solely as an investment but removing 30% of your profits from it is frankly a lot. Indian crypto adoption has hit a massive roadblock and the resolution is unlikely to take place.",

Otherwise, DeFi and P2P are the only alternatives for many people, I think. the point you have mentioned about regulators and that regulators have to find the balance so many people won't be deterred to trade cryptocurrencies. Is a valid point. But that too is true that you have to make your decision if you really have to be successful in the money matter. Better work in silence let the success make some noise.What you mean by work in silence? Hide the earnings or just keep earning and pay all to the government as taxes and go into the debt!About the topic, yes the trading activities on exchange seemed reduced a lot and even I saw few threads about wazirx exchange is closing their activity which is basically owned by binance the leader of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges then there is serious problem in their tax policy which had to be sorted ASAP or the black market will evolve and government lose all the revenue.",

Now I don't understand why the Indian government suddenly took such a decision. Since traders will not trade with such additional tax, they have to think about how to evade trading tax. If it is possible that by enabling vpn traders can avoid such tax system then I would say traders should enable vpn and then conduct their own trading activities.",

I have come to realise that the only way to get going in the cryptocurrency industry by the government is to handle or regulate cryptocurrency as it concerns your country and not necessarily adopting what other countries do.
