      "body": "With forum captcha code, you can change it after a few months. The same like you are required to change password of your account on some platforms. The forum does not force you to change and get a new captcha code. It is personal choice but it is not harmful to change yours after a few months.Without captcha code, you can log in your account but will need more time to enter captcha. Sometimes you succeed, sometimes you fail. It is annoying too but make sure if you use captcha code, you must keep it safe like how you keep your exchange account password, 2-factor authentication activation code safely.",

From what I can tell, the subject technology is only available to users with certain devices, so some people would not be able to use this technology if it were implemented on the forum.",
