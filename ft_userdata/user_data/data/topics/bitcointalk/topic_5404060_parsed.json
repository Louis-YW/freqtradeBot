(to some extend) You do not do the \"real\" transfer but you exchange the invoice which is \"paid\" one day, when the channel is closed.Like people in bar order drinks, bartender makes the list and at the end of party each one pays his part.",

      "body": "I don't think that's going to work. It's not just about the frequency of transaction. You have to understand about the average block confirmation time of 10 minutes (it could be faster or slower than that at times) and the mining difficulty adjustment which happens every 2016 blocks.If you happen to experience a fast confirmation time (under 10 minutes), you can expect that the mining difficulty will be increased in the next blocks. That means longer confirmation time.",

If only the LN channels and small proportions of internal services (perhaps exchanges and anything else which needs to move around funds) are the main transaction-broadcasters on the network, the mempool congestion problems would be largely solved.The thing is, this outcome is not expected to be reached for at least another decade.",

Lol.There's no point in being faster if that means you can't use it.",
