So what you want to buy will you send the payment to the person first or will you deposit the price before you send the payment for the item on Amazon?Maybe it's better to have an escrow so that both parties don't have doubts about each other because money is being discussed in this matter. It's also difficult because you first donate the item you want to a person you don't even know, and it's the same for you OP, it's also difficult to send immediately because you might think that the money you want will suddenly run out.",
