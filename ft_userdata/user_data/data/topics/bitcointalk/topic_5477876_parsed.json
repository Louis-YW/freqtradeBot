In a broader general sense; defi means decentralized finance. if you relate it to a token; it indicates freedom for everyone either young, or old or middle age to be able to mint/create a token. Thats decentralizationif you relate it to what a token has to do; then defi says that, everyone has the freedom, choice and the opportunity to freely issue a token and peg an utility to the token contract. Either token creation, token contract utility, token launch, token sales, and even trading of tokens; they are all related to defi. So if you specify even further more what you want to know about in DEFI; You will get more help and explanations definitely.Ball is in your court.",

Well to simply explain defi is like gauging the ability of a platform to incur rewards and interest like whats banks doing. Lend, borrow, repay, interest. Its simply a non decentralized approach with higher apy or percentage compared to bank in an anonymity state. Like you manage it on your own and no one will do it for you. No strings attach process to gain more profits.",

And whether you use some CEX like Binance, HTX, OKX,... and obviously your assets in those exchanges are held by that service and you are only viewing your assets on the service, and when a problem occurs, you absolutely do not have too much initiative. And in contrast to DEX, the asset is managed by you, and how you like to use it is your way.That's just a basic example of Defi products at work in the space, and while not entirely beneficial, it certainly provides a clearer view of freedom and fairnes.",

Unfortunately, the transparency doesn't take back the power of governments as we can observe seizures ranging from stablecoin freezes.
