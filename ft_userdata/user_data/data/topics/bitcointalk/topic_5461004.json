  "content": "It has already been discussed here on the forum, about privacy when buying/selling products with bitcoin. Many raise the issue that when paying for a product in BTC and giving delivery data, the person is exposed and loses their privacy. In a way I understand that, but over time, I've been trying to think of ideas to minimize this issue. And this is one more...The idea would be a smart contract, where the buyer chose and paid for the product. After this procedure, the seller only received the purchase order, not knowing the transaction involved in that purchase. And in the case here of the forum, not even which user was.Ok, the idea that person X has bitcoin will always be in the air, even if this is not true. But, for that, it is enough for the smart contract to be prepared to receive several types of coins and even fiat. Thus, the buyer never knew which payment method was used by that customer, becoming a normal purchase in any common online store.Do I think this idea made sense?I opened this topic here, because I was in doubt where it would be better. If any moderators find it appropriate to move to another board, I appreciate it.",

And this is one more...I don't think the user is exposed when paying.Professional payment processors make 1 address per customer, so the seller has its privacy.On the other hand, the customer will just expose one or a few inputs (depending on how much he is spending).If the customer cares about his privacy, he should carefully choose which output to spend. For example, if you have your life savings in one input (such as 2 BTC, for example) you won't spend that when buying a $20 gift card. You should choose a small input.Also, if all your inputs are in the same address with your life savings, you should use a mixer and split them and smaller values to be able to use them separately.Edit: LetÂ´s remember that you are much more exposed when paying with credit cards. The seller receive all your personal data, document number, account number, etc...",

The best they can do is link up with a web3 wallet to pay directly with it, but a contract by itself would not work because it would be quite expensive to use.",

So the solution maybe available on L2 layer which enables to implement more complex smart contracts without compromising the network securities.",

Simply watch the particular contract at some point in time when a seller received their Purchase Order, depending on how it will be implemented, I think it will still fall to the problem that I stated. But this assumes it only uses bitcoin.Quote from: joker_josue on July 25, 2023, 12:59:43 PMOk, the idea that person X has bitcoin will always be in the air, even if this is not true.

I don't think the issue you raise is worth and urgent enough to be solved merely by this smart contract idea.",

And really this is not the best solution.Either way, I think it's good to make use of these ideas, as it allows us to analyze various scenarios and various probabilities. With this analysis, we can find a viable model.I think the biggest issue is actually communicating our address. This is the element that I still haven't been able to come up with - that at least makes sense to me, so as to resolve this point.",

And in the case here of the forum, not even which user was.The seller needs to receive the payment and if the buyer pays in BTC the seller will receive it in BTC typically.The seller will know that buyer A does not want to reveal their payment methods, meaning they will likely be using a different one from the regular fiat transactions. This will pique the interest of the seller if they had dishonest intentions and they now have the address of the buyer.Quote from: joker_josue on July 25, 2023, 12:59:43 PMThus, the buyer never knew which payment method was used by that customer, becoming a normal purchase in any common online store.The buyer will be sure that they did not use a centralized means of payment depending on what means they receive the final payment through.",

Most of them wouldÂ  that which could be paired with bitcoin).Hence, the merchant with malicious intentions could build his set up not to be choosy on a target and about the price range of products sold and in the event that, a buyer plays right into one, the damage would still be done.Don't know how much sense this makes but, my thoughts though.",

The more complicated a smart contract is, a bigger size it is and users will have to pay more transaction fees.I don't know Vitalik is smart when he included it in Ethereum smart contract because I saw it on my side like this. Developers have to balance between their codes and user acceptance to use their smart contracts for interactions. If they include so much into their smart contract code, users will have to bear much expensive fee which will be like barriers for acquiring new users for a platform.To deal with it, developers have to keep their smart contracts as simplest as possible and at the same time, still maintain its functionality for users. I am unsure when they use that approach, their smart contracts will still be smart or become more stupid and more vulnerable and easily exploited by hackers.",
