  "content": "My State of residence has been one of the most expensive cost of living states in the country (Nigeria).I am making this thread after been overwhelmed about how students are being frustrated over high cost of house rents.Imagine houses built between 2018-2023 where a single rooms rent is placed @ #130K which the rent fee is evaluated according to the nature of the economy and the cost of building materials which would be extremely expensive and houses built between 1990s-2017 charging its house same 1 single rooms at same rates at #130K even when the houses were build when the economy was kindly impressing comparing to today's.    I learnt about lot of students having the schools environment for their homes and the classroom desks for the mattresses simply because they can't afford even a single room for a rent.A lot of them are able to have that one single rented room (s) only if they are partnered (roommate) while some others are struggled before they can have their own private living rented apartments.We all knows the nature of single rooms and its inconveniences, how do we imagine such rented below #130k per year excluding sub fees and lavys. This has got a lot of people taking the streets and the bridges as mansions Worth living due to the inabilities to the hike cost of rent and has also sent lot of masses who lives in the cities and rural areas back to villages where most of them has lost hope to lives and carriers supposed to be encouraged when in the cities has been buried beneath the foots.This state of accomodations rent fees has left lots frustrated.Last night I was on some significant reasoning with my friend on how possible the government can put an end to this increasingly house rentage following the economical inflations on its basis.Solution opinion to the situation The government could play and help minimize this hiking rents issues simply my issuing mandatory orders on every landlords and give them a specific range of charges they are expected to rent their house and anyone violating the rules must be penalized and every landlords must issues rentage receipts to every of its tenants because the amount stated in the receipt would be used to justify any of the reported landlords if overcharging their house occupants and there should be an active functioning phone number that is to be reached and report any forms of the landlords.I think the cautioned of governments authorities to the landlords would help this nature of situations.",

Most student are willing to pay whatever amount they are being told to pay. These people see students are the richest and are the people they can easily extort money from. This is because of the percentage of student that are involve in scams are much greater. Students leave more lavish than family or non-student. I will not blame the landlord I blame the government because there is no regulation of government that are in charge of these kind of things. Also, I blame other person s who have the money to pay whatever the cost. Because their lavish attitude has affected other student that do not have enough. I could remember when I was in search of an apartment last year, the house agents said if I don't have that amount to pay that there are lot persons who will pay for it.",

For instance a house built in 1990s might have lost some of it's modern tastes. So the landlord in an effort to modernized some of the old things in the house has to buy some of the building materials at today's market price. For example a landlord decide to change the zinc of his house built in the 1990s to a new more fashionable ones will buy the zinc with the price it is selling the market. So when the renovation is done, he will bring the room to the price that a room is letting in that area currently. Also Landlords of those houses built in the 1990s are are charging same amount as those built today is because houses serves as a hedge against inflation. If they don't do this they can't be able to keep up with the maintenance of the building as cost of building materials keeps going high in the market.",

Na true sha, house rent fees no concern government, the issue is if government go help the economy I believe say difference go dey, but some buildings with low quality go still dey charge high fee for what, even if na modern building I for understand because the expenses to build house this season cost. The issue with high rent fees dey common for community wey school dey. For me this is pure wickedness and over smartness, because student dey the community na why house rent fee go increase. Even if they want profit not with this kind of high fee, if na matter of profit everyone wants profit, everyone wants to earn high but make the over smartness of earning no affect people wey no fit afford high standard of living",

People argue that since housing is a necessity for their people, the government should not be concerned about it and that private citizens should handle the problem instead. However, in cities like Abuja, one can observe a large number of empty houses as a result of the high cost of housing, which forces people to live where they can afford and in accordance with their income. Truly we know that the government has other issues but housing to is important, and their are other ways that the government can help improve the housing sector,  Although there are initiatives exploring various options for building materials to lower the cost of construction in the nation, no one is taking action. Because if we continue like this it will be more difficult for us to build because of the material.",

If the government plays a very crucial role in how things are being sold to people in the market, everything will be fine because, with the way things are going, it is no joke and is not helping the citizens at all. Imagine something you bought today; you may go back in the day or the next day they double or increase the money, which is all because of how things are going in the country.However, house renting is not that expensive in my state, but I have friends and family leaving in places where these things are expensive, especially in Abuja, where there are many empty houses. Just because of the price, the landlord wants to give out the apartments. Yes, I know every business welcomes a profit, but not the way some landlords behave. Some people will build houses this year and expect their money to be returned for the same or half of the amount they used to build them. That is why some of them put in a huge amount of money.",

It's not as if it's something they should ignore either. I understand how important it is too, because some people can't afford those rent dues, but the truth is that the government will not look in that direction now. Those men in power are people who I see as only (roughly 60%) doing things for their personal interests and not minding the turmoil that society is facing. If you ask me, I will say that they can't control the house rent issues now.",

The cost of building the same house is high and owners are not likely to breakeven on the investement in 30 years, so my conclusion is the purchasing capacity of Nigerians in low. Let everyone including students have abillity to work even just 5 hours daily and earn 50k in a month, it wont be difficult to pay the 130k at the end of the year.",

Government is supposed to have a functional price regulatory body(agency) that control the price and goods. This agency go around the towns and markets to investigate and control the prices of goods (especially the commodities that have fixed price), but unfortunately we're not seeing doing the job. Now is it house rent the same government can control? Remember house rents also depends on several factors, such as location, standard/quality etc.Meanwhile some of us are also part of the problem. A greedy landlord in collaboration with a greedy and selfish house agent will put outrageous amount as rent. While you're still complaining of the outrageous amount, you will see another person rushing to pay! I have to be specific. Here in PH if you don't earn good money, to rent the least comfortable self contained would be very difficult. I believe house agents are even a major problem.",
