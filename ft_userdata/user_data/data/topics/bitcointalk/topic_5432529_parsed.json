  "content": "Starting this thread, because i am losing the will!!Aware slightly repeating myself, but, in the vein hope of some helpful, simple answer....Blockchain ( i now see ) is not as easy as a 'wallet' to setup. It requires documents to be sent etc.So, shall i proceed?PLEASE ADVISE....As i see, just setting this up, asks me,  'do i want to buy' etc etc....i dont want any of that! All i ever want to do, is, simply get a blockchain address, give it to this blasted casino, withdraw my few hundred euro winnings into it.  Thats it.I do not want to have to upload any of my own money into it etc....i literally, just want to withdraw winnings and then 'try' and change that into cash ( thats for another thread ).That's it.  SO - shall i proceed with Blockchain?  ( it does..make..sense..with what casino was saying earlier - in another thread - about needing my 'public' account number etc..whereas i was giving them my Wasabi details ..so in a way..i was told incorrectly on this forum...or...well..i..being new...asked totally the wrong questions...If some kind soul could please just answer me that. Blockchain, ok for me to proceed? wont cost me anything ? best case i get my winnings? worse case, i spent a bit of time sending some documents to setup the  blockchain.  (or does it open up a can of worms? )",

Midnight Wins, same setup each time. Behind scenes havent a clue, but have rarely got back tiny winnings, but lost more.Ive tried the Wasbie....but upshot is,  they said, blockchain.SO, thats my question, i need to give Blockchain a go.So, OMEGASTARSREAM, in your opinion, is it ok then, i just plum ahead, look into this blockchain/ idenity or not..i just click on the site there to see overall view of it...   You mentioned 'convert back to 'fiat'  Whats 'FIAT'?   If that is, cash...then..yes, ideally, i dont want bitcoin, i want my cash winnings, just casino wont give it too me..hence trying this route they recommend. I will wait for a few more replies, hopefully, sorry for annoying the forum..but its on my mind..and i want my cash!!!! more a principal now to be honest disgusted with the casino messing me about.",

It might be more effective to focus on one topic at a time, especially since some members have already tried to assist you. This way, the discussion can stay organized and focused, making it easier for everyone to contribute and offer support.It might be a good idea to continue the discussion in one of your previous topics and lock all other topics.

You might be using an address type that is not supported by the site. What does your receiving address look like?As for Blockchain.com then sadly, there are other services out there, but most of them require you to go through ID verification, selfies, etc. if you want to convert your funds to euros. There are some services that you can use to avoid that, but you'll be dealing with individuals in that case, not sure if that's something you want.As mentioned above, this can be a scam. Are you sure the website you're using is legit? It would help if you could tell us the site's name.",

And then..i want nothing ever to do with casino or bitcoin. Thats it.  So, advice welcome?Bro, any casino won't ask you to receive Bitcoin to any specific wallet. So make sure you aren't getting scammed by the casino. Bitcoin addresses all are the same doesn't matter where you generate them. So answer the below question.1. What is the Casino name where you win? Feel free to share the website if possible if it's not a phishing site. 2. Share the withdrawal page screenshot, and hide your personal information. Then we can say what's going on actually. QuoteNothing special.   I placed the Wasabi address in there...starting with ' bc1qu....etc'   and the button to withdraw stayed 'grey'. So, i do think its a legit thing in that, the address isnt correct.Got your problem. You need an address starting with '1' or '3'. They don't support segwit address. So better use address starting with 1 which is legacy address. So yea, use Electrum and create legacy wallet.",

Why you ask ? - There is no reason at all for me not mentioning, who cares so to speak, but  because I am currently emailing them as well as in this very forum mentioning my issues with them, and right now, the name is not of issue BECAUSE, as mentioned several times now,  the site in question goes under the same banner / licence as many others.  eg, Plenty Of Fish, Midnight Wins, Yummy Wins - they are ALL THE SAME ( same licence. How it works behind the scenes i do not know ).  They are not on Gamstop  so not like WilliamHill or Ladbrokes etc.  Again, no lectures please, I am only too well aware.But - I HAVE HAD a few Ttiny wins on some, deposited via mastercard, but, yes, much more loses, more fool is me.I hope that answers your question, i have a screenshot of 'withdrawal page' but..How can i attach it to this??? -   it is standard anyway, and will tell you nothing tbh.But perhaps if you could take a look then, seeing as youve asked.  In meantime i will try this Electrum ( i have again requested a normal mastercard withdrawal..i await the 'technicial issues email reply ).Failing that, and failing Electrum, i may have to resort to the messy Blockchain ( which i admit, IF EVER, i got the money, i would have to use anyway to convert to FIAT ..as im learning! ).Apprecaite your replies, and any help.",

A Bitcoin address is not a URL and does not start with \"http\". Instead, a Bitcoin address can only begin with the numbers 1 or 3, or the letters \"bc1\". It seems that you may not fully understand the concept of a Bitcoin address.Quote from: RobbyN789 on January 01, 2023, 10:52:43 AMTHAT PAY2 PUBLICKEY HASH   - that sounds like the one.  And goes with the mention of 'hash' which i mentioed on this forum. SO - how do i get one of those?P2PKH (Pay 2 Public Key Hash) is another name for addresses that start with the number 1. To avoid technical jargon, I suggest that you refer to this type of address as a \"legacy address\". Dont worry Marv i know only too well how little i know about all things bitcoin and truth be told the more i know the less im liking it!  What I have finally established though is this P2PKH.    It is this that they are after..pretty sure of it.  SO, my question is now,  how I go about getting one of these. I have downloaded Wasbie and Electron - both generating for me 'bc' codes....which are not being accepted.   SO...how can I get this P2PKH 'address'  ( 'they'  casino have said use Blockchain ( and another one which i cannot recall ) ...so....it that what i must do?  create a blockchain account ( wait for id to be confirmed etc etc ), and THEN...finally.....can i SIMPLY get this blasted 'address' give it too the casino and get my few hundred pounds in 'bitcoin' ( which i dont want! i want cash!! ).IF - the above sentence IS correct, thats what i need to do - then...to create a blockchain account must i insert monies or..is there anything i need to be aware of?  I have no desire or intention of using it other than to try get some monies from casino onto it - which i then want to convert ( somehow ) into 'real money.If anyone can just answer me, the first part, how i get this P2PKH address and if i need to put money into it to 'start it off' so to speak ( i see when i tried joining was asking , my intention to buy bitcoin etc ( which i have no intention of doing whatsoever )",

Are you absolutely sure that you need a P2PKH (legacy) address? Have you tried using the address \"1JdC6X...\" suggested by philipma1957? Is the button still grayed out?Btw, I still don't understand why you don't want to reveal which casino platform it is. That would make solving your problem much easier for us.",
