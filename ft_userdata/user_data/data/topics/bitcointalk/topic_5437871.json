      "body": "I really enjoyed your artwork and am a fan of Banksy. He is a controversial graffiti artist, which in my opinion his artwork has a purpose. Graffiti art itself has a history, as a form of visual message to express oneâ€™s opinion or plain simply to express a purpose. Banksy is voiceful in his artwork, whether it is a deep feeling of anger, love, and even hate. He voices out his opinion on politics to even save endangered animals. I admire his work greatly and if I had the artistic talent, I would do the same thing. He certainly contributed to changing how art is viewed throughout the world. Especially paving the way for those who have a similar talent. Banksyâ€™s art is good work, one should take their time to actually sit and actually evaluate it like you are in a museum.",
