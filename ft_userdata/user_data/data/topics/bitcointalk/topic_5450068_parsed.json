The upcoming sale would be held on May 1, still hoping to fix and able to join my allowlist slot on Bybit. I interacted a bit with the SUI testnet and minted NFT's and stuff but it seems like that was not enough to get on the allowlist for that better price in the public sale. I just login to KuCoin to check and the main-sale on Kucoin is pretty big. They want to raise 22,5 Million $ their and every user can invest up to 1000$. Also as you already mentioned, the price is 0,1 per SUI. If i have read correctly, then SUI has a total supply of 10 Billion coins, which would mean the total marketcap with the public sale price would already be 1 Billion $. That is just way to high in my opinion. With such a high valuation you are already a top 50 project even with the public sale price. So not much room to grow from there. I don't invest here.Of course if i would get the chance to participate in the allowlist sale, then i would invest.",

Very few lucky people get a chance to make quick profit. If you have quick hands, the chance could catch you.",

Anyway May 3rd is their launch of mainnet and we will see if this gonna run smoothly.Lets just wait for the result guys.
