  "content": "Terrabull is a community oriented project. We are here to give back to the community and donate to charity in the process. These are our upcoming plans:We are listing on a CEX in around 24hours. Yes you heard that correct, our very first CEX. This will help us list faster on CMC and it's pretty much almost a guarantee.Secondly, NFT minting will be coming out this week and there will be a lot of contests and giveaways to incentivise minting. After NFT minting starts, we will move on to NFT staking with fixed APYs. So your initial minting investment will be accruing tokens.In terms of token staking, we are discussing a potential partnership to get it up and running this week. If the deal doesn't fall through, we will set up our own pools and Dapp. Furthermore, the community wallet is filling up nicely! Once the volume kicks in again and it fill ups to 100-200bnb all of that goes to the community! This as well as our mental health charity donation which will be sent as a huge donation will be publicised heavily. In terms of marketing, with the above mentioned utilities/listings we will be doing our push in accordance with that.",

Actually I bought Terra Luna too while the price is 0.0004 and I got 25,000LUNA coins. But sad to see I got dumped too.. I think theres a curse for the coins with TERRA in their names lols, just kidding.Quote from: tomos81 on May 31, 2022, 05:05:07 AMI don't hear anything about Luna because when Luna price usually above $97 then I invested more than 150 Luna but my official duty I visited foreign for 7days then I forgot to bring my personal computer.

Of course, you're going to give millions and billions and trillions to the community.Your super hyper mega such wow project that includes a CEX, NFT, Staking, DefI and every other single hype known to the crypto community has no way of failing.Speaking of failing, what happened to microcats?It was the same,QuoteCat NFTS, P2E, staking, and a marketplace all under one ecosystemyet in just two months ended like this:QuoteAll Time HighMar 16, 2022 (2 months ago)   $0.0000001289  -98.26%Let's use the same scam project but replace cats with bulls, throw in a controversial name to gain an audience, and here it is, a brand new shitcoin waiting to mare some poor souls poorer.",

      "body": "Lol, the CMC list isn't an issue at all. Even I can get you in if you spend some money, so listing in CMC means nothing. The matter is how your token will work and what is your concept? Overall I don't think there is something interesting. Why should buy your token even if you list it in the cheapest exchange? Also listing in the cheapest exchange will not help anything. Marketing is the main fact here. Feel free to share more details with me, I will take a deep look if somehow could help.",

      "body": "Terra bull or hype, depends on what you want to call it, does not relate to Binance Smart Chain.Because you talk about Binance Smart Chain, there is Stepn and it helps people realize that BSC is good and there is no or very little lag, congestion on Binance Smart Chain. Solana shows its weakness when the network can not handle big demand.So what's happening on Binance Smart Chain? In my opinion, it is very good with support from Solana network congestion.",

Sad.It's even sadder for people who have played on the new version of LUNA, which is clearly detrimental to many parties, but under the pretext of support from large exchanges trying to take profits, they suffer 2x losses. LolYou don't have to worry about losing this short potential because there is still a lot of sad news out there about the destruction of the Luna project.",
