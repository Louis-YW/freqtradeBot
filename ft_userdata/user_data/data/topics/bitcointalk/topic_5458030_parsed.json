Now it also has eth, polygon and bitcoin nft support. Then there's Blur which is definitely worth a look. It's cheap to use and you get blur token airdrops for using it. They most likely aren't worth much, but free tokens are always a nice plus. I used to use Immutable Marketplace and Tokentrove a lot for trading Gods unchained cards, but i am not sure how those are doing these days.",

Because of that, the DD are quite low.Am more familiar with Opensea.io. it is quite popular alongside Rarible, compared to Binance, and it is the best I have seen so far. I didn't even think Binance would be successful with their NFTs. Now with current SEC issues, I wonder how soon before another better than them with NFT marketplace and good charge comes along.There's one NFTs market place I remembered stumbling upon sometime back, Roninsea.com.Although I was adviced it is suspicious, lacks proper information and contact details.",

The exchange site like binance, kucoin even okx have been making their own NFT market place. It's not so hard to find that through search engine. Rarible is not as good as you said as the volume on it is quite small at this moment. I think that exchange site's NFT marketplace mostly used by so many transfers too. That's why it's good for you to visit that place.",

Others say Binance but I haven't explore it that much though. I mean there could be more alternatives out there, but why look for options when we have the best right now?In any case I read that some exchanges too, like Gate.io has one. But then again, the volume might be too low for you.",

I think there are a lot of different options that are not specific to any specific audience, like most of them are good with similar features, the difference is the number of users and the transaction volume is not the point.

They also offer a unique NFT marketplace experience, which resembles more of a token exchange, making it more appealing to traders.Their incentive program is generating substantial volumes right now. However, the long-term sustainability of this approach is unclear. The key question is whether they can generate enough revenue to offset the emissions of their BLUR token and prevent its value from going to zero.",

Thanks for bringing that up. The link you've provided has a comprehensive list of NFT marketplaces available across different blockchain networks. I think I've found what I was looking for. As much as I find Solana to be cheaper and faster than other chains, it's certainly full of issues (mostly network outages). That's the reason why I didn't ask for Solana-based NFT marketplaces in the first place. It's a good thing Magic Eden now supports ETH, and other popular chains. Else, it would've died with Solana already. As long as NFT marketplaces don't censor certain NFTs on-chain, there should be nothing to worry about.",

Blur is a newcomer NFT marketplace that has even surpassed Opensea in volume in the last 30 days, so for now the most suitable place for you in my opinion is Blur. Apart from Blur, you can also explore X2Y2, LooksRare, SuperRare.co and Element. For a complete list, you can look for it on DappRadar, the link I embedded will show you the NFT Marketplace which also supports the Ethereum network.",

Blur is new but going up in volume, I think it's became popular with the chance of an airdrop so I think the volume is being manipulated so take caution on how you will interact with them. I'm not that an expert especially when it comes to long term investment's but I think it's worth a shot for Blur to be the best when it comes to nft trading.",

If you're interested in Bitcoin NFTs (Counterparty tokens -- which are pretty solid and likely to outlast the Ordinals craze), I recommend checking out their DEX & dispensers:https://xchain.io/Same thing with Dogeparty, there's a lot of sleepers (like Rare Doges) out there that have a good chance of commanding more value for collectors in years to come:https://dogeparty.xchain.io/This is a site that specifically tracks Rare Pepe sales on both Counterparty and OpenSea:https://pepe.wtf/As far as long-term investments go, I think Rare Pepes & other early Counterparty tokens (from 2014-2017) are the best bet and outline why in this thread.Finally, I also really like Monaparty tokens as they have a vibrant community of artists, plus they are dirt cheap:https://monapalette.komikikaku.com/shopshttps://monapalette.komikikaku.com/dispensers",

Aside from OpenSea and Rarible you can also check out Nifty Gateway because it is a user-friendly platform that allows artists to create and sell their limited edition NFT's. It is popular choice among collectors, the platform also hosts drops from well known artists and brands. Another one is AtomicMarket a marketplace that allows users to buy and sell NFT's accross multiple blockchains and it offers less fees and user friendly userface. There are many marketplaces to choose from, each with its own unique features and benefits. You can research and study if it is a good platform or not.",
