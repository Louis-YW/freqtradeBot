People still can't see all of this because they are blinded by this bear market.But when everything starts again the Okinami train will be lost. After Shib this is a gem that I cannot miss and when it is visible to evervone they will realize its value. It has a crazy community that is united and motivated to do more and more. There are connections that leave you speechless and give you goosebumps. Who knows if we could tell all this one day... I loveNamiArmy ðŸ’™ðŸŒŠ",
