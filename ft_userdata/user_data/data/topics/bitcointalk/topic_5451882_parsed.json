  "content": "NiceHash will brag about paying 6% more fees when that happens, but won't tell you when they pay you 34% LESS than what normal BTC pools pay.Obviously, today's fees were pretty high, with some block fees netting nearly the same as the block reward itself, an example of that would block 788685 that had 6.13 BTC in fee rewards alone, that's nearly 100% more profit for that single block.Current earning for the average large PPLNS pool and most PPS pools is nearly $140 per 1 PH (keeping the figures in fiat for easier comparison for the readers), while if your miner is pointed to nicehash AsicBoost or None-AB you would be making 104$, and 92$ respectively, that's a loss of 26% or 34%.It's worth mentioning that this could last for a few hours only, it could last for a few days, maybe weeks, nobody knows, which applies for the other side of the equation, when NiceHash is pays 6% or 10%, it doesn't mean it has to last forever, in many cases those payouts last no longer than a few hours, so while you could make more BTC by giving your hashrate to Nicehash, in times like these, you could be loosing more.I am not here to bash Nicehash or the other services that have the same business model (NH doesn't need more bashing IMO anyway), but this topic was made to make people aware that the way some of those services advertise their services couldn't be further from the truth, that brag-post of \"we are paying 6% more\" shouldn't be there because it gives the assumption that this is what they always pay, which is wrong, I would have the utmost respect for Nicehash if they would post another topic today and say \"We are paying 26-34% less\", but we all know they won't do that.",

Made an improved version of what I used to do.and ck made his solopool because I begged him to do it for at least a year. I then pushed team mining to support it and hit some decent blocks 3 I thinkI begged bitminter he refused to it and he went out of business.Nicehash is meh I do not use them much but they serve a purpose.

Anything can lead to a few seconds or a minute where you can't reach something.Your LA node is at Vultr, they have scheduled maintenance this weekend. There *should* be no disruption, but if there is do you want my miner to idle for 5 minutes waiting for things to come back or go someplace else and check back in a minute or 2.The just use another location does not help since if it is you then it just wastes more time till it hits the next fail over. Even if it's a few hashes here and there why let a miner sit idle?That is actually where places like NH do work well, as was pointed out no matter what you mine, if there is an issue at your primary pool you can have them as #2 and just get paid in BTC.Shrug, just took a look, the last time the BTC miners flopped over was between 3 weeks and 5 months depending on their location. The LTC all have been steady since Feb 9th when I did a thing.The shit coin miners are all over the place. Shocker.....not.-Dave",

Yeah, probably. Will anyone who really knows mining be taken in by it? Probably not.There are people out there to where BTC mining is the be all and end all and nothing else matters and nothing else should be mined. That is fine it's their choice.There are also people who mine everything that they can get equipment for and want to maximize profit. Also their choice.There are people who mine for fun. Last I looked someone was mining defcoin with a L3+ It's non tradable and designed that way. Now are they mining for fun, or were they mining some scrypt coin and that was their fail over and have not noticed that is also a possibility. But that is their choice.But in the end, and this is the important part, people are free to do with their equipment what they want. I choose to take a bit less in order to save time and effort. I choose to mine at a PPS pool since for various technical reasons it's a much better deal for me then PPLNS or any other format. Others will of course have different reasons for mining in different places. -Dave",

To be frank, It's more like certainly, i mean, there is no doubt that their marketing is indeed misleadingQuoteWill anyone who really knows mining be taken in by it? Probably not.This is a subject of debate, see, Nicehash don't publish false data, when they tell you that \"today we paid 20% more than the average pool\" they are honest about it, it isn't something they can fake or hide, it's pretty easily determined and anyone would call them out on it, what they do instead is make advantage an extraordinary event and paint a picture for people to make them believe this is the norm when it isn't.Now one can argue that up to this point, they are still \"honest\", but then when other opposite events happen and they pay 20% less than the average pool, they pretend that it doesn't happen, they keep their mouths shut until another special event that works in their favors happens, and they would use that AGAIN to mislead folks into thinking that Nicehash pays out more.It's not an easy thing to spot, even for people who have been mining for a very long time, who on earth watches their daily payouts and compare it to other pools, 5 out of 10 miners, maybe, who does that every single day of the year? probably nobody, you need to be keen to catch them, write some code that runs 24/7 to collect all the numbers and then run them by the end of the year, otherwise, you need to get lucky to notice it, so I am willing to bet that the majority of people are not aware of this fact.QuoteThere are people out there to where BTC mining is the be all and end all and nothing else matters and nothing else should be mined.

But I have a bunch of LTC miners and a few other algos too.NH makes it simple in the fact that no matter what I have as the #2 pool in the config I get a few sats at NH. Eventually there would be enough to bother withdrawing.And they do LN withdraws so that is cool too.It happens so rarely and for such a short period of time, it's just not worth going other places. I pulled all my funds out in Feb 2021 which was a couple of months after the final payback of their hack. As of now I have barely $20 in there. Most of which happened when ETH went POS and I was not in the mood to start pulling the GPU rigs apart for a while so they mined through that weekend.And another large chunk was when I screwed up a BGP config and dropped routing to most of the internet. The others as I posted above were all a couple of minutes, or a few sats at most.Spending time looking for another place to have miners fail to is not being lazy, but just a waste of time for amounts that small.AND since they are short blips they need to be a PPS they would probably never get any payments Somebody someplace was pulling the data from the nicehash API into good sheets and had a bunch of other data to go with it to show long term what they were paying. Have to see if I can find it, or if I am remembering properly what it was doing.-Dave",
