If you imagine Satoshi Nakamoto with two horns, he will look like Bull or Baffalow. If Satoshi Nakamoto is Just with Three horns, he will be look like God Jupiter with his Triton. If, one can imagine Satoshi Nakamoto with his Samurai Sword, it will make him Supream God of Nippon. If Satoshi Nakamoto is an Alien, that will make him an Angel. Ange mean anger and El mean Elohim. But if Satoshi Nakamoto is White Horse with two wings, he Pegaseus the Father God of Zeus. Now, most of the people sow how believe and worship God to hgo to heaven after death.  If Bitcoinism is a religion, it need a Paradise like Utopia. Where all the Faithful Bitcoin believers will go there to enjoy life with prawn cocktails and champaign not after their death but right now here on this earth. If some one think that Satoshi Nakamoto mined the Block #1 after Six Days and he was pretending to be God who has descended to bring Economic justice in the world then What is wrong ?  All the prophets were send down to the earth to guide mankind learning way of religious ethics to help each others, like wise Satoshi Nakamoto is Horse who has descended to this earth from Niburu with a mission Bitcoinism. This is the Dispensation, \" Hearken O people , poor and humble, greedy and thieves, \" there is no religion except Bitcoinism and Satoshi Nakamoto is God of Money\" when you recite it, you become a bitcoiner.

You will become rich and never get hungry.And as all religions, we've reached the dark part, where as usual all you have to do is pray to somebody and you will be rich and live a life without troubles without doing anything else than kiss some diety ass all day long.

      "body": "religion began when the pharohs and then greek leaders would get killed for introducing laws their citizens didnt like, other leaders of trust such as ministers of ancient roman times started making laws by saying some of them had a lightbulb moment of a law, a voice they heard that told them whats best for people or where those ministers wrote that some peasant or average joe had some miracle meeting with a magic man years prior (to avoid anyone questioning the peasant/average joe as they would then be dead due to it being over 100 years since the proclaimed event happened). this is where the ancient rome turned into christianityancient religion was just a law book of rules but without a human leader that can be slaughtered/questionedeg no one can question a law if no one can meet the lawmaker(secretly it was a bunch of ministers(religious priests administrating the laws)but wording the laws not as harsh rules. but as fables and campfire stories of moral reasons for the laws followed by a consequence that no one can defend againstEG ancient rome before religion allowed gay sex marriage outside of wedlock, but that caused alot of sexually transmitted disease so they needed a way to stop the spread, by outlawing it. by saying its a sin. same with sex outside of marriage to stop random sex and instead get people to control whom they had sex with via waiting for a special person to do it with that they would stay with and only do it with that one person. yep all them sins of ancient times were just laws to curb the spread of std's, theft, harmmodern day laws are made by groups of guys too (senators/ministers), but less of the vapour fall guy that lives in the sky talk... where by they hide a patsy/target by having too many people involved to have any single person claimed as the law maker. and the ignorant view that because citizens voted their representative of the group of lawmakers in. its the citizens fault for bad laws. (shift blame away from senate/congress parliament. to then blame conservative/republican/liberal/labour parties/groups and their followers(voters) for the law passingthus not a single target to chase if people didnt like a law, but the ignorant view that if people dont like a law. they can vote someone different in a few years.it is also used as an excuse to reduce the chance of undoing a law by again not having a single guy that is able to undo a lawcore do the same now..bitcoin is not AI code that self creates new or adapted rules.. but where some use the satohsi pretext of who made bitcoin and decided the laws. where satoshi the secret entity no one meets. yet reality is the core of modern bitcoin rule changes (2011-2022+) is where core are the modern rule makers now. not satoshi... and users do not have ability to change rules outside the commit merges of core. yet core try to say that bitcoin laws are a product of users votes, even though core is the only choice these days. and core do mandatory activations and soft activations even if users dont have the majority of code ready to accept the new rules should it activateso you can start to see some similarities where some believe in the senators false 'decentralisation' (no central point, even though the capital building is a central point) same as core say they are decentralised devs (no central point even though core github is a central point)the fallacy of citizen control and voting. even though users dont actually vote on rules, they follow rulesthe fallacy of user code control/voting. even though core devs decide when and how to deploy new rules. (as tested with mandatory activation 2017 and soft activation recently)core pretend they are not the law makers/changers. when they obviously are. even the lead maintainer admits to this now he is slowly resigning from lead status",

      "body": "Bitcoin Dispensation: 1. Before the beginning there was Nothing except a Bit. Then the bit clone itself and multiplied. That was the beginning. Then the second bit ran around the Original Bit and paid homage for respect to the Mother Board. When the second encircled the Mother Bit and created and coil it turned into a coin. 2. Then the coin enter inside the Mother Bit and the Mother Bit got empregnant. In a gradual process the a mother bit start become bigger and bigger until it burst out and created the Bitcoin Big Bang. The Bitcoin Big Bang formed the Cosmoss. That was ultimate beginning of the Universe. When this was happening there was no one to witness it beside Satoshi Nakamoto. Then Satoshi Nakamoto wrote it down the full history of Formation in a book called the Book of Satoshi. 3. There after, about 21 million years later Satoshi saw that out of the Universe came a beam of Light who came to Satoshi saying, Oh my Benevollent Everlast father, at list grant me a name by what I shall be known in the future. Then Satoshi said, thou shall be known as God and I must write your name and cryptographically sign it and publish it in the Blockchain. That was the Genesis Block. Thus the God came into existence who created heaven and the Earth. This God appeared to Mosses and gave 10 Commandments, which is written in the Book of Genesis. 4. Later the story of the Book of Genesis became a Religious indoctrination to brainwash the children of Jacob by Rabbi Judah Ben Hashem. 5. Now, Satoshi Was the Grand Father of God who appeared to Moses and gave 10 Commandments. Now The Grand Father of God Satoshi has come and given 360 Commandments. Who has given Bitcoin and Blockchain which is Purely Cryptographic covenant of the Bitcoinism. 6. If you are a bitcoiner and do not follow the Bitcoinsm mean you are not the legitimate bitcoiner and thou shall go to prison like Dread Pirate Robert and Markus Karpheleus and also like Charly Shremeus. If you prefer not to go to prison thou shall do Bitcoin business by abiding the 360 Commandments who Satoshi has given to follow for your benefits.",
