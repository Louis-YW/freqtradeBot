Cryptocurrency are valued or priced in each fiat you want it but the general currency is dollar because it is the international currency. So should the dollar devalues it doesn’t affects the value of bitcoin towards other currency rather the dollar will only increases in value against the bitcoin. For example if 1btc=$10k and then the dollar devalues it will become something like 1btc=$11k depending on it depreciates.Quote from: Nwada001 on April 10, 2023, 08:49:42 PM1 dollar will always be equal to 1 dollar; the dollar only depreciates in value and not in price. If a currency is being devalued, that means its purchasing power will decrease. To make a successful economy, the price of goods must increase in order to equal the value of the currency. The devaluation power has actually made it not to be equal to 1$ because it actually loses against other currencies or store of values. Due to inflation rates only store of values like bitcoin or sometimes bar of gold are actually worth the same as times goes on.",

      "body": "When USD changes its value by 0.1% in short time, we can't measure this effect on Bitcoin, because Bitcoin changes its value by a much higher percentage due to its constant volatility. Same thing is happening over larger timeframes. If US dollar loses  single- or double- digit percentages over years, Bitcoin changes its value - up or down or both, by a much higher percentage. Bitcoin market is so chaotic that you can't strongly correlate it with anything. But I believe this will change as we are getting closer to the supply limit, so halvenings will stop causing these huge bull and bear markets.",

In a market pair, any changes on the valuation of one of the pairings will affect the value of conversion of the other one.  Let us say Bitcoin's current price value is $29k dollar, then the dollar value crashes, it is obvious that the purchasing power of the dollar will be lessened thus making the conversion of Bitcoin to the dollar more expensive.",

All cryptos and their prices are determined with US dollar, Bitcoin is also included in that list. Fluctuations in the price of Dollar will not impact the price of Bitcoin as long as people are not buying or selling it in bulk. Even if Dollar devalues the Bitcoin will maintain its price and that devaluation will not have any impact on it.From recent reports it has been shown that people will invest their Dollars in Bitcoin, and if that report is true and the predictions are right then definitely the price of Bitcoin will increase.",

These are two separate markets which will impact each other. Anyway, it's better to invest in all possible assets to diversify the portfolio you hold using special prop firms  By having fiat and crypto as 2 separate investments you can be safer during financial crisis and instabilities.

Whether bitcoin appreciates or the dollar depreciates, the result will be that you will see an increase in the valuation of bitcoin in dollar terms, and vice versa: you will see less bitcoin for the same amount of dollars.Quote from: _act_ on April 10, 2023, 08:46:55 PMPairs have effect on each other.This.",

As a trading hotshot, I can vouch for the fact that Bitcoin's often paired with the buckaroo, which means Uncle Sam currency can sway Bitcoin's price in more ways than one.Now, let me slip into my goofball cap and imagine a world where the dollar goes belly up—BAM! We'd be shelling out Bitcoin for our java and munchies. But let's get real: the dollar-Bitcoin tango is a tad more intricate than that. Bitcoin value is ruled by market supply and demand, not to mention a smorgasbord of other variables like regulatory shifts, investor vibes, and tech breakthroughs.So, to wrap it up, while the dollar's ups and downs can definitely jostle Bitcoin's price, it's just one piece of the crypto trading puzzle.

Because I can remember when the price of my local currency (Naira) was #500 per $1, and back then 1 Bitcoin which was $30k was equal to over #15million naira, unlike now that the price of dollar has risen due to economic challenge, and as such resulted to the price of my local currency falling to #700 per $1, while 1 BTC now over #21 million naira (i.e 6million naira extra).Secondly, Dollar is used as a major trading pair simply because it is a currency generally accepted for International trade/business, as an official currency of Earth's most powerful country of the world",
