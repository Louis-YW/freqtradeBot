Maybe install POP!_OS the AMD version if you want to try that card again. Also consider Debian 11 you can choose what desktop-environment(s) you want or create a minimal base system and install only the necessary packages & dependencies.You said \"never again with AMD cards in Ubuntu\" but I hope later on you can get it to work on your test rig.",
