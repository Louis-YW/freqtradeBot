And if ever there are vulnerabilities that can be exploited, bitcoin devs are very quick to make a patch and update with the latest release.Here another link that might help you out: https://bitcoincore.org/And if ever you yourself discover any bugs, then you can report it here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues. Or you can read previous issues and how devs deal with it in a \"timely manner\".",

      "body": "The bugs does not affect the network permanently. In the case of any inflation bug happening, then part of the community will rightfully split the chain to fix the inflation bug while letting the other chain (presumably) die off. Obviously, there is a chance that the network just survives alongside Bitcoin, but it doesn't threaten the security of the network.There are numerous attack vectors within any decentralized network, many of whom are theoretical and hard to execute. With every vulnerability, we attempt to mitigate it by minimizing or completely eliminating the impact of it. Those attacks are discussed on the mailing list, if you want to know more about them, search it up using the mailing list. All your concerns on specific vulnerabilities should be addressed.",

You could just ask what would happen in case of a sudden vulnerability or what would happen if the internet was cut off from the entire planet. The latter isn't a reasonably scenario as the whole world operates online nowadays. As for the vulnerabilities, we'll tackle them as we've used to; with consensus.",

Although BTC is the earliest network and is now used by a lot of people, nothing is absolute in this world and I think including BTC is the reason why there are some bugs and security of BTC is one of the top concerns of many investors, and what you are imagining is a world with apocalyptic wars and many things affecting the internet, what will BTC look like? ? and we'll all go back to using gold. It sounds like what you said is possible but don't worry we will have another solution at some point.",
