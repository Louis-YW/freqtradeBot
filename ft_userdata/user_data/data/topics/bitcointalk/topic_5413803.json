Due to wrong market offered, selected affected ticket is considered REFUNDED. Kindly re-check your ticket and balance again. Sorry for the inconveniences caused!. i thought ok nice then i looked at my bet  slip and what i see its still lost i contacted the live support they said they have to contact their vendor. the respons was This is Ashley, BTC365 Customer Care, we are here to inform you in regards of your ticket with id : 2209160059371475 , as per vendor the announcement of the refund ticket only affected live betting , since you bet on full time your ticket were not affected and can't be refunded, your ticket resulted in lose as per official result you bet on away team and the winner of the match is the home team (with score 2-0).

Generally anything that could help convince people of your case without exposing too much of your own information. Examples may include Screenshots of the bet placed (with the amount or ID number on the bet if you want to keep the bet amount private), Screenshots of your conversations over email (particularly relevant stuff).Obscure anything that might be too confidential.Check the other thread mentioned above to find btc365partners profile, clock on the link that says \"trust\" and open a flag with them so others can support it if they agree with it.You can also read up on trust flags here which might be helpful in working out how to create one others will support: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5153344.0",
