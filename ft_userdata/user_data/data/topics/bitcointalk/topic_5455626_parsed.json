  "content": "Bkex is one of the top cryptocurrency exchange in the Asian region, on the 29th of May, 2023, the exchange made an announcement of suspending all withdrawals from the platform due to an account being involved in money laundering and police investigating the case, they told their users that the investigation would last not more than 4 days, and withdrawal of funds will be opened again for every one, but unfortunately, today makes it 9 days and withdrawal is not yet opened, several of their users are already panicking..Here is the full announcement..QuoteDear Users: Recently, the platform users' funds were involved in 'money laundering' and BKEX is currently cooperating with the police to collect evidence, for which we will suspend withdrawals to cooperate with the work.BKEX team will fully cooperate with the regulatory investigation and do its best to restore the normal operation of the exchange.The team will actively work with the relevant authorities to resolve the current issues faced to ensure that the rights of our users are protected to the greatest extent possible.We will maintain transparent and timely communication during this process.

Well, I felt it's more of a reputational issue, which is why I decided to make this post here, this no doubt will greatly or has already affected the reputation of the exchange, as I can see on coinmarketcap that the exchange is dropping in rank. So, though this does have a relation with the service discussion board, I felt it is a case that has to do with reputation as well, but I will gladly move the thread to the service discussion board if so suggested by other users.. Edit: I decided to move it, thanks very much for the suggestion my friend.",

If they're indeed telling the truth, I lean towards it's likely to get uglier specially after what went down with hotbit where even after investigation was done, they claim the assets were still frozen and they had to look for acquisitions or loans to pay back users. Ofc, this is assuming that hotbit was also telling the truth. If anyone hasn't heard, they claim to be in a similar situation: was investigated > froze their assets.Open deposits are indeed unnecessary, makes sense that people are questioning their sincerity. Since all the information are coming from bkex, it's pretty understandable that people are on the fence as well.",

If the site is under police investigations, this does not mean that the platform is frozen, otherwise it means that the platform has been sized, and therefore all depositors' funds are frozen.If users cannot withdraw it is an exit scam, they may not have enough liquidity and therefore everything may suddenly disappear.it is more likely to an exit scam than police investigations",

Hope i'm wrong....Yeah, I hope you are wrong indeed  I've got some altcoin on that exchange that's worth a nice sum, I really can't afford to loose that money now, not now that I've got alot of dept to settle.I deposited and bought that altcoin from the exchange, I was hoping to still buy more of the altcoin and withdraw everything altogether at once, to cut down on withdrawal fees, unfortunately for me, this announcement came 2 days after I bought the said altcoin, i  really wish I withdrew them immediately after buying..Anyways, I am still very hopeful, believing they will get everything sorted out soon and return better and stronger, this I pray.",

This is not a good business strategy to have stopped their customers and clients from making withdrawals.  Does it mean they do not have much funds in their reserve to pay back if there is any possibility that such an occurrence took place via their exchange. How can they hold customer to ransom from making withdrawals. I hope they are ready to face possible legal actions for such restrictions.If they accept deposit them they should be able to allow withdrawal while the investigation is ongoing till it is over otherwise they should have put a halt to both activities or are they trying to gather funds so if anything happens and and unfortunate events happens they would come on air to tell their clients cock and bull tales it possibly abscond with funds.",

QuoteBKEX Announcement on Suspension of Withdrawals And it leads to the page cited by the OP.

If an authority already requires a platform to cooperate with their investigation, they should already have some data to go by. It would be wild if they decide to freeze every account because one or two addresses make suspicious activities. I don't think it is hard to just disable one or two withdrawal addresses/wallets related to any suspicious address and allow registered users to withdraw their funds through other hot wallets. Unless of course, they have only one hot wallet/cold wallet to process every transaction so every funds get mixed. CMIIW.",

I mean that the process will be, closing all new deposits, collecting all withdrawals except those whose identity has been verified in the worst case, and even this will happen with an automatic effect for some accounts and the effect of a part of withdrawals above a certain amount.What is happening now is scam.",
