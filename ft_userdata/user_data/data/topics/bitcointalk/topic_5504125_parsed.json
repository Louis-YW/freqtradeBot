  "content": "The 4 rules stated in this image is quite simple not to boycott, but the last one “No bears\" is quite intriguing, who is planning to show up with a bear in the venue? However the event is ongoing. On the site I went through the event speaker's page, in search for Donald Trump, found he'll be speaking on the 27th July 2024; Topic; Donald Trump's Keynote, duration 30 mins. In my perspective, the organisers should, at least, prepared him to say something that'll contribute his Bitcoin knowledge, things like decentralization. He's probably the only speaker without a Bitcoin related term in his topic. In a nutshell, he's only there for campaign purposes. I mean if Trump didn't need votes from the Bitcoin community members, what could have made him to speak in a bitcoin conference? I understand it's an honor, and I don't know what he keynotes would be, but as surprising as it may seem, he's not prepared or have any prior knowledge that qualifies him as a speaker in a bitcoin event. Sorry, if the follow up words are derailing from the topic of my thread.The acting secret service director should pay close attention to the no Firearm or weapon rule, on Trump's visit.

They're basically saying, we don't want people here with the attitude that is pessimistic for the price of cryptocurrency.",

LOL.  Do you seriously expect Trump to say anything of substance, much less about a vague topic like decentralization (and I'm not sure what you'd expect him to say about that anyway)?  It's all rah-rah with him, and neither he nor anyone in the audience is going to learn anything.  That could be generalized to just about any political speech during an election cycle, by the way.Quote from: SickDayIn on July 25, 2024, 01:13:17 PMIt's a joke, it means no \"bears\" as in the trading terminology. Not sure OP gave this a lot of thought.",
