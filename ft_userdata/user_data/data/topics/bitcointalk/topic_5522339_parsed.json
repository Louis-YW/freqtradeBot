  "content": "I just saw the following statement in a global poll by Consensys (the company managing Metamask) and couldn't resist to create a thread about this:Quote from: Consensys reportOver 75% of respondents are concerned about AI generating fake news and fraudulent content, while 54% believe blockchain can mitigate those risks.Source: Consensys report press releaseMost of these 54% chose the option \"Yes, but I'm not sure how\", while an outright \"Yes\" was much less common.I think this is very insightful, because it shows the low amount of knowledge people have about Bitcoin and blockchains. And this is also probably the reason why people still massively fall into scams promising all kinds of \"magic\" features from \"blockchains\".Really, how should that blockchain-based magic \"removal of AI fake news\" even work? Okay, let's see one of the companies proposing to tackle that problem: fact.technology.QuoteThrough governance vote, rules are formed and decisions are enforced within the Protocol. All FACT token holders except NRs and NVs can exercise their right to governance vote.Source: WhitepaperLol. So basically, the richest users determine what is correct and what is fake. While it does solve the sybil attack problem somewhat, it is easily manipulable, and if the founders hold lots of the tokens (like it's common in altcoins) then they basically are those deciding about the \"correctness\" of a fact.This protocol doesn't solve anything. AI content being \"curated\" by rich entities like Meta, X or Google is nothing new, and doesn't need blockchains at all.Blockchains are not magic. There are very few applications which solve real problems and really need blockchains. The Bitcoin use case, a censorship resistant decentralized currency, is the most significant of them. PS: Mods, if you believe this belongs into the altcoin forum please move it. I think it fits better here as it covers all blockchains.",

That was Bitcoin's (and generally, blockchain's) only unique contribution to the world. This can be an important problem to solve, but it's also a fairly narrow one.But then, somewhere along the way, people figured out how to turn Bitcoin into a speculation instrument, which meant that the more people loved Bitcoin, the more money current holders would make.Then, predictably, people started, well, lying about it in order to pump the market price of Bitcoin. They said Bitcoin and blockchain would do millions of things it could never do, and/or implied that only Bitcoin/blockchain could solve problems that millions of other things solve (\"if your problem is a nail, every tool is a hammer\", etc.).You \"can\" build any app that needs to store data in some fashion using the blockchain architecture. That doesn't mean it's a good idea. Nobody would suggest you write the next blockbuster video game in Perl, even though it's technically possible. Why? Because Perl isn't a speculation instrument worth a trillion dollars.If it were, then everybody on TV would say that the FAA air traffic control systems should be rewritten in Perl. That voting systems should be re-written in Perl so they would be more \"secure\" (somehow). That video games should include Perl code so they are better somehow.

The root issue here is that you have no double spending problem to solve, which is what blockchains do best. Instead in this case the main thing you want to confirm is that \"person X thinks that information Y is correct\", and that's what digital signatures achieve already well, but on any storing platform.I'm however sure that what Consensys wanted to promote with this question are solutions like this fact protocol and other \"web3\" stuff, which depend on some token/smart contract on Ethereum and another altchain, and on PoS-like \"voting\" mechanisms which benefit the holders of some speculative token.",

For example, I sold 99.9% of my BTCs, because of new KYC/AML regulations, since 2025. I still have some coins, just to play with them, if needed, and Bitcoin is still a very interesting project, from the programming perspective, but it will be harder and harder to use it in practice, without having your ID checked by someone.The problem, which is really solved, is just a double spending problem. If you have \"Alice->Bob\" and \"Alice->Charlie\" transaction, then blockchain can tell you, which one is valid, and which one was supported by the hashrate majority. And that's it. There's not that much beyond Byzantine Generals Problem, really (by the way: if you want to execute an example, described by Satoshi, where each General has a computer, then you can use OP_SIZE on DER signature, and lock it into a shared public key, for a given group of Generals, and then, the fastest General can create a transaction, which will claim the whole pot, and will be first broadcasted to the Bitcoin network).QuoteAnd then programming would be dragged backwards in progress by about 40 years.We are getting there, but not because of Bitcoin. Recently, the \"magic box, that can do everything\" is Artificial Intelligence. Blockchain-based ideas will soon hit their limits, if people will find out, that transactions have fees, and if you do a lot of computations, without batching anything, then you have to pay a lot of money for doing that. Also, AI-based models will hit a different limits, when people will notice, that \"AI programmed by AI\" is not the best way to do things, and can lead to more and more dumb models, which will just turn everything into some kind of echo chamber, where the same data will be just processed over and over again, without adding anything creative.QuoteReally, how should that blockchain-based magic \"removal of AI fake news\" even work?Fake news will never be removed, because if some alternative version of the reality is logical, and could happen in theory, then it is hard to falsify it, if you don't have enough data. If you have \"Alice->Bob\" genuine transaction, and \"Alice->Mallory\" fake transaction, then both can have valid signatures, and the news saying that \"Mallory received coins from Alice\" is called \"fake news\", only because the \"hashrate majority\" decided to do so. And because all AI models have their limits, and their models are simplified and optimized, to give answers fast enough, there will be always some room for \"fake news\". Because AI can predict your age, based on your age, with 99% accuracy (and there is always 1% left for fake answers, just because that's how AI models are trained, and that's what prevents them from \"overfitting\", when you introduce a penalty for producing \"too complex solutions\").",

And if you don't have a blockchain, and you don't want to have a trusted third party, then how do you want to decide, which version is correct?Why not have a trusted third party, e.g. an ordinary computer system? There's only one answer to this: because you want to evade government oversight or control into your system. If this is not your goal, then doing any other way is a pointless waste of time and resources.Today, almost all blockchain-based digital currencies are defacto centralized (with the notable exception of Bitcoin and a few others). In other words, these systems are basically using blockchain for no valid reason other than to pretend they are \"like Bitcoin\" somehow. But unless evading the government is your goal, there is no reason to add the complexity and costs associated with the blockchain architecture.Hence, if all you want is to store transactions, and you don't care about government control of those transactions, then computers have been doing this for a half century, and blockchain is not necessary (and indeed, would, net-net, make the system less secure since the architecture as far more complicated and thus adds many more attack points for hackers).(It's worth noting now that realistically, only Monero and those like it truly solve the problem Bitcoin was initially designed to solve. With chain analysis and widespread KYC connected to so many endpoints, using Bitcoin is not very anonymous--certainly not in a way a criminal would trust their life with. And the Bitcoin network itself is majority-controlled by three known US companies, so Bitcoin could easily be taken over by the US government for instance, by simply ordering these three companies to do it).",

The media advertised it as a solution to everything! I still remember back in 2017-ish when they kept creating completely useless projects (usually tokens) and mass advertised them as the solution to various problems like \"energy problem\" the \"healthcare system\", and a lot of other weird things.That \"cat-video-watcher\" who is just scrolling through the news only reading the headlines before they go and watch their cat videos, sees titles saying \"this new blockchain project is going to solve [blank]\" over and over, will eventually think blockchain is indeed a magic solution.",
