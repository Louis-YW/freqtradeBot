If you lose your passphrase backups, you will lose your coins, just as if you lose your seed phrase backups. Do not backup passphrase together with your seed phrase.",

To put simply your TV is more valuable in their eyes compared to a piece of paper so it is their target.But of course you can always add encryption (a simple AES256 encrypt would work) or the lazy way is to add an extension word (aka the password) that you either memorize or keep elsewhere. This would make it harder to steal coins by only having the seed phrase.",

For instance, don't flaunt on social media or to your IRL peers.In case of cryptos, burglars typically don't assume you have it and they usually go for the general stuff like cash, gadgets, etc. That is why I'm convinced a lot of physical attacks to crypto users are targeted, which means perps got a hold of their victims activities/information first.",

If, on the other hand, let's say you have a considerable amount in bitcoin, which is 50% or more of your net worth, and you have several places to hide the seeds (your house, a holiday home, your parents' house, a remote and difficult to access place in the mountains, a bank safe deposit box...) then you need to explore alternatives.

If we talk about possibility, every way has it's own risk and a chance to lose all of your coins. It just depends on the person want to take which risk and advantage. If you keep thinking about the worst possibility, you will never think it's already safe.Let's say I have wrote 50 backup phrases with a good material and spread it to 50 countries, but shit happen on those 50 countries and I can't access my wallet anymore, the reality it's impossible something bad will happen on all the countries.",

Make encryption of your private keys and save it in secure where hacker can't access them in case, he got accessed to it he will need a second key.2. save your second key in a metal keycard at a safe place in your home.3. Encrypt the third key and keep secure it in a hard wallet and place this wallet at another location from your home which should also be a safe one. I think these tips can help you to make your mnemonic phrase as secure as possible.",

The first thing is to never store them on an online device like saving a picture on your phone or system. The second thing is never make many duplicate of your Phrase because it will just make them redundant and will easily expose the storage location of some. When it is stored on places like usb make sure the device is regularly changed because of wear out. If it is a large amount stored then I would advice a the use of multi sig wallet but the creation shouldn’t from a single or master key. It should be single seed for every co-signer",

While keeping it on a metal keycard, that's one of a disaster proof but also you need to make it as if it's not an obvious passphrase that you've written there. A metal card o dog tag is like a good one that you can count on in terms of disasters. But as you have said it's not thief proof. The only solution with that is to make back ups that you'll only understand and only you know where you can keep it safe inside your house.",

From disaster, you have to keep the seed phrase in another place like far from your own phrase. Maybe store the seed phrase in another region, city or where you think the disaster will not make any impact and you can access it easily. Quote from: coinfunda on September 24, 2023, 12:04:41 PM-> Obviously keep it online in email of any other way is risking your funds.Many users prefer to keep them online because that's the longest way to preserve them and if you have selected a drive or I line cloud storage that have distributed storage devices and have auto saving or cloning options then that better then storing on paper. But many will not agree with me.",

This is similar to using colors to designate them and it is also not advice due to mixing them up The idea of a google drive is also not available because it is as same as storing them on your Gmail. Once anyone gets access to them they could see it there. The best way is to take away from any online platform",

I say ironically because bitcoiners were famously against banks. At least some were. Or instead of usb, you can use that metal keycard you talked about, or Ledger nano X or Ledger Nano X or Trezor.Carrying them yourself is just dangerous.Or you can do what Vitalik did with his wallets. He gave half of the privatekey of one of his wallets to his father. I see that as risky.Quote from: coinfunda on September 24, 2023, 12:04:41 PMWhat your way?My way is against crypto ethos and i am storing mine in a trusted exchange.

We can't control natural disasters like typhoons, which are common in my country.Because typhoons can cause flooding, I shall keep my phrase on an elevated location. If I am not at home when the flood occurs and our house is damaged, I am not too worried since I have a different place where I keep my wallet, which is online. I wasn't concerned about actual theft because they normally didn't know as long as you didn't tell people you had Bitcoin.",
