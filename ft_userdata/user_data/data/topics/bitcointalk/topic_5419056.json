After that I could not log into the account. I wrote to support, and they replied that the account was frozen and that they would contact me via email. After that they stopped responding to my email. Every 2-3 months I send them an email, but no one answers, now I have decided to put an end to the fraudsters. I sent them documents for verification, my ID, selfie with ID, proof of address, but nothing. Can you give me some guidance on where to report this case. I have a lot of evidence and screenshots.",

I have a lot of evidence and screenshots.- If you have strong evidence, just follow what one of our colleagues said here that you appealed the scam accusation and just follow what you should do there. It's also pretty big that you can't get out of couldbet if what you're accusing is true. And that's probably a long process. You just didn't determine if that happened the first few years you created an account over this gambling platform. or 2 years or recently?",

The complainant will be assumed as a someone who break their terms, or people will twist the issue to complainant's other past issue, etc. (example of stake having past issues). It's like they are paid to defend the platform even though the obvious mistake is the platform.But for someone like cloudbet, who have already bad image, people will not be neutral, people will suggest possible ways to do against them. And that's the reality.Quote from: Cryptomiles1 on November 01, 2022, 08:21:14 PMYou have to be very careful otherwise i don't think they would respond to you since is been 2 to 3 years now.About the timeframe, yes, that's unfortunate, i don't know if this will be still solve, probably not.

I was even excited to see them having a signature promotion on this forum after quite some time. They had a good one for several months. It had just ended a couple of months ago. It is pointless, however, to explore marketing strategies while staying unresponsive to their own players. Anyway, have you explored all possible ways to reach out to them?

You can upload your proof on imgur.com/upload then the copy the link here so that we can view it in the imgur website since you can’t post image here due to your rank limitation.I’m just concern on the outcome of your complaint here. Cloudbet is not responsive here on answering concern but you can still try. Why does it took you so much time to finally have an update to your issue. They might gave you an excuse that your case is already forgotten since this issue is very old. @icopress might help you to notify the cloudbet team since he is the cloudbet signature campaign manager before which means he has contact on the team to look in your case. Just provide the proof to strengthen your claim.",
