Some people go just for get say na market wey dey go up and down anytime na e dem dey. If person invest come see say e money don spike go up, the next thing na to remove your interest. Dem own no be like dat. As I don talk am before, trading na gamble to me and e go better say u use your money take buy Bitcoin hodl and no matter watin sub Bitcoin go always go up for market  na only patience win am.",

Even the people that have leaned and have experience in trading can still continue to lose. Trading is very risky just like gambling is risky, but just that you can use charts, analyses and strategies to have more success rate in trading, but most traders try what are required, but emotion makes them to continue losing. But if you know the right time to hold and you go for it, it can give you more than you may not expect during bull run.",

      "body": "Quote from: JayJuanGee on July 28, 2023, 03:19:17 PMIf you overinvest into BTC it can be much harder to hold.   Also if you have a trader's mindset, it is going to be harder to hold because you are frequently thinking in short terms and perhaps even thinking that you can magnify the size of your holdings by fucking around with trading... and many traders will \"way\" overdo their trading strategies.. and perhaps should not even be trading more pristine assets such as bitcoin - because they actually do not recognize and/or appreciate that bitcoin is a pristine asset and they fuck around with trading it way to much merely because they realize that it is volatile.. so they mistake volatility with ways to make money.. and perhaps slip into greed or even not really knowing what they are doing.. so then perhaps emotions will kick in way too much based on their putting themselves into such positions of worry.I mean no offence to quote this here, but it's not off topic, and it's really the truth. Holding Bitcoin still has some huddles, and if one is not educated enough on how to invest, they can overdo the investment, which will result in them not holding for a long time.Trading can be risky, and even if you have a good strategy for making profits, you know your profit is not guaranteed every day; some days you will experience losses, but for someone who is holding, you will not be at much risk like the trader.",

In the end its all depends on the person interest though becoming a successful holder is easier but if the person has not the mind of an holder he/she may still fail to be successful (this shows hodlers might be affected by emotions also)",

But I know some people have built good trading skills over the years and at that,  they are good at trading and are making profits following their trading partan unlike holding where you never lose anything unless you exchange your Bitcoin,  trading you have to part away with your funds if the trade ends in the negative,  so your best bet is to hold while you trade minimal amount of stablecoins if need be.",

This one dey different from trading it. Trading also dey different from hodling your bitcoin for your wallet or exchange whatever where you leave am. But to trade bitcoin, you are talking about futures trading where price moves up and down and you fit make profit from each of them if you get ur analysis well.
