When you contacted the campaign what was his response? From what I am seeing the company campaign advertisement still continues which means there is a high possible chance for the manager and the company representative to communicate in and outside the forum since the company ANN poster account was online today the exact day for another round of their weekly campaign.Do you say you PM their representative? If yes. How come he/she did defend the casino?In the meantime, you can also report the issue on askgamblers",
