And is it advisable to invest in this coin?Always NFA, by the way it's already trading on Binance and up a 1000% and I think they are already announced it that they're airdropping it so yeah there will be a token airdrop. Not advising on anything, you should be responsible on it and do some proper research. Everything right now is going up and what I just can advise is don't FOMO or go all in unless you can afford to lose it.",

It hit $10 above after few weeks. I think jito could be at that level if the market continue considering a lot of users or whales would trade it. But of course its risky. Its up to you mate, if you have high risk apetite. Its total supply is same with tia the difference would be seen on execution.",

I think it will not be a bad idea to invest a little amount on JTO but the only thing you should consider is when to buy. Although the amount of eligible wallet is not much compare to other airdrop but it is still possible there will be many sellers which can affect the price in a short period.  My advice is you should put it on your watch list, monitor it and find an entry point. Between Coinbase is listing JTO tomorrow as well as other top exchange.",

There is a reason why Coinbase decided to list from the first day, they must think it is going to do well in the market",

If you participated in the airdrop and you still want to push forward to buy some holdings since it is already launched, that would be a good move and you can make some good profits from buying and holding whether for a long time or short time, just keep that to yourself. You need to do further research so you can understand more about the project. You can decide to join the community so that you can see what's going on there and make a proper decision.",

Moving on to the second question for \"is it advisable to invest in this coin?\". We all know that apart from Bitcoin, it's all rubbish that will slowly be eroded by new hype. So, my advice if you want to invest in JITO (JTO), it would be better if you just ride the wave that will occur in the short term. Don't stay too long in an Altcoin .",

And is it advisable to invest in this coin?Airdrops like this are usually formed to get the community attention. If you want to invest in this project then make sure you have checked their business model and roadmap. If they are distributing a lots of free token to the community and rewarding with their token for farming and liquidity by providing incentives then their business model needs to generate enough money to hold the sell pressure. A new project like thats price should not be fall drastically otherwise, investors will turn away and if they have a good plan to develop much better methods to generate revenue for the project and build usecase for the token then investor will hold their bags till the update has been done to maximize their profits.",

I have seen someone who was capable enough in receiving 38k JITO which was worth more than 100k at this moment. It's worthy enough to buy when it was dumping less than 2 dollars at this moment. I have been buying some almost 1 thousands of JITO and i have staked it into the vault. I have heard that if kamino will be doing airdrop as well. The bullish trend has become the golden momentum for the club to launch their tokens. This is so crazy. Everything has been preparing to launch their tokens. I hope that something big to happen soon. I have been getting lots of money but i wanna get some airdrops too. Sad i didn't even know about this. I hope that everything is going to happen soon.",

The price has been hyped due to listing on popular site while airdropped users are likely to dump their coins on the hype. Let other buyers take up the supply. The price drop that follows would be the best time to invest as a lot more people would have bought the coins at higher price.

Personally, I have not had the luck to receive an airdrop from the project and have no plans to seek profit with this new cryptocurrency. Although I also admit that the hype and the MM behind it can definitely push it to higher prices, getting back to the issue of investing is not always as simple as seeing people pay a lot of attention. It is the risk/return with the investment, perhaps if the plan is clearer about capital and target time, it will bring a clearer view. From a positive perspective, I think the period of global price increases is getting closer and closer, so accumulating and waiting for more time is completely feasible, imo to expect big profits.",
