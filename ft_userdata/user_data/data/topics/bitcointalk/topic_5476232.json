It's not just a random topic that most people will ignore; it's from the administration, and everyone will want to see what's new.¬†KYC is being introduced in the forum‚Äîare you kidding me? Well, it's obvious many people might have been taught to run through their heads, but then again, many people already saw what happened today. It's a peaceful move to keep the community as free as it could be from any governmental attack, and we know the government doesn't need any reason to come after anything when they feel like¬†they will also have a reason or they will create one.¬†Enabling KYC in the forum will be a little way more difficult. Whoever wants to pass KYC for using a forum, no one will want to do that, and aside from the fact that there is no direct financial dealing with the forum and its users, it's always third-party companies that bring in deals, and the forum has no direct involvement, so there will be no need for such.¬†The question others have is: how long until non-KYC projects are stopped from operating here?",
