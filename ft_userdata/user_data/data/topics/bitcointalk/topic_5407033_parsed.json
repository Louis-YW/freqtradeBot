  "content": "I read that there are \"security recommendations\" from the UN, which propose to reduce interest in cryptocurrencies by increasing the tax deductions received from them and also propose to ban advertising of crypto projects in social networks and in public places...There is a Full list that contains these recommendations, but at the core lies the fear that cryptocurrency is gaining more and more trust from the public, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for regulators to take everything under their control.QuoteThe following policies,among others, have the potential to curb the further spread of the risks of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins:(a) Ensuring comprehensive financial regulation, through the following actions:- Require the mandatory registration of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and make the use of cryptocurrencies lessattractive, for example by charging entry fees for crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and/or imposing financialtransaction taxes on cryptocurrency trading;- Ban regulated financial institutions from holding stablecoins and cryptocurrencies or offering related products to clients;- Regulate decentralized finance (such finance may, in fact, not be fully decentralized, given its central management andownership, which form an entry point for regulation18);(b) Restricting or prohibiting the advertisement of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets in public spaces and on social media.This new type of virtual, and often disguised, advertisement requires policymakers to expand the scope of regulationbeyond traditional media. This is an urgent need in terms of consumer protection in countries with low levels of financialliteracy, as even limited exposure to cryptocurrencies may lead to significant losses;(c) Creating a public payment system to serve as a public good, such as a central bank digital currency. In the light of theregulatory and technological complexity of central bank digital currencies and the urgent need to provide safe, reliable andaffordable payment systems, authorities could also examine other possibilities, including fast retail payment systems.https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/presspb2022d8_en.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1whBoNCSpqzAEBkLViqwe2CFemCkkWGvW2_2VON2yaFkt50zXAYg57ZVw",

      "body": "The whole thing is like going to be a drama. Because I don't know how they are going to do it. They want to regulate and control cryptocurrencies, and ban users. Let us watch the drama between UN and Cryptocurrencies. And I don't believed that it is UN is saying this thing, I perceived that someone (a Capitalist or group of people or countries) is/are behind the recommendation of the regulation and the reduction of cryptocurrencies to a bearish way to other Currencies mostly I believed, they are referring to dollar. They want the usage of cryptocurrencies (bitcoin) to reduce. I smile, are they also going to control the mining as well because that is where bitcoin or cryptocurrencies base on. Cryptocurrencies make things easy for me in my location.",

Still, they do like to tax the income from crypto, don't they?",

Yeah, there are centralisation to some aspects of the crypto space but, its sure to push for a more decentralized functional crypto space with individuals becoming more private. Its simply human nature and we would see it worked out.The government is so confused on there decision such like that of India that they even after banning crypto, goes ahead to tax it. I mean what rubbish? When you see double standards like this it only goes down to one reality and that is, Crypto can't be stopped and has no regulations to it.",

No bitcoins, no crypto hub, digital assets!Furthermore, this is the full text:QuoteMAS and relevant government agencies will take firm enforcement action if any entity is found to be conducting illegal activities or performing regulated activities without a license.The crypto industry globally is still evolving and regulation is still catching up with industry trends. Singapore is often seen as being at the forefront, with a clear licensing and regulatory framework.But the focus of crypto regulation to-date in Singapore, as well as in most major jurisdictions, has been on containing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.Most regulatory regimes today do not cover areas such as consumer protection, market conduct, and reserve backing for stablecoins.This is changing.  Reviews and public consultations are underway, among international standard-setting bodies and regulators, to strengthen regulation in these areas. MAS is targeting to consult on proposed measures in the next few months. But the key lesson from the upheaval in the global crypto industry is clear: investing in cryptocurrencies is highly risky.This is what MAS has been warning the public about for the past 5 years. In fact, MAS’ repeated warnings against retail investments in cryptocurrencies and ratcheting up of policies to restrain retail access have raised some questions as to where MAS stands with respect to the digital asset ecosystem.Still bullish?As for the UN, I would ask them to ^%%$ but I just remembered they have zero decisional or enforcing power, so they are just talking, as always.",
