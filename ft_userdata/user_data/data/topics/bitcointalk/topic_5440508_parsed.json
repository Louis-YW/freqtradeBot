Quote from: FFrankie on July 13, 2019, 10:52:48 PM~removed text~I also overpaid 0.0003 btc on the loading fee as seen by the transaction here:~removed text~I also had number 18, but I am 100% I gave that one away as a gift. I think I might have had to load that one too if memory serves me right because I gave it to my coworker and we split the funding amount. if poly kept the public addresses than they would be able to confirm",
