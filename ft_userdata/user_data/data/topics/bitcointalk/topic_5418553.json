I read a lot of posts suggesting contributing to the forum and making good posts.I've been frequenting every available board on this bitcoin forum in the past few days and I came across a post about the types of bitcoin account ratings. Turns out I was very low-ranked.It occurred to me that I would challenge myself to be in the highest rank someday in a good and right way even though I only worked as a housemaid.",

Merit and rank will be guaranteed not because you can caught most cheater or plagiarist, it's because you have something worthy of the forum.",

However, there are many other ways to contribute positively to the forum besides reporting violations. The most effective way is through creating good posts in response to others' questions and statements .This is how I think it works. All you do is be an active member of the forum and \"contribute to the forum\" as you call it. As for a good post, treat this place like your own community. So make posts that you think benefit others here in the community. It does not have to be something it really benefits us as long as people can learn from it or you are also learning from it at the same time or vice versa. After all, it is not helpful if your post doesn't add anything new to the discussion.",

What are we doing here? Isn't it something yunno? Then go ahead and do the same thing. I understand that you dunno where to start; it happens almost everytime, to rookies like ya, -- I'm not gonna say that's a sign of incompetency, No! ....only that, anything that's learnt in due process, in some pace of time,under a well-nutured avidity, is worth learning. You ain't expecting to get it that easily; it ain't some freeborn pizza & frozen yogurt giveaways, yunno . Sometimes, you'll tend to get pre-occupied with your normal day activities in real life but, just remember this day, that I, Sandra said this to you ; if you leave a piece of heavy stone on a deserted environment, and fail to move it to a site with which it'll be used for construction, will it move itself??There's a post of yours I read -- 'bout a week ago and you were strongly against a SCAM,...I saw some deep infurations in your words(though, I can't tell who you're , trust-Wise), if you'd follow the already-trailed paragon of yours, then that'll mean bursting out scams....it's still something that could earn you a good reputation. If your motives are clear, you wouldn't find anything else too difficult; everyone started like you.I won't say more NYMIE....... AND STOP SAYING THAT' YOU'RE A MAIDEN(nobody gets entertained with that).

It doesn't mean doing it once and your off but, you've got to be active and consistent with your forum activities. There are so many users on the forum and one way to stay ahead is by ensuring your being active in most of the boards.Of course the forum is wholesome but, not as wholesome as you see it. Given that sme boards are looked at with much neglect by the elites of the forum and puts such boards on ignore. You frequent there, your likely not going to get noticed.But, getting noticed shouldn't be much of an issue. It's better you just keep trying to improve you and in your doing so, you contribute to the discussions going on across boards. That way, you gain and as well sell your name by the Knowledge you put across. Trying to force yourself to do things just to get noticed is one way to ask for trouble.",
