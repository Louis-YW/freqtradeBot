I heard that soon all exchanges will force users to provide their documents. And it makes no sense for you to constantly change the exchange for trading.I don’t think the safety is actually worth it considering the risk of losing ones identity, yes there are many cases where the KYC platform might be used to fish out a certain crime but at this tender age of bitcoin and the government continues disdain against it, then it will be at risk to get exposed as a bitcoiner. Although bitcoin isn’t frowned upon in the US where OP stays but imagine someone from a place or country where it is frowned then it will be tricky or risky to use KYC exchanges. So I would just say OP should rather go for not only non KYC platforms but also the decentralized exchanges, they provide more anonymity if you actually care for you privacyQuote from: ajiz138 on August 26, 2023, 07:40:24 PMI am now using MEXC exchange which does not require KYC maybe OP can try it?It is actually a two way platform with an option of non KYC which has its daily withdrawal limit at 30bitcoin but requires KYC for more trading volume which is of two different phase too the Primary KYC and the secondary according to their site. With a setup like this i doubt if the non KYC users can actually see do P2P, because this is the same thing KuCoin actually was before going almost full KYC",

I have alot of USDT sitting on the tron network so I need tron support.^ A piece of advice.A non-KYC exchange probably seems more lenient in terms of privacy and account setup, it is crucial to do your due diligence before trading on any platform. Some platforms that claim to be decentralized probably still have certain centralized elements, or they might not provide the same level of security and recourse as fully decentralized platforms. Before trading on any exchange, whether centralized or decentralized, make sure to research the platform's background, security features, user reviews, and any potential risks associated with their operations. Protecting your funds and personal information should always be a top priority in my own opinion.",

When you ask the person to pass KYC for you before, they will most likely make it difficult for you or worse, you will not be able to contact them anymore. Then your money will be permanently confiscated by the exchange. I thought about that, but it's still too risky and not worth the risk.",

Extremely unlikely. First off there are thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth, equipped with cameras, communication payloads, etc., which can track potential meteorites. Secondly, Earth's atmosphere is so robust that it can protect us from almost every meteorite we've experienced so far, as it effectively burns them up before they reach the surface.

I just don't understand why messing with a CEX and violating their terms, is better than just selling the stablecoin for bitcoin, and then selling the bitcoin to a DEX with high volume.

No, you can't even use the TRON network in decentralized, peer-to-peer exchange as far as I'm concerned, let alone to pay 10 cents for what you described. But this isn't the point here. The OP wants to sell TRON for fiat, and there exist services which can let him do that with absolutely no KYC required, neither with violation of any terms. It might come a little more expensive, but ultimately isn't it worth it? To me, the answer is yes.
