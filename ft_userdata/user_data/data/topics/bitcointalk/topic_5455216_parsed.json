For people wey no understand wetin Igebotz dun talk, the Trust system been dun change and even since new criteria dun come wey dey make D1 dey change monthly. Every first week of the month (mostly 1st of the month) we dey get new dt1 members which some old members dey still dey among but atleast we dey get some new additional dt 1 member because of the criteria wey Igebotz dun explained. As DT 1 dey change monthly that means DT 2 they also change, currently you no need theymos before you fit qualify for any of the dt levels DT na people wey DT1 dem trust but if person been dun exclude you from their custom trust list then you go need atleast two DT 1 to trust you before you fit become dt2. If you dey very active for scam bursting and people trust your feedback or your face show for the forum via merits and been included in others people custom trust list because dem trust your judgement then, you go fit make am into DT 1. Basically na something like politics now, you go need dey active, get a specific amount of merit and then atleast 10 people go include you form their custom trust list before you become DT 1 member.

You can ask question on English board on this forum too, if you have a valid question to ask. There are questions like this on the English board which are also answered perfectly and no one laugh at the people that ask the question. Helping others is what a forum meant to be and that is one of the reasons Bitcointalk is existing. Even if you do not want people to know that you are the one that ask a question, just create a new account to ask the question which is not against any rule on this forum.",
