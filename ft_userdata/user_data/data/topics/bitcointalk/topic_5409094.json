  "content": "Quote from: theymos on January 09, 2019, 06:03:26 PMFor years I've been unhappy with how DefaultTrust ended up as a centralized and largely-untouchable authorityHow it worked: Theymos adds some selected members as DT1 and the DT1 members add users in their network who they trust, they become DT2. For the record DT level can be extended up to DT4 (please correct me if I am wrong) but anything over DT2 is always ignored because it includes almost everyone which does not create any value for the network.The current DT network: In January 2019 Theymos decided to change the old algorithm. Without giving all responsibility to one member (theymos) he decided to have a voting system for DT1 members and the voting system allow to select 100 members in the DT1 network to make the entire network decentralized. Quote from: theymos on January 09, 2019, 06:03:26 PMSo if someone on DT1 is doing something stupid, you can ask other DT1 members to distrust them.TL;DR;The current system created an open area for anyone to be in the DT network. We add, remove a user in our trust setting depending on their judgement of feedback leaving to others based on how less is their retaliatory mindset. Obviously none of us are perfect, none of us are above our personal likes and dislikes. But when a user's feedback leaving is (1) clearly out of retaliatory, (2) clearly to hostage others to silent against him, (3) clearly based on inappropriate arguments, (4) clearly using it to scam others would you still add him in your trust network or you will tilde (~) him?Warning: Be BOLD and brave, who do not care for a negative feedback and a tilde (~) before leaving an opinion. Here are your examples:100% retaliatory negative feedback:In response to:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5408864.msg60704946#msg60704946100% retaliatory tilde (~)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407834.msg60709658#msg60709658",

      "body": "Well sir, I guess that being in DT1 is a responsibility for everyone that is into it. It means that you're reputed influential from the other members, and in my opinion this one should be used (in negative) only if there aresome serious risk of scam (or confirmed) from the users that is tagged, or if the user has an improper conduct. In case of positive one, you can leave a positive feedback to a user that does something of cool for the forum,or if he has always respected his business (this is the case of a user that is owner of a casino, or an activity here), or if he has a long story of scam fighting ecc.Any other type of use, like tagging someone just because is unpleasant, isn't a professional use, and in this case, you wouldn't be able to be in DT list.Keep in mind that here there are users that has additional earnings from signature campaign, bounty ecc, and tagging them means that you're going to damage his/her financial situation. So, in my opinion, you should bereally sure of what you're doing before leavin a neg trust.",

But any way let me try again.His feedback has no reference (he does not have one in fact) to response my negative feedback to him.He says I was posting lieHe says my accusations are baselessHe thinks its a revengeThe repeating part is not clear to me. More reasons,I did not leave red or neutral to bitlucy scam.From above which one warns a red tag or even a negative inspired neutral feedback?My feedback has a clear reference: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5408864.msg60704946#msg60704946First of all he did not pay user starmyc but silent him with his negative feedback. He did not reply to my PM and even still have not replied to me for a clear explanation which leads me to believe that he does not have one but scammed.More supporting cause Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on August 07, 2022, 04:33:50 AMI have my reasons explained in the reference. In short[....]2. His arguments are inappropriate and his use of red tags based on the inappropriate arguments. He did it twice (from the limited investigation I conducted myself) once for nemgun and recently for Royse777More and moreQuote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on August 07, 2022, 03:05:03 AMQuote from: JollyGood on August 06, 2022, 09:33:50 PMQuote from: JanEmil on August 06, 2022, 06:33:39 PM[......] It was on telegram where CEO used the user @BitlucyCEOHas notting to do with Royse777[......] Well it does not matter which employee or part owner of Bitlucy contacted you to work for them. Based on the facts as they are known thus far, Bitlucy was owned by two people: Royse777 and the Bitlucy CEO - therefore some would say it does have something to do with Royse777. [......] Are you saying for example, in a group of company if the chairman runaway with the fund resulting the entire company including their shareholders in loss, you are going to tag the chairman and all the shareholders? This is pathetic. You were the same pathetic against the user nemgun too.[......]  Let's be on topic.I have pointed out 4 inspirations for leaving a negative feedback in the starting topic.Quote(1) clearly out of retaliatory, (2) clearly to hostage others to silent against him, (3) clearly based on inappropriate arguments, (4) clearly using it to scam others(1). Which ones apply to his feedback left for me, starmyc, nemgun and Royse777?(2). Which ones apply to my feedback?Update: Quote from: examplens on August 08, 2022, 10:49:10 AMbecause this is your second topic where the discussion will be based on Jolly's giving feedback.Please read: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407834.msg60714131#msg60714131You will understand why the first topic was created, when the PM was sent and why this topic was created.",

I don't know if he called for the help of lawyers.I have Royse777 and JollyGood on my trust list, and I know they are both normal people. There have been several cases where JollyGood has changed or removed its reviews altogether. It's time to get used to his behavior. Furthermore, two reviews from one are equivalent to one.Royse777 got into history, and I think he will also successfully get out of it over time.But your presence here seems completely superfluous to me.

I change it a little bit to generalize the idea that is applied for every user.Quote from: dkbit98 on August 06, 2022, 07:55:18 PMIf any user has nothing better to do in his life than to write multiple feedback on your profile, that tells more about him than about you.Exchange negative trust feedback is unnecessary in most cases. I rarely put anyone into my distrust list but if I do, I will not likely to remove it. It stay forever but I don't see reasons why I have to leave any negative trust feedback on the user I distrust. Take it simple and reduce non sense drama.Quote from: theymos on January 09, 2019, 06:03:26 PMAll that being said, I still discourage retaliatory ratings, and with these changes I encourage people to try to \"bury the hatchet\" and de-escalate rather than trying to use any increased retaliatory power you now have. Also, it's best to make your own custom list, and you must do this if you want to be on DT1.",

The same happen when someone merited your post, you will merited his post too since you think he's a good and kind person. It's a human psychology, but in this forum such behavior isn't appropriate and it would make an abuse.What I'm thinking is how possible if theymos implemented a new system where we can't see the user who trust, distrust, give positive/neutral/negative feedback and merited us except both administrator and moderators.",

After the last update, you added a new reference link to your feedback, I read that topic several times and have not seen any misunderstanding, nor any complaint that someone was cheated or not paid. Just usually discussion, certainly not enough for any trust tag even positive. (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3160752)everything we have in the case starmyc vs Jollygood is an exchange of feedback between the two of them and a message to you via PM. unfortunately, this is not enough for anything, and without presenting clear evidence by any of them.therefore, you gave a negative rating based on possible unfair behavior in some deals. You have no clear evidence, even if you don't know what was the subject of the agreement, did they agree that the code itself would be part of the delivered work?it is evident that your negative feedback was given to him (Jollygood), provoked by your attitude and feelings toward him. I believe you know, such cases are more like a neutral tag, not negative or even positive.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on August 08, 2022, 11:52:21 AMHis feedback has no reference (he does not have one in fact) to response my negative feedback to him.it is interesting that he changed the tag to neutral, no matter how harsh and merciless he seemed when giving negative tags, however, he is ready to admit his mistake.QuoteMore reasons,I did not leave red or neutral to bitlucy scam.Only 8 users (including me) leave the neutral or red tag on Royse's account. Here are 100 DT1 members, I didn't follow if he tagged the other 90+. isn't this too much drama?Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on August 08, 2022, 01:57:40 PMQuote from: FatFork on August 08, 2022, 01:26:53 PM..I am confused the topic is losing it's merit because you are thinking it's between me and JollyGood.It does not matter if JollyGood change the feedback to neutral or remove everything.
