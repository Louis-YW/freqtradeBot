But they allow bitcoin deposit from segwit address. When you paste your bitcoin wallet address in binance's Address/Invoice option it will automatically pick the right network for your address if they support that network. So don't worry try to use all those addresses in the withdraw section to find out which wallet type you are using.  Usually most of the tokens in the ETH mainnet are ERC20 versions of them. There are other ERC standards for tokens available in the ETH network. ERC-721 Tokens.ERC-777 Tokens.ERC-1155 Tokens.ERC-4626 Tokens",

For other crypto assets (Ethereum, XRP, Stellar, etc.) the address stays the same.Bitcoin transactions are public information. Addresses should not be re-used for better privacy. Ledger Live automatically generates new addresses using standards (BIP32/BIP39/BIP44) and keeps track of your previous ones. Previous addresses do remain valid, but they don't offer an optimal level of privacy.Things like this also commonly happen to other hardware wallets, such as Trezor:Quote from: https://trezor.io/learn/a/use-new-address-for-each-transactionA fresh address is a newly generated address that has not received any previous transactions.
