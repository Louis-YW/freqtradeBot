  "content": "Im a fan of Peter Zeihan and in general agree with many of his arguments, such as China collapsing by 2030 due to demographics and Germany falling down the economic ladder fast due to its reliance on ever-more expensive fossil fuels. So that's why Im torn on his views on crypto - hes usually right. He goes on to say \"crypto is the poster child for the environment from 1990 - 2022 when we had unlimited volumes of capital. Now with that the money is going away, crypto is going away\"My take on this is that yes, while there will be less capital going forward, fiat is still created at the whim of commercials banks, therefore the idea of a digital cash that cant be debased is a powerful one. On future carbon taxes, which I agree with, the bitcoin network can easily operate on a fully renewable grid - the problem with renewables is they are intermittent and the energy requires storage. Neither of these limitations apply to the Bitcoin network. at 53min 20 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHUoMmKDLUI",

I mean there will be general carbon taxes across the US, Europe, parts of Asia and Australia (anywhere with strong social contracts). These will target anything using fossil fuels, not just bitcoin.

Bitcoin miners will automatically use the cheaper energy available. I agree mostly. In fact I believe there is no replacement for oil that doesnt involve lowering the worlds standard of living. Where I disagree is the plenty of reserves less. The EROI(Energy Returned on Energy Invested) of oil was 1/100, now its 1/15. That is about 100 years ago, for every 1 barrel invested we got 100 out of the ground, now its 15 (as its deeper and harder to get out, and its shale oil).",

I believe that there are more governments nowadays that are printing more money than ever. Big companies are still big and even some of them are taking advantage of this current situation. It is all about opportunities and these giant corporations are capable of doing so because they have the needed capital and influence. Let's just say that what happened to LUNA and FTX are the main reasons the market is still down. Not saying that bitcoin should pump and regain its previous highest price but without that bad news, bitcoin should've been at the $20k level something.When this world economic crisis ends, ordinary people will once again have excess money to invest in bitcoin. Bitcoin network depending on energy is not a big deal since there are always places on earth that are conducive for it.

We are going through a mild crypto winter and the situation will be normal again and we will see an influx of capital sooner than expected. It's just that FTX collapse and ongoing legal investigations against Binance are putting the market at risk and that's why a lot of investors are pulling away their capital.

Neither of these limitations apply to the Bitcoin network. The problem with renewable energy is that they require a large amount of investment, to begin with. Once it is set up and running, the operating cost is much lesser than any conventional source of energy. Such kind of large investment is usually out of the reach of a startup or a small company. We may see a completely different picture if the market comes back to its former glory so that mining companies are able to collect the fund. Right now it's somewhat dicey.",
