The thing is the government actually prefers a currency that is centralized and can easily be regulated due to that and not the reverse.Nevertheless it's still good news for it to have been approved as a legal tender since definitely there were people who were still using before the ban was lifted. The good thing about it is they would be less restricted and able to purchase and sell more easily.",

In short, I would say that when the chips are down bitcoin will save the day.QuoteNow, the government is allowing its state energy firm to use digital assets for fuel imports as crypto adoption gains momentum in the country.While they are allowing bitcoin to be used, they should also work on strengthening their local currency.",

From temporary solutions, it can become a long term payment method in the nation too.I am unsure whether Bolivia got any sanction so that they have big problems like dollar shortage in their country.Bolivia is one of few countries, still marks Bitcoin is Illegal according to these following maps. With the latest change in Bolivia, they need to update their maps for Bolivia.https://newhedge.io/bitcoin/legality-maphttps://coin.dance/poli/legalityhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/geoeconomics-center/cryptoregulationtracker/",
