Haha, a more interesting question besides the OP's Question is When will you Sell what you bought haha buying I am referring to only the Bitcoin... For me, Bitcoin will be never sold until I really need the money as currently, I am selling my signature selling time to time whenever in need. In the future when I will be a more independent man and the resourceful man I will buy and Hold for my coming generation haha..In 2140 my grandchild's grandchild will say haha what a Visionary Grand Father He was haha.

I think the answer here will be obvious. Majority here are Bitcoin holders, so you already got the answers. As for the price, there are a lot of speculations, meaning, just like you and me, we can make wild and educated guess that bitcoin could at least hit 6 digits as it goes for a new all time high.So if you are slowly accumulating Bitcoin at the start of the bull run and save at least .25 BTC to 1 BTC, then it's going to be a huge profit for you. And since we still have like months before the halving (catalyst for the bull run), you still have time to save and accumulate. There is no secret formula here, you can do DCA or buy Bitcoin at once and then just HODL on it. Put that Bitcoin in a wallet that you can total control and not to exchanges and you will be good.",

Since you mentioned BTC a lot then for sure majority here is also going to look or hold BTC for a long time and most likely those who have been in many bear/bull market knows how to play this game as compare to some newbies, just saying.In any case, you should also be doing that. I mean being a long time holder, or buy as much BTC as you can and simply hold and wait for the next ATH and take the profit. $100k? maybe, no know has the crystal ball to see what lies in the future. That's why the best approach is to just purchase while the price is still cheap and then we will see how far the price will go in the next bull run.",

Like, expanding the business that I'm running now, increasing capital to buy investment assets, as is the case with bitcoin/crypto assets and in gold or real estate assets. Maybe there are many more wishes that I want to fulfill, if I have a large amount of money.Quotewhich coin do you prefer to hold for long-term or short term and what do you expect from your portfolio?For the long term, it is certain that I will choose bitcoin to be my long-term investment asset in the crypto field. Because right now, I'm holding bitcoin for my long term asset. Then for my hopes for bitcoin, the point is that hopefully the price of bitcoin after the halving that will occur in 2024, can be more than $ 60k. Because that is the target price that I want, at this time the bitcoin hodl.then for crypto assets that I hold for the short or medium term, usually I don't just hold one coin. But I always hold some coins, like Matic, Xrp, Bnb and doge. Why I chose this coin (crypto), because this coin has good potential and its market price movements are very suitable for trading in the short or medium term.plus, the coins are ranked in the top 15 according to marketcup.QuoteCryptocurrency Prices Today by Market CapSource: https://coinmarketcap.com/id/So I hope these coins, can experience a price increase that is quite high in these years, so that in terms of profit I can get bigger.Quote~SnipI think BTC broke his ATH in the year 2025 and make a new ATH on 100k what is your opinion? A new ATH on the bitcoin price, indeed it could happen that year. But about whether it can be at a price of $ 100k, it is still not known. All investors can only speculate. So basically, just wait until that year and don't forget to keep analyzing the bitcoin market.",

It looks like you have answered your own question in this regard, because you yourself already know what a very wise choice for the long term. So you choose something that is not very wrong in my opinion, and in terms of achieving new ATH in Bitcoin in a certain year or in the year you mentioned, I think it is still a very active conversation now because there are many people who are speculating like that so there are many predictions starting to be born this year related to ATH that will be achieved by Bitcoin in the coming year.",

This will help cope up with the times when bitcoin price is low and you are in a bad mood because of it, important to keep you functioning during the bad times and pass through it without ending up selling or buying shitcoins.However I dont agree with your bitcoin beats fiat idea, I think both will co-exist to something even better.

It depends on altcoins, Not all altcoins is shitcoins if you have an open mind perspective on crypto. Project like Ethereum and Litecoin provides a good quality of Blockchain and running for many years same with Bitcoin. You are correct that the majority of altcoins is not for long term since it’s very easy to create tokens now with the use of smart contracts but there’s still gem altcoin that can be invested long term.Asset manager like grayscale invest on altcoins too. They have a deeper knowledge on trading and assets background check. They will surely not buy altcoin if they are just garbage.",

I like that you have tried to answer well why it should be Bitcoin. It's a coin that's always better to hold onto over the long term.$100k new ATH price prediction and many will agree on that price. By the way, you don't look like a beginner anymore because your thinking is like a senior in providing Bitcoin price analysis.How confident are you about the next ATH price because Standard Chartered has changed its Bitcoin price prediction from $100k to $120k next year.",
