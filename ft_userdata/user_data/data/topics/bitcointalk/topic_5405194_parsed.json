Regardless of the the type of trading you are into, always know that trading is risky, do not use more than the amount you can not afford to lose, beginners should even use less than the amount they can afford to lose.",

In arbitrage trading, traders look for price of coins on different exchanges and move the coins from one exchange to another, converting it to stable coin or fiat to make profit.In spot trading, you do not necessarily need more than one exchange. But in arbitrage, you need more than one exchange, if not more than one exchange is used, then it is not arbitrage. Arbitrage trading are completely different. I know about it, the reason I still have to exclude it is because I am not using it to make profit, I do not do arbitrage trading, but I know about it. The other types I mean I do not know about are the pool or something and trading on decentralized exchanges to make profit.",
