  "content": "Anyone know how to get it online at all?Like two months ago I sent 16$ of BTC from nicehash to Armory because I looked up what's a good wallet and landed on it. I got armory working and went straight to send money to it. Even though it clearly said don't send anything if you haven't gotten online atleast once, I sent it thinking I could just send it and figure out getting it online later. Well two months later I still have no idea for how to get it online and google doesn't help. I saw on reddit that you need the whole blockchain to get it to work and you can get it using Bitcoin Core. So I went and got Bitcoin Core but it turns out the whole blockchain is 450gb as of today, which I do not have. So, do I need the whole blockchain installed for Armory to be able to go online? How do I get armory online? I have a transaction ID for the 16$ I sent from Nicehash to the \"wallet\" but I have no way of accessing it. I want that 16$ badly",
