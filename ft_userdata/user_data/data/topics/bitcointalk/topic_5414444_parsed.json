  "content": "I'm one of those idiots who invested in a bunch of coins/tokens at the top and lost a load of money - around $35k in total  I sold all of my coins/tokens a few months back but I will be reinvesting in numerous difference projects again when, or if, BTC goes down to $14k - which I believe will be somewhere close to the bottom.Since losing the $35k I started trading using ByBit Derivatives and it's helped me to understand the whole crypto scene a lot more. I lost another $5k when I first started trading but since then I've done pretty well (mainly shorting) and I reckon I'm now around $2-3k up with the trading in total. I'm still massively down overall since getting into crypto though Anyway, regarding long term investing and whether I should use Spot, Margin or Derivatives... My plan is to invest in loads of different coins/tokens but if we just use BTC as an example... EXAMPLEIf I purchase $1000 of BTC using the ByBit Derivatives pair BTC/USDT (i.e. using USDT to purchase the BTC) and I buy the BTC when the price is at $14k using a leverage of 2x, please can someone tell me if I've understood the following scenarios correctly:1 - If, in a years time, the BTC price goes up from $14k to $56k, that would mean the price has multiplied by 4. That being the case, my investment of $1k USDT which I leveraged at 2x (so effectively invested $2k) will go up to $8k, resulting in $7k profit... Have I understood this correctly?2 - If conversely the price of BTC goes down from $14k and I do not put in any kind of stop loss, at 2x leverage I estimate my liquidation price would be roughly half of $14k so around $7k (maybe just over)... is this correct?3 - If I've understood both the above scenarios correctly, what is the benefit in using Spot or Margin? It seems to me that Derivatives does exactly the same as Spot and Margin with the added benefit of additional leverage if required! Is that not right?",

You can DCA, you can also wait until the price you want is achieved, but bitcoin may never get to $14000. If you do not DCA and bitcoin has not gotten to $14000 some weeks before halving, I will advice you to just invest.

I'm still massively down overall since getting into crypto though Derivative trading is very risky, best to get specific coins like bitcoin for it. Some traders would trade shit coins and continue losing, know that altcoins are more volatile, if you increase the margin ratio, it won't be good. You are now patient, just do not trade, best to just hold which is better. You can leave the coin after you buy it until 2025.

Same as to number 1, the calculator will be best here since for a year that would occur lot of fees too on your open position.3. Saying benefits is subjective, personally, for me, Spot has low risk compare to what does margin do but if you're correct on your position then it's totally profitable.

Getting up is of course a difficult process, especially for those who cannot afford to lose $35k and start all over again. However, I would emphasize here that the key thing is to learn from your mistakes, and although I generally understand the need of some investors to invest in \"numerous difference projects\", I cannot escape the impression that they are making the same mistake again and again.9 out of 10 such projects will fail in the long term (in less than 4 years), so it all boils down to the perfect timing of when to buy and when to sell. Everything else is speculation, including the fact that the price of Bitcoin must fall below $15k, which is not impossible, but there is also a high probability that it will not happen.",

It's normal when people enter first time in crypto they lost a lot due to no experience with the crypto movement. Who thought Bitcoin would be below $20K? Everything is possible in cryptocurrency, we don't know where is the exact bottom. But you shouldn't be selling your holding in too much loss. What is the benefit then if you can't hold a longer? Once dump means dumped, have to wait for recovery. Because you already lost, it won't be recovered if you sold. But you have to choose the right coin, not a shit coin or pump dump coin.

But as your experience, not all projects are valuable and survive to have a brighter future. Many are shit projects or scam projects. That is why I personally always avoid new projects, moreover that have not been listed in any exchanges or listed on DEX or low cap exchanges that only utilize the pump and dump process. this is high risk.It is true also that we need to diversify our money into several coins investment. But it doesn't mean that we must invest in numerous shit coins.It is better to invest in Bitcoin at first, and top coins. At least, we can decrease the risks. However those top coins are also valuable for long-term investment, althoguh right now the price still decreasing, but I beleive that this will be able to rise up in the future.",

Though if we are talking about long term trade here, I mean for just months then spot trading is really the safe option.

Therefore, the spot market is often referred to as the cash market.QuoteMargin trading is a method of trading assets using funds provided by a third party. When compared to a regular trading account, Margin accounts allow traders to access larger amounts of capital so they can apply to their positions.QuoteWhat are Derivatives? Derivatives are contract agreements entered into by two or more parties with the aim of selling or buying assets or commodities. Later, the contract will serve as the object of trade. The price of this contract value must be agreed by both parties.After you understand the three trades, you can conclude what trading methods are worth using or long-term investments, I can suggest for you the right long-term investment method you do is the spot method.Margin and Derivative methods are not appropriate / suitable if you use it as an investment method, the two methods that are the most appropriate for you to do are trading, because they have a third party.",
