And I wanted to share some of the rules I strictly followed here. It might help other traders and might add some value to the community here:Systemizing the learning processThinking on effective ways of learning.Build through small wins, not the biggest, but where's the easiest money for me to test and implement what I have learnedI learned that I mostly lost profits and even ended up with losses for being too greedy for more profits and deviating from my trading plan.Set your take profit, and stop loss along with the right position sizing. Have a clear plan for what you want to achieve. (To learn how to set up your stop losses and effective position sizing, you can find it here.) Don't let emotional elements affect your trading decision and harm your long-term profitability. (Automated trading helped me greatly with this and also with my trading discipline)Set a risk limit for each trade, but also for a day/week/month.Determine the right position size and start smallIncrease the size of trades slowly if your account growsLower size or switch back to paper trading if your account doesn’t.",

      "body": "Also it is a good advice for traders to use indicators and have excellent risk management plan.Many traders believe in stop loss, but I do not use that. The biggest failure of traders are the high leverages they are using to trade. A trader using high leverage to trade would be better to use stop loss.How about using low leverage? It is good. Assuming you have $1000 to use to trade, why can't start with $333 which is 0.3x leverage to open a position, if indicators failed after some times, you can then increase it to 1x leverage to bring the entry price closer to the mark price. While I can no more go more than 2x.Traders have different strategies, but I do not believe more in stop loss than to just start small below 1x leverage and not increase the leverage above 2x.",

If you deviate from that plan that gives you winning, you are likely to go into losing especially if the deviated plan is winning plan. Most times you don't realize this as the reason for losing or you don't understand you have deviated. I have experienced this often times to realize that this is a big issue and the this is caused by being greedy. A trader that is less greedy may be contented with a plan and if we try to have different plans, we lose alot.",

Obviously, be serious about learning trades to fully achieved being a good trader later on.With experience we will feel how to run the theory that has been given and we can know the trades that we are going through with some of the skills we can.We will not even escape losses because basically trading will definitely feel it but by building good risk management we can trade with experience which we do all the time and this of course requires a process with time taken to get better at it. Minimizing losses that were previously large are now smaller, it is much better but I think trading requires extra patience considering the bearish market situation which is sometimes difficult to determine the price even though it has been targeted.From all the theories above, of course, experience will be made into our learning in trading.",

Losing in trading is normal though, and the goal should be more about consistently than always winning, it’s good also to have a year end target profit and when you reach it learn not to be greedy.",

I do not see any reason for having a trading diary. As for me it is highly not necessary.

Is it beyond having specific leverage like not going beyond 2x, using just certain amount of money, not to let emotion to take over. Just like I have said, I see no reason to have a book for trading plan. The book I have then were the ones I read online when I was learning how to trade, I read and I understood it and see no reason to have a book for trading plan. I trade just BTC/USDT which makes the pair for me to be easy. Even if I want to have other pairs, I can save them as favourite on the exchange that I am using. All my last mistakes were known and I do not need any book to correct them. But what I just noticed is that the last mistake can be done again after emotions sets in just like I have said the other time, but you do not need a trading book to correct that, only what is necessary is discipline.Quote from: Mr.right85 on October 28, 2022, 07:43:02 AMIt might be in the indicators or signs and  being able to note them, read them and understand them when they occur could add to your success. Diaries keeps you on check with those.Let us be practical and not let us just be having the theoretical discussion. If you are a scalper, what would diary do? Also for day traders? Analyses made are just for that day or few minutes. Going to holders, they may consider diary, but yet the analyses can be drawn again if you are expert enough, but you may want to keep record of some long term analyses. If I am a scalper or swing trader, what is the function of a diary that is no longer useful for me as I make analyses based on minutes, hours and within a day?Let us take it back to the discussion. Using diary to correct past mistakes. I do not see it necessary and can make trading to be more complicated. Mistakes are corrected in a way you know it already and you discipline yourself for corrections.",

It's because they have to find the right technique and indicators for them, we all have different approach in trading and finding that will cost a lot but worth the risk. Trading is a very long term investment, especially on your skills, doubting yourself won't do any good so you have to trust the process.
