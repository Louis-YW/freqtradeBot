Posting plagiarized content is not allowed.[e]Quote from: theymos on September 23, 2018, 08:58:25 PMCommon rule violationsThese are the most common rule violations that newbies make. There are other rules than these.Plagiarism: If you copy some text from somewhere, then you should have a good reason for it, and you must link to the source. Doing otherwise is plagiarism. Changing a few words around doesn't matter. If we find that you plagiarized, then you absolutely will be permanently banned, even if we find it years after you did it.Quote from: hilariousandco link=topic=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1684035.msg16904309#msg16904309Warning: Anyone caught copying other users' posts or plagiarising content from elsewhere on the web will be immediately permabanned. You shouldn't need a warning to know that this isn't acceptable under any circumstances. Recently some plagiarized reports were handled without any punishment, no account ban (permanently or temporarily), no signature ban.Is this rule still applied?If it is not applicable, please edit those topics and that rule.",

I was surprised you did not come up with as many as possible users that plagiarized and not banned which is the only way you can defend what you are talking about. Above all, as there is plagiarism rule, plagiarism will still be solved case by case. I have noticed this forum do not take plagiarism lightly.",

And this rule still works: moderators block accounts.But this rule does not work when there is a paraphrase. This is the case for the last case, which is presented on the topic of plagiarism. Here, of course, there are questions. A person writes posts only to fill the quota set by his subscription company, and as we can see, he is completely far from sports. And just such a paraphrase looks very bright and noticeable. This user would probably be helped by the prohibition of signatures for any period so that he would accept and realize his mistakes.Be that as it may, this topic has already been discussed, and we are powerless to change these rules. The moderators have their own views on this. However, I don't think it's best to ignore plagiarism altogether. Since this will bring the forum back to the side of spam and garbage, which is something everyone here seems to be fighting hard against.",

If it were, the unofficial rule would have to be changed and it would have to be announced in Meta. The bad thing is that no one explains why these cases are not handled and leave us all in doubt.",

Mods: please give temp or permban as needed topic, members are slowly realizing that.  Somehow we went from people getting perma banned for copy/pasting one sentence few years ago while Newbie/Jr members (which was definitely overkill)  to allowing copy/paste on the mass scale without any consequences whatsoever.

The forum is completely private and depends on the decision of one person who obviously has no need to comment on the current situation when it comes to plagiarism. If we are honest, there are much more serious things on the forum that are not moderated, and I would not be surprised if plagiarism becomes one of those things.
