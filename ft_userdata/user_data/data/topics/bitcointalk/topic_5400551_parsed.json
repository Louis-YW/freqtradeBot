This might     publish the preimage of an incomplete MPP. (1a5ef554, e74e9d8e) * Hardware wallets:   - smarter pairing during sign_transaction (238619f1)   - keepkey: fix pairing with device using a workaround (#7779) * fix AppImage failing to run on certain systems (#7784) * fix \"Automated BIP39 recovery\" not scanning change paths (#7804) * bypass network proxy for localhost electrum server (#3126)As you can see from the release notes above (emphasis mine,) the pairing issue with KeepKey has been fixed \"using a workaround.\"  How do I know the issue is with the hardware wallet, and not Electrum?  The same pairing problem is endemic with the KeepKey and any desktop client I've tried.  The same problem with pairing is present with KeepKey's own bootloader and firmware update client.  The issue started after a firmware update roughly 2 years ago (IIRC,) and until now KeepKey has been unable to resolve their issue.  In order to pair a KeepKey with desktop clients one would have to run the application with administrator privileges.I just tried the new version with one of my KeepKey HW wallets, and it pairs up smooth as silk.  Kudos to the Electrum team for stepping up and taking care of their supporters.",

As we know, Electrum does not even generate BIP39 seed phrases, but still supports them. And within an hour of me opening the issue about the user who was having trouble recovering from his BRD wallet, SomberNight had already made the necessary changes to the code to resolve the issue and make recovering these types of wallets easier. So again, going out of his way to support a problematic wallet.I wonder if we'll see this type of problem become more common as we introduce more different address types beyond taproot.",

Please upgrade if you have not done so already.From what it was written in here the importance of the update was not so much obvious. Now it is. So, especially the Windows users, please update asap (myself included).Good catch.  Interesting that the release notes don't mention anything about that issue.  It looks like this attack vector could be used to brute force the Windows password of a user who opens a pay request using a QR code.  It's specific to Windows machines only, and only if you use QR codes to import pay requests.  It appears that versions between 2.1 and 4.2.2 have this vulnerability.  Here're the details I found on Github:Quote from: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/security/advisories/GHSA-4fh4-hx35-r355DescriptionImpactIn BIP70 payment requests, Electrum allows the ?r= field to contain file:// URIs (besides http(s)).The ?r= field can contain an arbitrary file URI, chosen by an attacker.A malicious merchant can provide a BIP70 payment request in the form of a QR code or text, which the victim user would then scan or copy-paste, as part of the payment flow. Electrum would then see the file URI, and try to open the file in read mode and read it. If the read succeeds, the data is parsed using protobuf.Specifically regarding the QR code vector, note that Electrum starts the BIP70 flow as soon as a QR code is scanned, without giving a chance to the user to review the content of the decoded QR code.The file URI support was originally added for local dev testing, with the implicit assumption that it is safe to open files on the local filesystem in read-only mode. This assumption is incorrect.On Linux/macOS, e.g. trying to read /dev/zero results in a DOS attack, where the application would run out-of-memory and get killed.On Windows, paths can be crafted that correspond to network requests, for example initiating an SMB connection. In particular, it seems that it might be possible for an attacker located in the same \"trusted\" Local Area Network as the victim, after getting the victim to scan a malicious QR code, to have the victim's computer initiate a same-LAN SMB connection to the attacker's computer, and to capture an authentication token. That authentication token could later be used to initiate an offline brute-force attack against the user's Windows account password.PatchesWe have removed the file URI support in commit b247aa5ffef0f9ef000772fcf9cd9c7141abded8.Electrum version 4.2.2 contains the fix.CreditsWe thank the Unciphered team, and specifically Frank Davidson <fd@unciphered.com> for responsibly disclosing this issue to us.",

In the 13 years since Bitcoin's launch, we already have many commonly used derivation paths and scripts.

Given that the problem described here was a legacy wallet sending its change to segwit change addresses, we could see the same problem in the near future with a legacy or segwit wallet sending its change to taproot change addresses (which Electrum does not support or therefore scan for at all yet). There really is no end to how different poorly coded wallets can confuse their users and hide their funds behind unknown derivation paths.

I agree, although this problem could be solved if someone contribute to add list of non-default path on various wallet. It could be either simple textbox (only showing pair of wallet and it's non-default path) or option (default path, enter manually, path of wallet A, etc.).A better graphical interface pertaining to derivation paths and multiple accounts would solve a lot of problems for newbies.  They did a good job with the interface differentiating between \"Legacy\" and \"Segwit\" wallets, but not accounts within.  I don't see hardware wallet manufacturers moving away from derivation paths for multiple accounts anytime soon, so I would be nice to see Electrum find a decent way to allow users to see those options during setup of a new wallet.Quote from: DaveF on June 20, 2022, 03:53:19 PMAnd it's all good until with them trying to clean up other peoples poor programming or documentation they break something or introduce a vulnerability.This has always been an issue with programmers working around other peoples code since forever, not just with BTC.Same with the keepkey issue.
