ThanksYou can stake BNB easily on there own exchanger Binance. The offering staking for 120 days min 0.001 Maximum 0.5 BNB 12.99% APR and 90 Days Staking Min 0.1 BNB and Maximum 500 BNB 8.69% APR. I think it is better  to take 90 days staking package here you can stake maximum of 500 BNB and you will get a good Return each APR",
