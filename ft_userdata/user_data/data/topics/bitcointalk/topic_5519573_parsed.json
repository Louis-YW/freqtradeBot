You can uncertainty in the article title, it's \"probably gone forever\".Exactly, this is crucial because once these Bitcoins are taken out of circulation, they’re no longer part of the available supply. This helps in calculating the realized cap, which is more of a technical metric. For regular investors or traders, though, this might not be essential. What we usually care about is the total supply and how many Bitcoins are left to mine. That’s the kind of data we use to analyze the market and make decisions.",

You can uncertainty in the article title, it's \"probably gone forever\".Thank you, very interesting stuff: the hodl-waves, i agree it seems an estimated guess. In every wave-layer there must be a fraction of lost coins, but in older waves the fraction should increase, because of time en e.g. innovation in storage and increasing value of bitcoin. However the function of the wave >10y is constantly increasing in time(if  you turn the wave), this pattern is different for ALL the other waves. I suggest the wave >10y is significant different, maybe statistical analyses of the waves can determine the lost fraction with a high probability, Thanks again for advice, i will look at it.",

Coins that have not moved in 15 years are not definitely coins that are lost!Coins that have moved yesterday might be coins that have been lost!Nobody in this world would be able to approximate this, not by a very large margin that is proven day after day that is wrong, besides, it doesn't even matter. Market cap and realized market cap are some indicators that mean little, a far more reliable indicator would be to gather all data from major exchanges that have existed for the last decade and look at the inflows and outflows, which would be far more interesting as it would actually tell you how much was invested compared to the current value of those investments.Quote from: Finestream on November 17, 2024, 08:20:50 AMWhat we usually care about is the total supply and how many Bitcoins are left to mine.

I don't think there's any tool or website for that, you'll have to write the code yourself. There's no essential information you can extract from that statistic, however. We frequently notice coins mined in 2010 being spent more than decade later. Lost coins are only the provably lost, which amount to less than 5 thousand. All the rest are just speculation.",
