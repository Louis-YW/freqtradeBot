Self custody allows you to make multiple secure copies/backups of your wallet which can make it a lot harder to lose. If an exchange doesn't have enough copies (such as due to problems with trust) then you've only got that to fail before your coins are gone.",

Nobody said that self custody was 100% risk free, but sometimes it is better to put your fate of safety in your hands than depend on someone that you will be unable to know exactly when they have been compromised. James Howells is one of the very many cases of carelessness, but it is also a reminder that it is also a possibility and something that can happen to anyone. As we are all considering self custody this sort of reminders that come through stories that loss is still possible is very important to make us aware that there are still risks involved.",

It's a number game and the lesser the affected people the better. Exchanges have a wide variety of loopholes from third parties like staffs who have access to secret files that can lead hackers to the exchange. Ideally, it's just one address that store the whole money deposited by millions of people. Unlike the self custody that the virus will have to work on one victim per time. Unless, it permeates a viral software used by multiple people.",

So I can pull it off the exchange to a wallet.Does all of the above sound convoluted and confusing?  Fuck yeah and it is convoluted and confusing.One simple example I mine say Doge on a pool.  When it is 1000 doge I move it to coinbase. it was not safe on the pool. it was not safe in coinbase .  I make it safe and change it to cash say 85 usd. I decide I want to do a monthly dca to btc for 200 a month. So I buy 200 btc a month from those sales. I then secure the btc in my own walletI do this 1 time a week. I create 52 entries when I move the coins to coinbase. I create 52 entries when i turn them to cash. I create 12 entries buying the monthly btc and I create 12 entries when I move the btc to a safe wallet.AT the end of the year. 85 x 52 = 4420 gross income from doge mining which ends up as 2400 in btc and 2020 in cash  will mean 52+52+12+12 = 128 entries on tax forms.or just mine and keep all the coins on the pool till late december. then move to coinbase buy some btc and hold the cash which is 4 entries on the tax form.Really long and complicated example but it is why people let shit sit on an exchange they do not want to do all of the above to keep a mere 4 or 5 grand safe.",

Are you technically literate.    * So you know how to sync data, & secure your device from hackers. *   2. Do you backup your data offsite.    * Do you backup your data using encryption.*    * Do you take that data offsite. *3. How many coins , are you trading.   * Multiple blockchains require multiple sync times.*4. Taking time to send coins to the exchanges, could cost the traders extra time and money.    * Fast trading times can sometimes make the difference, between earning a profit or a loss.5. Faster conversion to fiat if needed.Yes, if an exchange crashes you were better off storing at home, but if your House caught fire , or your device stolen, or earthquake or floods, then you would have been better off storing on an exchange.So while there are advantages & disadvantages to both, the user needs to decide which concerns are more important to them and their own desires.Their is no one decision that fits every user.So while self custody might be suitable for some, thinking everyone feels the same is naive. FYI:One little thing , if every single person pulled all coins off the exchanges, all exchanges immediately become insolvent,  then the Trading Volume collapses and all of your coin value collapses without constant fiat exchange.No fiat exchange, and your crypto coins become pet rocks, that no one wants.  *No Crypto Markets , No Fiat Value.*Be careful what you wish for.FYI2:A more prudent thought for many , might be to use multiple exchanges or keep crypto as a % of one wealth, not as the entirely of one's wealth.IE: Don't keep all of your eggs in one basket. * Until Crypto exchanges are forced to enact their own version of FDIC, which insures a value is available for withdrawal even after an exchange collapse, then you are in the wild west of crypto, just the same as banking was before the FDIC was enacted for banks.*FDIC: The FDIC is a United States government corporation supplying deposit insurance to depositors in American commercial banks and savings banks",

That is one of the ways centralized custody differs from self-custody.I don't think there is much risk associated with self-custody if you do your things with due diligence, the case of that guy not finding his hard drive was a bit of negligence, he didn't do proper backup nor inscribe his passphrase on a metal piece or safe place, it would have been easier to gain access to his bitcoin, self custody is the future of bitcoin and I love how everyone has woke up to the reality of not your keys, not your coins.",

Youre giving ownership over the coins to that exchange and they owe you the same amount back. This doesnt mean your coins are just sitting there and being kept safe for you. Theyre not your coins anymore. They can now do what they want with it. Theyre not letting them sit still. They give out more fake paper coins than they actually have in their reserves. Manipulating the prices and the supply on that exchange. Theres no way to verify the balance sheet of a company for any of us and not even proof of reserves will change that. And when they go bankrupt trough this scam, youll have to fight to get anything back. Leaving you with nothing.Coins on an exchange are not yours, your transactions can be censored, your wealth can be confiscated, you wont have any privacy and everything is archived, the supply gets inflated, the price manipulated and the reserves looted and forged. This is the complete opposite of what Bitcoin was invented for. Its was made to prevent these things.And the only way to prevent this is trough self-custody. There is no way around it. Theres not a single situation where exchange custody benefits you more and is safer than self-custody, when you take the other aspects into account. It is not hard or complicated to keep backups of 12-24 words safe. Write down potential threats and find a security model that works. Theres no reason or justification to voluntarily give custodians this kind of power. It is literally against your own interest. Self-custody is the only way to protect your own interest/ rights and helps your investment succeed. You dont try to drive a car trough the ocean and then wonder why you get rekt and it doesnt work anymore. And in the same way it makes zero sense to try to use Bitcoin in an custodial way. Learn how to self-custody safely(easy) and you will be fine and Bitcoin will be fine.Quote from: LegendaryK on November 16, 2022, 07:08:20 PMFYI:One little thing , if every single person pulled all coins off the exchanges, all exchanges immediately become insolvent,  then the Trading Volume collapses and all of your coin value collapses without constant fiat exchange.No fiat exchange, and your crypto coins become pet rocks, that no one wants.  *No Crypto Markets , No Fiat Value.*Be careful what you wish for.Bitcoin can be used as a unit of account without a problem.

The exchange and its owner legally owe money to users, and there's some chance that the users will get at least some portion of their money if the government will manage to seize anything. But with self-custody if you lost your keys, it's not likely you'll see them again.But typically in both cases the worst case is losing your coins forever, and it seems to also be the most common outcome when something go wrong.Self-custody is better than custodians because when it's done right, the chances of losing your coins are significantly lower. And it's not rocket science, people need to just use their brains and create multiple backups, instead of writing down the seed, putting it in a cabinet, then accidentally throwing it away with garbage during cleaning.",
