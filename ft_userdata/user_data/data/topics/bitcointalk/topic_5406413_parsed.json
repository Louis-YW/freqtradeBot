Also have a enough power if you distrust someone.QuoteTrust is Neutral called Black Trust.Literally black is just a neutral color and not be called as black trust.QuoteIf trust is Black then user can freely participate the Campaigns and he is also considered Legit. If trust is Red then the user is used be considered scam and that user can't apply in any Promotional Campaign in Future untill his total ratings are Black or Green. It seems like you're saying trust feedback is mainly used for signature campaign, while the truth isn't.Neutral trust doesn't mean you're legit, actually the use of neutral trust can be used for spammer or merit abuse etc that would make his account doesn't deserve to participate in signature campaign.While the negative trust doesn't always mean they wouldn't participate signature campaign, if the campaign manager allow it, they can still join.Quote from: Muhammad Shoaib on July 15, 2022, 02:21:52 PMIf you are here only for the Bounties then Trust System can be ignored as well if you work in a proper manner following rules other wise you need face the Problems in your Work with Trust system,How shame you're suggest a bounty hunter to ignore trust system...",

A user doesn't just unknowingly become untrustworthy, you took actions which the general community or some other users considered to be so.Quote from: Muhammad Shoaib on July 15, 2022, 02:21:52 PMIf the Profit Trust Rating is Green then the user is considered as the Legit to trade and Intrect because he is having good feedbacks by DT members. Trust feedbacks is only a suggestion. It is not an indication that a user is trade worthy or not. Check references on feedbacks and verify if it's correct based on your judgement.Quote from: Muhammad Shoaib on July 15, 2022, 02:21:52 PMIf trust is Black then user can freely participate the Campaigns and he is also considered Legit.Neutral trust is also not an indication of a legit user to trade with.",

I don't imply all things they write are inaccurate, biased with intention to scam but it is a minus point for their opinion.It is fine because the forum is not a jurisdiction and with decentralized trust flags, forum operates well with warning for users on potential scammers.",

The same can be said about the presence of positive feedback.The trust system is designed to alert users if they are about to have any financial transactions. However, the user can independently decide whether to trust someone or not.But when you become an advanced user, it is recommended that everyone create their trust rating.The OP didn't mention it, but LoyceV has all the information.",

      "body": "Quote from: Muhammad Shoaib on July 15, 2022, 02:21:52 PMTrust System is one the feedback system <…>In spirit, it is meant to reflect commerce related feedback, enabling the reader to first get a general impression of the trustworthiness of the account by viewing the three Trust counter, and then getting a better notion by reading through the feedback comments themselves. Alas, there is a fair share of feedback that is non-commerce related, which mixes things a fair share.Quote<…> If you are here only for the Bounties then Trust System can be ignored as well if you work in a proper manner following rules other wise you need face the Problems in your Work with Trust systemCampaign Managers, at least those that run the better campaigns on the forum, may well look at the Trust values when selecting their participants, specifically they may decide to not enrol people with negative Trust (ideally after going through the feedback – not just the Ratings). From that perspective, it’s something to be wary of.QuoteTrust can be changed or removed / depends on the the Feedback providers if you are made a Blunder then its near impossible if a small mistake or in Unconscious/ Unknowingly then tou can Convince to change the trust.Only the account that gave you a certain feedback can remove it. Although it can be changed or remover altogether if the person who gave you a certain Trust decides to, I recall seeing many cases where the feedback has stuck even if not commerce related, and what to say if the Trust sender leaves the scene for good.Quote<…> Trust Ratings Describe the power of profile and show's a clear image of user within the community that how much this user is considered legit or scam.\"Power\" is perhaps an extreme term. It’s like looking at a rank and being impressed by Legendries just because of the rank they bear. We really need to look at the details thoroughly to get a proper idea of what the account’s commercial history is like. For example, the Trust ratings on my account are essentially wrong, since they are not commerce related. I should really have a 0 positive overall Trust score (all ratings should really be neutral – although I don’t particularly favour mixing things in a commerce related feature).QuoteThere are 3 types of the Trust which are separated by the color based on the feedback users posted if the Feedback is negative then Score is counted Red and if the Feedback is Positive then it is counted towards the Green another type of the Trust is Neutral called Black Trust.Nowadays, the three counters are standalone, and I’d look at all three at a first glance, and as said, then the detail, bearing in mind that there is Trusted Feedback and Untrusted feedback (this latter is not part of the Trust score rating values).QuoteIf the Profit Trust Rating is Green then the user is considered as the Legit to trade and Intrect because he is having good feedbacks by DT members. If trust is Black then user can freely participate the Campaigns and he is also considered Legit. If trust is Red then the user is used be considered scam and that user can't apply in any Promotional Campaign in Future untill his total ratings are Black or Green. Again, only after reading through the comments. There are lots of accounts that have negative Trust for non-commerce related features. There are some campaigns that do happily accept negative trusted accounts, though they themselves do not tend to shine as very trustworthy.QuoteDT members: Basically there are two types of DT members DT1 and DT2Those are the default levels. You can actually include ratings from DT3 and DT4, but the default and recommended level is DT2 (which considers DT1+DT2’s ratings).Quotethese members can give you Green / Red Trust Ratings. Normally any user can give feedback for any profile but DT members Feedback is considered more appropriate and Worthy.They can actually also give you Neutral feedback, which may be relevant to the reader. DT feedback is important in the sense that it is included in the rating counters (as opposed to untrusted feedback), and that is what tends to catch people’s eye. Non DT members may also leave some feedback worth reading.Fun fact: Since DT1 members are limited in number, and change every month to some degree (DT2 does consequently), so may the Trust rating counters people view on profiles after the said changes take place (i.e. somebody’s counters may show as (DT view) +2/ =0 / -0 and change to +0/ =0/ -0 without any changes in the feedback). Custom Trust lists will make the values change even more so in general, thus the suggestion to read through both Trusted and Untrusted feedback (and the determine the feedback that you find relevant).",

As Unofficial as it may be, it speaks from experience with an evidence to prove. Hence, trust ratings visibility is mostly limited and issued out by DTs as these guys tries and seeks to be just in dishing out ratings.It's a clear cut between the unmoderated activities on the forum and it's saving a lot of usees on the forum as we know it.Also, users unable to dish out trust ratings that would be visible and warn others of an impending danger with a user or site, you can always call for a flag support by making your aligations in the reputation/scam accusation boards with evidence to prove.
