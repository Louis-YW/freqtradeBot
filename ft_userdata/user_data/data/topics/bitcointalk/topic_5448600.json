You can not earn anything by running either a Bitcoin full node or a Bitcoin prune node.To earn bitcoin, you must run your mining equipment ASIC to get mining reward. Nowadays, it is impossible to do solo mining because total hash rate is very high, difficult is very high and you must config your ASICs, connect them to mining pools and get mining shares for each block found by that mining pool.The advantage of running a full node is for yourself: privacy for your transactions and you can use coin control features better as if a Bitcoin wallet allows you to set up a node, it does allow you to use Coin Control feature.",

Remember, there is a risk with new projects, they don't always become successful, and your money invested on nodes can go to waste since the future is not certain I will rather invest in the project than its nodes.",

The real benefits of running a node are privacy, decentralization, learning more about bitcoin, and individual sovereignty.I personally love not having to connect to a third-party server to check my wallet balance.

Now my question to the community is; can I make money if I decide to run a Bitcoin node? The Node is an integral part of the Bitcoin network responsible for verifying transactions before they are selected by miners. Once confirmed by miners, the Node adds the transactions to the ledger, which is distributed globally to other nodes connected to the Bitcoin network. The main function of Nodes is to safeguard the Bitcoin network against fraudulent transactions. However, by running a node for the Lightning Network, you can earn some sats when users route transactions through your node. You should note that the primary purpose of the Node to Bitcoin is to protect and secure the Bitcoin network.",

You can't earn anything with your Bitcoin node, but you are going to have much better privacy for all your transactions.There is a chance you can make profit if you are running Lightning Network node that have low enough fees, but don't expect to get rich doing this.You can find many instructions online, but you need to have some basic experience with computers and Linux OS.",

You can only earn bitcoin by mining.",

I owned a full node running on my raspberry pi as well.Although you cannot really earn money running a full node, there are other advantages which contributes towards your privacy and bitcoin network's security.You don't have to depend on third party for exploring your BTC transactions and also you can help other nodes in validating the transactions.Running a bitcoin full node is like a charity. It must be out of your own will and towards betterment of the world.",

Running a full node won't help you earn Bitcoin because the creator didn't make BTC like that but it would be a contribution to Bitcoin since running a full node means you now one of the Bitcoin server owner which BTC data are stored. As you can read in most of the post here that it is a contribution if you run a full node. In mining, the more hashing power youe device have the more chance you mine a block and get rewarded.",
