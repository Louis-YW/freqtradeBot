The price of the slore coin has increased.I tried the service https://clore.ai/ and there are some points that I don’t like. On this service you must use standard settings for mining and for renting, otherwise you will receive negative reviews and the administration will not give you the MFP.At standard settings, my video cards consume more power and get hot. Lelom, this mode will be bad for video cards without ventilation, so I decided to stay in dual mining clore+zill.",

A very good tariff, but does it allow mining or do you have to steal mining from controllers, as miners do in Russia?If there are no problems with the controllers, then I would use all the maximum power for mining while the videocaps are cheap.",
