However I don't think there's will be a person need to think the money isn't need for the next 5+ years because it's really long to go and there's no way you can make a plan for the next 5+ years since anything can happen without you expecting.The most simple thing just allocate 5-10% of your monthly salary to buy Bitcoin.",

Telling someone to invest what they can afford to lose and telling someone to afford money that they won't be needing in the next five years is same thing just worded differently. Before one gets involved in Bitcoin he/she shouldn't come with the idea that Bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme one such idea has been eliminated from a newbie then such a newbie won't see any difference between the two statements in Op. So for me; first and foremost prepare the mind of the newbie for what he/she is getting involved into. You might decide to use the latter for them, but, what if an issue arise and they're unable to keep up with the five years agreement? So it takes a prepared mind to successfully navigate through situations like this.",

And of course investing with money that you have to be prepared to lose is fundamental in crypto investing and that is something that still needs to be said.But the fact is that most beginners always invest excessively at the beginning of their investment steps. so that not a few experienced losses at the beginning of their journey in investing in crypto. they know the adage about having money ready to lose. But beginners are more likely to still not be able to control their own psychology.I hope beginners also learn about psychology in investing. so that they are also mentally prepared and can control their own greed or emotions in investing.",

If it is bitcoin, that is also my advice, but some altcoins are just useless and if someone invested in it, the value can depreciate, some coins will not get to all-time-high is another thing. If it is bitcoin, it is worth investing. As for altcoins, during bear market like this, you can gamble with it with the amount of money you can afford to lose, but you can invest in bitcoin and still have the confidence that you will see positive ROI in long term.",

It's not that they want to learn what bitcoin is and what it is actually for. In addition, many of them do not want to learn, even they are willing to pay for trading assistance. Because I used to be the first one too, only then did I try to learn more through this forum.

They didn't want to stick around, and tried again for it which I met in my friend who studied crypto. They give up before they understand it well, probably because they have a job that is more certain to make money from the services they do.",

Many people think they can handle anything in a bear market but as time fly they become tired of it and start losing hope. I could remember someone in my school who bought 100,000 pieces of polygon when it was in few Cents years ago, he got tired of holding and sold, I tried changing his mind but I failed, later Polygon surge so much and he regretted his decision. He was not ready for long term holding and he thought he was. Its always easier said than done, I believe this is the right quote for this.",

Instead, tell the person invest in bitcoin but there is risk because the price is not stable. You can invest today with the price of 22$ and probably by the time you want to take the funds it might be at the rate of 20$ which means you are in the losing side. So when you invest in it you have to be attentive to the movement of the price for a very long period of time. And if the person likes the risk involve allow him or her to invest and if the person is not interested then let him or her go.Mate everyone needs money at all time. So investing money that one doesn't need is an understatement, that Investment money can be taken at anytime. Because expenses is uninvitable. So you might spent that at anytime. You have money and you an urgent matter to settle won't you spend it to settle the issue?",

In addition, everyone should focus more on promoting Bitcoin as a currency, and not just as a means to make a profit. Do not invest what you can’t afford to lose, will always be the most basic rule in any forms of investing. However, with bitcoin which involves high risk because of high volatility, I would not advise people to invest but most likely to learn and become knowledgeable about bitcoin. That way, if they have already understood completely about bitcoin, then it’s already their decision if they still wish to invest or not. But the moment they’ll start investing, they should also be responsible enough to think that bitcoin will never give them quick profits as it could be a good long term investment instead.",

However, we must be careful to choose the coins to invest in, especially when we are newbies. For newbies, I think under 5% is more than enough to use for investment. And only choose BTC for the safest investment.",

Basically or in the most simplest terms, just think of it as throwing away money and not expecting any profit from it or anything whatsoever. In that kind of mindset, you would be surprised to see that your cryptocurrencies would slowly grow from time-to-time. But of course in order to maximize your profits, you must be diligent enough to check its price on the market if your initial investment increased.",
