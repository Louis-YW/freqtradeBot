And your mum would constantly tell you if you don't get married nobody would take care of you when your aged. Nobody would make a tomb for you, and when you died you would go to afterlife with empty stomach and would suffer straving too in the afterlife. That must be a lot of hurt! ouch!So back to question. which is preferred? Married to fiat rich or crypto rich? Although crypto can be created at the comfort of your basement, also the value would plummet quickly to near zero too. Do you think in your life, you would ever see someone marry to crypto rich? btw recent news about ftx being rejected to sponsor a superstar due to it is unregistered tell me marry crypto rich might be a distance dream. Also there would be only 21m bitcoin existed, only 21m couples would be able to married rich. When there is billions of population, a lot of couples may not marry rich, due to unequal distribution, some of the crypto super rich would married hundreds of thousand more.",

And note, that not every rich person that will because of its rich and got married with thousands of women, that scope is individually perceptions and we are not meant to generalise it to anyone who are rich. So from my findings I comprehend that women and also men marry according to their choice, some people can be couples due to the source of your generated income, so it's obvious. So these, is also applicable to both side either male or female none is exempted in the aspect of choosing a partner.",

Just like someone that has gold and other precious metals in their possession, they are rich if they are many, it doesn't necessarily mean that they have the fiat money. So long as the crypto could at anytime easily be converted for its value, then it will always represent well.However, money is volatile, no one should depend on one investment because we don't know the future. I advise that whether you are having lots of fiats or crypto, try to invest them more in other things to spread the risk.\"Don't put your eggs in one basket.\"",

      "body": "You're contradicting yourself, OP. When someone is rich, it doesn't matter what he has in his possession to get wealthy; being rich is being rich, thus the comparison is unnecessary. When you suggest they'd be the only crypto-rich people in the world, the mentality of 21m bitcoin being owned by 21m couples after all have been mined is likewise unrealistic. As you mentioned, the value of bitcoin fluctuates, and there is a lot of anticipation that the price will be higher than it is now when the last bitcoin is mined. To me, if 1BTC is valued close to a million dollars by then, owning one-third of it will still make you wealthy in certain parts of the world.Note: Not all riches come with all the pleasures of life; some are a burden you can never get out of and will regret for the rest of your life. So marriage should not be intertwined with riches; they are distinct in their own right.",

Do people nowadays marry solely based on their partner's financial status? Our present-day marriages seem to have deviated from the ones our parents and grandparents had in the past. Instead of prioritizing love, our generation is more consumed with material possessions, that is why many marriages today don't seem to endure the test of time like they used to in the past, pathetic right!  QuoteSo back to question. which is preferred?

There are billionaires who have invested in various industries such as fashion, food, and beverages, and they have earned more money than some people in the crypto industry. The returns on these investments may not be as fast as those in crypto, these billionaires are content with their progress. I think the fast profits and gains associated with crypto have made some people complacent and lazy, neglecting opportunities outside the crypto industry.",

In general, as much as feminazism may say, women tend to consider several things beyond physical attractiveness when it comes to marriage, such as the resources the potential husband has or can attain. As in everything, there are exceptions, and nowadays that many women have resources of their own, they do not give it so much importance. But in percentage terms, they still give more importance to the wealth of the potential husband.So, going to the question you ask, I think it's bullshit. It doesn't matter and the one who is rich is usually not rich only in one thing. If someone gets rich with fiat, normally what he does is to use that fiat to buy houses, gold, stocks etc. And the one who is crypto rich I would say not so much but he also tends to diversify. So it doesn't matter.",

I'm not rich and I have nothing to boast about and even employed somehow but then, there were some of them that have been willing to settle with me and build our dreams together on our journey. There are women that are for the money and riches and that's normal for them to think about their security and future. But then, not all of them can be classified to have that standard.

Every dead bodies have their places, they can't be on the ground where people are living, if you died and you have no kids or family that can bury you, someone have to do it, for the health sake of people living in that surrounding. Things have gotten to hard in the world today that you will need money to survive, its true that no female will want to live with such a man who has no dream and I don't blame them, it can be very hard to get a partner who don't give a shit about the world and that's the type of people that makes a good life partner, you need a lot of luck to have such people in your life. Still I would advice any man to never marry anybody simply because you have a lot of money, having money can be a curse at times, it is better to pretend and live a lower standard lifestyle to attract those that will love you for who you are and not your money.",

And your mum would constantly tell you if you don't get married nobody would take care of you when your aged. Nobody would make a tomb for you, and when you died you would go to afterlife with empty stomach and would suffer straving too in the afterlife. That must be a lot of hurt! ouch!So back to question. which is preferred? Married to fiat rich or crypto rich? Although crypto can be created at the comfort of your basement, also the value would plummet quickly to near zero too. Do you think in your life, you would ever see someone marry to crypto rich? btw recent news about ftx being rejected to sponsor a superstar due to it is unregistered tell me marry crypto rich might be a distance dream. Also there would be only 21m bitcoin existed, only 21m couples would be able to married rich. When there is billions of population, a lot of couples may not marry rich, due to unequal distribution, some of the crypto super rich would married hundreds of thousand more.I really don't understand the way of thinking that you convey in your writing, it made me think several times but to no avail.What is clear is that if life wants to be better in your family as well as you have job security or anything that can support your marriage until old age, whether in the crypto or fiat industry, it depends on how you get income from it or synchronize both of them to draw profits why not do that .Don't think that you have to marry a rich person from crypto or fiat, basically both are the same and it's not a mandatory requirement for you to marry a rich person.It should be remembered that wealth is not everything because it will fluctuate like the market, or in the most trending words \"the wheel of life rotates sometimes above and sometimes below\" you should understand that.",
