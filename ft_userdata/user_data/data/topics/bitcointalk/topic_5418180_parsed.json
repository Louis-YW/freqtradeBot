I don't think mining is of interest to a large number of people at all because of its cost and shallow profitability. It is much more profitable to spend time on popular business models of earning token or mint NFT and any web3 initiatives. This is what the crypto community is interested in now and will be interested in the future. This is just my opinion.",

First Pi Network and another one if I'm not mistaken mangos coin long gone. But actually these two coins are not really obtained from mining, specifically for the first PI Network because there is no power used from the phone looks good but that's precisely the peculiarity, while the second there must move your cellphone continuously until it reaches a certain amount in a day and can be withdrawn to exchange and convert to btc (I got much profit on this coin). So to my knowledge so far there hasn't been a project that could actually implement that and I doubt it could be implemented in the future as well.",

Honestly, I don't think it will work.

Don't get your hopes up and think this will become a thing, there is no way phone mining can become the next big thing. There is nothing like phone mining in the first place. Can you list how many trending coins are mostly based on cloud/solo mining? If you must know, people stop engaging in cloud mining long ago because they are mostly scams, you are pretty much wasting your time and resource thinking you are mining. The next trend is nothing close to mining let alone phone mining.",

It's only starting to get hype because of that pi mining but people shouldn't believe on that as it was a scam. There are other legit phone mining app like electroneum but I think they aren't that profitable and you can only end up paying more for the electricity for your phone maintenance as it will likely be damaged from continuous use of the app.If you want to earn a crypto then there are more better ways of doing it. Crypto trading, investing, working online as a freelancer can be a few examples. You can also do bounties and airdrops.",

I have a social media friend that flexes her brand new bags and other haul that were purchased using Pi Coin, I was amazed that someone really accept that coin but my perception to that coin will not change.

There's no urgentcy to do that other than creating fake hype by using the world mined from your phone. Im not even seeing any usefulness from that thing. Im tired to see that a newbie keep believing with that BS. Using your phone to mine a coin will not be considered as crypto infrastructure caused by it contributes nothing for the blockchain ecosystem. The real blockchain was actually decentralized but after i have seen the mechanism about how mining from phone work and then i do believe if these are only full with BS. You basically did nothing with your phone and then developers were adding some number in your balance (wallet)",

This has become a risk for founders to understand the market situation, because those who actually realize real projects will last a long time. Electroneum is a good project and they are still alive today but, didn't see any new ATH in last bull seasonI wonder if what are those 10% who are not included in the bear market but they can be a mixed of coins that are from the top and some coins which are not really that known. What I know is that eth, matic, sol and bnb have showed a good increase last time but some of them have decreased again later on.Bear market is a time for accumulation so if you are a founder or developer of a coin, you can try to deploy your project during this season and expect that people will buy it. More if they find potential about your project. If electroneum is a great project then there is still a chance for it to experience an ath and it could happen once this bear is over.",

You'd just do it for fun, rather than profit. There were tons of CPU-mineable coins which turned out to be a failure in the long run. Electroneum was one of them, followed by Pi Network and several others. Back then, there was a coin named \"Magi\", but the original developer abandoned the project some time ago. The community has taken over it, but it's not the same as the good-old days. What I like most about the coin is that all miners are equal on the Blockchain. There's an algorithm which penalizes big miners by reducing the block reward. So you'd have to mine with very little hashrate to get the most rewards out of a block.If other CPU-mineable coins copied Magi's model, they would've been much more decentralized and equitable by now. You can still mine Magi (XMG) on a phone, but don't expect to get rich anytime soon. With GPUs and ASICs being extremely profitable these days (although energy costs are increasing at a fast pace), less people will be inclined to mine crypto on their phones. Just my thoughts",

      "body": "I can see that TAU mobile mining has already been established since 2 years ago. I was a  miner of that coin. The current tech is focused however in decentralized web 3 model, initially at messaging. It would literally mean no restriction from posting or joining groups. Mobile mining tech does not rely on POW or POS obviously as what most of the comments here seem to know. It is far beyond the likes of electroneum or even Pi. Those are all simulated mining, which as we all know, is not real mining. TAU mobile mining concept derives from having no central servers ( such as facebook, twitter, telegram etc.) while utilizing the least possible data consumption on a daily basis. And yes it is a hard code to make since there is literally NONE to copy from. Blockchain nowadays are focused on speed of transactions while neglecting decentralization and security.How decentralized can TAU get? The groups you create on app are totally controllable only by you. Even the team cannot control them. People cannot be removed from the group and messages cannot be deleted ( as they are hashed on chain ) If  you think at it, it is actually a great way to hide messages and have a discreet communication. So far, this is what I understood about the project and tech. I do not understand codes nor have any skills so you are free to check on their codes since they are public and open-source anyway. If I would put it in line with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it should be as follows:Bitcoin - Proof of Work - Digital gold - FinanceEth - Proof of Stake - Smart contract - TAU - Proof of Transaction - Communication",

You study other protocols such one of Proof of Transaction TAUcoin is using then start criticizing mobile mining. Other projects such as Electroneum and Pi and others obviously only copies code from bitcoin and ethereum and the likes so mining on  mobile phones wont work. TAU seems unique in their approach since they also tried IPFS in mobile mining and although it seemed to work on the beginning, even IPFS consumes resources. Even with all their work, \"mobile mining\" seems impossible since all we are familiar with are  bitcoin and eth codes.Remember, internet was once an \"impossible thing\".
