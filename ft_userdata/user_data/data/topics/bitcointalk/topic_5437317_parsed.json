So yeah, that's my Only ever experience with so called lucid dreams, and I personally find them fascinating and would love to explore that field more later in life ^^ You can never learn enough about anything haha!",

      "body": "A lucid dream is a type of dream in which the dreamer becomes aware that they are dreaming while dreaming. During a lucid dream, the dreamer may gain some amount of control over the dream characters, narrative, or environment;[1][2][3][4] Lucid dreaming has been studied and reported for many years. Prominent figures from ancient to modern times have been fascinated by lucid dreams and have sought ways to better understand their causes and purpose.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dreamI had to Google it to find out what it was. I have never heard of this practise before but it does sound very interesting. I will report back if I am able to take control of my dreams & master this.",
