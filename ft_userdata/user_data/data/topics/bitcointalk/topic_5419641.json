Do you want to verify a message? If so, signing and verifying messages isn't supported by the mobile version of electrum.",

Verifying an address is more commonly done when you pair Electrum with a hardware wallet, and you then verify the address on the hardware wallet's screen matches that being displayed by Electrum. With Electrum on a computer, you could verify that you do indeed have the private key for the address you are being shown by signing a message from that address and then using an independent tool to verify that message. The closest you can come on Electrum for Android would be to export the private key for the address to an airgapped computer and ensure that the private key does indeed generate the address you are being shown, but this is a much more complex process and involves handling your raw private keys which puts you at a significant risk of your funds being stolen.Since Electrum on Android is a hot wallet, you should only be using it store very small amounts of funds, and so most people simply trust that their phone does not have any malware which is modifying the address they are being shown. You should make sure you downloaded the app from https://electrum.org/#download and verified it prior to installing it, rather than downloading it from the app store.The 2FA part of your wallet only comes in to play when you try to make a transaction.",

I explain two kinds, the first default_wallet and the second 2FA. Only limited to how to make.Split: How to create an Electrum wallet on AndroidThe use of the Android version of the Electrum Wallet in my opinion is limited. Better to use the desktop (PC) version as explained by @o_e_l_e_o",

I mean don't put it together. you have to create new wallet when next use it for pc, don't put your money on the same address on mobile and pc. better for big money to use pc, when small like 0.001, mobile is good, because very flexible if you have travel to anywhere.",

The more instances of the same wallet with the same seed there are, the greater the chances that malware or a user mistake will cause the information to leak from somewhere that could result in the loss of coins. So it's a good idea to have separate wallets, sure.  Quote from: Sarah Azhari on November 11, 2022, 04:18:48 AMbetter for big money to use pc, when small like 0.001, mobile is good, because very flexible if you have travel to anywhere. It depends on how you use your PC. A computer isn't safer than a phone if the person using it has been infected with malware, clipboard hijackers, password stealers, and generally has no idea how to keep it safe. And if he isn't replicating those activities via his phone (hard to think but still), the phone might actually be safer.      And also: small to you can be even smaller for someone else, or it can be an enormous amount. 0.001 BTC converted to USD is just a tip you leave after lunch, or someone's weekly salary depending on where you are in the world.",
