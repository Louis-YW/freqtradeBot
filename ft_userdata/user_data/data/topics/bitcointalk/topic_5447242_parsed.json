  "content": "In the past, what I did was joining 2-3 signal groups and buy/sell according to their instructions. However, I realized 2 points.1. No one can generate signals with a 100% accuracy.2. When the winning percentage is 80%-90%, we have to make use of all the signals to get that percentage. For example, if the results are1-Win2-Win3-Loss4-Loss5-Win6-Winand we only take 3,4 and 5 trades, we are in a loss. Therefore, now I am not doing trading all the day. When I am free, I spend some time to analyze the charts and find some opportunities to enter the trades. Please share if someone has a different story.",

Nothing is 100% in joining group to trade. If you have a little idea about trading then you can build on it and gradually you have a better progress in your trade by studying and mastering your indicators and chart.",

Don't depends on others analysis they might be using you for their own benefit and just like what you said they can't generate signals with 100% accuracy. Did it ever cross your mind that what if that one person giving signal was also receiving signal from the other?Learning is free in the process and you won't be spending too much money except of your time reading and learning while applying it. It might not be profitable at the start but if you can manage to master a strategy where you can make profit then that's the start, the results of your learning.",

Extra benefit when you study yourself, you will take much less time to take each decision, and you will be able to manage the risk and other factors in the trade management.",

      "body": "I think enough has been said about trading signal groups. Most of the time they're just a pump & dump group where the owner will buy some coins, put the call on the group and then dump on newbies like you. If you can't make an analysis on your own, using a bot to analyze the market is better compared to following trades. At the end of the day though, bot or something similar is just a tool. If you don't know what they're doing and what indicators they're using, you won't get anything.Try to check out demo trading that is available on some platforms if you want to get familiar with some trading tools/indicators. You don't have to spend money when you trade there. After you're familiar with some of them, spend some time trading on an exchange or P2P market, if that is available to you. Trading needs discipline, you can't buy them with money, unfortunately.",

No one can generate signals with a 100% accuracy.Correct, Trading is based on understanding the current market condition and outwitting other traders to get profit because all the profit comes from the other trader pocket. There’s no way to win 100% if you are battling to other people that doing same strategy as yours.Quote from: Mudara on April 02, 2023, 12:15:05 PM2. When the winning percentage is 80%-90%, we have to make use of all the signals to get that percentage. Correct again, As already point out on your point one. There’s no traders with 100% accuracy. Picking random signal from different traders will just exposed you to a more potential risk if you are unlucky on picking the losing trade. Ypu will not availing this kind of service if you can trade on your own so better stick on one trading signal with a better accuracy.",

If we trade all the time, it feels like we are pushing even though we are not in a good situation in the market for us to enter. If we follow the trading signals that many now provide, sometimes they give signals in a very short time. I was wondering how do they analyze it so they can quickly give a signal? Are they that good at analyzing? because from what I've experienced, determining when we should enter is very difficult, it must be with really a lot of knowledge.",

If a trader continuously doing this, then he will not be able to become a genuine or professional trader. Moreover, all the trading paid platforms I have seen so far, even after giving the signal, they have written that invest in your own risk. In that case, the risk will still be yours, but as a newbie, you can use some genuine platforms for trading Still I would say learning to analyze the signal yourself is the best option.",

It's important to understand that no signal or strategy can guarantee 100% accuracy, and traders need to be prepared for losses as well as wins.Joining multiple signal groups can be helpful, but it's also important to do your own research and analysis before entering trades. It's a good idea to have a solid understanding of technical analysis and market trends so that you can make informed decisions.Additionally, as you mentioned, it's important to take all the signals into account and not just the ones that fit a specific pattern or strategy. This can help to improve overall profitability and reduce losses.Ultimately, every trader will have their own approach and strategies that work best for them. It's important to constantly learn and adapt to the market conditions, and to have a solid risk management plan in place",

In addition, now I realize that everyone's trading style is different, everyone has different technical and fundamental analysis.So now I prefer to practice my own strategy rather than relying on other people, because this has proven to be more effective even though I experienced a loss, but at least this can be a learning material not to repeat it and be a little more advanced.
