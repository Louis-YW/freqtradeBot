If you were to use a centralized exchange, just stick to the bigger well-known exchanges, my guy. Don't risk using unknown exchanges.I agree with you @mk4. OP should use buffer exchanges that already have their reputation and not a small unrecognised exchange. This is because they are not yet reliable and you don't know how much that they have, they might have come out to scam people of their money, also these small exchanges is prone to attack because their security can be breached easily.The only thing that I will tell you to do, is to relax till the given time that they gave you and try to withdraw again. If your withdrawal is successful, you should use a reputable exchange, and if you are unable to witdraw, it means that you have been scammed. For decentralized exchange you can use bisq and if you don't care about your privacy, you can use a centralized exchange like Binance, Coinbase, Kucoin.",

You won't be able to get those funds back in anyways, it is better to repost this exchange to your local authority. They might be able to give you more details or even might be able to get your funds back. Never use any exchange that comes up with lucrative offers for opening up an account and making a trade. If you want to use a CEX then there are many trusted ones like you mentioned Coinbase. If you are using an exchange for trading purposes then do not hold large funds in your exchange wallet. Always use non-custodial personal wallets for holding funds.",

Maybe for some extra bonuses or offers? Or did they somehow promise to give you some percentage of the money after you successfully withdraw some amount of money?Sorry if you don't like this question but even a beginner will feel somehow about this exchange, the name alone is a big turn off, and I can remember that something like this was been shared to me on telegram but scammers, they pretend to be in trouble and they need someone who can do the withdraw for them in exchange for some part of the money? Why would anyone use this exchange in the first place if something isn't fishy? Even those who are not into crypto knows Binance exchange, some don't even know how to use the exchange but they know its a place you can sell and buy crypto, even those that don't know Binance knows how to use google search to find top crypto exchanges, sorry to say but this is a scam and you are already a victim, next time don't use creepy exchanges for any reasons, always do your own research first.",

I had done several withdrawals to see if I could trust the site. There was also some issues with sending digital crypto to a coinbase crypto that was unsupported According to scamdoc, the domain is just less than 6 months old and the trust score rating is bad.  There are many good exchanges you'd have opted for, but don't know why you had to settle for such an unpopular exchange. It's not on the list of coinmarketcap exchanges nor to talk of top 100 exchanges. The exchange is a scam, and if I were you, I'd not bother submitting my personal documents for KYC verifications, because they'd steal your data and still you'd not be able to withdraw your funds.",

Or you are just randomly searching and bumping into this suspicious fraudulent website?By the looks of it, I assume that you were still a total newbie (not just in rank alone) as you are in a rush and not taking time to research first before engaging. Sad to say that due to engaging in a fraudulent website where you do not have the control of your BTCs, there's no way that you can recover them where the ones behind it may likely going to shut it down and ran away with your hard-earn money.Worse is if you have submitted KYC to them that would lead to identity theft. It's hard to accept this loss of yours, but it is what it is and we cannot do anything about it. This is gonna be one of the hard lessons that you will ever learn in the BTC and crypto space.",

There was also some issues with sending digital crypto to a coinbase crypto that was unsupported Doing arbitrage trading is restricted, this was new for me, maybe it might not be in there policy, because not every exchange restricted it. I never heard about this exchange and never even faced it even by accident. But the domain name arose a skeptical thought in my mind that this might be a fake exchange. Who told you to use this exchange, like how did you found it. I think you are new to crypto and don't know much about crypto exchanges.Because if you will have any idea then you should be preferring top crypto exchanges, because that's the best practice to do, and even if you are newbie you should have check the authenticity of the website and must check how old this is and how many review it have, even if the reviews are fake, so before using it you should make this topic.I feel sad that your funds are locked there for months for no reason, but you should contact the team to unlock the funds maybe they might give you some way to do it, but for that the exchange must have to be a legit one otherwise its sad to say but your funds must be gone.",

Yes, even I haven't heard of this new exchange platform before. Through searching for \"Multi Banks\" in the search engine, it became clear that the scam fake domain mentioned by the OP, from which he couldn't withdraw his funds, is not the official domain of MultiBank Group. I honestly don't understand the wisdom behind using these lesser-known and unrecognized exchanges. Perhaps it's due to the tempting offers they provide. I agree that he may have used this fake platform based on recommendations from strangers and fake accounts that appear to be bots. It's sad for what OP lost, but he is okay as long as he learns the lesson and won't repeat the mistake again.",
