Im so bad to see even those UST holders claimed to be stable token has been loosing their money. What a big shame. This foundation can't even build a proper stable token that truly pegged with the dollar value. So, any implementation other than using the real dollar to back the stable token was a big lie. People are distrusting this foundation and the price of token plunged so hard",

Imagine if bitcoin pump, obviously others will recover too including luna and ust. However knowing stablecoin can be depeg such as this is quite scary. Especially I am taking advantage of their 18 to 19% apy now its down. But I do hope it could recover pretty fast to avoid such panic sell",

Since Bitcoin crashed down to $30.000, they could no longer keep the peg to $1. Please, correct me if I'm wrong, that's what I quickly summarized in all this panic.
