  "content": "Hi Community. I am naim027 on my alts.I hope everyone doing well. As you guys know, I got banned permanently, but I keep getting notifications from the Telegram bot, and I am watching discussions about myself. Lovesmayfamilies keep saying I have lied at every opportunity. I would like to say that I didn't lie. In my first response, I have already stated that I did that a few more times without knowing the rules (see the quote).Quote from: naim027 on May 13, 2022, 08:57:05 AMWell, I don't have an explanation on this matter. But, As far as I remember, Not only this, but I did this a few more times without knowing the rules (As I have already said that those few weeks were my newbie days). Later someone from the WO thread warned me about this that I cannot share an article (or a part of the article) if I am not an original author. Later I edited the post and added the source link. Maybe this is one of these and I haven't edited this one (Added source now). So this is my responsibility. Good catch BTW. Edit: I just found that post that psycodad and LoyceV was guiding me to not post articles/part of articles without source:Quote from: psycodad on November 19, 2021, 10:06:36 AMQuote from: naim027 on November 19, 2021, 09:54:23 AMFor bitcoin, upside momentum continues to slow on the daily price chart, suggesting continued profit-taking among buyers. And the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is not yet oversold, which provides scope for further downside in BTC over the short-term.The 100-day moving average, currently around $53,000, could attract buyers similar to late September, which preceded a price recovery.For now, intraday charts appear deeply oversold. This means buyers could defend immediate support around $56,000, albeit briefly given strong overhead resistance on the charts.Please be careful posting full identical sentences from i.e. Coindesk as if they were your own statements, it's called plagiarism and highly frowned upon around here:LoyceV also mentioned me at that time:Quote from: LoyceV on November 19, 2021, 10:32:26 AMQuote from: naim027 on November 19, 2021, 10:27:28 AMI am not original author at Coindesk. Is it forbidden to share the news here?Plagiarism will get you banned. You should edit your posts and add the source (link) to all of them.Even if you don't get banned for plagiarism now, it can happen years later.LoyceV asked me to edit my posts and add the sources. I have edited a few posts, but I could not edit all of them because I forgot if they were copied or not. psycodad and LoyceV warned me on October 19-2021. After that, I never plagiarized. Before November 19-2021, I made a maximum of 70(+-) posts. The post they reported was before this date. So, My question for the community is, How still I am a liar while I never plagiarized after November-19-2021? Here is another reason they call me a liar. Once I commented on the Unofficial rules thread, I said, \"I found this page, and this is helpful.\"To be honest, that was a shitpost to increase the post count. This post was my 12th post in this forum. After this post, I was not there for another six months.So, at this moment, I feel shy to create a ban appeal thread just because the community already believes that I am a liar. I don't know why people are so aggressive at me. I didn't poke at anyone's balls.I cannot express my feelings by writing. But, this is not good for me. I am trying to take a break. But, This forum has become part of my daily life. Last words: I don't know why people still say I am lying after I answered every question. A single man cannot be good in everyone's eyes. There is no one in this forum who can vouch for me because I didn't make any good relationships with anyone. I apologize for what I have done before. I also apologize to those who were getting rude behavior from me (if anyone). I am requesting Moderators to review my case and take an action if possible.Username: naim027Regards!Naim027Quote from: LoyceV on May 21, 2022, 09:07:07 AMQuote from: Dic3L0v3r on May 21, 2022, 08:58:30 AMOnce again, I am willing to accept a sig ban for a year or more. Will appreciated if they reduce the punishment.You're missing the point: read theymos' quote again. What good have you offered the forum, and what good can you offer in the future?Well, That's a hard question for me I guess. I am not a guy with an extraordinary talent like n0nce. I am an average person.The good thing I did (In my opinion)-I helped newbies answering several questions on my local board thread (would be great if someone from my local thread can confirm) (post 1, Post 2, Post 3,  Post 4, Post 5, Post 6, Post 7, Post 8Exposed some bounty cheaters (Later stopped because I realized they keep creating new accounts. Someone said I left some useless feedback) Post 1, Post 2 Post 3 Post 4, Post 5, Post 6 Post 7, Post 8, Tried to help others with some information (Midas Sticks Investigation 1) (Midas Sticks Scam Final Report) Exposed some scams website (Cloud Mining Scam, Binance Doge Scam Removed some Video content that promote scams with the help of forum membersFor now, What I can promise, I won't break any forum rules in the future.I will help others in every possible way I can.Guide newbies from my experienceI can help others with GPU mining (The only field where I am a bit veteran)I am not sure if that's enough. But, all I can do is help others in every possible way.",

If a person knows what he writes about, he will not copy it. You didn't check all the posts thinking you were lucky.

I have these to say in your case;One fastest means I use to determine a quality poster is the calibre of members that merited the user. If your merit fans span across reputable forum users, I will believe you are a quality poster. I came to this conclusion because it is easy for a quality poster to discover a quality post. In your merit fans I saw The Pharmacist,  LFC_Bitcoin, Ratimov, Fillippone, LoyceV, El duderino_, hugeblack among others, Welsh, Pmalek, Poker player,  foxpup, Lovesmayfamilis, Royse777 etc. I am sorry if this doesn't make sense to some persons.I sense that you are sincere in your statement as you had some data in your claims. You could easily be called a liar here because no one knows your real life personality. If you are not, don't allow it bother you much. You mentioned that a time came you didn't know the difference between your posts and the ones you plagiarised after LoyceV called your attention to it.I can say that your statement is correct as I already discussed something similar in my thread Why people plagiarise in the forum and how to avoid plagiarism. QuoteHOW TO AVOID PLAGIARISM: 5. Don't post immediately after a research:Ensure you don't post immediately exiting a research room. If you do, you might likely find it difficult to differentiate your personal ideas and the ones gotten from research that needs to be cited..This can be difficult for a newbie who doesn't know about plagiarism toolsFinally, I cannot say whether the plagiarism committed by you was in the quest to make money. I also pray that the moderators should revisit your case and see if there is a way to help you out or mitigate your punishment.QuoteThere is no one in this forum who can vouch for me because I didn't make any good relationships with anyone.I was touched by this statement of yours, because what you are into can happen to anyone. Well, you don't need to be in any kind of personal  relationship with anyone before you could be vouched for. Just try not to be hostile to the community and anyone could vouch for you, just like what I'm doing now. Though a reputable member has done it above before me. I wish you success.",

There is no one in this forum who can vouch for me because I didn't make any good relationships with anyone. You're lying, again. Our relationship was good.The question here, as I said before, is whether someone who broke the rules in the past but is now making a positive contribution to the forum should be punished for it. We have several examples of people who had questionable behavior at the very least and after a second chance have become great assets to the forum.When initially no action was taken against you and now you have been banned I understand that it is because you plagiarized too many times already. It's not that you copied three lines only once the first month you were on the forum, it's many times.In most legal systems not knowing the rules is not an excuse. To give you an exaggerated example, you cannot murder someone and when appearing before the judge say that you did not know that murder is forbidden and therefore expect to be exonerated for it.

And Somehow I violated One Of The Rules And I got a Message With the link to this Topic. it's helpful. Thank you Very Much.Does March start after November on your calendar?The lies and the issue of repeated plagiarism is in addition to that of alt abuse. In any case I hope that if they lift your ban it will be in time, months at least I'm talking about, and I would be very surprised if it were not so, otherwise it would not make sense to have banned you.

I guess that doesn't let you see that there is nothing wrong with writing to theymos directly, especially when hilarious recommended it:Quote from: hilariousandco on May 11, 2019, 11:07:25 AMWhat you've just said makes little to no sense, but state your case to theymos if you feel you are a net positive to the forum and maybe he'll issue a signature ban instead.",

I was wondering how can I get quick merit. I copied some sources from the internet and posted them in this forum. Back then, I didn't know the rules until LoyceV and psycodad told me on WO thread. That was November 19-2021. After that, I edited my few posts and added the sources. but, I was unable to edit it all because I forgot which one I copied. Now, You may say what about you commented on the Unofficial rules thread in march?To be honest, Maybe I read a few lines or not, I cannot remember. I guess that was a shitpost from me.

Also, with the risk to offend you (I hope not, though), this topic looks somewhat like \"yet another Meta stats, fishing for merit\". This being said, you should expect some harsher replies.I don't blame someone want to participate a campaign in this forum to earn more money, but using this way in order to participate a campaign is really DIRTYQuote from: Dic3L0v3r on May 21, 2022, 09:27:05 AMExposed some bounty cheaters (Later stopped because I realized they keep creating new accounts)Exposed some scams websiteThe reason why you're stopped to expose bounty cheaters because it doesn't guarantee you to earn merit, creating useless stats is more easier and each stats you created always earn merit. That's why you're still continue your useless stats and stopped to hunt bounty cheaters.Quote from: LoyceV on May 21, 2022, 09:07:07 AMwhat good can you offer in the future?It doesn't make sense you ask such question to him, you know right when someone already got punishment, he will do anything e.g. beg for forgiveness, promise to contribute, or even bribe if it's possible.I find it's similar situation like someone never posted in gambling board and he applied in gambling campaign, then he write below his application \"willing to post in gambling section\". Of course he will start shitpost on gambling board in order to fulfill the campaign requirement, we should look on past contribution, don't trust him words\"The real of his contributions was his recent posts, can anyone show me what's his contribution in this forum on his post history from pages 1-10? You will see it's a full of generic gambling posts in order to meet the requirements of the campaign.Question: If someone really give a contribution in this forum and not only for signature campaign, why he stopped to give contribution and only post in gambling section?Anyway, you should thank me for save you from plagiarism when I report your post on May 13, 2022 and the moderators didn't directly ban you, they waited for 5 days more.",

There is no doubt that you made a mistake when you presented someone else's work as your own, it was simply wrong whether it was something in real life or online. What's worse is that you've been warned many times to stop doing things that way and even correct any posts that could be problematic, which can definitely be considered a second chance - and not everyone gets it. I would personally check 7000 posts if I were you, and it would be enough if you used some free plagiarism checker if you can't already remember which posts were plagiarized and which weren't. It would be even easier if you deleted them all, as LoyceV already mentioned. The fact is that you were banned for plagiarism, but what's even bigger problem is that you didn't take a second chance when you were given one - now you're actually asking to be forgiven again, and you're unlikely to get the support of forum members in that request. I think now everything is in the hands of admins and global mods.",

I guess you already know how hard it is to get to a Hero Member rank these days. You had more than enough time to comb through you post especially after the first warning \"shot\". Not so many people get that chance but you became too confident and started having a bitter argument with other members which didn't look good. I remember when some of Lauda's posts were reported for plagiarism. Being the dramatic person I knew, I thought we were going to receive a very dramatic response but what he did was accept the mistake and edited every post that had no source links and from what I know, he was never banned because of that plagiarism report.",

As ever, Asia was one of the leading regions, along with Europe that remained steady in terms of growth.2021 was also the year that the FATF greylisted Malta. This meant we got several requests to move jurisdictions, acquire other licenses, or set up in places like Kahnawake and Curacao.2022 is set to be an even better year for the online gambling sector. According to the \"Gambling: Global Market Opportunities & Strategies to 2022\" report, projections for online and offline combined surpass an impressive $565 billion by the year-end. This demonstrates a growth rate of almost 6% on an annual basis. When we look at just online gambling, the picture is even rosier. Figures from Juniper Research suggest that the total value of online wagers could reach $1 trillion. The figures vary depending on where you look, but all of them show a CAGR of over 10% in overall growth. Based on a CAGR of 12%, we can expect the value of online gambling to surpass $112 billion by 2025.As for drivers of growth, we should be on the lookout for several different factors.archivedOriginal source: https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2021/10/18/59781-projections-for-the-gambling-industry-for-2022And, it seems, you edited the post and added a link to the source article only on May 13, 2022, after you were reported for plagiarism by @Solosanz.Code:Last edit: May 13, 2022, 11:08:43 AM by naim027",

At least we know broke plagiarism rule is still zero tolerance until now. There's no excuse for high ranked users to deny he was don't know the forum rules, if it's a newbies, then it make sense to give a second chance.With due diligence, you would probably see another very interesting post, where Solosanz simply did not give you a chance to \"hide your head in the sand\", that is, escape from the scene of the crime and again, as if nothing had happened, add a link. Naturally, the plagiarism messages were removed by the moderators, as they always do after a copy is discovered.https://loyce.club/archive/posts/5822/58224716.htmlNow check how much you're cheating here.
