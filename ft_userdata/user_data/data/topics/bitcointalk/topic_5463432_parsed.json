Even a simple discussion about strategy makes me want to gamble because I’m excited to try the strategy that I’m thinking.Your story is not different from most users here. Their signature campaign requirements fueled their interest in gambling. Or rather, they became gambling aware. For old time gamblers, this board just serves as a medium for them to share their experiences and indirectly mentor the newbies.QuoteRight now, I’m still not frequently gambling because of my work but I do regular gambling once or twice a week even if I don’t do this before just because I’m always exposed to gambling discussion and the thought of it makes me want to try. You should not be a frequent gambler not just because of your work but everything, your mental health, relationships, career, finances etc. If you become a frequent gambler, you'd get addicted because of the unhealthy habits you'd pick up along the way. Right now, once or twice per week for gambling is okay in my estimation. More than that is over doing it and may lead you into problem gambling. You do not want that.QuoteWhat’s the effect of gambling discussion here to you? +camaraderie+New strategies +Casino reviews+Gambling addiction discussion + friendly banters QuoteI’m thinking to quit participating on signature campaign that involves gambling discussion in an event that my gambling activities is increasing above my normal habit.Mate, I'd tell you this, man is the master of his fate.

      "body": "The gambling discussion here really helps us learn many things and not only learn about strategies for choosing sports betting teams but also how to deal with problems that arise while we are gambling. Apart from that, we can also ask how we should treat gambling to prevent gambling addiction.I advise you to try to prevent the urge to gamble from getting bigger by having other activities so that your attention will not be focused on gambling. And before you get a problem from gambling such as addiction, you better prevent it because I see you already have an urge to gamble so it can be categorized as an addiction to gambling even though it's not too big.",

I got hooked on it too and I sometimes lose all my funds just because of it. Now, I am playing on a real gambling site and I can say I got hooked on it too because of the variety of games. As I said, the same case as you, I started it after it was introduced here in the gambling discussions. But I don't think we should be blaming the discussions on our urge to gamble, it is still up to us if we can control it or not. Try withdrawing all the balances that you have on the gambling site and never leave a single penny on it. Maybe that could make you stop it. Because that's when I rest when the site rekts my wallet.",

But when I started visiting gambling discussions and I saw how some people were coming up with different strategies and also talking about people that were jackpot winners, I became more interested again and started betting to see if I would be lucky, and again, through this gambling discussion, I easily got some information about many things that often happened to those who were addicted to gambling before, so now it encourages me to seriously read many news stories about gamblers.",

You are in control of what happens to you here. You are right, because gambling activity has increased, not because of active involvement in gambling discussions, but because self-control has been lost, so when you see another member who gets a big win or tells about a chance to win with a decent profit, it makes someone interested and wants to have the same thing as what has been shared by other members.Actually, every individual has their own goals and desires, even self-control, I'm sure everyone has it, but it's hard to be able to really maintain control yourself.So it's not a matter of being active in gambling discussions but because there are no controls that can be controlled.",

Your story is exactly same as mine, I wasn't a regular gambler, like I might go for six whole month without placing a single bet, my gambling used to be very occasional like when there is an ongoing world cup tournament and all my friends are betting, that is usually the period I gamble the most, as soon as such event is over, you hardly see me near any casino again or betting house again, but all that changed immediately i started participating in gambling discussions here on the forum, today, i gamble almost everyday, even if it means placing just one bet, i only do not gamble on days i am very occupied with work and had no time for any other thing, but yeah, discussing gambling regularly on this forum have turned me into a supposed regular gambler rather than the occasional gambler i used to be .QuoteWhat’s the effect of gambling discussion here to you?

Even a simple discussion about strategy makes me want to gamble because I’m excited to try the strategy that I’m thinking.It’s true that when your signature requires you to make certain amount of gambling discussion you will get attracted to gambling because it exposes you to gambling and educates you on gambling and you will know alot of stuffs about gambling that you don’t know about. You will be educated on various gambling techniques and strategies and also educate you on how to prevent gambling addiction and the more you are being exposed to it the more you will develop the interest of gambling and eventually if on your early days of gambling you were able to win some money you will even be more attracted to it and gradually it will become part of your activity but still it all depends on how strong you are and how you give yourself to it so only you can decide how it affect you. I was also not a regular gambler just like you though mine was because i was not lucky enough to start my early days of gambling with a win, i lost some couple of games and the loss made me lose interest in gambling so i left it for a while but after joining a campaign that requires me to make some gambling posts i have been spending more time in the gambling board than i used to spend before and it has taught me alot about it and awakened my spirit of gambling. Since resuming back to gambling i have won couple of games this time which I think is the effect of my gambling discussion here, it has helped me to understand gambling properly and i am happy for the positive impact it has on me so far.

I’m thinking to quit participating on signature campaign that involves gambling discussion in an event that my gambling activities is increasing above my normal habit.I wouldn't blame you for your choice because we all live different lives and have various perspectives on the world. I'm sorry this has had a negative effect on you, but I'm glad you caught on quickly so you don't end up developing a gambling addiction.When my friends told me about their gambling wins, I used to be envious, so when I found out I could learn about it here, I was excited. I now try to grasp what I've read here thoroughly and put it to good use. The most important part is learning to manage your emotions and prevent greed from interfering with your gambling because if you don't do that, greed will eventually take over and may result to addiction. The effects of gambling Discussions to me here has been positive so far because it has taught me how to control my emotions, how to minimize the  level of addiction and also how to control the money i spend on gambling.",

If you think you will do well this way, go ahead and try it, but I think it is better that you study statistics applied to gambling.",
