They could be included in the survey upon request, but any others must have a probability of less than 1%.This idea only applies to the group stage.I will update the table as I get information.Edit: outside Serbia and Morocco. Puerto Rico, which seems more interesting for analysis. Source:https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022sorce: Getty imagesEdit: Aug 3",

      "body": "Well from the teams listed in your first OP I think that all the teams are correct except maybe Senegal,I say so not because Senegal has high chances to win a competition of such level but because they also have a star player like Mane which has done great at Liverpool and I think he will also do great with the Bayern Munchen team in which he will play this upcoming season.So from the teams listed in the first post I think Senegal has the better chances compared to the other teams.For all other teams I agree,I don't know any star player in Japan,Iran,Korea (I know Son but he is not in the best of his age for such huge competition) and the other teams listed.",

For now it is like a new beginning.Let's see if I understand!, these Asian teams don't have the level of European football...(We have discovered warm water!) Although today it is a yes and no, it depends.   The Korean team has been qualifying for the last 10 World Cups,, that is, maybe they has a better performance than many European teams, then is normal what in all confederations the distance is shortened, but at the level of individual matches, specific feats, win or tie a match with a large team from Europe, that is there latent for any World Cup match, it will happen at Qatar.Now to say that an Asian country is going to win a World Cup, according to your own words, that will not happen at least in the medium term, in fact, your comment is in contradiction.Quote from: KennyR on November 15, 2022, 10:27:11 PMQuote from: famososMuertos on November 15, 2022, 10:04:26 PM...//:::;;;...//,,,  For now it is like a new beginning.",
