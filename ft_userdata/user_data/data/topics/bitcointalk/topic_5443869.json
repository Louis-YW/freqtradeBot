  "content": "My dad is 79 yo. He's a retired carpenter but has always been interested in technology, electronics and related stuff. Back in the 90s, when I was just kid, he bought me a computer because he knew that's where the world was headed and we learned to use it together. During the years, I developed my passion in computing and programming and I always taught him to use all the tools needed to be a good user (he even uses things like password managers and multi-factor authentication tools).Fast forward to early 2020, just before the pandemic, I started to buy BTC and I had always told my dad about this new \"digital gold\". He was skeptical (he's lived most of his life with FIAT and cash after all) but curious. He thought it was too risky though.Not sure why, but last week he finally told me he wanted to try it. So we setup his software wallet and he bought 0.01 BTC. Not sure if he'll buy more, but I can certainly say I'm proud of him!Did you manage to convince your dads or other older people in your family to buy BTC?",

There are people like that that's why I really don't like convincing people to invest not unless if they come to me telling that they can adopt the risk and no the consequences since I could spare some time teaching them the basics about crypto.",

As for the older generations they would ask about it risk and once I tried to tell them most at times that the risk is minimal in bitcoin if they stick to holding they just shrug off that everything related to internet seems scam to them. Sadly it is what the government has made them to believe. More so I don’t bother introducing older generations because I feel they lack the ability to secure their funds on wallets because of most of them from here are naive and could easily be scam.I most give you credit for bringing your dad in but you need to tell him about the risk involved not when he sees some dumps he will start panicking just tell him to hodl. Also tell him not to click on phishing messages from emails because older generations easily falls for tricks like that",

But I also think like you, I know everyone wants money, but they have sacrificed their whole life to work hard to take care of and nurture us. They sacrificed their youth for our future, and now they need to rest. What I want is that they to have the last days of life to enjoy life and have fun with their descendants, I don't want them to face the risks brought by crypto. They are old, and having a lot of money cannot bring them happiness.",

I think our role in the society is to only plant the idea about the cryptocurrencies and its future to their heads but never convince them to try and invest into crypto. That part is really up to them how will they react about that interaction afterwards, some might be curious enough what is it about and what does it do but doesn't have the will to have their own research to know about it.",

In the last 5-6 years, things have changed, not only because most people say that BTC is too expensive for them, but also because it is not wise to expose yourself in any connection with Bitcoin in public.In addition, older people (mostly) are not interested in new technologies, and I personally let them enjoy their old days, because realistically, they have earned it by working continuously for 40 years.",

Anyways you have done well by on boarding your dad into bitcoin. It is rear to see the elderly getting involved  by investing in bitcoin as a business for them with regards to the volatility and their expectations which does not augur well. This is the sole reason when ever I meet with elders who are inquisitive about bitcoin I open up to them telling them everything about it so that they do not develop blood pressure in the future as a result of the market volatility and other unforeseen circumstances that might likely emanate in the future. You did well and i trust you did tell your dad the \"not your keys,not your coin\" phrase so as to keep him on the safe track.",

It's important to let people know how to self-custody, secure the devices they use to hold bitcoin and make backups. My greatest worry with older people is that they misplace stuff, forget their passwords, are talkative and brag about their investments. All this puts them at risk. Personally, I have access to my father's account and I could invest his money, but I don't do it and I won't do it, even if he asks me. I don't want to be responsible for it and I don't need the burden of him calling me all the time because he read that \"bitcoin CEO was arrested\". Yes that's a real thing.

I also have an elderly father like you, and what I think he needs are days off and enjoying his old age. What they need now is the love of their children, health, and joy every day, not money.
