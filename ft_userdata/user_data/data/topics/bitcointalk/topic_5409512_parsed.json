  "content": "Specially for BADeckerAlik BahshiInsult in a dispute – Russian national feature  Insults are the main feature of Russian participants in political forums on the Internet. Usually they have nothing to oppose in a dispute, they don’t even try, immediately in a mat and foul language, moving on to the opponent’s personality, this is especially practiced, as a rule, if there is an ethnic difference. Well, a Russian cannot but insult an opponent on ethnic grounds. This phenomenon is observed in any forum and distinguishes a Russian participant from any other. They themselves do not even understand how low they lower themselves, exposing their national inferiority to the whole world. It should be noted that this national feature does not depend on the degree of education, or on gender, or on social rank. A vivid example of this is Russian President Putin, whose speech at the moment of emotional tension instantly acquires words from the lexicon of gangster jargon.   The fact that rudeness among Russians is almost at the genetic level is confirmed by the behavior of Vladimir Safronkov, Deputy Plenipotentiary Representative of Russia in the UN Security Council. No, he did not swear, which is usual for any Russian, but his words to the representative of Great Britain “Look at me. Don't take your eyes off. Why are you averting your eyes” sounded among the diplomats as nothing more than a demonstration of the most real rudeness. It is known that anger is a sign of weakness and in this case is caused by Safronkov's impotence to refute the truth that came from the mouth of a British diplomat.   Yes, and what is far to go, to demand elementary decency from some Safronkov, if rude expressions sometimes escape from the lips of his patron, which a politician of the rank of president could not afford.   The thing is that getting nasty with Russians is not considered an insult. This is a national trait, a feature, that is, for a Russian, the usual everyday condition that every foreigner who arrives in Russia faces.         04/19/17",

Condemning yourself.  Your conclusion that I am writing is very similar to what the official Russian media say that in Bucha the Ukrainians themselves killed people in order to blame the crime on Russian soldiers who invaded Ukraine. A typical Russian mentality is to kill and blame the murdered person for this murder. It also happened with the Russian crime at Katyn, when the Russians shot 24,000 Polish prisoners and blamed the Germans for it. Traditional Russian approach. How similar it is to what Minister Lavrov said that the US special services tried to poison Navalny in order to shift it to the Russians. So are your thoughts about me. Moreover, you are trying to get away from this topic in a different direction. It would be better if you remembered your rudeness in the comments in my topics.",

The ensuing Russian strikes in populated areas have killed civilians and destroyed civilian infrastructure,” Amnesty International’s report said, adding that the results of this were Russian attacks on said civilian infrastructure, Zero Hedge reported, adding:The report detailed further that in 22 of 29 schools visited by an Amnesty team between April and July, investigators found evidence of prior military activity. Additionally, five instances of Ukrainian troops using hospitals as bases were documented.

Here is a topic about Russian foul language and rudeness, which is typical for a Russian participant in a dispute and which was demonstrated by you in the comments to my topics. As far as war crimes are concerned, all the Russian lies will be discussed in the Treban after the war. Evil will have to be paid for, and the pay will be high. On this issue, I have topics, but here I ask you to discuss adhering to this topic and not jump to others.",
