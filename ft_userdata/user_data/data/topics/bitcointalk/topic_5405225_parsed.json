Trader vs. HODLer, zoom out the chart to the maximum, who made more in fiat, and who HODLs more Bitcoin. There's higher probability it's the HODLer in my opinion.",

This is not a time for FOMO, but its time to analyze again and know when to buy. I don’t suggest to buy because of FOMO because you might not be able to buy at the right price. The volume is not enough to push Bitcoin and break that resistance, we will stay on that level for now.",

I think it should be opposite, smart investors should be accumulating at this point. No need to FOMO, it is only in bull market. Now is the time to buy cheap bitcoin and then just HODL, there is no simpler formula than that in a bear market.",

Not every day is Christmas day.I can feel the holidays here already because you use the term Christmas and then winter but speaking of winter, a real winter last only for up to 3 months but this crypto winter we are having now has been running since last year because the drop started at December 2021 right? But, no doubt that there is nothing better than being ready or prepared for what's going to happen next.This is why people now are buying because they think this bear will end soon. People here are now ready for the bull run but there might be some that is still ready for the real bottom, that is why they are preparing a good amount of cash, in case it suddenly occurs.",

This was also the break-out level of the resistance trend-line from symmetrical triangle break-out a few days ago, so a fair amount of confluence at this level.
