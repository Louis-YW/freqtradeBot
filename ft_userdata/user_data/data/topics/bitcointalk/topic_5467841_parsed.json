Unfortunately, we have a new era of people who buy Bitcoin, which is different from those who bought it from the year 2010 to 2015. These people believe that Bitcoin is an investment, and they like the idea that their money is safe and that there is someone who will keep it in an encrypted and safe way, even if the seeds are lost. And do not forget that natural problems such as earthquakes and floods, in addition to hackers and the laziness of many in learning more about Bitcoin and multiple signatures, all of these people still trust Ledger and, on the contrary, love their new service.A simple example of this: I know many people who keep thousands of dollars in Binance account and/or USDT they are afraid to withdraw them to the wallets because they want to invest and are afraid of losing money.Quote from: Meuserna on September 25, 2023, 07:54:25 AMI assume Ledger will manage to survive.  They'll find a way to stay profitable, but their reputation among people who understand how important security is...  well...  that's gone.Ledger lost a share of the market and gained another share, and if it wants to gain the share it lost, it will be by renaming the product.If the code is open source, well reviewed, price is low and true airgapped, then in the end you will not trust them, but rather trust someone who reviewed the code or you review it yourself.",

Someone definitely should shove open source definition[1] directly to his face. At this point, i wonder when will license of their other source code will be replaced from MIT/Apache 2.0 to their own fake open source license.I am sure they know how Coldcard played stupid and did something similar when they went opposite direction and changed their license.They also made false open source advertisement for their CC+MIT license, and everyone knows about that.I also have doubt about new ''open source'' Safepal X1, but let's wait and see what first reviews say.",
