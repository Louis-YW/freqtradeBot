  "content": "For the past few days, Sei has been trending on Twitter (X.com) because of the mainnet launch on August 15th which is today. As of this time of writing, they will officially be live for trading in big CEXs like Binance, KuCoin, Bybit, Gate and other ones in just a few hours from now. The main reason for Sei’s trend is because of the airdrop being confirmed by the Sei Foundation via their official Twitter handle. After that, the noise on Twitter keeps increasing day by day as well as in Discord, Facebook, etc. I see that a lot have participated in the Sei launchpool in Binance by staking their BNB and other supported coins. What’s your price speculation for this one guys? Would like to hear some opinions here. Thanks!",

More likely it could go for $0.5 - $1 a piece especially it will be listed on binance today and hoping for good news as well for everyone to have good profit after the TGE release.",

Im sure that if 80% of airdrop receivers will be dumping their reward to the market. Sei has been trading around 17 cents now which is far from my expectation which was above 50 cents. It's likely the hype has failed to drive the price of sei to be as high as sui. It seems people aware if sei is not as good as sui. There have been many problems occuring around sei. Its twitter has got bunch of complaints from airdrop hunters as they were delaying to give airdrop. So many negative comments may also affect the price of sei. Let's see how can the price can defend its position once airdrop gonna be distributed.",

Thanks!So far not much has happened as the price neither dumped or pumped and it kind of remained on the same levels, now there is not much we can say about the direction this coin may take as we literally have nothing to work with it as the coin was released today.However it is revealing that not much happened, as a great deal of coins in the same position as SEI would have pumped and then dumped already, still it seems that for those that are holding this coin it may seem that their dreams of unlimited riches will have to wait a little bit, as it may take some time for this coin to show the results they are expecting out of it.",

My missions in Blocked are incomplete. Only accomplished 16 of 18 missions (including Humanode) that gives us a Verified Seilor role. I’ve also failed to become an Officer (ambassador) as I only got into Level 7 Crew before the deadline. However, I did participated in the Bridge event where I have made some transactions a few times. To be honest, I am expecting very less tokens to be allocated to me. I would be grateful even if it’s just only worth for a Starbucks Frappucino. If I do receive a decent and reasonable amount of Sei, that would be also great as it could help me sustain for the time being while still looking for more opportunities.",

First airdrop will be givens to testnet users. Unfortunately i missed this airdrop as 25 transaction was required and I leave this airdrop. distribution is not started yet and claiming will be start soon. Quote What’s your price speculation for this one guys? Would like to hear some opinions here. Thanks!The opening was unexpectedly very low and i was lucky one ti to buy at 0.178$ and sold at 0.27$ and made 100$ profit in 24 hours. Liquidity is 10 billion and community reward has not been given so i think price will be below 0.3$. I think below 0.2$ is good to buy because token is still new. If Sei team announced some big partnerships and other staking program then i believe that price will rise.",

I am just a Level 7 Crew member but eligible to receive 65 Sei tokens. Maybe I am because I do not have multiple accounts. Sybils have been eliminated from the airdrop and there are like over 30,000 wallets that are being disqualified due to multiple accounts. But it’s not just about focusing on Sei alone. There are projects using Sei where they will be launching their own tokens and airdrop it to early testnet participants.One of them is Levana Finance. Before the Sei mainnet, I have interacted at least few times with Levana Finance under the Atlantic-2 testnet. The founder himself which I had a call with him a couple of days ago have confirmed that early testnet users will receive an airdrop from Levana Finance once their token is launched. Probably the same thing to other projects who are using Sei network before the mainnet.
