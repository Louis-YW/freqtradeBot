Basically, we can more easily make mistake on mobile rather than on desktop computer or laptop that has better keyboard and bigger screen. In addition, less protection (software) is used to protect mobile.QuoteIs there a way to get them my personal info by email directly from my pc?I don't understand your question and your need.Just don't store your sensitive information in email or anything on third-party service.

My android won't work for this, so I want to know how to (if it's allowed) send my personal info by email.

I thank you for your help! Well, if you don't want to pass KYC but wanted to buy Bitcoin then there other solution for that which you can check the post of BitMaxz. It is possible to send your personal info through email. You can send it on their customer support email if they did process manual KYC completion. Try to submit your personal info using pc. can say that it is the official website of Bitcoin which is bitcoin.org and it's legit afaik.",

I am trying to send my personal data bitcoin.org (I'm assuming this is a legit site, correct me if I err) requires to get into their system to buy and sell bitcoin ...Huh, I wonder how many new users buy bitcoin this way? (i.e. via https://bitcoin.org/en/buy)I'm guessing that a lot of new users might feel like this is the \"official\" way to do it (even though it's just a \"MoonPay\" widget).That would be a great page to educate people about P2P exchanges and give them a couple of choices (Bisq, LocalCoinSwap, hodlhodl, etc.)@OP: I've never bought bitcoin this way, so I can't offer you any help, sorry. You should be aware that there are many different ways of buying bitcoin and that some of them don't require you to share your personal info.",

They do not provide bitcoin exchange, it is provided by Moonpay (as described) which is not associated with bitcoin.org. In order not to be too complicated, use the moonpay site directly for proper exchange support.Or use other exchanges like some of the suggestions above to make the buying process easier.",
