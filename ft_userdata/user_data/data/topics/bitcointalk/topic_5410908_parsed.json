All cryptocurrencies have come to the point of being profitable until the dump and massive correction happen. So, everyone will have to say that they're holding a profitable coin just like me that I've been always telling that holding bitcoin is profitable because it's what I have and I've profited from it. Those that are following Apecoin and holders of it will tell the same thing. If I'll invest, it won't be that complicated to me and will be determined to hold and buy coins that I know that I've made a research.",

Apecoin is the same with other altcoins.  Not sure what is the utility of apecoin aside from can be used to buy their land and nft on ape ecosystem but probably youll only get to earn from it with its value which is quite low for now since the market crash happened.  So waiting together with other altcoins is the best thing to do.  Or if there are staking program for apecoin,  do staking while holding at least you earn something.",

If you are planning to buy an Art know that you need a big capital on that and probably it can only be profitable once the market becomes better but if not then it will just remain as NFTs. The utility of their token is to buy their land and nfts, you can just have the token itself and trade with it. Profit will come once you already know what kind of strategy you are going to use, and ETH network can’t guarantee any profit at all.",

Imho it's BECAUSE it exist there it might be. Also because devs have pretty much stroke a gold mine with their apes in the first place. ApeCoins doesn't even need to be anything special, just the brand behind it sells eventually.

Ofcourse, creating your analysis would be a factor but to determine is another thing. It is like testing your hypothesis whether something is beneficial or not to someone. Just like any crypto, APE has a tendency to be have a huge name but do you think it will be assured that it would? Concept is good but on my end, I guess it just ressembles the known nft projects. This is just a general perspective, I, myself did not take time to study this coin so yeah, I think we can say that industry is just a matter choosing your own poison.",

Since this coin is listed by other good exchangers with Binance. it may have a good future and I have seen that its circulating supply is very low. So if the project team works well and their effort is there to make the project better.  So maybe in the future if the price of Bitcoin increases.  This coin can also generate new ATH. so this Coin can be suitable for investment . but do your own research before investing on any crypto",

It's still profitable if it will be going back to the old ATH but it would not happen next year. Buying altcoin will always be profitable as long as you know that which altcoin that already reached bottom. Buying at the bottom is a must caused by that was increasing your chance to get a lot of profit even from ape token. Think about that. Everything is worth to buy except scam token in the market.",

But this coin is could be a promising coin because its trade volume is very high and also it is listed on most of the good exchangers and their project team is also strong.

However, in this bear market situation, that seems too hard to make it, not even those coins that have a higher profitability rate. But for me, if we aim for a long-term investment, Apecoin couldn't be on my list. I'd see APE has been surging the last bull season but I think that was the last hype it made and this is due to heavy market competition.",

Apecoin is one of those projects that started with a huge marketcap right off the bat, just like the token from Uniswap for example. The reason for that is, that a pretty big number of users got those tokens for free because they used their platforms or products before. This also means though that a lot of people are holding this tokens now that have a significant value and they did not pay any money for that which means they also don't have a price range where they have to sell in order to be in the profit zone.So there can be a big sell pressure for this tokens at all times. So i would be very careful to invest in a token that was distributes in such a way. Either you were one of the lucky ones that got them for free, or you skip that project.",
