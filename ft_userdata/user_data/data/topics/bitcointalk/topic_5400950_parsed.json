  "content": "I've had this discussion with some people, and I'm not really sure I covered every single possible thing that could go wrong in that scenario, so I'm asking it here.My view is that solo mining should definitely be done into your own address, because you would have full control of it of course.I'm now wondering about the technical aspects of it.Are exchange wallets created somehow differently to, say, using Electrum to receive the mined coins?Is there any technical reason that would make this a bad idea, or is it only a matter of not having exclusive control of the keys to the address?Is it possible for the initial transaction to fail for some reason if you use an exchange wallet?, or should it work exactly the same as other wallets?",

Exchanges should never be used as a medium to store bitcoins. You can buy and sell through them, if you do not mind sharing your personal details, but if you're holding for the long term, get a non custodial wallet.Quote from: nullama on June 01, 2022, 08:36:53 AMAre exchange wallets created somehow differently to, say, using Electrum to receive the mined coins?Not in any way I can think of, newly minted coins function as coins which have already been involved in multiple transactions, except in some scenarios their value could be higher by virtue of the fact they are newly mined. Exchange wallets are just wallets controlled by a central authority (for centralized exchanges).Quote from: nullama on June 01, 2022, 08:36:53 AMIs there any technical reason that would make this a bad idea, or is it only a matter of not having exclusive control of the keys to the address?Is it possible for the initial transaction to fail for some reason if you use an exchange wallet?, or should it work exactly the same as other wallets?• I can't think of any others, besides risk of hacks, data leaks and sales of details to the government.• It should work exactly the same in my opinion.",

That is why people always recommend you to use a non-custodial wallet and remember \"Not your keys, Not your coins\".However, if you are mining and making a profit daily GPU or ASIC receiving it directly to your exchange is fine I have a Viabtc account and receive it there and transfer it to Coinex exchange and Binance when withdrawing since I don't have free electricity I need them to withdraw and pay for monthly expenses.",

They could potentially lock your account and ask questions later.Even though you're not doing anything wrong, you might potentially lose access to your mined coins.",

Even more, since they were not sent from a wallet of yours, you cannot prove it's your money.If they're stealing your money you cannot prove they did (i.e. it was ever your money)",

Could also be because of the maturity issue that their databases were not set up to handle it.Whatever the reason(s) the exchanges have, I would not mine to any address I do not control.I think that one main reason, especially at start, was that many (altcoin) mining pools were sending payouts no matter how small (no threshold implemented), and if one was mining to exchange address it was spamming it with small inputs which the exchange had to consolidate.Another good reason can be disputes. If one didn't receive the reward it had to be somebody's fault and the exchanges didn't want to be part of that.Of course, as you said, the DB maturity plus the various coins' clients running with probably much smaller resources could also have been playing an important role.But especially for Bitcoin solo mining, if one is willing to risk 6.25 BTC in 2022 by sending it to wallet under others' control... something must be very wrong in his setup (to say it nicely).",
