      "body": "There are quite a lot of more important things in life than Bitcoin, if you sold your coins to handle something important in real life, then that is fine, if you sold it to have some good time with family and loved ones, that's also great. You basically just have to find the right balance between what you sell and what you hodl.Remember that Bitcoin is money and spending it or exchanging it for fiat isn't a bad thing afterall. You cannot also hodl it forever so there is no point regretting anything, as you can always buy some more again if you desire to do so.",

      "body": "One thing i will say is there will always be regrets in this crypto space because of the volatility attached to it. You might be regretting why you sold early because the price went up significantly above where you sold or you might be regretting another time why you didn’t sale because the price started dumping, these two are part of the space. But the best regret is always that doesn’t make you to be in loss that’s selling with a profit. How do one over come this i will say don’t fix a time to take profit rather fix a price to take profit. If a coin gets to a price where you can take 75% holdings including some profit and maybe the invested amount too then take them. Don’t sometimes be too greedy for a high pump that you leave your coins most especially if it is Altcoins. Although the most important thing is to invest in what you can afford to lose so that there won’t be any regrets regardless of the decision made. Hodl bitcoin for long, take profit when necessary and you wouldn’t be in regret",

Luckily for me, it mostly happened in the early days when I didn't have a lot of bitcoin so I coulnd't sell much even if I wanted to and on top of that it was usually when I really needed the money so it wasn't like I was selling it out of boredom. Nowadays (after years of experience) I have no regrets and I don't look back thinking how much bitcoin sold would be wroth and I simply spend some when I need/want to.",

The price of Bitcoin was dropping and I became scared that it would keep dropping so I had to sell my coin. A few months after the price bounced back and I regretted my actions. But I have learned to let the past pass by because it cannot be changed.  QuoteIt might sting a bit to think about what could have been if you held onto those BTC, but let's not forget the golden rule of crypto: it's a marathon, not a sprint. The market is dynamic, and opportunities are ever-present.There are great opportunities in buying and hodling Bitcoin. Bitcoin is still in its infant stage so anyone who invests now still has the chance to achieve their targets. When I see how the price of Bitcoin has increased these few months, I usually regret why I sold my coins but we still have the chance to utilise the opportunity Bitcoin provides today to make our future more financially stable.",

Whether they made profit whilst they sold their bitcoin at lesser value when they were alive? Or to the sick person on the sickbed who sold his bitcoin to save his life at a lesser value than it is now? Or even, a student who invested in bitcoin at a time to later use it to pay for his/her house rent and tuition fee?I think in life, so many things mean different to others and the purpose and intentions behind why people invest is what matters the most to them. it does not matter whether the value of bitcoin faced a decline at the time someone took it out or not. And yes, this does not also have anything to do with the so-called \"golden rule of bitcoin\" which you said it's a marathon, not a sprint. In real sense, the entire life is a marathon and not a sprint and I feel like the rule applies to all aspect of life not bitcoin alone but you can not also use this rule to negate the intentions people use to invest.",

Perhaps there were no old investors who did not have that feeling after selling off their Bitcoin at $5–$10 and seeing that, a few years later,a piece of the coin sold for $5 is now worth $40k. The profit they made when they sold so quickly was also helpful to them, and that's a fact they can't dispute.If one can still keep accumulating gradually for some years, they will be able to achieve a large portfolio.",

If you look at the market very well, you will see that people are still trading their BTC to earn little money to settle down things but long term hodlers don't allow any challenges to make them sell their BTC because, they always wait for the massive bull run to come before they will sell. New new year, new system, I don't think I will regret in this new year because there are still some signs from the crypto market that this year will be more favourable than last year that was full of bear run.",

I only blame those who just sold and did not use the money for any important thing because they really do not need such money at that time.But the most painful aspect of it is when you own bitcoin but do not actually have access to it. Which means you cannot recover it or do not even remember the platform where you will save the Bitcoin.

The market is dynamic, and opportunities are ever-present.There are circumstances that cause some of us to regret owning Bitcoin in the past. Sometimes we intend to store Bitcoin for a long time, but if something very significant or an emergency arises while we don't have any other options, we have to sell it to get the money we need to get through the situation. which will return us to the starting point since, although we were relieved that we could hold some Bitcoin, unforeseen issues arose.However that is the source of regret. For this reason,having a backup source of income is beneficial for those who intend to store Bitcoin for an extended length of time. This way, in the event of an emergency, we will always have a means of covering our expenses not until we can withdraw our Bitcoin holdings.",

Bitcoin doesn't necessarily have to be held; sometimes, we also need to spend it to make it circulate.
