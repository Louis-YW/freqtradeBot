(eg, from the perspective of your country's regulations). I see that in the long term it is somewhat threatening to the value of your fiat.",

Sounds like a really big plan.With pessimistic feelings I'm not so sure you'll find someone who meets your qualifications in this forum.As for businesses involving the government, I think it should start with building connections with relevant government people first, this will make the process of legality and legitimacy smoother. It also avoids wasted effort when you've gotten a few steps with someone experienced in this field but ultimately doesn't get support from the government.Quote from: Pentafa on December 14, 2022, 05:44:07 AMThe country is in fact central africa in which cryptocurrency is still unregulated. Its very conducive for crypto investors.Afaik, bitcoin is legal in central Africa[1].1. https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/central-african-republic-adopts-bitcoin-as-legal-tender.html",
