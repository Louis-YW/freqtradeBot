Ratings are not for popularity contests, virtue signalling, punishing people for your idea of wrongthink, etc.Sub-topic:How different would the forum be if all neutral feedback toward dishonest and lying members was changed to negative?This thread is just for discussion. No need to get your tits in a knot over it if you take the trust system so seriously that it effects your sleep. It's not a suggestion for change, just a poll and discussion.",

It's not a suggestion for change, just a poll and discussion.However the trust system is not moderated so anyone can tag anyone either because the account is dangerous or because of a personal dispute. That's all I know, and I'm pretty disappointed with the trust system even though in some ways, it works well.Even though theymos has a wise view regarding the trust system, but not all members can think like theymos. Apart from that, scammers always have their own methods even though the trust system has been implemented in the forum, so the best way is not to trust anyone or don't make any trades here",

If someone says that is happy to see his wife's mother when he's not in fact, I don't think it anyhow corresponds with trading risk with him. And if someone sais he will return you 2 cents in a week and hasn't return in a month it is another kind if lie: maybe 2 cents is not so much, but if a persom declared a deal and didn't follow the rules he declared by himself, this will be a totally different case.Lie as an idea by itself doesn't say enough about trading risk. So I suppose that no, it is not appropriate to leave a negative tag just for lying. The one should show how can it be projected onto trading. If it has too few connections with trade, than it's not a Trust case on this forum.",

If deceit results in material loss to one of the parties, then this will certainly be reflected in the trust. This is unavoidable and will allow other forum members to remain wary of a lying user should they wish to do any trades with him. Although I would not do this even with someone who has been caught in such a deception at least once, but even the absence of such a recall in the trust does not mean that you can't be deceived. So, at least leave a negative trust that you don’t leave, this is generally only a subjective opinion (if there are no mass complaints and a public fact of lies), which is not direct evidence of the user’s lies. Look, some users have a negative trust, the content of the comment is not always adequate.",

Yes, if someone has been proven to be a liar, it's fair to be a bit wary when dealing with them. Trust is usually built on what someone has done before, so if they keep lying, it can make people see them as untrustworthy. But it's kind of a tricky thing that can change depending on the situation. Not all lies are the same, if you get my drift.",

At least, this has been my experience with JollyGood. I commented on him being a complete and utter stickler, this lead to a false theory about me \"knowing about a scam before it scammed\" (not true) along with countless negative labels. Based on this experience, I do not trust JollyGood.By the way, despite my position that I stated above, I cannot agree with the accuracy of your feedback for the reason that I had conflicts with JG more than once (in those days when members of the DT had a lot of power and when my account did not represent nothing out of myself). However, despite the facts I mentioned, JG was a decent sub-person and I don't remember him acting arrogant (as the feedback you left suggests).",

Sometimes it's not intentional, like in the event of just getting something factually wrong. That can happen to us all of course. Jokes are technically lies are well however, it's definitely not what I'm referring to.Malicious lying is the kind that I am talking about. Misinformation, lying about other users, misrepresenting factual information with an agenda, in a reputation matter, or a trade. These all pose detriment and risks to users.Quote from: YOSHIE on September 06, 2023, 03:21:22 PMOP, you already know the answer, we here have three Types of feedback.Code:feedbackType:O: Positive - You think that this person is unlikely to scam anyone.O: Neutral - Other comments.O: Negative - You think that trading with this person is high-risk.

I can agree that lying for the sake of protecting yourself and your privacy is fine. In fact I'd encourage that in a situation where that information isn't at all necessary to be true. Lying about a service and it's quality, I definitely agree that the red tag is justified (maybe even a flag if there's sufficient proof).However these are a bit less vague. Lies that are non-trade related that effect third party judgement in a sensitive situation, or involve other users period, is one example of the kind that is a little more vague.To what extent can a user misinform or misrepresent facts relating to other users before a negative trust is given, and is a neutral warranted or a negative, if this is proven? Is a better question if we want to add a little specificity to the topic.

Is a better question if we want to add a little specificity to the topic. There is a difference between lying to deceive (trade risk) and expressing an opinion. Everyone has the right to their opinion, even if it happens to be wrong or incorrect. Contrasting opinions should be addressed through reasoned discussions or by simply ignoring them, and this should take place within the context of regular forum conversation, rather than using the feedback system.On this forum, we hold the principles of freedom of speech, or freedom of expression if you prefer, in high regard. Everyone has an equal right to express their thoughts as long as they adhere to the forum rules. If you believe someone is violating these rules, report them to the moderators for appropriate action. If you happen to disagree with someone's opinion, you can engage in a discussion or simply choose to ignore them. Disagreements are a natural part of any discussion platform, but trust ratings should not be part of the equation.I view your use of the trust system as vindictive and driven by personal feelings because you didn't appreciate someone's opinion of you, and now you are trying to rationalize it.",

Over the years, \"trade\" has been expanded to include participation in bounties, signature campaigns and any kind of agreement that involves an exchange of goods or services for BTC, other crypto, or money.Some things negative trusts should never be used for include:- airing personal grievances- calling someone a troll- calling someone a liar outside of anything related to tradeNeutral trust should be used when commenting on someone's ability to use the trust system correctly.Like LoyceV said in the other thread, no one can stop you from leaving any kind of trust you want, but in doing so you can't expect other people to agree with your interpretation of appropriate use of the trust system.",
