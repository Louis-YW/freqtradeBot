  "content": "Hi,I'm tired of scammers advertising their paid signals groups with made up unverified trading results. I guess most of their trades don't exist or they hide their unprofitable trades and only brag about successful ones. There was a time I was subscribing stock market trading signal service until I noticed that the signals and reports are not as profitable as advertised by the service \"guru\". I'm aware that signal trading is full of scams, but I believe that there are some people who have good experience in trading, specialize in a niche e.g. agricultural commodities or metaverse and achieve better investment results in their niche than others. And are willing to share their trades for extra money.That is why I started to work on a signal trading platform with two groups of people:1) Traders can register and share their trade signals. The main difference is that they share trade signals on the platform, so the platform exactly knows the timing and the profit of the signal. There is also no manipulation of the trade price, because the exact price is taken from the current market data, not typed in by the trader. E.g. if the trader buys Apple stock or Ethereum, the platform checks the current price of that asset, sends the signal to subscribed users and saves it in database. When the trader sells it, the platform knows the exact profit of the trade.2) People can join and subscribe to Traders's signals. They see their REAL, VERIFIED results and there is no manipulation, no hiding bad trades, no time difference between the trade and alert sent, etc. Everything is clear as day. Of course those people pay some fee to subscribe to trades, but at least they know exactly what they are paying for.What do you guys think about such a platform? What are pros and cons? Of course I'm thinking about improving it in the future (adding reviews, traders can add reports, presentations etc.) but I wanted to get some feedback before starting further development. Would you be willing to join it for beta-testing?All feedback is welcome.",

What is clear is that I know the people in the community very well.",

If you are thinking of creating a platform that provides copy/signal trading, it means that you yourself must have experience with trading, but I will not follow what copy/signal trading is because almost everything is full of manipulation, especially what is done on the telegram channel/group almost everything is bullshit. Maybe you will not manipulate but your members who share the signal may be the ones who will carry out the manipulation unless you can verify all the data before sharing it in the group which means it takes longer and your signal may not up to date",

I meant \"signal platform\". Users subscribe to traders' signals (they receive those via platform, email or SMS) and can decide whether copy the signal or not. It won't be automated. It's my mistake, because I used the expression \"copy trading\" which means automated copy trading but I rather mean signal trading, when you get the signal and decide what to do it for your own. I just edited the original post.Quote from: Silberman on June 08, 2022, 06:47:45 PMIf you did all of that then you would at least gain the trust of those which may like to use such platform as you are revealing the real results the traders get, however there is a reason scammers are so successful and keep deceiving people over and over again, and that is because people look for extraordinary results, which most of the time means inflating or even falsifying the real results traders can get, so I would not be surprised if not many people wanted to use your platform as your traders will offer less accuracy and profits even if the results are real.Yeah, I agree. But I believe that still some % of people would prefer those ordinary profits with less accuracy with the knowledge that those profits are real and achievable. I'm a good example of that. I don't believe in promising the moon any more.Quote from: yhiaali3 on June 09, 2022, 04:03:23 AMYou have to build trust first, big trading exchanges are full of clone trading from top traders who have great experience in this field and have high credibility, so it is never easy to convince people to leave the big platforms and go to your platform, there should be high incentives that make people go to your platform such as low fees or high positive results, etc., all of this takes time to build.

There is no competition with big, established platforms who offer copy trading like eToro. It's my mistake, because I used the expression \"copy trading\" which means automated copy trading but I rather mean signal trading, when you get the signal and decide what to copy it for your own or not. I just edited the original post.I see some advantages of verified signal trading over copy trading:1) It's multi-platform - you can make the trade on any exchange you use, you are not bound to one platform like eToro2) You decide whether to make the trade or not, it's not automatic and you have the final word3) You can subscribe to many signal trading options and pick up the trades you will comfortable withThe obvious disadvantage is that there is a time delay between the signal and your trade, which may affect the final profits and it's also more time consuming because you have to decide whether to make the trade or not and then make it for your own. But I think that it's still worth the effort.",

No trading signal provider will tell you 100% honestly, there will be always anything that is hidden or shared lately after they got the profits. I ever joined paid VIP trading signal but mots signal can't work every time I got the signal, they always share the rate and analysis after they got several percent profits,  but when we enter the market, the situation has been changing. And then the signal will not really work much. It is better to still analyze by ourselves in order to be satisfied with what we are doing.",

I wish you success.Unless if those pro traders are also using his sites. They can also post their trades there and maximize their earnings as I see that this was a paid service. Not only the site can earn but they should also share some of their income to the traders that shares their strategies. Those traders must use the same name as what they are using on popular trading platforms. Results can depend on the traders that you copy but you should see their ratings and feedbacks to judge if which of them are worth it to pick.Quote from: FenixS on June 08, 2022, 10:43:29 AMWhat do you guys think about such a platform? What are pros and cons? This is a good idea since crypto trading is still growing and so many traders are looking for this kind of service. The pro's are there already but about the cons? I think that will be the originality. Traders won't have it if they will just depend on others.",

Is just the same thing when some random guy goes on YouTube to show some profit made on video and never show the loses and mistakes. Is usual that people like success story and that is what they get which make them run to pay fees and they don't get same result that attracted them initially. This is surely a ground for survival of those that can survive. While some are making sffort to learn others scamming others in the name of having the real strategy that works. It is only your personal strategy that works if you can learn it.",

What I meant is, those paid groups are using technical analysis for their trading signal. Hence thats the thing you need to learn about or do it on your own so you can be dependent on your own trade and not even relying on those paid one that only shows the reality of their positive gains but not showing their losses too.",
