OK. More bitcoin uses the blockchain as storage which is a distributed ledger that uses PoW for its security and timestamps for very little.

It is cryptographically secured because it is the blockchained Database. If you alter one single indexed number, then it will alter the rest of the merkele tree and makes it unsecured. If any information in a merkle tree is changed then the root node is changed and bitcoin survives off the root node of old blocks being unchangeable as a hash of them with other data is referenced by the next block.

It is impossible because it is the bullet proof Blockchain technology with the permanent clock base structure behind it for absolute security. The distributed proof of work algorithm and the decentralised network is what keeps everything secure. It's not exactly that there's one clock that decides everything, there's many! This is what keeps things more secure. The Internet would have to reduced to barely anything to ensure all of these clocks/nodes are disconnected from the network.",

      "body": "\"clock base structure\" ?bitcoin is not a clocklike employmentwhen people do work. the boss does not look at the clock on the wall to do the accounting of wages and workload performed.. he looks at the sign-in log sheet of employees that turned up to work. bitcoin is not the clock on the wall, its the employee timesheet on the table which includes the work they performed that day",
