  "content": "BTC works because of PoW. Satoshi realized that consensus in a network could be achieved if the nodes committed computationallly to their version of the story. Using computational means to show how confident you are that you're speaking the truth prevents malicious nodes to influence the network with untruthful facts. But \"computational\" is too theoretical of a term. In reality, miners care, not about how many operations their calculations are taking, nor how long they're taking, but about how expensive the next block will be to mine. Really, miners use financial means to back up their version of the story. If their block is accepted by the network then the financial goods spent in the mining process are collected back with a profit; otherwise they're lost. Miners stake their financial goods to \"prove their point\".Now, I guess many miners use traditional currency to buy all those nasty plastic high-tech gadgets that speed up their calculations. My two questions.Does this economically \"link\" in some way BTC to physical currencies?And more importantly. If the time comes that the traditional currencies are replaced by BTC, miners will spend BTC to buy their graphic cards and everything they need, so they'll actually stake BTC in order to prove their point. So in a fully bitcoinized economy, won't PoW be identical to proof-of-stake? Let's just obviate the immense pile of e-trash and the huge electricity consumption gap that separates both protocols in reality.The title of this post should be \"Will PoW converge to PoS?\" but I liked a catchier version.",

Let's just obviate the immense pile of e-trash and the huge electricity consumption gap that separates both protocols in reality.You have asked a good question and it is really a good one and if we conclude things on the basis of your statements then I can say yes it do resembles with POS but if technically speaking you don't really need BTC to start mining, as you can start mining with fiat directly while in POS you must need ETH to stake. And in POS you basically your experience for specific time period but you don't lock your components which you have bought using your Bitcoin as you can sell your components like your mining machines etc. anytime.",

In PoW it is all about cost of the \"work\" required to become the \"longest chain\". A malicious actor needs to compete with the majority to create the longest chain, since the cost to do that (a 51% attack) is too high, it becomes impossible.QuoteMiners stake their financial goods to \"prove their point\".Well, miners do have a \"stake\" in the game but it is not the same as \"proof of stake\" because in the later you virtually perform no actual work and are only rewarded for having money!!! Meanwhile a miner in a PoW algorithm is performing actual work and is being paid for that work.QuoteDoes this economically \"link\" in some way BTC to physical currencies?No.QuoteLet's just obviate the immense pile of e-trash and the huge electricity consumption gap that separates both protocols in reality.There is a lot more than separates the two specially if we go beyond just the mining algorithm and compare bitcoin with ethereum. The later is a useless centralized shitcoin with unlimited supply and a massive premine and to top it all it has a mutable blockchain while the former is a unique decentralized payment system with no premine and with an immutable blockchain.",

Let's just obviate the immense pile of e-trash and the huge electricity consumption gap that separates both protocols in reality.1.Nope. BTC has no \"economical link\" to physical currencies.2.Nope. Bitcoin will never replace the traditional currencies. You wanna know why? Several days ago, a had to pay 70 USD transaction fee to move a small amount of BTC to my wallet. That's why. The Bitcoin blockchain can't handle big quantities of transactions and it gets easily congested. Bitcoin will always remain in the form of \"digital gold\" and I'm OK with that, but I don't expect BTC to become a normal currency.This is yet another \"PoW vs. PoS\" forum post. This discussion has ended months or even years ago. There's no point starting it again.If you like Proof-of-Stake just move to a PoS altcoin. You have multiple choices.",

Look at ETH, it took them 4-5 years to build something they are comfortable about, could we really do something like that for bitcoin which has even more transactions?

(I'm not sure they will replace traditional currency with BTC)Making it like what is implemented in El Salvador, BTC and fiat currency can be used as desired, if you want to transact with BTC you can and if you want to transact with fiat currency you can also do it, in my opinion, it is still difficult for stakeholders in each country to agree.Quote from: ltcltcltc on December 15, 2023, 03:25:21 PMThe title of this post should be \"Will PoW converge to PoS?\" but I liked a catchier version.I think PoW and PoS will not be combined because the processes for achieving goals are different even though they still involve algorithms.[1] That's all I know about what PoW and PoS are.[1] https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp",

There is no chain is perfect there is always the thing that called the blockchain trilemmaTL;DRBlockchains can only handle a limited number of transactions per second. If blockchain technology is to be adopted globally, it should be able to handle much more data, and at faster speeds, so that more people can use the network without it becoming too slow or expensive to use. However, the fundamental design of many decentralized networks means that increasing scalability tends to weaken decentralization or security. This is what’s known as the blockchain trilemma. Developers looking to solve this problem are experimenting with different consensus mechanisms and scalability solutions, such as sharding, sidechains, and state channels. - https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma",

All it takes is to dump it for another coin or convert back to fiat or bitcoin. However, when you have mining equipment, you can't just sell those equipment any time or quickly. It is also difficult to switch to another coin specially since mining algorithms are different for a lot of coins.That's not to mention that in PoS you are only rewarded for having money while not doing anything at all. In PoW you have to actually work to get paid. Now with the fact that shitcoins such as ETH have a massive premine, you can see who PoS benefits the most",

Let ETH run it on PoS and see how it goes.We have done it before, obviously not something as big as this, but when we moved to segwit that was moving blockchain and that was some playing around with fire situation and nothing bad happened about it as far as I am aware. That means, we have changed some stuff before and we have all done it together. You get to see wallet addresses that start with 3 nowadays, not with 1 that commonly anymore do you?I mean it's still possible that you could do that, legacy is still there if you want to use it, but it's not all that common at all. This is why I can say that if we really want to move to PoS then I do not think that it's that impossible, I think it's quite possible and it may actually happen on the long run as well. We just need to make sure that the security on it is tight and we all know that it's going to be a tough deal so we all need to be patient about it, if we keep on doing something that's dangerous then we are not going to be quite good at it.",
