  "content": "Good idea ? Plan to build gold storage maybe art storage.On the start up based plan so you can invest in and later earn some % from the holders fees.The idea is that we Also can sell the holders physical gold or art and transfering money to owner to bank cash or by crypto.How much revenue we can earn ? Well If just 500 000 people will pay fees like 50$ it's allready huge profit and after paying the storage maintance and utility bills like electricity and for security Im sure there will be good profit even after all that expenses. The service should be cheap enough so many people can use that service It's great service for collecting fees with crypto the holders can pay fees instantly with crypto around the world.But imagine If many people around the world will pay storage fees it's signifant profit and constant income and it's good If someone will hold physically goods with value like gold and do Even handling and selling for you.What location should be good for this ? I think it will be untited states or maybe canada  becouse it got be secure enough and with low war risk.It's good idea becouse it's not easy to hold goods in your home it's good If someone holding for you and handling it for you with security.Also need good suggestions about location in where to build this off course with cheap enough Property or land.I need good but cheap enough security people to work with so to build up top security for this any suggestions?We can use USA military planes and army Even If we do transport the goods for our customers also Im sure Trump or Biden will give aid If they see this kind of good business need aid maybe equipments or stuff. Currently this idea can be good becouse there is risk of war so in times of war we know how difficult will be to move goods like Gold bars around the world so it would be perfect If someone will hold it for you. And the process should be easy enough for average person who want to use that service.tanks for ur opinion If i see real people who want to invest in this asap i'll start working with this right to way tomorow.",

      "body": "Do you remember that old James Bond 007 movie, \"Goldfinger,\" from the mid 1960s? Goldfinger was a bad guy who owned a bunch of gold. His idea was to set off a dirty nuke at Fort Knox, the US repository for its gold, so that the gold would become so radioactive that nobody could access it for 200 years. This would make the value of his gold soar.Storing the gold would have to follow these points:1. Well enough away from where it could be nuked by the US, Russia, Canada or China.2. But not hidden, so that everybody would know where their gold was being stored.3. And accessible so that anybody could take ownership of his gold at almost any time by shipping it to him.4. And what about if the country where the gold was stored decided to make gold ownership illegal, and confiscated it all?And that would only be starters. The price of security would eat away the value of the gold.Personally, I would be uncomfortable handling this kind of valuable property belonging to other people.",
