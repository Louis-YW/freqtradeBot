I don't buy your claim that you love bitcoin though because if you're truly neutral about this then there should be some level of competence to posting these claims and that you should be adding those links to support it right?

And, yes, monopoly is always a tendency not just with mining but also with the limited supply. I also agree that BTC products will probably be used more than real BTC. And we don't have to wait for the future to see this happening. Right now, many don't own a single Bitcoin; what they own are numbers provided to them by exchanges and other custodial platforms. And, yes, while Bitcoin may not die, in terms of relevance, there's likelihood that gold might outlive Bitcoin. In the meantime, while at its infancy, let's stack as much Satoshis as possible.",

Let's save MSM the trouble and agree.... \"there is no evidence of that\".1. You could say this about any investable asset, and yet people still invest in assets. This is not a worry. Any big long holder of any asset can sell at any time. And I don't even know why you are talking about 20 million bitcoin being immobile or \"every transactions includes risk of loss\", you're just making stuff up there. Basically none of what you said in #1 is an issue to worry about.2. You don't seem to know what a pool is. A pool isn't a single entity. And there is high competition in mining, in addition the incentives in bitcoin are such that it would make no sense to attack it. So this isn't a realistic worry.3. Not sure what your point here even is. At first your say Bitcoin is too complicated, then you start talking about ETFs and Blackrock for some reason. Anyway, people can learn how to use Bitcoin. Tens of millions of people already have. And for the people who need it idiot proof, they'll just use custodians anyway and it'll be as easy for them as using Apple Pay or Venmo.4. Okay now I'm starting to think you're a troll cuz #4 was just nonsensical.5. You don't seem to understand the value of hard money. No reason for me to refute this here, you just need to learn about money.6. This again is a trolling comment with no real argument so no reason to refute it.7. Yes elites run the world. And yes they like that they can manipulate the fiat system. They also like to put their money into assets that increase their wealth exponentially. Which is why more and more of them over time are getting into Bitcoin. So this isn't a negative for Bitcoin, it's a positive.8. This is another dumb one.Done and done. Now go buy some Bitcoin cuz it has been succeeding for the past 15 years!",

Because all other assets also have big risks that can result in losses. So risk is a normal and commonplace thing, therefore there is no need to exaggerate it. Because without you realizing it, most bitcoin investors know this risk. But the difference is that they don't think about it too much. Because if you think about it too much it will definitely turn into fear.Quote from: Westerboob on January 04, 2024, 11:23:57 PM2.

Because if there is a person or group that monopolizes bitcoin, indirectly this will make bitcoin increase. So if, for example, rich people monopolize bitcoin, ordinary investors will not remain silent. In essence, when rich people monopolize bitcoin, ordinary investors must be able to take advantage of the opportunities from this monopoly.",

And it almost happen, many early adopters quit and few of them really stay. But still even if the disappearance of Satoshi, the market continue to thrive to where it is right now.So to say that there are reasons now for Bitcoin to fail? it could be just pure hatred on it, in my opinion. Then we think and insert terms, and what not to confuse Bitcoin enthusiast and then preach all about the so called fiat system.The OP love for Bitcoin is questionable because with his 8 prophecy of doom why it'll Fail gives no room for love, coming from a person that has such strong contrary views about it, perhaps he's giving intelligent contrary opinions why Bitcoin can fail. Bitcoin is designed to be volatile, therefore it's market trends that determines it's pump and dump in price will always give it a balance and relevance, and people will continue to invest in it because it'll keep being profitable. It has survived in it's infancy to this stage with many skeptical minds that we're against it now realizing it's potentials as the valuable asset that was intelligently designed to outlive us.",

      "body": "Everyone who has ever bought bitcoin has had these doubts. Some of them come on the forum to spell out their worst fears and then the community assuages them. Like clockwork, LOL..Do you think people did not think of all this in the past 14 years? Imagine the 20 year olds in 2009, poring over their computers to set up PC miners and P2P exchanges, who are now grown men. Those who saw bitcoin in their prime are now at influential positions. The whole ecosystem of DLT that Bitcoin spawned is not going anywhere. Bitcoin is the true asset layer of every other chain and all these trading and options layers being built on top of it.Granted that we are not going to see hyperbitcoinization in our lives, but we aren't going to see its demise too. Just too much money is locked into it right now. With the ETF, there will be institutions locked in too. The only way that bitcoin 'fails' is if everything else fails too. Come to think of it, the dollar as reserve currency is also really just printed out of thin air. Yet, it is the backing of the billions that actively use it which gives it value. Similarly, the use of Bitcoin has also become sufficiently widespread to be resilient enough.",

Predictable BTC loss is destabilizing.  Every transaction includes risk of  loss, meaning a greater portion of supply that is immobile will grow.  No, that's not solved with divisibility.   The world cannot have confidence trading it's wealth in 1 million BTC with 20 million sitting on chain immobile.  If another million can suddenly wake up because an unknown pool has been hoarding them, it wrecks the market.When we are diving into crypto I think at first we have to know the risk of possible loss, you cannot jump into an investment that you don't personally know. Quote from: Westerboob on January 04, 2024, 11:23:57 PM2. Big tech trends towards monopoly, BTC will eventually be controlled and one pool will control 51%.  Dominant pools already have emerged, which means Monoply is inevitable.  A truly decentralized system has no components that trend towards centralization.Just go with the flow, we all know that in crypto space pump and dump is quiet common. If Bitcoin don't work with you then just don't take part. Quote from: Westerboob on January 04, 2024, 11:23:57 PM4. It's a piece of code. It's not actual gold, AU, which is fixed on the Periodic Table as an element.  There is no \"AU.version3.45\", and you can't copy it and turn it into ButtCoin.v2For me Bitcoin is digital gold, physical gold is different.Quote from: Westerboob on January 04, 2024, 11:23:57 PM5. BTC has value only in it's \"potential\" - which creates real transient value because people want it -  but that only runs until is potential declines. It's a fad.  Like any pump and dump, the profit is in the sales.Since Bitcoin is a revolutionary digital currency, people might need it's potential rather than want it. Quote from: Westerboob on January 04, 2024, 11:23:57 PM6. BTC's real profitability is through market manipulation, the absolute value is irrelevant. Coordinate actions by whales, or quotes by Elon Musk can cause big moves.  It's profitable in both rises and crashes, with the retail investor paying the price.True. That is the reason why some traders made millions of dollars based on the market status. Hodlers also make profit with this kind of situation. The solution to this is buy during dip, apply DCA, and then hodl. Quote from: Westerboob on January 04, 2024, 11:23:57 PM7. Elites run the world and fiat is easier for them to manage, and pleebs follow them in exchange for small boons.  Elites move their fiat systems to CBDC with an XRP model, since XRP was designed to emulate a Fed (which is why us government locked it down). It mints and owns the XRP and passes them into circulation to banks it sees fit.  No, your XRP will have no value Sad. They will copy the code and issue CBDC tokens.The reason why I only own Bitcoin. Based on my observation, investors were quiet active in Altcoins but at the end of the day they end up converting all of it to Bitcoin. 😅",
