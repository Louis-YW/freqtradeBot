Out of 10 available ad slots, only 9 are auctioned off and the rest is set for facoid slots ad. You can see all the information here- https://bitcointalk.org/adrotate.php?adinfo",

My impulses took over for this one Quote from: factoidposts should actually contain ideas, and these ideas should be argued reasonablyOn note of not clicking the link though, it's available when you click \"advertise here\" on any topic with a reply and they're quite interesting to go through once to see if there's anything you've missed or see quotes users here have put in (especially ones not as active any more).

And normally takes being noticed by Theymos I think but there might be a thing that vips get a slot and some reputable people might get one too.I've checked on archive sites and can't find a copy since last December, but it wasn't on there so it's been added since.",

Happy to help get BPIP some of the recognition it deserves. My understanding is anyone who can see the donators section including VIPs can request a permanent factoid slot with minimal limitations, but outside of that anyone can suggest factoids that would be useful to forum users. Whether they get added or not is probably based on how useful they actually are to the forum or its users...and here they are with links!  QuoteActivity + Trust + Earned Merit == The Most Recognized Users on Bitcointalk[BPIP] Who are your biggest merit fans?

I don't think people need to be concerned as much as they are about random stats from users here.  Especially when you consider that the people running them are obsessed with controlling the trust network and that's why they were drawn to these projects in the first place.  I think the obsession with tracking stats has led to attacks of honest people like myself and made this place a far worse environment for everyone as a result.  I wish people cared as much about real Bitcoin activity or projects that actually exist on the blockchain as they did about trying to be ranked high on a website that let's be honest, has devolved into a digital billboard.",

Agreed.  I think bpip.org should focus on key metric stats that everyone can agree MATRs (matters).  Large forums like this allow scammers to hide multiple accounts and cooperate with other scammers to manipulate lists.  Aggregation sites like BPIP, Loyce and Ninjastic allow the average Joe to investigate.  Quote from: ibminer on September 15, 2022, 07:59:18 PMHappy to help get BPIP some of the recognition it deserves.
