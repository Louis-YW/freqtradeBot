So the fact is that , success in investment is directly linked to smartness.Â  It deals with smartness while also circling around patients. Some investors have the zeal to invest but may not have the patience to hold their coins during a bear market. You are right that not everyone will make a profit, but the fact that if you don't sell your coin cheaply, you will make a profit is correct. Some investors also invest wrongly in Bitcoin, which is why if the market becomes so bearish, they become scared thinking that all their assets will get liquidated, so they rush into selling for just a little or no profit. The reason why I said some people invest wrongly is because if someone is earning like $1000 a month and they decide to start investing in Bitcoin, on their first investment, they buy $700 worth of Bitcoin, and after a week, the price of BTC drops by -15%, leaving their asset at a significant loss. Let's say at that moment when the price is down, an emergency comes up for the man, and he needs instant $500 to solve the problem. At that point in time, if his Bitcoin investment is his only option to solve that problem, he would not mind selling at a loss. That's why it's good if we always map out our budget and only invest the right amount in Bitcoin, so it doesn't affect us.Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",

Bitcoin investment is similar to every other type of business which is no doubt expose to ups and downs, the fluctuations in the market can and has made so many investors calculated wrongly due to the fear about their investment going A WALL. Only the smart one who are willing to hold and buy more during theÂ  dip and it doesn't necessarily need for you to buy big but continues DCA strategy can go a long way.",

Well, this is true. Another one's profit is another one's loss. This always happens especially in trading. Who said that every holder can't be rich at the same time? It has 2 factors IMO. The time when you bought Bitcoin, and the amount of time you held it. If you bought Bitcoin earlier than most investors, you will get more profit thus, it might make you rich. On the other hand, those who bought a bit late can get lesser profits than those who bough earlier. TBH, the word \"rich\" has a very broad definition when it comes to investing, but one thing's for sure thought. You bought it earlier, you will gain more profits (base on history).",

This is something that happens In every other business. So the fact is that , success in investment is directly linked to smartness.Â  Profits from investing have indeed encouraged more people to invest in cryptocurrencies in their own ways and strategies, but this does not always have to be related to intelligence because that alone will not be enough to get profits for an investor. There are several other things that also greatly support an investor in making a profit, namely luck in choosing investment assets at certain moments so that someone can benefit even though their intelligence is still below average.This means that someone simply researches which cryptocurrency is most liked by many people and then buys it for investment. Even though he is not that smart compared to other people, but if he is lucky enough with the cryptocurrency he bought for investment purposes, then he can also get profit. So without having to be too smart, someone can still benefit through their investment, although an investor doesn't have to be too stupid either in choosing cryptocurrency for investment.",

This applies not only to the crypto market, but also to the traditional stock market. In both cases, the same financial laws work. If at the same time all investors want to sell their assets, be it cryptocurrencies or classic stocks, then there will not be enough money for everyone. That's the way these markets work, and the situation you describe is called a zero-sum game (if one makes a profit, then someone else loses a profit).
