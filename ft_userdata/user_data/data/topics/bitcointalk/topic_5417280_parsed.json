The Indian Police have launched a polygon blockchain based complaint registration portal. Indian district named Firozabad located 40km away from the world famous Taj Mahal have launched this complaint registration portal for the transparency of complaints lodged by the victims.The project is developed to solve the issue of officials refusing to file complaint against victims and to avoid the manipulation of the complaints. With this people can easily lodge their complaints without fear and keep the complaints away from manipulation by the officials. This system will serve as a key system in the Indian Police System where corruption is a big problem from the lower level.Source: India Police Launch Pilot Polygon-Based Complaint Registration Portal",

I even did a video on how accurately it could detect a fake/copycat with a small adaption to the 3D shape and it did very wellhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TlDE69Tmmsyou could also use this tech to generate passwords with objects you have at home that only you would know about. If you loose the password you can always literally recover it by scanning the item. Just make sure it's not stolen or your partners throws it in the garbage  DYOR but if you want more details check out the ANN thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5382009.0I fully believe in this project and I'm hoping it will revolutionise digital assets.",

I've been saying for years that it is a great tool for public ledgers because of its immutability, making it extremely difficult for other parties to tamper with the contents of the said ledger. It can also be a starting campaign to publicize government records that should be known to the public, but I think that wouldn't see the light of day.India is a country full of technologically-inclined citizens. They can easily spearhead a lot of projects that will benefit a lot of people, and this complaints system is a start.",

And it's faster and the transaction fee is cheaper so it must be worth it to use thier own. With the population they have, they really need this kind of service which there must have lots of crime committed every minute while government officials also can be corrupt.",

Let's suppose, for example, that a complaint against the victims is highly transparent, and manipulation of complaints has been avoided. Are these provisions implemented? If corruption is rampant in the country, adding a blockchain will not solve the problem. Blockchain will succeed in environments with minimal accountability for individuals.Also, such solutions are expensive and the possibility of defaming victims and policemen is high, and if there is the possibility of deleting the data, then it will be centralized and other problems.",

I remember as early as 2018, the government of Canada has been using blockchain for their registration or at least showing their people the incoming budget of a certain government project ans how and where the money is spent (if my memory serves me right).And then the whole idea of election votes going into blockchain so that the data can't be tampered by anyone, or manipulate in order for a candidate to win the election. This are just some of the real life usage of blockchain and hopefully it will gain traction for government to used it.",

But so far, it hasn't had much impact on traditional methods.The user can track their submission by a token number and their phone number, the point is it didn't show any information/proof it was being recorded in the blockchain. Truth be told, I did not know the reasoning for incorporating blockchain, if some authority wants to make its bureaucratic system better, using a conventional regular database is enough. They just need to implement an access/log record system where any submission by any user should be unmodified as it is, and those who are truly in control can manage within the system by just simply watching the access log. With that in mind, transparency still can be maintained and monitored by the public.",
