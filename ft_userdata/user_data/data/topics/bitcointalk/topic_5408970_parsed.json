Here is my advice to new crypto users out there..1.

Wazirx shows that any project that starts with success can end up with great failure.3. Wazirx exchange has everything, good utility and great use cases, many make it sounds like without these is only why projects fails.",

Wazirx exchange has everything, good utility and great use cases, many make it sounds like without these is only why projects fails.In every success stories. There are outliers and exception to that. Its not wazirX is careless but they did a mistake and Binance should speak on it. Maybe we all knew that any project affiliated with binance cant suffer a heavy hit but surprise, its happening now. It always depend on the project how transparently they could show their cleanliness and honesty. Well I do hope users of wazirX are safe and able to overcome such news that are spreading.",

But we can't, because.. 1/2The WazirX founding team maintained control of the operations of the platform. We (Binance) were never give data or control of users, KYC, etc. We would love to work with ED to fix these issues in WazirX.For more information please take a look on twitter about the issue of the WazirX exchange and why the WazirX token is currently declining.",

They should have resisted the urge to take the money Binance was offering them and stayed the way they are. Now look. That buyout by CZ effectively made them puppets and that is what happens to puppets",

It was funny to read the tweets about this exchange being owned by Binance and then that supposedly Binance is not aware of such a project. And now CZ offers to transfer all funds from one exchange to another. As if all this did not lead to a new market crash, because Wazirx was a big exchange.",

As if all this did not lead to a new market crash, because Wazirx was a big exchange.Two years ago, I remember that Binance promoted Wazirx a lot and from Binance, you can even have a link to Wazirx exchange. I did not use Wazirx because I already use Binance but many local in that nation would use that exchange more because Binance is a backer.Lesson from Wazirx case, don't trust any exchange and store all your money there. They can be shut down, they can make a scam exit, they can be hacked and collapsed then are unable to compensate users. Many reasons to cause loss for your capital if you store it on exchanges.",

I haven't used this exchange but I see that they're also one of the known exchanges out there. But when it's about the decision of Binance, it is their platform and they can list and delist, remove and add features or partnerships that they want to have.",

Wazirx exchange has everything, good utility and great use cases, many make it sounds like without these is only why projects fails.It’s not the Wazirx who failed here. I have read a news 2 days back that Indian government raided on Wazirx and blocked all the cryptos. In India cryptos are not regulated properly and still consider Bitcoins as Illegal. So earlier a bill has been passed on parliament to impose tax on BTC transactions. This is the reason for which the exchange was in target of the Indian government, and for this the downfall of the exchange happened, and Binance also left it in the middle of ocean.",

Second: we can move anywhere we feel safe for our possessions, not necessarily taking their advice. Storing assets on centralized exchanges is a rather risky thing, it can collapse at any time without warning. \"It's not our keys, it's not our money.\"",

Deposit, trade and withdrawal from the exchanges should be the habit of the traders.",
