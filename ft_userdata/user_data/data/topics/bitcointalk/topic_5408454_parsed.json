As far as I know if you have some technical knowledge, you can verify if the projects is real or fake especially if the scammers have just plagiarized the white paper. It gets harder if they haven't plagiarized the white paper or created a fake team.I do see so many members expose fraudulent projects in the scam accusations board by manually reviewing them.",

You better ask here for an opinion about the mining of any coin. But if you have not paid back your equipment yet, then it is better to mine those coins that will give you the maximum profit now.",

You better ask here for an opinion about the mining of any coin.Any fifth parties notation on something shouldn't be the only fact/or fiction based information on a project, being led towards nonexistant content makes information difficult to actually confirm, What is your opinion on algorithms becoming physical centralized action based components function on a visual playing field without promoting decentralization or supporting their nodes, being referenced on the website or their vague whitepaper in addition to falling into the realm of an uncomplicated looped doubleskein function, or observable planned obsolescence for that matter.I always figured whitepapers were their admittance toward implying information to the fact. Unfortunately any extensive research just points to how easy it is to duplicate or occlude a different crypto's mission statement and how vague that type of documentation is. Making it difficult to invest hashpower in new and or existing projects on account that its difficult to gain interest in an algorithm that makes you want to mow your lawn or dance in a specific direction if that isn't specified in its operations manual.One would guess the implementation of physical representation and information based representation would imply that its easier to function as a wall of jargon than specify confirmable facts and truths.Couldn't an algorithm take interest in self preservation and relevance, maintaining its backbone and presence be part of its decentralization policy; budgeting to maintain nodes in difficult to reach areas, assisting in maintaining anonymity without negatively effecting other participants, or you know innocent bystanders. Also when algorithms arent functioning properly or lack the proper support, shouldn't the information base at least include instruction sets on how to resuscitate the ecosystem of its respective crypto and what to expect, timetables, references...etc",

There are more than 20,000 cryptocurrencies on the coinmarketcap, but in reality there are many more cryptocurrencies. Any technical document can be redone so that it does not look like plagiarism.
