Now the news that Tess Rinearson, who was made the head of Twitter crypto team has made a tweet stating that he is leaving the company. Many other people in the crypt unit of Twitter space also followed her and announced that they will also be leaving the company. What impact do you think this will have on crypto space in general ? I am sure they must be working on crypto inclusion on the platform in some way and now when they have left the decisions will be delayed in this matter.",

Starting with cutting workers monthly 'rest days', stopping those working remotely and laying off workers here and there, what did you expect? I guess Tess had to take the leave option. At least for her peace of mind, heh! I think Musk would have to back pedal on this rigid control method cause it may cause more mass exodus of not just prominent, but efficient and important workers leaving the company.",

This is what it is confusing me as well, I can understand if some employees got fired as a way to try to increase profit margins during this transitional period in which Elon began to understand how to make Twitter a profitable enterprise, but he is firing people left and right for no reason at all, those people were already very good at what they do, and if they had knowledge about the internal code of the company then competitors like Facebook could recruit them immediately to get to know those secrets, so I cannot help to think that he is making a mistake with these moves.",
