  "content": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/72-of-russians-say-they-have-never-bought-bitcoin-survey\"A new survey hints at a lack of crypto awareness in Russia as only 6% of respondents were found to have a good knowledge of crypto.\"According to estimations by InDeFi CEO Sergey Mendeleev, the number of active and passive crypto users in Russia currently amounts to less than 1% of the total 144.4 million population. I was amazed that the figures were so low, with all the sanctions and currency restrictions being placed on Russia. We know Bitcoin and Crypto currency adoption increase, when restrictions are placed on centralized Fiat systems. So why is this so low?",

In a country where for disagreeing with the policies of a great leader you go to prison for a few years or they convince you that you are going to free Europe from Nazism in the 21st century, should we be surprised that the average resident of that country is not honest when asked about Bitcoin?I think that the average Russian knows that it is much smarter to keep his mouth shut and pretend that he has never heard of or invested in Bitcoin, and that is not something that is smart to do only in Russia, but also anywhere in the world.",

By the numbers in the last topic you have 8% of Indians owning and using crypto, that would make at least 1.5 million crypto users in the metro area of New Delhi yet you have 3 businesses accepting crypto there. Yeah, it makes total sense, isn't it?Move out of the capital cities of most countries and do mention Bitcoin and let's see how many will look at you as if something is wrong with you as you speak gibberish.Do you think with 700 million people owning Bitcoin we would still be at 20k a piece?We're nowhere near that level of adoption and look at the really bright side, if already 1/3 of the world would be owning crypto, what would be left for growth?Quote from: Lucius on August 26, 2022, 09:18:30 AMFirst of all, the source of the news is something I don't want to click on at all, and secondly, who is the person you are indirectly promoting here? The fact that someone is the CEO of a company does not mean that he can estimate how many Russians know or do not know what Bitcoin is, and even less whether they own it or not. I actually think he is far closer o the actual numbers than sot of those, I sometimes have a feeling that anything over 5% for an entire country is an over exaggeration right now, I know personal experiences are not relevant at this level but I highly doubt that there is somebody here who can claim that in each family he knows there is at least one crypto owner.",

Would it be for speculation, gambling, buying something in the darknet, moneylaundering, day trading altcoins or buying regular items.

We also know sanctions are in place to restrict their economic growth and that is hurting everyone... not just the people who wanted this war.  In Russia, almost stably, about 70 percent of the population support military aggression against Ukraine and call for stronger bombing of peaceful Ukrainian cities and other settlements. The fact that some small percentage there do not support their country’s attack on Ukraine and they can talk about it quietly except in their kitchen does not please Ukrainians at all, who have been under Russian bombing for ten months now. Russia in the 21st century is openly committing genocide of an entire nation in the center of Europe, and therefore it would be just abnormal to expect a normal, non-hostile attitude towards Russia.But the Russians still face a retribution. Due to the difficult economic situation, the government will get to their cryptocurrency. Therefore, I do not see a good prospect for crypto enthusiasts there.",

The fact that Russia is at war.... does not mean that all Russian support this action.  Since the topic is bumped, I noticed that you even spelled my name wrong, and it's not really that complicated. I'm not saying that there aren't good people in that country, but most of them are for war and I honestly don't care if Bitcoin is banned in that country or not. This is not any positive news for the Bitcoin community, until people decide to change the government, neither Bitcoin will help them.Quote from: Kakmakr on October 14, 2022, 05:51:57 AMBitcoin adoption might increase, because people in Russia might need Bitcoin to store their wealth and to protect it from possible hyper inflation in the future.

There are certainly those who cannot leave for various reasons, but we cannot live in the illusion that the majority is against the war when we know that this is a simple lie. The price for what they did and what they are still doing should be the highest possible.",
