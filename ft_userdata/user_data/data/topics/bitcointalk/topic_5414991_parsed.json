Many people will advise against borrowing to buy Bitcoin but just as you rightly said in your post, it depends on individual conditions and chances. In your case you were lucky to have bought Bitcoin in 2017 when the Bitcoin bull market was highly intense according to the price at that time and you were able to sell at a gain but you did not tell us how much profits you make from the $150 invested into Bitcoin and what your entry and exit price was, but am sure you made some good profit and you didn't go above what you can afford.",

There’s no wrong actually from borrowing money as long as you intend to use it for bigger and brighter purposes. And it’s definitely most of the big time investors are doing so that give them more opportunities to gain and earn. However, as long as you never invest for a wrong investment or that has a red flag, then your borrowed money won’t be compromised.",

Just because there's two possible outcomes doesn't mean that the chances are 50/50. Investing in Bitcoin higher chance of success than investing in an altcoin. And your success also depends on your actions. Even if you buy Bitcoin and it will go up, you need to have patience to hold it and not sell at a loss. And you need to avoid losing it to malware, scams, hacks. Investing with borrowed money is never a good idea. Investing should only ever be done with your own spare funds that you can lose. Because if you are risking your last money, you're achieving the opposite thing - making yourself poorer.",

You have proven that borrowing money is a good idea. It is very helpful if you use the borrowing money in the right way, isn't it? As long as we don't borrow money excessively and use the money for something that we really understand, it sometimes effectively gains bigger profits. However, don't make it as a habit, you won't always succeed to gain profits every time borrow money.Regarding the chance to get a good result, it is actually the same as using our own money. And the chance can be higher (more than 50% to succeed) if we have enough knowledge and experience in it. Crypto investment is risky, but it isn't like gambling, we should have many ways to increase the opportunity to succeed.",

      "body": "First off, if you are looking for a way to get quick cash and then invest it into Bitcoin, this is not always going to work out. It is important to remember that borrowing money is rarely good for your financial situation and will put you at risk of defaulting on your payments. There is no guarantee that Bitcoin will rise in value over time, so you may end up in a worse financial situation than before. You should only borrow money if it is absolutely necessary, and then do so as sparingly as possible. My suggestion is to not invest money you cannot afford to lose, not just because of the risk that Bitcoin may not rise in value but also because of the risk that it may fall dramatically. It might be better to save up and wait until you have the money required, instead of putting your financial future at risk by borrowing money to buy Bitcoin. Understandably, there is incredible excitement regarding future investments given how well cryptocurrencies have performed over the years. But that does not mean you should treat buying Bitcoin as an opportunity to get rich quick.",

Investing in bitcoin may also comes with luck but it’s more on knowledge and skills. And when you think borrowing for initial investment is good, well it depends. If you are investing in potential coins that have proven its worth a lot of times, then maybe borrowing money is a good alternative as long as you also borrow an amount that you are capable to pay even when crypto investment fails.",

Crypto investment is risky, but it isn't like gambling, we should have many ways to increase the opportunity to succeed.The knowledge one develops before investing in Bitcoin doesn't correlate with the price (if it will appreciate or depreciate), because the direction the price will take at any given time is unpredictable. You can't have enough knowledge or experience to increase your chances or time your ROI when you invest in Bitcoin, you basically just buy and hodl for the long term, thus if your lender will be needing their money anytime soon, borrowing to invest shouldn't be part of ones plans. Having said that, when it comes to Bitcoin investment i don't think there is any particular trick to it in order to increase your chances of success, you basically just have to do the simple things like being patient and understanding that it isn't a get-rich-quick scheme, and it is much easier to do all these if the money invested is yours.",

But IMO, investing in Bitcoin with the amount that you can afford is the best way to invest, just like saving the amount little by little and storing it in the bank that you have control with your own money (in a non-custodial wallet).All kind of investments has been tied up with risk, you should understand it first and be ready for the consequences that may happen in the future, at least there's should be a plan B.",

Very rarely do we see that people return their loans from an investment since the result is always the opposite- most people who borrowed money to invest in cryptocurrency fell short due to the latter's nature.Good thing that you borrowed a relatively short amount of capital. There are others here who aim to loan large amounts of sum for their returns to double. While your case may be the living proof that it is possible, the cons outweigh the pros in this case. But as a general rule, if someone were to borrow a loan to invest into cryptocurrency, better have a backup/contingency plan in case your investment incurred a loss in the process.",

It's an unspoken rule not to use borrowed funds for investments, not just Bitcoin, for the same reason you wouldn't go to a casino with borrowed money. Things can quickly deteriorate, and you're screwed, especially if you have a bank loan and are paying interest. If something occurs and you're unable to make your payments on time, accrued interest will quickly accumulate, putting you in serious debt. If I remember correctly, a member here recently claimed that he took a loan of over $10.000 in order to buy bitcoin. This not only poses significant risks in the event that Bitcoin or the market crashes severely, but it also significantly reduces your APY, assuming everything goes as planned.Luckily, Bitcoin's prices were much lower in 2017 and it was considered a great period for purchases, regardless of what your capital was, in which case it was small and even if it didn't go as planned, you wouldn't be in so much trouble, but it is still something to be avoided.",
