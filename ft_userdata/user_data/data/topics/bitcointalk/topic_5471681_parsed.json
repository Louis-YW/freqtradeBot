Since I was introduced to forex trading via a third party,  so my experience was not a favourable one and at that, I won't want to ever repeat the same again.",

Yeah, of course, you need another source of income and what's not. But it's very hard to trade on Forex if you are a newbie.It's better to just be a long term holder in crypto, not that complicated unlike Forex trading, just saying.",

Anyway, as people teach about forex. What I don't like about it is you guys are making it look easy that trading there is like an instant money. But you never say that it's also like the crypto market that's highly volatile or even more. That is the reality that each one of you must say because that's what I have heard with some forex traders that have made a video encouraging people to do it.",

      "body": "Forex trading is good though, I've seen some persons who make it out of forex investment. Some of them, have bought themselves houses and cars. But the truth is, forex trading is more like gambling to me. The fact that after research and study on forex, you are still likely to experience losses as a gambler those. No matter the testimonies of forex traders, it's still no match for bitcoin investment which requires just little knowledge. What irritats me the most is the ability of some traders to depend on forex signals from some sites, like telegram signal group. Its so dumb having signals from humans like you, how sure are you that you're not bring scammed .",

Is he trying to teach us about Forex or is he trying to provide us with some information? Above all creating a post about Forex which is not an altcoin on this board is not right.

The value of the currency is a reflection of the market's opinion on the current health of a particular country's economy. In crypto, it's the health of the digital economy.",

It's pretty hard to comprehend the content of the OP topic, I was able to make sense of the thread from the subject that talks about forex, I hope he can improve on giving his message a clearer meaning. What is traded in forex is obviously money, fiat currencies of different countries, they're paired and traded on the stock market, a trader can trade directly or through a third party that is a broker. It can be traded only on working days of the week, excluding weekends being Saturdays and Sundays. While cryptocurrency trading are digital currencies that are traded on the crypto market, a trader can trade on one crypto coin or with another crypto coin, and trading can be everyday. They have some similarities but their main difference is that forex is fiat currencies while crypto is digital currencies.",

This is not a forex market even though we have some firex traders who might have become a cryptocurrency traders due to switch in trading trying out how profitable the crypto market could be. Asking questions about the forex market is not really bad but asking some unimportant question when the answer is already known to the op does not really makes sense.
