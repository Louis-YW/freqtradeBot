In this era of blatant censorship we believe that POW can secure a new decentralized messaging platform. It is built using Drivechain technologies BIP-300 and BIP-301 and could be implemented into BItcoin (BTC) via a soft fork.Drivechain current sidechains that could be implemented and activated in SKYDOGENET:-Zside (Zcash sidechain)-Ethside (Ethereum sidechain)-Bitassets (NFT sidechain)-Thunder (big blocks sidechain / scaling solution)*** The current network was considered as a testnet and 3000 blocks were mined before the flash launch but due to the miners interest in the network this chain will be maintained and live on. However there might be another fork with  a fair launch announced including some new network parameters and a GPU miner available at launch. ***RPLANT mining pool has released a GPU miner with a pool using the algorithm SHAndwich.https://github.com/andru-kun/wildrig-multi/releaseshttps://pool.rplant.xyz/#skydoge#connectThere will still be an algorithm change in the coming days meanwhile you can mine there if you want...More info about the change soon!For more information join us via IRC on Libera.Chat or Freenode #skydogenetThe use of a VPN is highly recommended.Telegram : https://t.me/+MWAp8s6Q4sQ1ZTNl Discord : https://discord.gg/mAh8GvAhQQ group number of the Chinese community  606803662 (SKYDOGE is not there is it run by the Chinese community)Current network specifications:-Total supply: Around 210 billion-Algorithm: SHAndwich256 (sha256 + sha512 + sha256 instead of sha256 + sha256)-Subsidy halving interval: 2100000 blocks-Block time: 1 minute-Difficulty adjustment: 1 hour-Block initial reward: 50 000 SKYDOGE-Maturity: 100 confirmationJoin us https://skydoge.net     ██▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄      ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▓██     ▀▀▒▒▒▀▀▒▒▒▓▓▓▓█ ▄▄▄▒▒░    ░░▒▒▒▓█ ▀▀▀▒▄▄▄   ░░▒▒▒▓█   █▄░   ░░▒▒▒▒▓▓█    ▀█▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▀",
