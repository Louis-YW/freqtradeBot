Personally I was hoping Jake would get the Tommy Fury fight sorted but I guess we'll have to wait for that now. Hopefully Jake fights a true boxer after this because people won't stop complaining that he's only fighting washed up fighters way past their prime and that isn't going to change with this bout given Silva is pushing 50.",

Well I would prefer a proper boxer and someone of similar age like Tommy Fury but Silva has taken up boxing now and fought twice in 2021 with two wins as well. The age is still an issue though, but I think this is still a risky fight for Jake. If he wins then people will just say the same thing they did about his other fights - too old, washed up, not a proper boxer etc and if he loses, well, then he's lost to an old, washed up, non-boxer. Jake really needs to keep a hold of that unbeaten record as it pushes his stock and hype up with every fight and once it's gone it's gone. If he doesn't fight a 'true' boxer next then he should just go back to YouTube boxing and try fight KSI if KSI has the balls for it.",

I just want to see these dudes actually fight a legitimate boxer their own age. Regardless I’ll be tuning in hoping for a Silva KO. I completely agree! Jake Paul is not even a real boxxer in my eyes. He is just an influencer with too much time on his hands. He cannot face real opponents so he chooses aged boxxers because then he might even stand the tiniest of chances. That being said I really really hope that Jake Paul gets his lights knocked out hard. I want to see Anderson Silva embarrass Paul like he deserves. And that actually very well might happen. Even though Anderson Silva is 47 years old, he is by no means a pushover. In fact, I think Jake Paul severly miscalculated his chances at winning. Anderson da Silva is a a former UFC Middleweight Champion and holds the record for the longest title reign in UFC history. And for good reason too!",

I respect the legend, but he must be exterminated.In Paul's tweet I took one conclusion, Paul ambition to beat Silva in boxing fight next october, I'm sure everything will turn around if Paul's goal is to annihilate the UFC legend boxer.",

I’m sure this will probably be the biggest payday of his life though, so I’m glad he’s getting his bag and I hope this is his last fight.

I wasn’t aware that Anderson Silva had started boxing. That’s of course a good thing if you’re rooting for him like I will be. The age is the biggest issue, I mean a 20 something versus an almost 50 year old is just crazy. It will be interesting to see when he actually schedules a fight with a legitimate boxer and someone his own age. I guess we’ll see how this one goes first.

Silva is not very mobile because of his leg injury, seems very delicate for him to do some side steps that might crack again. When you get old, your bones get brittle and brittle.

There's even a former basketball player on his record lol.In fairness, Jake Paul knows the basics of boxing but if only his professional career started against those real boxers in their prime, his current reputation won't be that bad. As for Silva, his experience is the only foundation here in this fight. Regardless of his dominance during his prime, we can't hide the fact that at 47 years of age, his body might not cooperate anymore with his will. I don't want to support or even watch this fight too but as for other people, they want to witness the first loss of Jake Paul in his career so they might want to spend money here.Is this fight sanctioned as a professional fight? I don't know how they were able to convince Silva to accept this fight aside from money.",

Although, KSI’s fight night has surpassed Paul’s most recent outing against the former UFC welterweight champion, which did 200,000 buys.Quote tweeting the article, Paul said: “Bull**** aside, the PPV business ain’t easy.“Congrats to KSI and his boxing company. Those are great numbers. The day we finally settle this, it will break the internet and do some big PPV numbers on Showtime. \"People like Jake are hoping they can build up to that mega-money fight against someone like McGregor or Mayweather which will come with a life-changing amount. Once Connor is done with the UFC I'm sure he'll start taking these boxing exhibition matches but for now he's stuck with the UFC and daddy Dana isn't going to let him fight a youtuber, especially not one he has beef with.",
