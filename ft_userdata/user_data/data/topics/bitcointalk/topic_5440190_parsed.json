  "content": "Hello everyone!I need a formula to calculate Dogecoin Scrypt miner daily profit. I saw this PHP formula somewhere(1 * 10000 * $hashes * 86400) / ($difficulty * pow(2,32))but that's clearly not what I need. It outputs wrong daily profit (not even close) compared to coinwarz. Best Regards,David",
