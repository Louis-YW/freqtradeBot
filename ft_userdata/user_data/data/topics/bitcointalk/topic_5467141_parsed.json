For example, physical casinos could reward you differently (food, drinks, etc.), while in online casinos, the rewards you get are always money.In gambling addiction, online gambling is probably the hardest to stop because it's too easy to get in and go back whenever you like. Also, it only takes a few minutes to browse an online casino and create a gambling account.",

If you change your behavior and add other kinds of activities that make you feel good, your brain will rewire itself and you'll be able to escape addiction.But if there's nothing else fun in your life, then you will probably go back to your addiction.",

Today, we can work at home, get a helper, laundries are easier, cooking is way faster, we can also just get a food delivery to avoid cooking, and more equipment that makes life easier so we have lots of time to gamble. So, I think the era today where we use online gambling is more prone to addiction than it was before. A husband doesn't even need to make it a secret anymore because he can do it at home, no more sneaking out at night just to gamble, all he needs is a computer/phone and internet access, and voila, he can play. Also, because of the wide range of games today like slots, poker, blackjack, roulette, etc.... getting bored in gambling is non-existent as long as you have money.",

If one gets addicted already either he is a single or have a family, its gonna be hard whichever he is. So before that ever happens, someone has to intervene like the father or the son. It would be awful for him.",

In gambling addiction is all psychological and it is much more difficult to break a problematic habit of many years than one of a couple of months. In addition, those who have been addicted for years on average will be older than those who have been addicted for a couple of months and will have less brain plasticity.",

      "body": "Each gambler's experience is different, whether he has been gambling since before there were online casinos until now, there are online casinos. What differentiates these gamblers is their gambling experience. Previously, they gambled face to face and met many people. Now, they can gamble using their devices online.If we talk about addiction, I think each gambler finds it difficult to eliminate his addiction. But it will come back to each gambler again because this has something to do with the intentions and efforts of each gambler to recover from their addiction. If one gambler has a stronger intention and effort to cure his addiction than other gamblers, he can cure his gambling addiction.But whatever it is, if someone is addicted to gambling, he cannot cure his addiction young. He had to fight hard to cure it and live his days going through every process of healing his gambling addiction.",

A person who is addicted to gambling must be always greedy. Especially between online gambling and offline gambling, it is natural and easy to get rid of online gambling addiction. Because by depositing only some money you can participate in gambling and once the balance is exhausted you have to deposit again. In such a situation, when the balance comes to the end, the gambler must take a break for a while.Especially I am telling true facts from the gambling scene to reality in offline gambling. Even though the gambler faces a loss, he takes a loan from the gambling club and resumes the game. And in spite of the debt, I have seen him gambling away his possessions, houses, lands, and other possessions. And due to the excessive greed of the gambler, he faced losses and remained in hiding, but the gambling addiction did not stop. So I think real gambling must be hard to stop.",

Age and experience do not matter. I’ve seen adults and college kids that were equally addicted. I had friends who made bets every day. When people reach that level it becomes almost impossible to save them from the addiction. That’s the problem with being an addict. Unless the addict himself wants to be saved, nobody can save him until they lock him up in a cell. When the addict makes up his mind and accepts the treatment, everything becomes much easier suddenly.",

Absolutely different. The old time gambler would find it difficult to adapt to the new tech particularly if he is not opened to new experiences and wants to be stuck in his old ways. And the thing about this is that the old way of gambling hasn't been flushed away by the new tech enabled gambling. People still gamble by the street corner and in all sorts of alleys. The addiction that would be harder to break is the new type of tech-enabled-crypto gambling. The casino is literally inside your pockets and you take it every where you go. And anytime you check your phone or even visit the casino website, you reinforce the addiction and make it stronger. The difference I see between the new type of tech-enabled-crypto gambling is that there is no delayed gratification as compared to the old form where you must leave your apartment building to go gamble.",

Unlike to those new gamblers which doesn't have experience on everything then it may take sometime for them to understand how the game works and most of them quit because they maybe think that gambling is to hard for them to understand. On addiction cases well both have the same chances but its still up for each person on how they can deal with their addiction and get out on worse condition they are facing.",

But gaming remains the same, it still involves the risk of losing or winning money or anything of value. Be it roadside, online, or crypto gambling,  you have to bet something hoping to win something better.  The difference is that gambling has become more convenient and private. Instead of moving out from your home or office to gamble,  you can just do it anytime and anywhere. Privacy has also been improved because you can successfully hide your gambling life from relatives or the public. But one of the challenges of this change is that it has also increased scams and fake casinos. Since most of them don't have physical offices, they can easily claim to be real and steal people's funds and victims will not have any means of seeking refunds. But those days when casinos or bet firms have a physical presence, one can easily report government authorities.",

Furthermore, the chances of forming bad gambling habits is higher for people who gamble with their properties because they practically have little risk management skills and most times looses their properties for small money. Finally, I feel online gambling is better organised and makes it possible for someone to apply skill and talents unlike the street where luck play a bigger role than skill.",

In most cases people visit physical casinos in a group and enjoy some good and drinks together. It's not everything about gambling, whereas in an online casino we are on our own and it's all about playing the casino games. Which is also why I think that gambling addictions would be different for people playing in the two types of casinos. It's much easier for someone to stay away from physical casinos than it is to stop gambling at online casinos. Anyone that is used to gamble online and becomes addicted will have problems to use the internet and not visit casinos. It only takes one click to be back at the casino and start playing again, while the other person might need to drive 1 hour to visit their favorite casino. Nonetheless both types of addictions are terrible and hard to overcome.",
