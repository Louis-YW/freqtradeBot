  "content": "Going to part ways with my 45 gram 24k gold coin from MrCryptoHodl. Â Love his stuff, and it's an awesome piece of work, but I've just decided that gold just isn't my jam. Â Will consider partial trades of other coins of lesser value plus BTC. Â I'm open to offers, reply here or DM. Â Worst I could say would be no. Â This specific coin is #27 of 33. Â Update: Â Photos redone again:",
