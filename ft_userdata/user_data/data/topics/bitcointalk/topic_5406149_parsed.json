It will be a conflict of interest, as exchanges will only approve/disapprove certain network upgrades and/or improvements if it benefits them. For what I know, money talks so you can expect such big players to \"own\" Ethereum at its fullest. We cannot say the same with the current version of Ethereum (which can be mined by anyone with a GPU). Vitalik Buterin has a strong presence in the project, so anything he says will be seen with good eyes by the community. It's unfortunate, since this will lead Ethereum towards full centralization.At least, we'll have Ethereum Classic to preserve Bitcoin's original purpose (decentralization/censorship-resistance). Who knows if miners from ETH flock to ETC once the PoS merge is completed? Just my thoughts",

If we look back at the Steem hostile takeover examples whereas big exchange is using users' funds to cast a vote, it indicates that there is no reason exchanges can't do that again in another means for ETH PoS. So that kind of scenario is prone to happen again until some exchanges stated clearly what they should or can do with user funds on their exchanges.",

To be honest those big exchanges don't really want to control the ETH, they just want to destroy it because every exchange have their own coins and tokens also encouraging new projects coming up there because of low transaction fee but with ETH becoming PoS there will be a competitor for them and also big whales in charge so this os not going to be that easy to control meanwhile the users just enjoy the decentralized ETH blockchain while the others are completely centralized.",

I don't regularly follow developments regarding Ethereum moving to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), but do you think Ethereum will become centralized after the consensus change on the network? Besides, if it becomes centralized, will the big exchanges like FTX and Binance be able to control the market? I think, even if it were to become centralized, it would be difficult for big exchanges like Binance and FTX to control it, this is because Ethereum circulation is quite evenly distributed across various exchanges.",

      "body": "Reading some information on POS from https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/.  Here is their explanation about the security of PoS against 51% attack.QuoteThe threat of a 51% attack still exists on proof-of-stake as it does on proof-of-work, but it's even riskier for the attackers. A attacker would need 51% of the staked ETH (about $15,000,000,000 USD). They could then use their own attestations to ensure their preferred fork was the one with the most accumulated attestations. The 'weight' of accumulated attestations is what consensus clients use to determine the correct chain, so this attacker would be able to make their fork the canonical one. However, a strength of proof-of-stake over proof-of-work is that the community has flexibility in mounting a counter-attack. For example, the honest validators could decide to keep building on the minority chain and ignore the attacker's fork while encouraging apps, exchanges, and pools to do the same. They could also decide to forcibly remove the attacker from the network and destroy their staked ether. These are strong economic defenses against a 51% attack.51% attacks are just one flavor of malicious activity. Bad actors could attempt long-range attacks (although the finality gadget neutralizes this attack vector), short range 'reorgs' (although proposer boosting and attestation deadlines mitigate this), bouncing and balancing attacks (also mitigated by proposer boosting, and these attacks have anyway only been demonstrated under idealized network conditions) or avalanche attacks (neutralized by the fork choice algorithms rule of only considering the latest message).Overall, proof-of-stake, as it is implemented on Ethereum, has been demonstrated to be more economically secure than proof-of-work.Take note of the bolded part.  That would be a strong warning to any exchanges wanting to take control of the ETH network.  So I guess exchanges will not try to control ETH when it becomes POS.  Damn, now I realized how centralized PoS ETH will be.",
