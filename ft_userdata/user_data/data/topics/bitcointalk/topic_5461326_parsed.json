They charge expensive withdrawal fee even transaction fee on network is cheap.With altcoin blockchains, they are less secured, more easily to be compromised so you will have to move (withdraw) your fund gradually. Avoid to withdraw all fund in one transaction to minimize risk and value of loss when something is wrong from you or from the altcoin blockchain.Reminder: Do not keep your money in online accounts",

Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on July 28, 2023, 03:11:10 PMIs there a best/cheapest way of withdrawing profits to bank? As OmegaStarScream wrote, some P2P could be a nice solution. You can take a look on Bisq, Peachbitcoin, Agoradesk, or find someone who wants to buy some BTC with cash for example. But in all cases, these solutions also contain fees.Some CEXs offer withdrawals with limited fees, so you need to do your own market research when it comes to exchanging your funds for FIAT. Depending on the fiat currency you wish to obtain, the fees are not the same.Like the others, I'd like to add that you should never store your funds with a CEX. If you don't want to buy a hardware wallet, Electrum is an excellent free & open source wallet for BTC. You need to own your private keys, that's all that really matters.",

Is there a best/cheapest way of withdrawing profits to bank? There are 2 things that you will have to do if you want to cashout at the right time while holding your funds safely.1. Hold your funds in a self-custodial wallet. Hardware wallet would be the best choice.2. When you want to cash out, you can transfer the funds to a reputed exchange which supports your fiat currency or go for a P2P trade. In both case, be extra cautious of whom you are dealing with.It's a long term journey and keep exploring more ways to cashout but always review with people by posting on this forum if you are not sure of how to proceed.",

Most of the exchange waive their transaction for P2P trading transactions or just find someone here in the forum that willing to purchase your tokens in exchange for fiat.

While someone else (in this case the exchange) is in the possession of your private keys, you are not the owner of the money. As a consequence, you are also not the owner of any profits. My advice is to move the funds from any centralized exchange as fast as you can no matter how you do it. As long as you keep funds in someone else's pocket, that person (or company) may always cut your access to the pocket.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on July 28, 2023, 03:11:10 PMI don't plan on withdrawing any profits for a long time at least until 2024 but just wondering if there is a best/ cheapest way of doing so when the time comes?Perhaps what I wrote above will make you reconsider this.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on July 28, 2023, 03:11:10 PM2024/25 will be my first bull run and up till now all I have been doing is buying have yet to sell anything for cash.How do you know for sure there will be a bull run in 2024-2025? Do you have the power of seeing the future? Have you traveled in time and you already know it will happen? You seem very certain about this.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on July 28, 2023, 03:11:10 PMIs there a best/cheapest way of withdrawing profits to bank?And next thing you say is another ridiculous idea: to associate crypto incomes with banks. Such movement would only expose you even more in front of the government. You already exposed yourself by offering for free to a centralized exchange, one of the most important thing from your life: your personal information. And, since you gave already your personal information to an exchange, that in formation is, obviously, not personal anymore. If it were personal only you would know it. Now third parties know it as well.And you are also trying to jump from the frying pan into the fire. Meaning to become a complete sitting duck in front of the government, abandoning any last idea about anonymity and privacy, and associating your crypto exchanges with a bank. That would be a really bad idea.Perhaps reading this thread will help you understand better how to use Bitcoin: 12 years later and people still don't know to use Bitcoin nor what it's good for. And, if you read that topic, perhaps you can also read Why KYC is extremely dangerous â and useless.Be careful about what you'll do, OP... Your funds and privacy are at high risks right now...",

Usually, you can convert to some other coin that has a lesser fee, such as Stellar, Litecoin, or even stablecoins, and withdraw through them; however, I'm understanding that you most likely mean how to withdraw after converting your coins to fiat, in which case, your options are pretty limited to bank withdrawals, something that I wouldn't recommend doing because, depending on the amount, you may be susceptible to taxation.In general, if you're holding, it's advisable to move your funds to a hardware wallet, or at least a desktop wallet like Electrum, and avoid centralized platforms.

Is there a best/cheapest way of withdrawing profits to bank? I sincerely hope you didn't put your funds on a cryptocurrency exchange, as that is the worst location to do so, especially for an extended period of time. Have you not heard that certain exchanges have been hacked, while others have defrauded their consumers and fled with all their money? We never know the exchange that will be targeted next, so we shouldn't put our reliance in exchanges. Although we don't pray for such to happen but we should always exercise caution when using exchanges. It is safer to keep your bitcoins in a wallet where you have control over the private key, preferably an offline wallet since you will hold onto it for a long period to fend against hacker attempts. When you need to withdraw, you can deposit the desired amount into a trustworthy exchange, use their p2p, and then use your bank account to receive the money in exchange for your bitcoin. You must exercise caution when conducting transactions in these exchanges because scams can still happen there.",

Is there a best/cheapest way of withdrawing profits to bank? Hmm, As far I understood from your post, You actually want to withdraw your funds after booking profits from the centralized exchange by the cheapest way buddy you can do it, Bank transfers never cost transaction fees from crypto to Bank as far as I Know at least in Binance P2P there are no fees. But if you want to use other ways so there are different options rather than a bank transfer. As you can use the TRX for the minimum transaction fees, If your funds are on the Binance than Bep2 BNB or even BUSD will be a good option. If you want to export your funds I mean withdraw your funds to a private wallet you can use the BTC Bech-32 for that purpose. It may cost you a few more cents but recommended.",

Already several users gave you some extraordinary advices and thay all are really helpful. Anyway you didn't mention about which exchange you are using now. If you share this information it will be very easy to give some proper advise. Anyway I mostly try to use Binance and there have P2P exchange feature which is much beneficial and I don't have to pay any fees for P2P exchange. If you use another exchange which have no P2P feature then you can transfer your assets to Binance using a coin or token which cost you lower fees. Then again convert it to stable coins and sell it though P2P. I hope that will be the best idea for you. And never hold your coins in a Custodial wallet if you can't afford to lose it. Because there is a common sentence \" Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins\". Always try to have full control on your assets to assure best security. Anyway if you have gotten your answer or suggestions then you should lock this topic to avoid unnecessary replies or spamming.",

There are methods for reducing fees, like exchanging Bitcoin for cash in-person, but they come with a lot of risks - a risk of getting robbed, a risk of receiving counterfeit currency. Then you'll have to explain to your bank were did you get all that cash when you'll decide to deposit it to your account. Centralized exchanges make things more smooth - you'll get your money directly to your bank account without those risks, but you'll have to pay 1-2% fee. There's also p2p online trading, which will have risks similar to cash - risk of getting scammed and risk of drawing attention from your bank over large private transactions.

I mean it depends on the exchange platform that you use, you can't change the set fee on that platform because that's the set amount of the platform already, When I'm doing exchange I think the easiest way and cheapest way to cash out or exchange your cryptocurrency to fiat is through the P2P section, there are a lot of banks that are available just pick the bank with the highest exchange rate. And that's you could do it as well if you're going to cash in fiat into the exchange it was pretty convenient and easy since it's directly on the bank.I have some experience just be careful if you're going to cash it out at once because it's going to be a huge amount sometimes the banks where you're going to cashout or put your money are going to be suspicious of that and they are going to freeze your money. So be careful with that. Your doing great investing and holding until the Bullrun just be careful as well holding all of your investment in a centralized exchange.",
