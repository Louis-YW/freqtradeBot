We call it hayrat (Normally its called fountains \"çeşme\" but we call it as a hayrat if the financer wants to make good deed) . It's coming from word \"hayır\" its mean like good deed or charity. And our religion Islam is encourage us to make good deed for our other life. All of our good and bad deeds will put us to hell or heaven. Under 3 circumstancies our good deeds still be counts even if we die. One of them is \" Be part of charitable foundations, such as fountains, mosques, schools, hospitals, etc., and leaving behind permanent structures\". And all of your regards should be to Mehmet and Hacer Reşat. They wanted to leave a good deed behind them and their wishes found you and your neighbourhood. Probably they wouldn't find your message but your prays find them. Whenever you drink water just pray for them",

Some people like to do a good deed, just for the sake of doing good or making people happy, without any ulterior motive. Anyways, thanks for bringing this to attention @NicNacCoin, glad to see a Turkish public good project in Bangladesh.",
