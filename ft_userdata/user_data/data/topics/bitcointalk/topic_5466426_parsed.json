      "body": "It is the same question as asking why is their no value as less than a cent (a unit of dollar currency). My answer will be because it will be useless to have such denominations. Yes you can write anything on the ledger but it must be significant so having anything less than a satoshi is pure waste, how much will be worth of it. Satoshi as a unit was just to make investing into bitcoin easier for less rich people, instead of waiting to get a bitcoin you can purchase the units as many as you can. 0.0000000000001 BTC will be like a Milisatoshi and approximately hundred billionth of bitcoin which is definitely not reasonable considering that is worth nothing when you compare it to the price of one bitcoin",

Satoshi are not defined as 0.00000001 BTC, but rather 1 Bitcoin is defined as 100,000,000 sats. Here is the code in question:Code: (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f7b9eb8711fdb32e8bdb59d2a7462a46c7a8086/src/consensus/amount.h#L15)static constexpr CAmount COIN = 100000000;The same is true for transactions. If you decode a transaction, all amounts are specified in satoshi, and not in bitcoin.Since satoshi is the base unit in the code, then you cannot settle anything less than one satoshi on the base layer. If you want to use smaller units, such as millisats, then you'll need to move to Lightning.",

      "body": "Because everything in the smart contract is termed as a satoshi. Your question is good and has a straightforward answer to it but if are asking why it is kept only limited to satoshi and why we can not go beyond. For example, a simple 1 sat is equal to 0.00000001 BTC. Mean there are seven zeros and then 1 comes. means there are 8 digits after decimal. That's the lowest BTC blockchain could process. If we make transactions smaller than that, then they might become dust TX.Now, we can use LN to make transactions at the micro level. For example, in your post, you asked why we can not make a transaction of \"0.0000000000001 BTC\". This contains 12 zeros and then 1. This means there are 13 digits after the decimal and that makes this transaction a millisatoshi transaction and Lighting Network can process it easily. This means we can make transactions lower than the normal rate (meaning we can make micro transactions) just with the help of the Lightning network. A lighting network can make these TX because it processes them off-chain so if the transaction is smaller than your specified one then still LN can process it and make it complete.",

Taking your example of \"0.0000000000001 BTC\" and defining a Bitcoin as 10,000,000,000,000 a transaction of 1,000,000 BTC would be too large a number too handle and break the network (or more realistically probably just yield an invalid transaction). So while there would be room for more digits, there are fundamental limitations based on how a computer operates.",

The term \"millisatoshi\" doesn't just mean \"anything less than a satoshi\". It follows the standard International System of Units definition. One satoshi is one thousand millisatoshis. This means a millisatoshi is 0.00000000001 BTC. That's 11 digits after the decimal point, 3 more than the usual 8. Even the Lightning network won't process 13 digits after the decimal.Quote from: Faisal2202 on September 11, 2023, 03:42:10 PMA lighting network can make these TX because it processes them off-chain so if the transaction is smaller than your specified one then still LN can process it and make it complete.Whenever you close a Lightning channel, your balance will be rounded down to the nearest whole satoshi to allow the transaction to be broadcast to the main layer.",
