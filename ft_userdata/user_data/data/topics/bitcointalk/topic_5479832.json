But why would the type of person who only uses regulated currency see any difference between regulated BTC and regulated fiat?

I would appreciate any perspectives.Irrespective of what anybody says, I will always advocate for the sane world, too much freedom is a curse in society, so we should be careful of what we wish for and to do as no one will know the next victim of such freedom. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are good on their own and it would have been perfect if they could be left alone as it is now. But the heart of an average human being is wickedly wicked, that is why I will never agree to that, more regulation is needed, it will not solve the issue 100%, but will lessen the negative effect. I love the way the crypto transactions are private and somewhat anonymous and has helped us solve the cross-border payment issues where the top world countries alone had the most privilege. Nonetheless, a lot of people are using it for bad purposes too, that is my own concern here.We can't leave it alone to freedom or let what we use it for judge our conscience, some people do not have a conscience, hence regulation is advised. However, I expect more regulations over time, a light one might be added in 2024 though, but in the next 5-10 years, cryptocurrency will have been effectively regulated whether we like it or not.",

Bitcoin will loose it's core value if regulated. but you didn't understand one thing that regulating crypto exchanges or companies is not same as regulating Bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot be 100% regulated. so everyone who trying to regulate Bitcoin will end up with nothing at the end of the day.I also think that pro-regulation crowd who think regulation is important and beneficial have a point. because everyday Crypto industry is getting filled with new type of scammers, with new ideas to steal peoples money. regulation can be really helpful to eliminate some of those scammers.",

I would appreciate any perspectives.When people talk about regulation they aren't talking about making Bitcoin not work anymore. They're talking about stuff like making sure crypto exchanges are safe, trying to stop scammers, stopping fraud in the industry, making rules to allow traditional finance firms and whatnot to hold bitcoin. That sort of stuff. Regulation has nothing to do with stopping Bitcoin from functioning the way it functions.I mean occasionally there is the horror story of some sort of politicians or regulators want to change how it works (which obviously is impossible because politicians/govts have no say in how bitcoin works) or make some function of it illegal, but those people simply don't know what they are talking about. In general when people talk about the industry needing regulations they mean the helpful stuff mentioned above, stuff that has nothing to do with how blockchain/bitcoin functions, but has to do with making rules for the ecosystem to make things safer.",

Some argue that putting rules in place would make crypto more legit, protect investors and keep the market from going nuts. They say it could bring in big institutional players and help crypto go mainstream. Others worry that too many rules might kill off the cool stuff about crypto because of the whole freedom and decentralized vibe. Im still into the news.",

But the government would definitely want complete surveillance. Without regulation surveillance would not be possible and if we want to use cryptocurrency as a method of payment, that won't be possible either. So regulation or no regulation, both have their own downsides and positive sides. But as a common people we do not control anything here. Unfortunately that is true!",
