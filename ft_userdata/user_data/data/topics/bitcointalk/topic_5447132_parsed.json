Take note that it's not that miners will stop their work once all bitcoins are mined. Currently, miners get the newly generated coins and the transaction fees. At that time, miners will still get the transaction fees. Quote from: Diiriye on April 01, 2023, 08:48:46 AMWhy it is not possible to mine the remaining BITCOINS before 2140 when the 19 millions mined in just over 10 years?That's how bitcoin is designed. The initial block reward was 50 BTC and it's halved every 210,000 blocks.It may worth mentioning that the total supply of bitcoin will be exactly 20,999,999.9769 BTC.",

Why it is not possible to mine the remaining BITCOINS before 2140 when the 19 millions mined in just over 10 years?Bitcoin block reward is MEANT to halve every ~4 years. That's part of how bitcoin software was written, and it's also something that makes the coins price rise (not the only thing, still..).You can easily make your own fork of Bitcoin, make the block reward logic change (maybe the difficulty logic too) and mine those remaining coins even in a day if you want to. But that will no longer be bitcoin and will most probably have no value.",

Also, there have been thousands of bitcoins that have been provably burned (i.e., block rewards which didn't include the subsidy or, less than subsidy, or mistakes in Script language), and right as well as probably thousands of bitcoins that have been lost non-provably. Quote from: Diiriye on April 01, 2023, 08:48:46 AMWhy it is not possible to mine the remaining BITCOINS before 2140 when the 19 millions mined in just over 10 years?Because of the difficulty adjustment. Read about it here. TL;DR: the more the mining, the more difficult it is to mine a block, and oppositely, the less the mining, the more easier it is to mine a block. This ensures that every block will be mined in about every 10 minutes, regardless of the hashrate. Now add halving to the equation, and you get ~2 million coins until 2140.",

If some reports about mining companies are to be trusted, we can conclude that their recent mining profit is still negative, but they keep their business afloat by selling coins mined a few years/months before. I can't say for sure if this is a spin from the media or just business trying to deter competitors from competing on their business though.At the end of the day, the market will find the equilibrium and some miners will definitely stop mining due to mining costs, the question is whether the security of the network is good enough to sustain the network when that does happen.

Why it is not possible to mine the remaining BITCOINS before 2140 when the 19 millions mined in just over 10 years?The Bitcoin protocol calls for the number of BTC created every 10 minutes to halve every 210,000 blocks, in a process known as \"halving\".  This means that while initially 50 BTC were created every 10 minutes, today only 6.25 BTC are created every 10 minutes. Since the \"halving\" process is predefined and cannot be accelerated, the number of BTC created will gradually decrease over time until it reaches the 21 million mark.  Even if all the miners in the world focused on mining the remaining BTC, the process of reducing the number of BTC created every 10 minutes would remain unchanged.",

Why it is not possible to mine the remaining BITCOINS before 2140 when the 19 millions mined in just over 10 years?I don't think that you need to wait till 2140, most likely in the next 3-4 block halvings, \"almost all\" bitcoin are going to be mined or at least 99% of it. And that 1% could take centuries to be mined.So in this case, it might be difficult to get bitcoin decades from now. Supply are dwindling, but that 21 million might not be reach technically.",

First, let's talk about your writing and grammar. Your English is not bad but you should improve it, especially grammar that temporarily damages what you want to express. I can guess what you want to discuss but improvement should be made.  Grammarly.com. I advise you to use this one together with Grammar bookSecond, you misunderstand about how Bitcoin blockchain works, how difficulty is set up to retarget. Hashrate on the network can rise or fall but difficulty retarget algorithm is always in place to do its task every 2016 blocks (which is about 14 days).Bitcoin network's Total hash rate (TH/s). Choose all to see how it has risen with time. Then see how Network difficulty adjusted in history with some deep falls.If you want to discover some reasons behind this (like flood season in China mainland, mining crackdown), explorer in my topicThe history of Bitcoin difficulty adjustment (in percent)A cool tool for Difficulty estimator is helpful for you to recognize that Bitcoin network can operate fine with either increasing or decreasing total hash rate.",

There is no need for miners to retire due to the halving.  While reducing the block reward may make Bitcoin mining less profitable, there are still many incentives to continue mining Bitcoin, such as transaction fees and the prospect of a long-term increase in the price of Bitcoin. Furthermore, Bitcoin miners are often large companies or groups of miners who have invested substantial sums in mining equipment and infrastructure.  These individuals may have a long-term view and consider the halving as an expected event in their business strategy.",

This means that it will take longer and longer to mine the remaining 2 million bitcoins as the network grows and more miners participate. Additionally, there is a finite limit on the number of bitcoins that can be mined due to the way the Bitcoin protocol is designed, which is why mining will stop once the 21 million mark is reached.
