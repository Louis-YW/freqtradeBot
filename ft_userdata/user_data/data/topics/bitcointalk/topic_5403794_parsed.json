      "body": "I'm not aware of any crypto platforms, not any good ones anyway. I think the best way would be to just create a site for your service/product and then add BTCPayServer to raise the funds. And for exposure, you can simply advertise the site online. But as mentioned above, it's not going to be that easy and unless you have a working product/service or a prototype, you probably won't find much support.",

      "body": "Are you wondering to raise funds for your project? The traditional crowdfunding system is almost dead. Nowadays it's hard to find crowdfunding sites. It depends on the nature of the projects. Crypto Projects have been using Launchpad to raise funds Nowadays that is called IDO. You may use Google to find a good Launchpad to raise funds for your project, and of course, you need a token for that. Raising funds in your own website is quite impossible lately.",

I imagine most people interested on chipping in would at least visit your website.",
