  "content": "Elon Musk once tweeted about his initiative to end hunger globally and publicly demanded an open-source method of executing this initiative from the United Nations Food Programs UNFP, you’d recall that the response he got from the secretary wasn’t quite satisfactory, simply put; no clear open-source method is available on the World largest charity platform. But Vegan Rob’s brand snacks team has taken a bold step forward to shoulder this kind of initiative through the power of the blockchain’s Web3 technology.About Vegan Rob’s SnacksVegan Rob’s wide variety of healthy snacks is a snacks brand that sells in over 10,000 stores around the US including Walmart and sprouts! The founder Rob Erhlich is known to have created hundreds of successful snacks in his long career starting from the 80s including the snack sensation Pirate Booty! What is Vegan Rob’s Token (VRT)?The Vegan Rob’s Token VRT is an ERC20 token that powers the Vegan Rob’s ecosystem, which has tokenized the brand with an initiative to end food shortages in the poor communities in the US and the world by giveaway healthy snacks to households that are victims of food shortage. VRT is going to have several use cases, including:-Discounts on Vegan Rob’s Snacks-Access to exclusive snacks and merch not sold in stores, and NFTs!-A portion of all VRT exchange fees will be donated to charities focused on combating world hunger!-VRT will be used to purchase Vegan Rob’s NFTs which can be stakedVegan Rob’s DAO-Holders of the Vegan Rob's NFT will automatically be air-dropped a token for the DAO.
