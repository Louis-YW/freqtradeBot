  "content": "Hi guys...So earlier today, I was having a slight argument with a friend of mine who said there are some games that naturally carry ill luck - ill luck means, the player can never win anything significant from such games no matter how long and how much they wager.I tried to make him understand that some games are luck based and such games requires luck to win good money, if the player is not lucky, he or she can never win any good amount of money, but he still insisted, he said he has experienced it with some games but can't remember their names.At the end of the day, I had to agree with him in order to end the argument.I want to get your input on this matter guys, I have just two questions, and they are - -1. Do you believe there are some games that carry ill luck with them, that no matter how long and how much the player wager, he or she never win significant amount of money?2. Which game have you won the most amount of money from?, and how much in total did you win from that game?Maybe you can also mention the game provider(Pragmatic, Evolution   etc.) so we can search for the game on our respective casinos and try it out.",

      "body": "experience doesn't bring luck. maybe it can help in some situations to avoid some bad picks but generally speaking casino games are not based on skill (I am talking about virtual casinos/excluding blackjack played in person or texas holdem etc...).1 No. It's all based on House edge and statistics. Some sessions are more lucky, some sessions are a disaster. Maybe you can have a better experience in some game, meanwhile another player get an heavy loss in the same game.2 I will never count \"casino\" games because it's math you can't \"earn\" from it. Personally I have been lucky in some games but probably if I will continue to play I will just realize a loss.",

But I believe the longer time you spend on gambling, the higher your chances of losing your money. Games that were not pure luck which I usually won, poker games, and sports betting usually gave me a good profit because I know how to research and study upon placing bets in sports betting. If you are not lucky enough to fight house edge, find another one but don't tell me you will never win fighting house edge.",

Some games may provide you with better chances to win than others, but no matter which slot game you choose to play, you are still able to win the jackpot - if you play long enough. In the end, it's up to you to determine if any of these games will bring you luck.",

Do you believe there are some games that carry ill luck with them, that no matter how long and how much the player wager, he or she never win significant amount of money?Yes, there are luck-based games like that you can only win a small amount of money but when you're pouring in a lot of money that's when you lose I notice it in one game in the crash game, and on dice but I will not put the blame in the casino its just bad luck on my side and I am aware of thatQuote2. Which game have you won the most amount of money from?, and how much in total did you win from that game?My favorite is Coin flip this is not a popular game but in one casino I am good at predicting which side of the coin will give me a win I don't want to mention the amount but still win on this game and looking to break my highest earnings here.",

      "body": "This is very hard to believe because I have never experienced this but somehow making me to feel it's true. About 2012, a friend of mine also talks about pools and how he never win anytime he played and most likely saying that his destiny is never to succeed through gambling or something similar. The funniest part of it is that, he would say the week he will get angry of not placing a bet is the week they will win in parallels draws ( specifically dealing with draws in pool).So, your friend is right. Gambling requires luck because I have seen many businesses today not succeeding not because there was no funds to run it or something but is because your are not destined to run such business probably that person is clueless and lack of ideas to run it for long. These are the forms of people who got into business because they think is lucrative for them to venture into it.Gambling is not for everyone and not all games that favors everyone as well.",

Luck isnt something that could be influenced by those factors.Its totally random and you should have avoid this kind of belief on mind.It would really be just creating that desperation inside just because you do believe on a wrong thing.2. Slot game.. Pragmatic but only about 20x of the bet size as far as i remember. Most of big wins do come into strategic based type of gambling and not the casino types.",

Games that are completely new for me, i usually can't win. My confidence level will be at zero such type of games for this reason i dare to gamble on that area. On the other hand, I lose a lot in gambling but still i love gambling. I try to gamble with my own finances. In one game i got $950 and that was my biggest winning money. There are also small winnings belongs to me. Anyway I always like to gamble with small amounts. So that I can continue it for a long time.",

Tell your friend, assuming the conversation with your friend is real, to learn a bit of statistics applied to casino games. Then he won't say such nonsense. 1. No. Such a generalisation is a misunderstanding. What are we talking about? What is clear is that in casino games, by HE, the more we bet, the closer our actual results will be to the expected mathematical outcome. But that does not mean that in the short term we cannot win.2. When I saw the title of the thread, I thought that it was a question that gives the opportunity to lie but this does not seem to have been the case so far. No wonder hardly anyone has answered you, because I guess most of them are not big whales. In my case the most I have won in a day has been in the order of a few hundred euros, but I bet little and in small amounts.",

There are only probabilities, the dice, roulette or the team you selected in a sport bet does not care about what you did, so there is not such a thing as ill luck, and while unlikely you can earn money in even of some of the most difficult games like the lottery, in which your chances of wining a huge prize are one against several millions and yet someone wins the lottery from time to time.2. Probably poker, I have not played in a long time but when I did so I was not as bad as my competition and I could earn some money, I do not remember how much it was but it was a good amount.",

Well, third party Slot developers will give casinos several options for a RTP (Return to Player) for each of their Slots. The casinos cannot change that RTP as they want to ...say from a house edge of 3% to a house edge of say 80%..... because that is done on the 3rd party Slot providers side. So in theory.... all games should return a huge percentage of their bet income, back to the players over time. Some 3rd party Slot providers give casinos several different options for the RTP (Some Hacksaw Games have say three different RTPs that the casino can choose from)   It is luck...but also the RTP and Variance and the Client&Server seed that determine the winnings.... not the kind of game you play that never pays.",

My experience Hi-Lo is the kind of game that's almost hard to make long term profits even though the house edge matters but I've never won anything big not because of the low stakes but often because of impatience, maybe your friends experience this because always chasing victory so that in the end they lose everything and think that it's because of bad luck even though the way players play can also affect2. Not a casino game but sports betting in my opinion is much more profitable especially if we are knowledgeable enough about that sport or when we can get valuable but rare bets",

A lot of Megaways games are high volatility3) Once I see there are recent big wins, I would skip that game as the RTP would have been on the disadvantage to me4) Following twitch live streamer timing. Some vendor adjust the RTP for twitch streamers to win more.
