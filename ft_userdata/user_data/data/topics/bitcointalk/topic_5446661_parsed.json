I get it, we all want a better work environment with a better pay and all that and if you aren’t getting that at your place of employment, it’s within your rights to quit.Actions speak a lot louder than words and the manner and behavior in which you choose to exhibit when quitting would tell others quite a bit about you. Then you’ve got to go ahead and put it on the internet for everyone, probably including your next employer to see. You may very intend on passing along a message with your quitting video about standing up for a right to better working conditions with pay but your message could also be interpreted differently by other people who would then start to generate a not so good opinion of you. This hashtag might probably be highjacked by trolls seeking views and attention and ruin the purpose(if any) for its existence. Sadly, I think people might follow this trend to quit their jobs and post it online simply cause others are also doing it the same way people have been blindly following others.",

I'd rather not at this time. It's not because I'm trying to hide something, but rather because I value my privacy. Nonetheless, everybody to his or her own, right? I see no problem with it if someone wants to document their final moments of employment online.

Going by the link you posted below your post, the trend is predominant for youths in the UK and US, who quit their jobs and then make a video of it to give reasons as to why, citing mostly \"bad working conditions\".Having said that, what to make of it? I really don't know if it is some sort of online protest for better pay, better working condition and stuffs like that, but as it's being done on the internet, mostly on tiktok, i doubt the government or private employers would want to do better because of this. So many employers are basically going to call it a ploy by some people to gain popularity on social media, and we can't even attest to the veracity of some of the claims.Protests for a better working condition and salary didn't start today, it is long standing, especially in underdeveloped countries, and in mine for example, people hardly quit their jobs because there is zero alternative and a high level of unemployment, thus there are quite a lot of people, even as qualified as you are who are waiting to take your position for the same pay or even lesser without complaining, thus the cycle of underemployment continues.",

Information Communication Technologies have opened doors of opportunities that most people don't need to work in a formal organization for them to earn a living. There are so many online jobs that these youths can engage in and still earn the same or even more than what they were earning. Unlike our parents, we can easily resign from our jobs because we have many employment options. COVID-19 made these online work platforms more popular that majority of people in my country working remotely and it gives them privilege of controlling their work life.I will not be a part of such show. There is no reason to share the moment you are reigning to the entire world. It could have some negative consequences on you and your former employer. Resigning is a confidential or formal matter, that is why it shouldn't be showed in an informal platform. People might see you as an unserious worker for treating a formal matter in a informally and for not been able to keep your job. It could also affect the employer because people might feel that they don't treat their employees well that why you are leaving.",

It's a bit of a strange phenomenon but maybe it shouldn't be. Most people throughout history have dreamed about being able to leave their job behind and live in relaxation their whole life, however few have the financial buffer available to do it. I can only imagine that a few of these \"tiktokers\" are successful enough to do it legitimately, where they publish enough content and have built up a big enough following that they might be able to provide themselves a sizable safety net. However for every one of those there may be dozens who are spurred on as copycats, who don't understand that life can be a struggle to pay costs and will probably fail in the long run because jobs can often supply a very basic level of stability.",

      "body": "The reason for young people quitting their jobs is better explain here in the article of Mark Elgan a computing Columnist, in his computerworld December 6th, 2021.Take your time and read through it and enjoy the answers. Technology is to blame for the ‘Great Resignation’Workers are quitting in droves. That’s the bad news. The good news is that technology can fix what technology broke.Have you heard about the September exodus? More than four million Americans quit their jobs that month, shattering the record for resignations previously set the month before. And some 40% of remaining employees are thinking of quitting, too, according to a Microsoft report.The crisis is even worse in technology. TalentLMS and Workable reported recently that 72% of US-based tech employees are thinking of quitting their job in the next 12 months.It’s not just the US. The Great Resignation is a global phenomenon.Pundits point to many causes for the trend, from government stimulus checks to the rise of remote work to entitled millennials and even pandemic-driven stress.In general, it’s clear that there’s a growing incompatibility between the reality and the expectation of the employee experience.Making matters worse: The more people quit, the harder life gets for those who remain on the job. This is especially true of tech workers. IT departments have been notoriously understaffed, and as the Great Resignation increasingly hits tech workers, all employees suffer more downtime, cyberattacks, and tech implementation slowdowns.This is an emergency. You need to know why people are resigning in such high numbers.The many reasons people quitAfter extensively reviewing the interviews, surveys, and reports, I’ve compiled a list of the major reasons people give for quitting during the Great Resignation. These are:Frustration with laptops, desktops, networks, and systems that don’t work well, a trend exacerbated during the pandemic when many remote employees were literally left to their own devices. There’s also widespread confusion about how to proceed when technology doesn’t work.Lack of control over workspaces and processes. Many employees feel they have much to contribute to how work gets done, but are blocked from having their say.A “toxic mix” of low pay, high workloads, and a broader lack of recognition. This observation comes from the Trades Union Congress about employees in the public sector.Lack of work-life balance. Covid-driven remote work gave millions of employees a taste of commuting less and spending more time with family, and they realize that they might retain that with another employer.General inflexibility about how things work, how work is done, and when.Lack of training opportunities. Tech workers, especially, want more training opportunities — 91% said so in the TalentLMS and Workable survey report.Many are quitting because they’re physically and emotionally exhausted. And the departure of so many makes it that much worse for those who remain.While these reasons aren’t surprising, it’s important to realize what all these have in common.This is all about technology… and cultureWhile businesses of all sizes are scratching their heads and trying to figure this out, the truth is that our technology products and how they’re used, plus our culture around management and employee interaction, is exactly what’s driving people out the door.Technology is frustrating workers, creating friction and inertia, blocking employee progress and empowerment, creating needless work and engendering a feeling of isolation and impotence.The good news is that better technology is a big part of the solution. Here’s what you need to do to start retaining and attracting employees.Transform training. Artificial Intelligence(AI)-based adaptive learning technology can make employee training far more relevant by enabling employee-driven learning based on what the person already knows — ending the frustration with classroom-like or generic training systems. In general, ramp up training and career development. Promote from within whenever possible. Guide employees on their career path, wherever it leads, within the company. Just as products need a roadmap, so does each employee.Enable natural connections between employees. User-friendly collaboration tools foster connection and culture. Focus not just on getting the work done, but on team building and the psychology of each employee being part of a team.Use advanced technology for HR, but over-communicate with a human touch. Automated HR is contributing to the burnout issue. When it comes to changes in employee status, pay, benefits, supervisors and other personnel events that have an emotional impact on the employee, the communication around this should always be human-to-human, not emails or automated notifications.Avoid employee surveillance. Many companies reacted to the rush to remote work with employee surveillance software. Monitoring screen activity, mouse movements, time online and other metrics are the surest way to drive employees away. Nobody wants Big Brother to always be watching — especially in one’s own home. Develop alternative means to measure and gauge employee performance. Be results-driven and don’t rank employees based on how often their mouse moves. This is true of remote workers, office workers, and everyone in the new hybrid workforce.Embrace transparency, authenticity and empathy. Most business culture  change happens because each year a new group of young people enter the workforce and an older group retires. The youngest employees — those who have joined the workforce in the past 10 years — have very different expectations about how their employer behaves. They want to know what’s going on, and to work with human beings who care. If younger employees feel like a cog in a machine, they’re more likely to pack up and go.Embrace agility and flexibility. Technology that drives flexibility in hybrid work, remote work, shifting teams, and flexible hours will go a long way in improving the employee experience and sense of wellbeing.Develop a holistic approach to employee satisfaction. With remote and hybrid workforces, companies need to help employees cope psychologically and emotionally to the realities of disparate and shifting work locations and environments. In the past, it was enough to hold occasional team-building exercises and offsite events. Now, managers, supervisors and leaders should be helping employees not only feel like they’re part of the team, but also helping employees maintain physical and mental health. Part of this process is technological. The feelings of connection, involvement, the sense of mission, and a work-life balance can all be helped — or harmed — by technology choices, as well as work policies and management approaches.Make burnout avoidance top of the list when choosing technology. With each passing month, AI gains ground in tech, for example. But it can have opposite effects, either contributing to burnout or alleviating it. AI that replaces human interaction — for example, overly automated HR — can leave employees feeling frustrated and abandoned. AI that augments human performance can boost employees, making them feel empowered and supported. It’s also true that automating repetitive tasks can free up employees to do the things that only humans can do. Automation should be applied to helping and empowering humans, not replacing them.The reasons for the Great Resignation are many. But it’s time we acknowledge the role technology has played in driving away employees in droves — and the role it can play in bringing people back by creating a flexible, humane, and empowering workplace that will make employees happy, productive and invested in the mission of the company.",

So there's this one time where I worked as an Over-The-Phone Customer Service Representative for a Telecommunications company I wouldn't disclose today. The job was far from being a dead-end, coz it provides great accommodations, hefty incentives despite the cutthroat main salary, and a good way for you to get promoted too which is in the form of merits, though different from the merit system we have in this forum. I came across a co-worker who I instantly befriended after knowing he's playing league of legends everyday after work, and that's where most of our time spent together went basically. In any case, after a very stressful day at work, a bomb dropped on us where our bosses told us they aren't going to consider the promotion application since they're short on phoning staff at the moment, and a cut from our monthly bonus, we decided over a game of league to not report to work the next day, and the next, and the next, until the company just gave up on us and tagged us AWOL without resignation. We basically dipped out after losing so hard in life and losing even harder in league. Still one of the best decisions I ever made in my life. Would I share this on a video-sharing app like Tiktok? No, not really, I couldn't risk having my online presence getting tarnished like that.

There's no point putting a video of me quitting my job online. I didn't make the decision for the would to see, I made the decision because that's what best for me. Most of these young people just want to follow the trend as they usually do, but this time around they're doing it when it comes to a major life decision. As an employer, I would never hire somebody who puts up videos of him quitting their former job online. Those videos sends a message to the public and that message is that \"this work environment is a toxic one\". That can damage the image of the firm or organization to an extent because that's like a red trust on that organization. Nobody wants to work in or do business with a toxic environment, so if this is not actually a toxic environment their reputation has been tainted.",
