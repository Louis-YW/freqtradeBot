  "content": "Well, Russia won't be that reckless or foolish. It can only be possible if Russia is used by evil entity (who will likely fail unless allowed by our CREATOR), Â  or the CREATOR could use Russia HIMSELF only if parts of USA or a targeted nation is filled with full blown hardened \"zombies\". Another possibility is the provocation of Russia with the use of Nuclear weapon against her or closest allies... the provocation will be prevented to eliminate the likelihood of nuclear war. *In regards to Russia-China alliance I saw some posting about on another site, China currently can't win a war against true Christains but Russia could if the Christians have broken GOD's law & become worse than Russia who is considered a Christian Nation. For some reasons, China currently cannot defeat Hungary in Europe but could easily defeat others in thesame region except for those who are Pro-Russian...Same in Americas, Asia, Africa, etc. So, this is not the time to be Afraid of the use of nuclear weapon or something similar. That should be in the tail end of the reign of false messiah.",
