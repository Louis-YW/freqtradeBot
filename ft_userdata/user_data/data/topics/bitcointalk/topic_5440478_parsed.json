This lack of proper sex education makes this young girls get into sex at their early age without knowing the consequences of their action.In Africa,you will see a young girl who is two months pregnant, that don't even know that she is pregnant until she is been told or later when the pregnancy is four months and cannot be hidden. Parents,guardians and government have failed in this aspect of teaching sex education to these young ones.",

      "body": "We live in a society that if you grow older and don't have a child people will complain that you're barren as a woman and if you have a child at a younger age they'll say so many things even condemning the pregnancy. So am going to ask, how old is too early to have a child?  To me life is all about choice, as a mother, you can live a very crazy life and the daughter won't follow your footsteps, same thing as a mother who lived a calm and respectful live but the daughter goes crazy, so who's to blame here?Quote from: Remiscoin5 on February 19, 2023, 09:04:39 PMOne of the reasons why most young girls give birth in an early age is what   1- lack of education 2_poor background3_lack of good parents Sometimes those things mentioned above might not be the cause of early child birth like you say OP. The school a child attends might boost out some negative behavior in her especially by peer groups, things happens in school that changes a child that the parents have no idea of and a child's brain comprehend the negative behavior very fast, so I don't really think lack of education is responsible.The poor background has the good and bad side of it, depending on how the individual manage to respond to the situation at hand, help can come from any angle and some might take advantage of the issue at hand, convince the child and sleep with her.Parents always have 95% of child up bringing while the remaining 5% can come from the society, like if a parent don't have time with his/her child it becomes difficult for the child to Know her left from her right. In this case I believe all parents need to engage their child in sex education and other positive things of life, because is better to get those knowledge from you as a parent than getting it outside, if a child does get all these info outside, then it will be disastrous.",

Most parents step out of the house in the morning when thier children are still in bed and they come back late when they are already sleeping at night. They don't know anything about their children because they don't spend time with them. Sometimes I don't blame these parents because without this hardwork these children might starve to death. The girl child needs all the attention and there must be a healthy and free flow of communication between the female child and the parents. One of the easiest way of guiding your child is to build a cordial and friendly relationship that will make them open up and learn from you instead of getting advice from the social media. The problem we have currently is that most parents are not matured enough to raise sound children, therefore they end up raising half-baked citizens.OP you addressed your post to Nigerians and you posted it in an international section. If your intention is to get the views of just Nigerians you should have posted it in the Nigerian Board.",
