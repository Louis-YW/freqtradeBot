Just edited the post with more details added.This is just the Revolut offer from my App.I give the participant the official revolut referral link (that I copy from the app) and they register as usual on Revolut - I dont ask for any information - everything KYC will be done on Revolut's side.The basically offer me around 40 euros for a refferal who joins under me. I can only do this 5 times during the promotional period, why the spots are limited.I posted this if maybe someone wanted to try out Revolut and I could also make some money, like 15 euros. Its not even about the money for me. I think this post actually is a fair entry for me, as I actually joined in 2014 - just never been active. There is no risk involved whatsoever.Feel free to ask about Revolut in general as well or whatever I could help with.",

This can be likely to you Shilling your product on behalf of your organization here which is not appropriate and you risk getting your account banned or suspended.It would be  nice your organization creates an announcement thread for their products and you be their representative either way you or they deemed it fit to getting their presence here been recognized.",
