The tenant's grandfather recently passed away, and he received a box full of vintage items.My uncle bought the records that were in the box from him. It is not known who signed the album, but it has not been faked, for sure.You can look at the records signatures from the images attached. My uncle does not have a turntable, so he couldn't try to play them. I do have, i can test them for you and even record a video of them playing if you'd like me to do so, but since they are from the early 60s, keep in mind that they won't sound the best:)Let me ask him how much he wants for them:)",

For me, records of a band like the Beatles, from their original release, with possible signatures (which needed to be checked, and i will check it), are worth more than my lunch :-)Anyways, he won't sell it for that kind of price, people locally here are willing to pay higher.",
