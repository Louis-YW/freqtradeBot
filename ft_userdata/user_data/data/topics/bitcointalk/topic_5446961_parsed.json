Simply put don't trust any free pool code that's out there even as a starting point.I concluded after many fruitless tests with most open source pool code and efforts to work with others in the space to get something useful built is a waste of time.The only solution for me was and still is to start coding everything uniquely from the ground up. It's the only way to make sure the code is controlled and written properly and works the way you intended it to.",

Only with a large enough hashrate you can have a steady income and dont have to gamble to find a block every few month. This is also why many new pools fail, because they will simply not be able to find people to mine with them in the beginning. After the pool becomes more popular it also becomes pretty easy to find new miners however.",
