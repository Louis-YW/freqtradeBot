Every month, you deposit amount of PAT that you choose. After 48 deposits, you can withdraw 480,000 times of the minimum deposit. For example, if you deposit 1 PAT every month for 48 months, thereafter, you can withdraw 480,000 PAT; that is 10,000 times of your total deposits.Wait, 10,000 times reward? Is it guaranteed?The reward is guaranteed by the smart contract. However, the reward is in terms of PAT. The price of PAT may change overtime. You may lose significant portion of your money even if you earn 10,000 times more PAT.Is PAT inflationary?Yes, PAT is inflationary. If everyone finishes 48 deposits, there will be 10,000 times more PAT in the market. Fortunately, very few PAT have been deposited, which means there will be no significant inflation when you finish deposits.What if I miss a deposit?Every 30 days, there will be a very short time window (48 hours) for your depositing. Specifically, you need to deposit after 29 days but before 31 days since your last depositing. If you miss a deposit, You will lose all your deposits. You need to reset your account to start over again. This feature is written in the smart contract and has no exception. If you plan to go to Mars and there is no web connection, You'd better not participate in the project. If many people do not finish deposits, the inflation will be further reduced (even negative!). Be careful, the countdown in app is only for reference. No one excepts the smart contract is responsible for your deposits.How are PAT tokens distributed?PAT tokens are generated only through clicking \"FREE PAT\" button in app. The first three clicks will generate 7 quintillion PAT tokens each click. The further clicks will generate 100 PAT tokens each click. PAT generation will be ended given one million clicks OR after March 31, 2024. Basically, you can generate as many PAT tokens as you need. Investing in PAT is not be advised.",

      "body": "Imo that is the way they distribute their custom tokens apart from giving them out for free on the faucet, they can also take all of your deposit due to delays isn't it (1st risk)? I think this is definitely a new kind of game over an investment scheme. They explain the game and how you risk losing.Of course with their own token they can guarantee as much as they can even with 100k returns, for example by adopting a stable (printable) token way. After all, they acknowledge that their token is inflationary (2nd risk).",

The only problem here is that those shitcoins will be of course worthless.",

They promised their user 100,000x of what's deposited on their account, but the only way to deposit PAT is through clicking the free button. Wouldn't that means we didn't invest anything --aside from time for clicking the button-- for the project? How would they make income and --when the first person finally managed their 48th month-- how exactly would the price be determined?

I can't find this info on their very minimalist website, but if I'm correct, then I'll say it's more of a money-grab than a ponzi.All investors need 4 years before they can earn anything, and if the dev has total control of the LP and or at one point within the 4 years period they got listed on a CEX, it is not impossible for the dev to dump the entire supply they controlled and vanished, especially as during that 4 years, the price have a good chance to move upward, as the dev themselves predicted this,Quote from: strangebank on February 19, 2023, 10:37:52 AMYou are correct that PAT has no value now because the contract was created three days ago. You are also correct PAT price may collapse due to huge inflation one day, which does not mean it cannot surge before its dying. Keep in mind, the first withdraw will happen 4 years later (48 deposits needed), so no huge inflation but only deflation (depositing) within the first four years.You call the project \"really strange and unique\". Thank you. This is exactly the value of the project.",

      "body": "We explain the design and answer the questions below. What is “FREE TOKEN” bottom in app?PAT is minted only through “FREE TOKEN” bottom. After the first three clicks, the clicks generate 100 PAT per click. When you click the bottom, you will be charged the Ethereum network transaction fee for around 2 dollars. Therefore, the cost per PAT is around 0.02 dollars by clicking. This mechanism sets an upper bar of PAT price, 0.02 dollars, in smart contract: a welcome offer until March 31, 2024. Will people dump PAT after a while?Maybe. Who can guarantee not dump? However, based on our observation over the ten years in crypto, if a token is not huge inflationary, the price will not be dumped 99.9999%. Even if a token is concentrated in a few hands, they will not ruin their own fortunes. Refer to Coase Theorem for more explanation. If the price is not dumped 99.9999%, you are profitable by depositing in Strange Bank.  Is PAT huge inflationary?First, PAT is not inflationary in the first four years. There are around 21 quintillion PAT (from the first three clicks of “FREE TOKEN” bottom). The following clicks generate 100 million PAT at most, which reflects 4.76 * (10 ** (-9)) percent of the total supply. Second, the inflation rate when you withdraw your 10,000x PAT depends on when you start depositing. If you deposit earlier than others, you will withdraw earlier than others. Third, many people may miss deposits. A person needs to deposit only once per month, which discourages automated depositing by code. Every person has chance to miss a deposit. If miss a deposit, you will lose all your deposits and have to reset your account to start over again. Therefore “RESET” bottom is here. (answer to PX-Z’s question: QuoteTheir app/account is also strange why would they put a reset button just to clear the whole account balance such feature is unnecessary and useless.)QuoteI'm not good at reading contract, but I dont don't think this project has a smart contract that lock everybody's PAT and the LP? I can't find this info on their very minimalist website, but if I'm correct, then I'll say it's more of a money-grab than a ponzi. (holydarkness)When you deposit, PAT will be burned, while the time and amount of your deposit will be documented on blockchain. When you withdraw, PAT will be minted based on your records on blockchain. Is Strange Bank a scam?We doubt whether we are in the same crypto world. There are many scams here. Some project may promise a huge plan but deliver nothing. Some project may copy codes from other projects and have a new name. Are they scams?Strange Bank has a unique design and originality and delivers the product in the first place. We also keep telling the truth.Will Strange Bank be considered as Ponzi?Again, if you do not understand the value, potential, and risk, we advise you not to participate in the project.",

In traditional games, a task cannot last a long time because game servers may be down, or game may be discontinued.
