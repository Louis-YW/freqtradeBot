KPL is best example that even without international players you can have a successful t20 league. Last year Gibbs was there in KPL not sure whether he is joining in this year or not. One more thing KPL must have few players from Azad Jammu and Kashmir also.",

Will the main players will be going to the Netherlands as the Netherlands is a weak team and the Pakistan B team can also show some good performances if the main players are busy in kpl?",

Also, KPL is not being broadcast internationally making viewership a lot less.Each team has played two matches each and below is the point table for anyone who is interested",

There is nothing much we can do about these natural disasters.Anyways, it's Sohaib Malik's team Mirpur who won the KPL season 2.",
