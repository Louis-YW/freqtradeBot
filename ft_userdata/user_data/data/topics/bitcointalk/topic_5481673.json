It's best to convert bitcoin to Monero through one DEX, then swap this monero to Bitcoin again through different DEX but keep in mind that if you circulate 1BTC back and forth, you might be compromising your privacy. It's better to have at least two receiving address with different amount of coins.Quote from: _act_ on January 15, 2024, 05:56:32 PMLet me make this clear for you that no created coin that exists that is better than bitcoin.

Some may think that if you make a new coin with 21m cap it will reach to Bitcoin price, strength and usefulness in a month. Of course, that's not going to happen.

There are even some mixers that advertise that they mix BTC to xmr and xmr back to BTC, you have to find them yourself as the forum has banned its members from linking to mixers. You can also do the swap yourself, but you must go through different steps if you want it to be 'untraceable'. I.E. send BTC to a p2p exchange, convert it to xmr and withdraw to your own wallet, send xmr to a different p2p exchange and convert back to BTC, and withdraw to different BTC addresses and at different times. Take note that you shouldn't send or withdraw all the funds at once, for better privacy break them into smaller chunks and pay attention to the varying times.",
