  "content": "Hello,I am hiring a professional developer to create a Solana vanity address generator, here are some basic details;1) runs on Linux2) compatible with multiple (in parallel) Nvidia GPUS, using CUDA/OpenCLThere is a project on Github to give you an idea of what i'm looking for (However it's only for EVM addresses )https://github.com/1inch/profanity2Solana keygen grind is also acceptable if you're able to tweak it to work with GPU'sDo contact me via PM for much more details on my requirements, only experienced people please!",

Therefore, you cannot send PMs to newbies, either.sent me a details via telegram @e",
