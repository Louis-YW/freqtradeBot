  "content": "What is ErgOne ?>Decentralized Marketing Powered by Community \"\"ErgOne's function is to promote various projects via its app.Proof of Commitment Protocol is designed to encourage users to share content through various social networks with $ErgOne as an incentive Total max supply is capped to 1,000,000 in order to always guarantee a certain value.In the first year, we distributed 5,000 $ErgOne per month among all our users based on their Virality Score.Since December 1, 2023, one year after our launch, the rewards are now 2,500 $ErgOne per month.Here is the official announcement of the previous Halving : https://x.com/Erg0ne/status/1730497250890035665?s=20Every month, number 1 receives an NFT video presenting the 10 users with the highest scores.This NFT engraves forever the user's involvement in the blockchain.Here's an example: https://x.com/Erg0ne/status/1719798428836733089?s=20ErgOne halving will be annual, increasing the value of our tokens as they become scarcer and scarcer and reducing selling pressure at the same timeBeyond this period, ErgOne will be so highly valued that a simple mention as a reward will stimulate the promotion of other future projects.Our treasury ensures automated distribution for the next 20 years.What is PoCoP ?First of all, let’s consider the Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). These consensus play two key roles : • Secure the blockchain • Participate to the emission and distribution of the coins / tokens.Of course, we, the ErgOne team, don’t have the pretension to beat the perfection of Ergo and its Autolykosv2 in terms of security and efficiency. But we have thought of an innovative way to mint and distribute tokens far away from hashrate (energy power) or staking (financial power).We believe that commitment in a project or ideals is a new kind of power mixing time, personal energy and creativity. It was therefore normal for us to try to create a protocol based on this power.We have therefore designed the Proof-of-Commitment Protocol (PoCoP) to issue and distribute the ErgOne tokens in order to reward the most active and committed into the promotion and support of Ergo.Because we are confident that Ergo will establish itself in the blockchain ecosystem, we think the mission of ErgOne is intended to be evolving. That’s why we plan a way, in the long run, to permit the community to vote for one or more other projects to support.As we’ve just said, supporting a project involve time, creativity and energy. And unfortunately, this commitment is based on the passion of just a few mainly because there are no incentives to spend efforts on it.In parallel, we can observe that a lot of passionate content creators commit on the long term on different niche markets. Of course, they are excited by their sharing but they can keep faith also because of advertising revenues and partnerships with companies. We can observe this trend on platforms like Youtube but also in all kinds of social media. And there’s sometimes a gap between what the content creator is preaching and the products he promotes.In view of this observation, we have decided to incentive the commitment of the community in the promotion of a project that will change the entire world : Ergo.The ErgOne token is dedicated to push the community members to highlight Ergo but, in a few years, other projects nominated in a total decentralized way.How does it work ?Our app reward everyone who promotes Ergo on every possible network.( X, YouTube, Reddit, TikTok, Instagram ...)Once a month, it rewards all users simultaneously (Only possible on Ergo, with almost no fees). This is \" Proof Of Commitment Protocol\"  PoCoPwe are the very first crypto project in the world to rewards Content Creators by cryptocurrency  ( $ErgOne token )You need to link your X account to the app and update your Ergo wallet in the dashboard to receives token every monthFor more details on reward distributionplease read our Github ________________________S y n t h e s i sPoCoP was launched in November 2022Being simple enthusiasts we didn't take the time to write this article here before.ErgOne is a social movement, the token is totally community-driven.Its future depends solely on your will and that of the Architects ( You can check out the Github to learn more about Architects and how to become one ).We're aware that everything isn't perfect yet, so please bear in mind that we're developing this in our limited free time.We hope the internet will make good use of PoCoPThanks for readingToken specificationsBlockchain : Ergocoin ticker : ERGONETotal Max Supply : 1.000.000Rewards Distribution : actually 2500 $ErgOne per month (during the next 12 month ) ErgOne Halving will be executed every yearWebsite : https://www.ergone.io/Sources : https://github.com/koukarin/Proof-of-Commitment-Protocol/blob/main/README.mdExplorer : https://ergexplorer.com/token#fcfca7654fb0da57ecf9a3f489bcbeb1d43b56dce7e73b352f7bc6f2561d2a1bApp : https://app.ergone.io/votingSocial : https://twitter.com/Erg0neYouTube : https://www.youtube.com/@Erg0neDiscord : https://discord.gg/ergo-platform-668903786361651200Telegram : https://t.me/Erg0ne",
