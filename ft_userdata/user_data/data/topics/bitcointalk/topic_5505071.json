  "content": "These days, networking has been made easier with social media, where you can easily make a referral, and people on your contact list take it seriously based on the level of trust and reliability that they have for you.If you make a referral and people who follow it are satisfied, their level of confidence and trust in you increases, and they value you more.There is a need to be careful about the referrals you make, because some referrals are capable of ruining your image and the trust that people will have in you.I have seen people question why bitcoin is still the first choice that is referred to new people in cryptocurrency who want to invest, and one reason for that is that bitcoin can be relied on when compared to other cryptocurrencies, especially the new ones, and you don't want to gamble with your referrals.I know we always have to advise people to do their own research for any referral given to them, but still, you do not want to give someone a referral on some altcoin just for them to do their own research and find out that they just dodged a bullet.Do not just refer to any cryptocurrency; refer to bitcoin when introducing a newbie to cryptocurrency.",

When they've bought and then BTC suddenly plummeted, you will take the blame from them. This has surely happened to many of us here and that's why even suggesting or referring people to buy Bitcoin, always put a disclaimer that it is highly volatile and you have no control over the market and its price. Because they might have that first glance and thought that you've just referred them and you earned money from them and then, the price goes down so as their losses. So, if you're going to tell someone to buy Bitcoin personally, make sure that they have understood every basics about it. This is why it is important to know what we are investing to pass that logic to them.",

Of course, i only refer those things i personally experienced so i can give thoughts about it, also compiling negative reviews will give more results if you should go or not using them. This is because i don't want these users be frustrated with me if they don't experience good enough on that service. For something investments, i don'f refer other coins than those major coins like BTC, ETH, BNB, etc. other than will be too risky especially those meme coins where price are based on mere hype .",

This is not just my opinion but also common knowledge that people do not typically do things for free, there is always a catch. That’s why newbies are skeptical when they are being introduced to Bitcoin by certain people. They often ask what’s in it for you if I invest in bitcoin. They assume you are earning a percentage of their investment as is common with most referral programs. You can educate people about bitcoin but never try to coerce them into investing in Bitcoin. Even though bitcoin investment is a good thing, your persistence may come across as suspicious and cause them to be wary of Bitcoin.",

You should only refer someone that you know believes you because if you refer someone that is new to crypto they might think that we are promoting a scam company but they don't exactly what is bitcoin or the crypto you are referring to. That is why I only have a few friends who know about crypto many of them are not interested in crypto they always think a networking is scam.",

Think about it by yourself, and think of positive as well as negative effects you can bring to your followers.By that deep consideration, you will have to think more carefully before you shill any project, in any program such as a referral program. Because it's simple if what you share brings benefit to others but it's not easy if your sharing causes negative effects to your followers. You can not say you're not responsible for your activities.At the end, it's up to each person to decide doing or not doing something but as an influencer, you have your responsibility too and it's undeniable.",

More exposure to more people, more opportunities to get referral income that is most concerning interest of influencers.To attract people and gain referral income, they often say about good things and try to hide bad things that can affect their chance to get referral income successfully. It's not right way to hide possible negative things to newbies and kindful, frank and moral influencers will apply this method. Newbies who want to seek advice from influencers, must do their own research, and know about a big rule \"Don't trust, verify\".",

And I've stumbled on this your post which I feel we can draw some parallel to. In this time when these telegram games are trending and people are looking for how to get money quick in cryptocurrency aside Bitcoin, the players of these games would rather refer their friends to sign up on these games to play and earn from cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin other than Bitcoin. While these is happening is because it is \"easy\" for them to make money on these games than investing in Bitcoin and making money from it. However , in my own estimation referring someone to Bitcoin is easier when that individual has a skill that can be used to generate more Bitcoins should the person asks how can he earn more Bitcoin. So if the person has a skill you can simply tell the person that they can offer their and ask for payments in Bitcoin.",

It's better a newbie show a learning interest in bitcoin then you proceed to giving him privacy and security awareness, than telling them the can make more money by buying bitcoin.Of what use are the coins if you can't protect them ?",

It's true that sometimes we might be thinking we are doing the best for people yet it ends up falling into our hands as victims of blames from wrong decisions taken but at the same time we ought to do them in a careful and serene way, so before one can mention altcoins to people you must make sure they are well acquainted with some level of knowledge because scam is real and they are looking for preys who are new to the space hence referrals showed be done consciously.",
