It is their belief like now they have similar believe with Bitcoin Spot ETFs.They are similar but not completely the same because Bitcoin Spot ETFs are bigger than Elon Musk, Tesla or SpaceX. They are systematically bring more capital to Bitcoin market. If one Bitcoin Spot ETF stops, others will continue to operate. People will switch their capital from a closed ETF to other ETFs and I expect total capital will be the same, not decrease.",

It was not only Tesla but at that time PayPal also announced the feature of buying bitcoin via PayPal. This doesn't mean that Elon Musk and Tesla played the game fairly. Elon Musk was tweeting and using Tesla to make Bitcoin pump and dump , he used his influence to artificially push people to buy Bitcoin and Doge, then when price reached a high level, he sold his coins and told you that Tesla is no longer accepting Bitcoin payments and then price went down. This is what Elon did.",

I mean even if some people thought of that, it will not be more than a handful of not very informed people so i don't see why it should gain attention.Everyone or almost everyone knows bull run comes after btc halving, what usually triggers the price is unknown. At least am yet to see a particular event that was considered as the main reason why the bull run started. There are several events that usually occurs during the bull run so i guess it is hard to attribute it to just one.",

      "body": "I really do not think Tesla initiated the last bull run let alone Elon Musk hype but rather a manipulation to control the market for their own benefit. The Bitcoin market was just fluctuating on hype and fomo based on Elon Musk d Tesla's interference. Although it gave a little price push up but it was not sustainable to hold the price of Bitcoin high for a long run coupled with the fact that China banned Bitcoin and it drastically affected the market for a long time before the bounce back. Institutional acceptance of Bitcoin is not as influential as a government acceptance of Bitcoin because if the government accepts Bitcoin definitely all the institution  under the government would follow suit and that would drastically cause an increase in bitcoin  price compared to when a single institution decides to accept Bitcoin as a means of legal tender. So I think to some extent the bull started with Tesla's acceptance but could not sustain the price for a while coupled with the fact the stopped the acceptance which made the situation worse and it gotten worst when Chinese government banned their citizens from mining Bitcoin.",

They just started to increase the buying pressure of the high bitcoin price before. Elon surely did market manipulation, even without his bitcoin manipulation strategy, he manipulated doge so much. I remembered the days where every elon tweets about doge, the market go crazy and pump the price of doge. It's an obvious manipulation.

Sadly some people followed it and the correction of price then due to either demand or supply made them believe that an entity like Tesla can manipulate bitcoin. Elon used this to cash in on his shitcoin as people followed him there think if he can move bitcoin then he can push doge higher but as usual you know how it is ended QuoteYears from now, Musk will be stuck with his worthless fiat that nobody will wish to accept anymore, and the rest of us will have his Bitcoin, that he so foolishly sold.I see that as a win.Sorry but do you think those behind this Tesla or Elon himself wouldn’t be owning bitcoins at this point of time when bitcoin is proving is worth day in day out as fiat continues ti struggle.

It is just rubbish to praise what manipulated bitcoin price when it is even not what that started the bull run. I think they played a part. After all they bought a lot of bitcoins back in 2020, which pumped the price of bitcoin drastically. Whether you think they caused bitcoin to pump or not you gotta give credit where it is due as they played a role in bitcoin's rally 3 years ago, although of course, we know they only did so because they were trying to manipulate the market into choosing Dogecoin or whatever the fuck Elon's siding himself with during the time. Personally I'm not a fan of him as well, and I hated how he did Twitter dirty all cause he wanted to profit off of it even though the previous formula worked for the site anyway, among the stupidest things he did trying to claim internet points and cementing himself as the cool meme man. But at the end of the day, they bought bitcoins, they considerably increased bitcoin's value when the people's just about to regain their confidence in the crypto market. They marketed cryptocurrency through their social media and allowed crypto payments (which they then redacted anyway but whatever) so they still did something. I agree with you in the fact that they weren't the cause for the bull run as it's rarely the case for crypto to pump in value over a single reason anyway, but they deserve the credit in this one and I think you should hand it to them.",
