  "content": "happy Children's dayI never new how exciting and important children day was until I and my spouse welcomed our child recently and since then I have taken everything that relate to children very important, as children reminds us of the purity of nature. So I started reminiscing on the important things I can teach my children at their early stages that will have a lifelong positive impact on them and among all other things I choose to teach them cryptocurrency BTC, teaching them the basic fundamental knowledge on the value for money and financial discipline, how to own and operate cryptocurrency related activities, How to recognize scam and most importantly the technicalities around Bitcoin/crypticurrencyThis was born out of the motivation I got from my previous thread about the 14 years boy and the sister who are earning multiple stream of income from mining on their gaming computer, with the help of the father you can check it here:Quote from: Wiwo on August 19, 2021, 08:56:23 AMI was amazed by this news of 14 years old and his 9 years sister making a living through ethereum mining which generates them $32k monthly income, this is so incredible and highly commended, the kids use their old gaming computer to start up this amazing business and there are already expanding. I guess our kids are already taking advantage of the gains of blockchain and are already doing amazing stuff through the blockchain.Kid making $30000 monthly income.

      "body": "While teaching them, like a game, this or that (I've thought my son to use hardware wallet, but he doesn't know the implications), I think that pushing financial information too early will not really help (it's too much information, too much background to be told and can easily become boring). The technical info can be even more boring.Yeah, starting a miner and seeing it hashing can also be fun.But no, getting kids take care of a mining farm looks as child labor to me; that can break and needs fixed (i.e. needs technical skills) or can get on fir if not done properly. Heat and noise (in case of Bitcoin miners) can be also not suitable for kids.My opinion is, especially as Children's Day is near, is to let the children be children. Let them enjoy their childhood, even if that means a bit bigger effort for you.There will be time for teaching them these things when they'll get bigger. Now it's their time to play.",

I was I bit too lazy to search if the children's day celebration is a national one or global children's day, the importance of early education in children can not be overemphasized and that includes cryptocurrency education because Bitcoin is the currency of the future.",

Really, crypto can wait — I agree, the focus should first be on exposing children to the various aspects and ways of finance and investment before the introduction to crypto. Crypto knowledge especially in our present time is important, but not the only thing a child should know as regards finances and investing especially since there is a very long life ahead of them within which some other digital advancement may spring up. A child should be equipped and intimated with enough financial knowledge to be able to navigate and adapt to any financial situation they may face regardless of if the existence of crypto remains or not.",

I agree to you that it's still the interest that these kids have but if we're giving them the idea and teaching them these, they'll have the advantage that they'll won't go through the same experience as mine as I'm ignorant during my younger days and was only knocked by the hard reality too late.",
