I was wondering what model of oscilloscope would be easier to use and more practical? Can someone recommend an oscilloscope with experience? Thanks!",

      "body": "You're right. Multimeter is useful and handy for most hashboard repairs. But on the hashboard of the Innosilicon ASIC miner, there are some signals whose voltage cannot be detected by multimeter. If use a multimeter, the detection result will usually show 0. That's why I asked about the oscilloscope.",
