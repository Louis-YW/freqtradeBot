How does it work?You list your debts from smallest to largest and pay the minimum amount on everything except the smallest one.

How does it work?For those who have gotten out of debt more quickly, did you use the debt snowball method or another personal debt payment strategy that worked for you over the years?I must say that the debt snowball method is one of the best strategies to be debt free because it has a very good concept in repaying the debts. The main focus goes on paying the smallest debts and slowly moving towards the one with very high value. When you start following the strategy and successfully paid your smallest debt you will get positive emotions about yourself. You will now focus on paying the rest of the debt one by one over time, and you won't delay the payment of any debt on your shoulders.I'm really impressed by the strategy as it is truly effective. I have used it in past and I must say that it works like a charm. It will somehow force you to pay the debts on time even if you do extra job hours and that the real magic of the method. However, the debt I had wasn't a very huge one, and I'm not sure that if the method would work for the ones with very high debts. I even wonder that how would this thing works for those who have debts of millions on their shoulders and aren't able to pay the debts even in 4 years.",

I just increase monthly payment by 10% -15% every year and that's it. I don't make lumpsum payments or any interest renegotiation unless absolutely needed. I had initially taken this loan for 25 years and now I can see the tenure remaining is less than 17 years. This method really helped me personally.",

Users can seek advice from financial experts to choose the most suitable method for them.A strategy that focuses on paying off small debts first, then gradually increasing payments on larger debts in a \"gradu-to-fast\" approach. Specifically, the focus is on first paying the monthly interest on all debts, then paying off the small debts before moving on to the larger ones. This method works by creating momentum for long-term repayment and relieving some of the debtor's financial burden. This helps the debtor focus on paying off the debt and developing long-term financial plans.",

It is also necessary to separately identify fixed costs - rent, utilities and other similar types of expenses. Then you will clearly know what costs can be reduced. As for ready-made meals - nowadays they sell ready-made frozen foods. All you have to do is heat it up. And it doesn't cost much at all.",

The easier it is for you to take a loan from the bank or from your friends, the bigger the snowball becomes, so no matter how much you pay off your debts, you will find yourself in debt again. Debt is usually yours, meaning it is your last resort.After you leave this habit and accustom yourself to paying it, you will find that the debts that grow or are associated with specific deadlines are the last debts to be repaid, because you will force yourself to work to pay them, and therefore you may stop eating in restaurants, going to clubs and wasting time in order to pay them off, and then be sure to finish them. Unimportant debts first, down to important debts, and so on.This method may not work for everyone, but it works for some, and you have the right to choose the appropriate method for you according to your circumstances, but do not return to take a debt again.",

Some people have the habit of buying the advanced model of their phones, cars, and other accessories. This habit has been built over the years and it has become a tradition to them. So they spend on these items without considering their debt profile. Meanwhile, the old models or editions are stronger and durable than the new ones. I will become indebted if the loan or credit is a necessity but I will never take a loan for pleasure or to satisfy a want. The best strategy to be free from debt is to avoid unnecessary expenses. Cut some major expenses such as house rent by owning your house. Buy quality products that can last for a long time. Learn an additional skill that can increase your income. And don't take a loan to service or pay for another loan.",

We have mortgage debts and student loans which accounts for majority of debts that people own. They are not caused by bad spending habits or addiction to any substances.Being in control of you financial situation and having a budget to kontior your spendings would help a lot to avoid getting into a financial crisis, but the best way is to find extra ways to earn an income and invest in assets gradually to secure funds for the future.",

I have seen situations where strategies to clear debts has been laid out to people in debt but because they lack commitment to clear the debt, they never meet up. Debtors need to be committed to settling a debt above all things if they willeet up with clearing a debt. Some debtors also start commited to clear a debt but loose commitment along the way because of distractions. A debtor who intends to put to work any strategy to clear their debt need to understand the need to plan to remain committed.",

I don't know if this exists already or have a name, but this is what I came up with. I only borrow when it's an extreme scenario where borrowing is the last option. I like to set the deadline 2 times more than my payment date. That way, even if one gets missed, I try to make sure the next pay date will bring the amount for sure. Also, I take the minimum amount that is needed for the job to be done. So less pressure there. What you said in OP about snowball method, it was unknown to me till this day. It's a really good method that you have taught me today. Thanks to you for sharing such informative post. This is how human mind works and this method shows exactly that. Now I have 2 methods in my arsenal to use. This will be very helpful for the upcoming future.",

If I were to advise people (with debts like that) on what what strat is best for them, I'd say it's the abstinence method. Basically, you stop any form of unnecessary expenses, tally up how much you've been spending over those stuff, and be hit with the realization that you spend this much over stuff you don't need. Once that sets in, stop all of those at once, and immediately pay off your debt, with those that are set on due dates being the highest priority so as to not incur interest charges. If that's not gonna cut it for you, I suggest you take up another debt, build up a surefire business (online selling of gadgets and tech services for mobile phones, or essentials like food and baby goods) and use the profits to pay off all your debts. This is a little riskier than what I have listed prior but this will not only stop you from taking debt if the business took off, but will also enlighten you in the world of entrepreneurship and would set yourself for financial freedom later down the line.",

It really works for me.As i do not have debt that has a deadline because most of the debt is taken from near ones (like relatives and friends) and they have a soft return policy so i can return them whenever i have money but i have to be true to them and not tell them to lie to wait for more.
