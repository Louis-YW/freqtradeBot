In case if you know any step by step tutorial/video then please point me in that direction. [I'm searching at my end to know about it]I've 1 computer so is possible to use multisig on it. I already have a Standard wallet and coins are in it.BTW 2FA I  not to prefer to use it because it cost extra fee and also 1 key is stored on their cloud so I refrain.In a nutshell, what I understood from your and other reply, I need to take care of these:1. seed phrase 2. seed or private key [both are same thing right!]3. Also take backup of Electrum wallet via backup optionAm I correct?",

I already have a Standard wallet and coins are in it.There is no point having a multi-sig if all the wallets are on the same device - you don't achieve any additional security. You could set up a multi-sig between your computer and your phone, however.If you want to use an airgapped wallet, then you will need a second device which can be permanently airgapped (i.e. never connected to the internet at any time). If you can't have a second device, then a somewhat less good alternative (but still better than nothing) would be to use your current computer via a live OS while disconnected from the internet.Quote from: Newones on April 27, 2023, 07:18:24 PM1. seed phrase 2. seed or private key [both are same thing right!]3. Also take backup of Electrum wallet via backup optionJust write down the 12 word seed phrase Electrum gives you. That is all you need to completely restore your private keys and access to your coins. There is no need to back up or even look at your individual private keys. Similarly, you do not need to back up the wallet file, and indeed, doing so adds more risk since it is harder to secure a digital file than it is to secure a piece of paper with 12 words written on it. The only reason you would need to back up the file itself would be if you had added labels to a bunch of addresses or transactions and you wanted to back those up.",

How to keep my Electrum wallet and BTC safe? [I created Standard wallet](In other words which constraints I need to focus on to keep my wallet and BTC safe: seed, private key, and public key)Your seed represents your funds.  Anyone who gains access to your seed has the ability to move all your funds.  Keep the seed phrase away from any wandering eyes, and make sure it's stored in a safe and secure place.  I recommend writing seeds down on paper, make a copy, store the copies in a fire and flood resistant, and secure location.  A small, hidden document safe would be very practical.With hierarchical deterministic wallets (those generated by seed phrases) your private keys (and public keys) aren't regularly displayed, so there's little risk of someone else seeing them.  They can be exported one by one, if the need arises, but those are uncommon circumstances.  The private key can be used to move funds from one specific address, and the public key can be used to see if the address is funded.Quote from: Newones on April 27, 2023, 05:09:46 PMFYI: I'm not in the favor of 2FA  reason is not willing to pay 3rd party any money and also they keep 1 key at cloud.I'm not a fan of Electrum's 2FA implementation either.  You can apply the same level security for free by creating your own 2 of 2 multi-sig wallet, or better yet, spend the money on a hardware wallet instead of the 2FA service.Quote from: Newones on April 27, 2023, 05:09:46 PM2. If I remove the Electrum application from computer then will my wallet remain safe for few yrs even if Electrum release updates about applicationor even if Electrum decides to discontinue the wallet.Once you have generated a seed phrase, and have a list of addresses to which you want to send funds, then you don't need Electrum installed.  Regardless of what updates and upgrades happen to the software in the years to come, once you're ready to restore your wallet all you'll need to do is download and install the app, and restore your wallet with the seed phrase.  All the fund you've collected over the years will be there.",

Once your seeds are kept safe, then remove the Electrum application, break your computer, bomb the headquarter of the OS provider, take down the current internet system, do everything to destroy the world. You will still not lose your coins unless you are able to destroy all copies of full nodes 😉Good luck.",

The second change fixes the salt that Electrum uses when turning seed phrases in to private keys. That's all you need to do. Then just go back in to the \\src\\ folder and run index.html, and you'll be able to import Electrum seed phrases and extract the relevant keys.Obviously do all of this an an airgapped computer for safety!",
