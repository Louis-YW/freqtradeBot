  "content": "OP_CAT could be pivotal for Bitcoin's future, pushing it beyond its original role as digital cash. Recent efforts by the Taproot Wizards, led by Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, aim to revive this opcode.The Quantum Cats Ordinals project involves creating 3,333 evolving NFTs featuring cats. This initiative is designed to encourage NFT owners to support the adoption of OP_CAT.The reintroduction of OP_CAT could open up new possibilities, such as establishing a secure link between Bitcoin and a layer 2 with zero knowledge, enabling the development of smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. Additionally, OP_CAT might enable post-quantum signatures and introduce conventions to limit Bitcoin use in specific ways.However, the process of reintroducing OP_CAT is intricate and involves creating a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), coding, inclusion in Bitcoin clients, and persuading miners. Its reintroduction would mark a significant step in Bitcoin's evolution. Whether OP_CAT will overcome these challenges remains to be seen, but it's clear that Bitcoin is growing and diversifying under the guidance of key figures in the industry.",

      "body": "you dont even need to OP_CAT in relation to the junk adorers that want what they pretend is \"nft\"it doesnt need to be a bitcoin activated rule for all nodescurrently modified nodes add junk and have their own subset private policy for understanding the junk within their own community of junk supportersto everyone else its junk to to each other using particular wallet they can understand junk does things in a way the junk adorers supportthey just use a validation bypass opcode to allow junk. which native bitcoin nodes just allow anything afterwards to be accepted unchecked. and then the junk supporters can add any daya they like and have any kind of flag they decide to suggest joining x number of lumps of junk togetherop_cat has got other purposes. but how and why its used should be of benefit to bitcoiners. as op-cat has other exploitable uses too that can cause more issues",
