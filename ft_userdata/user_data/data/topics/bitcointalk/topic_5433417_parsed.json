Overall, I agreed with him that most of people should not exaggerate with ridiculous methods to secure their Bitcoin while risking future access.one needs to be reasonable and he gave some tips about it.Â  I have also watched some videos by Cryptobureau, but I am not sure what most people around here think of him, to be honest.",

Iâ€™m fairly certain that on here, any question you may have would not go unanswered. So while Andreas Antonopoulos and Matthew Kratter may have enlightened you more on bitcoin, this forum has broadened my understanding and knowledge of bitcoin and has continued to do so on a daily basis.",

Have to admit I haven't heard his new stuff since 2021 at latest, so can't say but it was his books (collection of lectures) that really got me reading Bitcoin in 2016. Wish I'd found them earlier.Just something to mention... and I know we're only talking about Bitcoin but these days, my work takes me into a lot of learning in this area, and I've been really struggling to find a way to help a newcomer easily detach or expand on from Bitcoin education into \"everything other than Bitcoin\" learning. This mainly because the way Bitcoin works is almost completely different from everything else parading as \"the same thing but better\".From an education point of view, especially with kids and newcomers all using some form of non-Bitcoin wallet, now I try to see learning starting with Bitcoin and understanding classical crypto or classical blockchain (which is required fundamental) and then everything else is... modern crypto/blockchain (which is required for soon-to-be non-financial mainstream use).",

BTCBitcoinOh, Mr Andreas makes easily one of the best crypto educators out there. He explains crypto concepts so well that can get it the first time you listen to him or read his books.In fact, one his best quotes that got me curious about him was in his book The Internet of Money Volume Three: A collection of talks by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. He said, every time you use crypto, you are exercising sovereign power that is diverting money from a corrupt and broken system of central banks, investment banks, and governments, into a system that is giving people hope.I haven't really heard of Matthew Kratter. I just check him out on his YouTube channel and I can see why the OP listed him. Fabulous.",

All the channels that upload Bitcoin related videos get very few views. As a result, those who work tirelessly and want to share some knowledge about Bitcoin with others, they stop uploading these Bitcoin related videos, seeing that everyone is less interested. That's why there are so few Bitcoin-related educations available on various social media today.Â  However, there are some channels that regularly post educational videos related to Bitcoin.",
