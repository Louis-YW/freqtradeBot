  "content": "Original proposalI saw a post by Welsh saying that moderation reports have been in decline and that he misses the days when he woke up to hundreds of reports in his queue. It got me thinking of ways to jump-start it again.So, the idea would be for each user to have a \"millimerit\" balance (either hidden from view, or maybe visible next to the existing report accuracy numbers). Moderators could then award members with say 25 millimerits for any good report and -100 for any bad report.The balance can (maybe, not sure) go negative, so you would have to \"work off\" each of your bad reports to get back above zero and each time you accumulate 1000 millimerits (40 good reports) the balance gets reset and you're awarded one real merit.The thing I like about this system is that it can be completely ignored by the reporters that don't need an incentive (they can just pretend the system doesn't exist and keep doing their thing; it changes nothing for them except that they'll receive an extra merit once in a while). But, it might encourage others to spend their time cleaning up the forum, too. The steep carrot/stick ratio is to prevent would-be abusers from gaining any traction.The specific values will need discussion/tuning so that there's just the right amount of incentive; too little and it obviously won't jump-start anything, too much and it would likely lead to excessive reporting.An interesting consequence of a system like this is that it would probably compel a decent fraction of merit-seeking newbies to thoroughly learn the forum's rules.This proposal touches code that I don't have access to, so I'm unable to provide a patch like I normally would, but it's a nice idea and I thought it would be worth sharing.Revised proposalThanks for sharing your thoughts, everyone!It seems like maybe reporter badges would be a better (less abusable) motivator. I'll address reporter badges at the end of this edit.People have pointed out that reports are down because activity is down in general. That's true, but I still think ideas to motivate reporters are worth discussing.The system as proposed above would have been automatic (i.e. once a mod marked a report as good or bad, the millimerits would be sent). The -100 penalty for a bad report was there to prevent people from spamming the mods with reports; each bad report \"undoing\" 4 good reports means that the threshold for profitability is 80% accuracy (i.e. at or below 80% you can't sustainably earn millimerits).One piece of feedback that torpedoes the original proposal is the possibility of collusion, which I didn't think about. If the reward is handed out automatically, then it's only a matter of time before people start manufacturing posts for others to \"report\".I think both of the above problems (the -100 penalty and abuse by collusion) can be solved with a fairly small adjustment:Get rid of the -100 penalty for a bad report, but instead of the 25 millimerits for a good report being sent automatically, leave it up to the individual moderator's discretion. That way, the mods can spot abuse themselves; if someone spams them with mostly inaccurate reports or if reports seem suspiciously like collusion (e.g. someone keeps reporting new posts from the same user over and over again) then they can decline to issue any millimerits. Maybe the rule could be that when reporting a post, the moderator that handles it has the option of sending you between 0 and 1000 millimerits depending on how useful/valuable your report was. Then (just making up numbers) original reports can get ~60 and redundant (but still good) reports can get ~20, really valuable reports like malware can get ~300, and so on (some moderators would likely be more generous than others).Reporter badgesA few people mentioned reporter badges, which I think would be a nice addition to the forum!Quote from: Findingnemo on December 04, 2022, 03:32:37 PMBut I would like to remind the concept of (Seeking reporter badge images)Quote from: LoyceV on December 04, 2022, 03:45:25 PMMaybe OP can do the heavy lifting for theymos to implement the reporter badges?

Lol.... I'm sure you're not expecting an escalation over the previous quantity?

Hmm, it's strange that the admin proposed something like that, and that nothing happened for more than 4 years, which means that it's something very low on his priority list. Given that badges were awarded in some other cases, I assume that their technical implementation is not too demanding, so perhaps part of the reason why they were not implemented lies in the fact that some do not want to be labeled as top reporters.",

Moderators could then award members with say 25 millimerits for any good report and -100 for any bad report.I don't think that more merits will motivate old users who are reporting less, but millimerits could actually work for new members who are trying to rank up.Instead of buying or begging for merits they could finally make some positive forum contribution and earn merits this way.Now for this to work I think that millimerits should not be hidden, and it should be thought carefully before implementing this change.Quote from: PowerGlove on December 04, 2022, 01:31:23 PMThis proposal touches code that I don't have access to, so I'm unable to provide a patch like I normally would, but it's a nice idea and I thought it would be worth sharing.You need approval of theymos for this, but chances are higher if moderators support your proposal.Down side is that they will have more work, and not everyone is like Welsh Quote from: LoyceV on December 04, 2022, 03:45:25 PMMaybe OP can do the heavy lifting for theymos to implement the reporter badges? That would be really cool.I support this also.",
