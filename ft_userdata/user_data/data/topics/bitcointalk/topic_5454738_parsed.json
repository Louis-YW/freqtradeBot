  "content": "I know that not many people like the UEFA Nations League competition as it is referred as a replacement for all the friendly games that national teams played throughout the year. However, I didn't see any topic covering the upcoming final four that is scheduled in two weeks so I started a new topic. I hope it catches up...So, for those of you that don't know, the four finalists that qualified are Spain, Croatia, Italy and Netherlands. The first game will be between last year World Cup runner up Croatia and Netherlands as the country hosting the final four. Some say that it will be the last competition for Croatia's brightest star - Luka Modric. I'm not certain but I'd say there is more chance for him leaving the national team than for him staying. As for the odds, I would say that Croatia is maybe a slight favorite just because of their third place in the last World Cup but I wouldn't agree. Netherlands lost in the World Cup against Argentina who won the title in the end. Also, they are playing at home so I would dare to say that they are a slight favorite.The other semi-final game is Spain vs. Italy. Spain is probably a favorite as Italy didn't even qualify for the World Cup last year. Also Italy lost to England at home in the qualification game for the EURO 2024.All in all, I think we get to see four good football games. Maybe the title doesn't mean much, but I'm sure that all four national teams that qualified would like to win the title after coming this far.",

      "body": "It seems that there is not too much interest in this competition, but considering that it is only about 4 countries, it seems that most of forum members do not consider it too important - although this is in a way very similar to playing the semi-finals and finals of the European football championship. As for Croatia and the Netherlands, I can only say that I expect a very good match in which both teams will give their best, and it should be noted that this is a match between the sixth and seventh national teams in the world according to the FIFA ranking with the fact that the Netherlands is in 6th place with only one point more than Croatia.The first match is played only 4 days after the final of the Champions League, and as far as I can see, the Netherlands has at least 3 players who should play in that final, and Croatia can only have one (Brozovic). I would say that the Netherlands has a slight advantage due to the home field, but that Croatia in its standard good form can beat any team.I also think that Spain is the favorite in the second game, but even though Italy has been in bad shape for years, they should not be completely dismissed in advance.",

Nevertheless, I'm sure we will watch four great games. I just hope Croatia and Netherlands won't play too defensively. I know that Croatia tends to play knockout games just like that.",

      "body": "Yes most of top countries in this league see this as a chance to prepare for much bigger tournaments like Euro and World Cup. However actually this isn't that much of an unimportant tournament. If I'm not mistaken the winner of the Nations League will have a quota in the qualifying stage of 2026 World Cup.My source for this information: https://en.as.com/soccer/what-does-the-winner-of-the-nations-league-final-four-get-and-what-is-the-prize-n/If this is true then this should actually be some extra motivation for the teams in the semi finals here now. In addition to that there is some prize money for teams competing in the group stage but the biggest prize is for the winner which is around 10.5 million euros according to the source. But of course it must still not be feeling like the Champions League for example which pays a lot of money to the teams even for participating in the group stage.",

      "body": "The UEFA Nations League is indeed a competition that has received mixed reactions from fans and critics since its inception. some see it as a meaningful tournament that adds more competitive matches to the international calendar,While there are dissenters who disagree with the public opinion!!!!The 4 finalists you mentioned, Spain, Croatia, Italy, and the Netherlands, have certainly earned their spots in the tournament and will be competing for the title. The first semifinal between Croatia and the Netherlands sounds like an intriguing matchup. Modric, who has been a key figure for Croatia, may potentially be playing his last competition for the national team. While it's uncertain whether he will retire from international football, it adds an extra layer of significance to the game. Given the Netherlands' home advantage and their strong performance in the World Cup, it's reasonable to consider them slight favorites. We will see if these finals are worth betting on",

I say that because I believe that he really wants the trophy from that competition, regardless of what he won with Croatia at the world championships. He is a completely different person from, say, some who left the national team, and then continued to play club football for years. In addition, he can significantly reduce the number of minutes in the game, and his presence in the team means a lot, even if he does not play.Ivan Rakitic is an obvious example of such a player, because he can still play at a high level, but he no longer wanted to play for that national team.",

But I don't know if that will be enough to win a medal. I remember when Germany hosted the World Cup in 2006. There was a lot of Croatian fans on the stadium, but Croatia didn't even qualify for the next round. They ended up with one loss from Brazil and two draws from Australia and Japan.I admit that this time the Croatian national team is much better and I'm sure that failing to qualify for the next round after the group stage will be a huge disappointment.",
