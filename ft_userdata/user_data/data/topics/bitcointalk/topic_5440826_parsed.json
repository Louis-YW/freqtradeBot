      "body": "As already mentioned by OmegaStarScream, it's a very bad idea to keep your private keys online. Any centralized service and any online device is prone to hacking. You should keep your private keys offline, on a piece of paper or even better on a metal sheet.And you may want to consider creating a HD wallet with a seed phrase (a series of 12-24 words). In this way, you can have numerous addresses all generated from a seed phrase.Unlike a private key, a seed phrase can be written down on a piece of paper easily.",

Is this actually the best way to store them or is there any other ways I can store or Keep them safe?There is no way to recover if you forget or lose your private key, which is also one of the downsides of being our own bank but still safer than handing over your assets to a 3rd party. Gmail or other online storage services are very vulnerable to attacks, so absolutely do not host on online services, they are not reliable. The way I protect my private keys is to write them down in different copies and keep them in different places, and I give one copy to my wife. No method is absolutely safe, we can only use solutions that in our opinion are as secure as possible.",

I suggest you stop listening to their advice in the future. Even if you are not trying to store your private key/seed phrase, using online storage to store sensitive data is never a good idea. Have you never heard of how many people lose their account/money because they save their password on their Evernote, Google Keep, e-mail, etc?Personally, I store my seed phrase offline with encryption that only I know of, in a very secure location, and regularly check them out to see if anything is broken. Definitely not the best way but it is good enough for now, and I'll try to improve it in the future. I can't really protect myself from memory loss, so what I can do about that is just try to live as healthily as possible. Relying on our memory to remember the seed phrase is not a good idea anyway, just make sure to remember that you have some crypto and seed stored somewhere. CMIIW.You should search around this board to find out how to protect your private key better. There are tons of threads talking about it other than what has been mentioned above.",

It is no more new that someone will bring such issue up on a platform that his seed phrase has been known and his wallet compromised all because his seed phrase is online. Avoid anything that has to do with online for seed phrase and password backup.There is nothing as easy as two or three backups on a paper. If you want something more resistant to water and fire, you can go for stainless steel instead. There are many metallic backup option you can go for, stainless steel is the strongest among all.This is not updated, but maybe useful, or do more research on it: Store your bitcoin seed / private key safely (Water, Fire, Shock-proof)",

Only physical back ups and do make sure they are stored in a safe location. Protect against natural disasters as well as thieves.

Passwords are very secretive which if disclosed can lead to loss of valuables including assets.1. First you can write down the secret password on a piece of paper.  It can be diary, notebook etc. Keep it written down on paper near you. The outsider should not find it.2. If so, you can remember short passwords yourself. Remember passwords that are never hacked and are the most secure that you have written down.",

It's better to save it offline and one of the way of doing that is by using a nail or any sharp objects capable of scratching a steel plate, write your secret phrase or private key on the steel plate and then keep it in a place where you know that no one will ever think of looking at. By using steel plate you have successfully avoided the risk of your private key getting destroyed by fluid and also getting erased easily unlike those written on a piece of paper which are prone to water and been erased.",

You should only store your seeds or private key in something that you own and only have access too. If you do not do that you could lose access from a rogue employee and they would not be able to prove who it was.

No clouds, no mails, no private keys. Just generate a seed phrase on an airgapped device.

Close your curtains.Download Tails (a privacy and security focused Linux distro)Verify the binaries <- Important step, you need to ensure the integrity of the OS. Do it on a clean environment.Burn the OS image to a USB.Take the device and physically remove any Wi-Fi antennas (and obviously, Ethernet cables if any).Plug the USB to that device, and start up.You can see that Electrum comes pre-installed. The device will not connect in any network. It's also recommended to encrypt the electrum part of the USB (as shown in the Tails start screen), in case someone gains access to the USB.",
