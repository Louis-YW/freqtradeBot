There should not be a problem. You can always do a test transfer with tiny amount to be a 100% sure (minimal deposit to binance is 1 sat), but I don't think that there will be any issue.",

The output you create via a bitcoin transaction must be bigger than the dust limit. Otherwise, your transaction would be rejected by the nodes. The dust limit is 294 satoshi for segwit addresses and 546 satoshi for legacy addresses.",

Yes, you can transfer part of the whole balance to another Bitcoin,  this is not a big deal and I am sure a good number of people here have experienced the same thing before so they're given you the right information but how do you accumulate such an amount of Bitcoin in your wallet for long and not reminded to keep out emotions out and didn't let emotion control the outcome. Secondly, I will like to know how you accumulated such an amount in your wallet,  I want to know if the wallet balances are built from the durst transaction.",

When I was still new to crypto and didn't know which is legitimate and not, I was exploring and trying different crypto wallets to find out, and after time went by, this has become a major issue for me. Glad to hear it could be resolved like this, i'll try transfering mine. Thanks a lot for this helpful guide.",

Unfortunately a lot of shitcoins have created tokens that use the name bitcoin but have nothing to do with it. Sometimes people use them to transfer funds between exchanges without converting to bitcoin.The bitcoin addresses on Binance are under the \"bitcoin network\" type. Anything else is an altcoin.",
