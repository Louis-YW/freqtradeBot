  "content": "I would like to inform that ZAINmalik75 is using insulting language ( a sort of a threat) via PM. I feel very bad after reading his PM and his point of view and decided to share here.  I usually post to the point not necessarily lengthening the posts but he reminded me on the local board ( i appreciate learning new things) to keep the posts long (even if there is no requirement) to look like a constructive post. Now today he PMed me saying ( in bad language) that if I do not stop short posts, he will start reporting me. I got really confused and afraid and asked which post (after his initial warning) I did wrong. QuoteApko Mai NY warn Kiya for short post, ab dobara karr rahy haa next time ap ka lihaaz Nahi karunga direct report karunga.Google translation: I warned you for a short post, now I am doing it again next time, I will not take you into consideration, I will report directly.He told that this post is short. For that i replied him in PM the below text.QuoteI told in this post that Honda brother should change his signature because he was selected in the campaign a few hours back but he did not know it. So I helped him and he changed the signature after my post.What's wrong in it ? Why do I have to make artificially long posts?For this , he replied QuoteAise baato ky liya ap ussy PM bhi karsakty Ty Meaning i could PM him for such thingsI am here for learning but i did not know how should i know that which things to PM and which things to write on the forum ?I was also confused whether i should bring it on the table here  Now i am very afraid as after seeing this post in the reputation board he may get furious with me and don't know what will he do with me. Also, i am not sure if i should artificially make all long posts when something can be said in short posts too. I want to improve and i try my best.",

If it's a death threat, then it's correct to report here because he might get banned.Remember, high quality post isn't must be a long post.",

      "body": "I don’t see his post as threatening but rather just an advice or a warning for his future action. There’s nothing to be threatened with the report since the lenghth of the post is not the basis for the quality of the post as @Solosanz already explained. Actually, those post lenght is just a requirements for signature campaign purposes and you can post how short you want as long as it’s on topic to what you are replying. You’re doing just fine. I’m not sure what his intentions for PM’ing you. Maybe you’ve got a bad blood argument against this user in the past. Just block his PM and ignore him so that you can’t see his post. Let the mods handle his report since forum moderators is fair on reviewing all reported post.",

Again, Just lock this thread and follow my advice on ignoring him simce this thread will surely triggered him since you dedicated this thread for him while I really understand his purpose of contacting you. Grow thick skin because you will encounter worst offensive like that when you post on global threads and started an argument to a certain topic. Probably you are just both misunderstood the point of each other. There’s no threatening message in there but only an aggressive advice. Everyone needs to grow up here. Quote from: ZeeshanTrade on September 29, 2023, 02:29:20 PMHe is after me.He is not after you. He is ZAINmalik from 1d after all. *pun intended* seriously there’s nothing wrong on following your seniors advice especially for your campaign acceptability in the future.",

He is after me.You need to know that no one is after anyone in this forum and there is no one who can harm your account unjustly. As far as reporting the posts is concerned, he has the right to report any post he sees that does not meet up to the standards but rest assured that posts are not deleted based on one's reporting. Mods will judge the reported posts and only mark it a good report if they think is not upto the standards.Also, you need to improve too. Maybe he is concerned about you as if we see your post history, some of the posts may seem spam, if not all.",

He is after me.He is not after you lol. He is saying that your post quality is trash.Let's say you keep posting the way you are. He dislikes it and starts reporting your posts. Either the moderators will agree or they won't. If they agree, they will possibly delete your post, if they disagree they will leave your post up. There's nothing else this user can do to you, so if you feel he is threatening you, just ignore him.I would take a little advice and try to make sure your posts are constructive and topic. If your posts are reported and you keep seeing posts deleted, you may login and find yourself banned. Learning is fine, make sure to check out all the sticky threads in each section as well.",

Quote from: Rikafip on September 29, 2023, 12:25:54 PMAnd yeah, you should reports those oneliners and they will be deleted and accounts probably nuked as well. Zainmalik75 is reputable member of our local Thread and I learned a lot about Bitcointalk rules from him. When I was newbie he guided me as well. All our senior member work is to protect our thread from spam/scam and for this purpose easy method is to report the post but he considered your newbie and just warn you in dm after advising multiple times in the local thread.",
