And if I'm not mistaken we have a UFC thread here, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5139347.0.Maybe you and other UFC/MMA fans could go on the discussion regarding this fight.Personally though I'm not going to tail you on this one, no offense.",

Cannonier has 15-6 record 4 of his losses is because ufc abused him and gave hom heavyweight fighters 1 weight class above him which is not fair and not competitive.In his career he lost only 2 legitimate losses to fighters on his weight class to adesanya and robert (they are elite)Sean has a weak chin and he just got ko 3 month ago.(is traumatic for fighters and ruin their confidence)Cannonier has powerful hand and 67% of his wins by ko..He never fight a fighter like cannonier. His striking is going to be too much for sean  handle.It may take some time to finish him than perira but i can easily see round 2 K.O",

Also ko doesnt effect him mentally like other fighters.But i dont see stick knock him out or outbox cannoiern over 5 rounds. Even if he he is confidence and psycho Cannonier will overcome him with his power eventually.",

Are you trying to promote your casino or something? This makes me think companies try to advertise and get promoted through members conversation onboard the platform without any due diligence and attracting people to there conversations to inquiring about their casinos based on their platform predictions and other previous done predicted jobs. How do you convince me or others to bet with just a mere conversation here without any factual or statically proven records and wins of or in the past. What makes you feel your predictions are a win win game altogether?Like you claim, if you truly are why not give us updated documentations of your previous casino betting or better still if you have none such I will advise you raise up a thread here where you could be updating your win win prediction regular so that when you have a good prediction you could reference the thread link so members could see and believe you for that.

Strickland being somewhat the favorite here is no surprise, given that he has more fights in his bout and has a lot more experience in the said fighting tournament compared to Cannonier. Meanwhile, Cannonier seems to be full focus on this bout compared to Sean, and you're not really one of the first ones who though that maybe, Jared can outclass Strickland in this fight. Lots of betting circles are already predicting the same as you do, although the odds haven't swayed enough to show the people's sentiment about this match.",
