Do you have any links at least about this game?Url link? Sorry i cant able to search it up since when i do google it there are lots of results.",

Seriously, to attract players and investors it must be an entertaining game and of course a more rewarding game with a minimal investment. This might look not easy but it should work like this and also have a strong backup plan where you can assure that the game will run smoothly. P2E lose a lot of investors already, many lose their trust on this kind of project and that is a big challenge for you.",

If you want to attract both users and investors, you'll have to show that your game is for long-term and it's tied up to a real company (the more reputable the company, the better). Having an anonymous team of developers isn't going to help you that much. I'm not saying doxxed teams will be more trusted either since there have been some hired dudes  who pretend to be developers (fake).Since most of the blockchain games now are almost similar, you can put more emphasis on longevity and legitimacy. Make sure you already have a plan on how to make the game sustainable. Don't be like those projects that went out because their reward pool got drained just weeks after launching.",

Whether it’s blockchain or not does not matter, it can go boom with perfect marketing strategy. For a game you can start publishing it on digital platforms which allows user based testing services. They pay their users for doing so and you can get a survey back on how your games doing. Try to find those ways and you will be good to go.",

I participate tons of this event before and all I can say was the experience is great because tester will have an early access and at the same time earn tokens from the game itself. You can partner on Kols that will do livestream during there test so that your game will be show case in the social media to attract more players to try it. Beta testing program is the best way to market and test your product at the same time.",

Alpha test usually done by the team itself without any help for the outside to limit the exposure of all the major bug and error in the game. Beta test is the most appropriate term on accepting the public to do the trial test with the team to determine more minor bugs that team didn’t encounter during Alpha test. Sometimes it’s still very hard to launch beta test especially if the game doesn’t give interest to the players.Marketing on social media such as buying ads  to target crypto users is more effective than doing community participation if the project is just starting.",

However, most projects are doing that with VCs and partners to boost the progress nowadays, that's why i suggested that.

What are the options for developing a marketing plan, please share your experiences ...?There is no way to get a project into the hands of players quickly other than hiring a professional marketing team, it will probably have to spend a lot of money on marketing if you want your project to be known to many people. But the main thing is you have to make sure your game really has potential and excels, because you know those P2E projects before they really aren't P2E but to me it's just a formality disguised investment, in my opinion it is click to earn not play to earn. P2E is going downhill so it is difficult to attract participants and we are still in a bear market. where people are not excited about new projects.Completely agree with you that the market is not at its best, but on the other hand there is time to develop a game in full force and do not hurry anywhere, the attitude towards the many games now negative among participants. Unfortunately this badly affects the really promising games that are not for profit",
