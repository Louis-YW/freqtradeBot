It's all about hype and shilling. If someone decides that the shilling of this project can bring more profit to its creators, it will be promoted in various social networks and influencers, who receive payment, will talk about it with his audience. Without these actions, any meme coin, including this Robo, will remain a shitcoin nobody needs.",

I don't think Shiba inu wouldn't have rised anywhere if it would have been called Robo Doge or stuff like that, as there were doge copycats out there and they died right away. Even memecoins need some level of originality. Naming it to Robo anything else would have at least given a them shot at this. It would still be really bad attempt to make a new meme but atleast it would be something.Because why an earth would anyone spend a penny to project where the dev didn't even bother to make an effort.",

I heard that and that's pretty much the same like another copy paste meme token after shiba inu booming due to the elon's tweet. It seems like that you didn't even know how to know whether's good or bat token. That could not become the next one to blow up. Low daily trade volume mean the interest in the token is very small at this moment. I think that you must also see the fact that if these days bearish may stay even longer then what you have expected before. There will be no big wave for this token. This gonna be another useless token that will exist in the market. it's so garbage as usual",

It is so disappointing to see that so many people are still interested in coins which have no other purpose but to make money to the people behind them, how can they not see that this coin is useless and that no one should invest in it? Or maybe the actually know but they just do not care because they want to be part of a coin which makes a major movement from the beginning and see if they can make a fortune this way, but whatever the case the most likely scenario for this coin is to simply cause no impact at all and disappear soon after its release.",

It’s just too obvious, the next big craze that comes in the next bull run will be a shot out of the dark. We don’t know what it is yet because it’s probably in the early beta stage.

My advice to you and to everyone is to stay away from such meme-coins because in the end they are just shit-coins. It is as simple as that. The only reason why those projects are created is, that the \"team\" behind those projects wants to make a lot of money with almost 0 effort. They just create another Ethereum or BSC token, create a copy and paste website and that's it. In many cases the \"team\" behind such projects is just a single person that wants to take away money from naive investors.99% of those shit-coins are never really alive. The other 1% maybe survives a few days or even weeks and makes the team and early investors rich but eveyone that comes in on day 2 or even later is already rekt. Just stay away from meme-coins. Their time is over.",

Honestly I doubt if this project is going to be anything like Shiba Inu. I would advice that you stay away from it if you haven't invested in it  but if you've have already bought some of the token then you probably should consider selling if there's any slight increase in price because this is not a token to hold for a long period of time. I don't know if I'm just been paranoid but any token that has to do with \"Inu\" scare the hell it of me maybe it's because of my previous experience with Shiba Inu.",
