      "body": "100% scam, don't click on the link, or you might lose control of the wallet, which you will attach or link with the link the scammer has sent you. If earning money would be that easy then why would people work hard, why would he be sending you the link, why would he not claim that for himself? Actually, he is trying to lure you into clicking that link so that a second thought of skepticism will not come to your mind and you will abruptly click on the link and attach your wallet and end up losing your wallet access. You did the right thing in avoiding this link, and I hope after seeing this topic someone will report that person, even you can report him. I doubt if he is banned, because he is not active from long time, but still, it worth to report him. You gave a good advice to avoid such links, because if someone is telling you that you can make free money by just attaching your wallet with the link then believe me this is nothing but a scam. Recently, when Vitalik's twitter account were hack then, scammers posted a tweet in which they asked the fan following to link their wallets to this link in order to get some NFTs. And at the end, they all lost their access to their funds once they connected their wallets. You can learn more about it here:https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/",

In this message, the scammer asks you to visit the site provided, fortunately you quickly realize that the message is a kind of phishing attack.",

TYThere's a link sent thru pm so I guess that person have evil plan to you and its good that you ignore him since no people will give you easy money thru pm so think so many times about link sent to you. Much better if you ignore all of it especially those unfamiliar links and entertain only the links where you know you engage with or sent to you by legitimate people. To many scams happened by clicking those dangerous link so don't let yourself included on their victim list.",

While can get banned after doing it?It is definitely a phishing attack, you can see that the forum warns against just message. Donâ€™t be carried away with the copper membership account he purchased, scammers can invest a lot to get their target. Also this is a forum account that can easily be hacked and the hacker could attempt a scam with such account so in general if you receive a message from anyone even if it is high ranking member containing a link i would just advice you not to click it. If it is something important I notice that prominent members would rather create a thread about it rather than sending unsolicited messages to anyone",

If you really wanted to differentiate that either you should trust this dude or not then simple before clicking on any link, use your common sense, like why would he want you to make money. If I can show you, my twitter, and other social media accounts are filled with such phishing message in which they try to give your many offers, like free nudes, free money, free burgers in your area etc. etc. They are just trying and making attempts on newbies, because they know that newbies don't know that much and they might fall for their shit. I am relieved to know that you did not clicked on any link. And reported the person here. I am sure that many members will have reported the person till now and I am also going to do the same and I might give him red trust or negative feedback using your pic's reference. But I think that's won't be needed if he will get ban.",

Since I am not new to the internet, I know what scammers do to lure their next victim.In my opinion, no high rank member on this forum will attempt to scam you because they realize it will put their account at risk, and they realize how hard they worked to get to the high rank. Be more concerned about newbies, stay away from them at all costs, because their accounts are brand new, even if they are copper accounts, they have nothing to lose. When someone sends you a PM with a link, they're up to no good. Use common sense.",
