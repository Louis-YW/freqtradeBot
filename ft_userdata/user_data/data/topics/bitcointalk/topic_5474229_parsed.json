  "content": "This recent thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472210.msg63078727#msg63078727 that talks about \"how children are more closed to mother's  than father's\" inspired me to create this post.I want to categorically emphasis on how negatively mother's has inffected us as a course of mothers love but with the aids and ability of adulthood and conductive aids, we could be able to separate right from wrongs and lead our paths independently at today.However, here are my outlines about our mothers negative effects during our childhoods>>>* Enemity amongst the families: Mother's are in fund of being one sided when their children are in domestic misunderstanding (quarrel/fights).Instead of mothers applying diplomatic when children are having issues, they would just want to take one sided and have the other to be blamed basically on the one she loves more without undermining who was at fault and then enemities amongst both arouses by grudges.* Laziness: Mother's has tended to breed about laziness in the kids as a course of pampering/caring.At the age of a child supposed to be rendering some domestic helps in the family such as the house chores, they would opt to say the child is too tendered to engage on domestic works instead they would bring in house help to do the works. This pretty treat's has caused must of our girls/women today slaying even at the husband's house that they can't take proper in-charge of the duties of a woman at home.Also has caused laziness on the male borns whereas they finds it hard to cope on their own at when time is due and failing to consider they would be man of their own home sometimes and they got lost the responsibilities exercises because they so much leaned on the parents endivoirs.* Lack of conducts: The mothers has always lived to tolerate with our mannerlessness whereas the junior ones disrespects the seniors while mother's takes it for fun protecting the junior ones from sanctioned for being disrespectful.This has also brought us about public misconducts that we don't at all realizes who is our elders. We just talk to people without undermining age differences simply because we have a lioness mother who is behind to defend our actions. Etc.Conclusively, it all begins from the inside. Mother's love on children is exceptionally incomparable but losses its fundamental obliged significant.",

Like the line way talk say I want to categorically emphasis on how negatively mother's has inffected us as a course of mothers love as highlighted the statement com the sound like say nah all mama the do this favouritism and unqual sided love for their children. So me go lik make you edit your talk make we know say no be all mama in general you the talk about but some.Wetin I get talk be say  e get how sweet some mama go the treat one pikin inside family more than the other pikin them and the other pikin them go just take hatred focus on the one the mama the too show much love. So make we mama try the manage how the the share their love to their children them make jealousy no show face between them. Example of wetin happen for bible when Jacob love Joseph pass all him other plenti pikin them... Unah know the rest of the story how it end.",

      "body": "Bro, I no go really support you for somany part fro this your thread. That one na because motherly love fit different from one person to another but the love na still the same. They all care equally for all their pikin Dem. From the look of dis post, e dey obvious say you get bad experience with your moma and this wan done make you get these negative view of how she treat you. The truth be say she love you more than you even think. As small pikin, I notice say anything wey my sister's Dem talk, na e my mama dey believe and conclude put. This one be con make me think say she like them well pass me. But today, I come know say she love loved me same way as my sister. So no go dey reason am like dat. A mother is the best gift you can get as a child.",

      "body": "Op your conclusion on motherly love is biased, it is subjective reality/experience that determines how you see motherly love. mother's are absolutely the most valuable gift in childhood, most people that didn't see their mother tend to be unguided because they lack this basic mother love. Not all mothers partake in showing a sided love to there favourite child. some just do it in their subconsciousness and sometimes they tend to realize their mistakes sooner. when you talk about how people become lazy you reason is not valid to be the cause of laziness the children or youths because it's an individual decision but for some it is inherit, I believe in recantation and I discovered that some attitude  are caused by recantation. Sometimes mother's try their possible best to put children in order but they sometimes resist because of the in built ego and this can not the cause of motherly love. On a personal level I use to believe that my mother loves my elder brother who where never around since my childhood but when I go to the university my kid sis kept tell me that my mom loves me more than everybody. it keeps reoccurring then I knew she loves everyone equally. you do know about the story of a Shepard who lost 1 sheep out of his 100 sheep so he left 99 to look for the 1 that was show that one lost sheep is more important than 99 that is the same thing with my case. my mom just cares about that 1 that she's not seeing for the mean time. So is applicable to all mothers they show love to that one child that since to be lost than others in order to bring that one close too not to be misguided. QuoteConclusively, it all begins from the inside. Mother's love on children is exceptionally incomparable but losses its fundamental obliged significant In logical reasoning you conclusion is proposition that is not correct or maybe correct in some sense. it is an invalid argument because the premises (The above mentioned things e.g laziness, Enemity amongst the family etc) do not logically imply the conclusion or let me say the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.  I write dis tin for English because I want make anybody wey go read am understand am well. And plus say op himself write for English.",
