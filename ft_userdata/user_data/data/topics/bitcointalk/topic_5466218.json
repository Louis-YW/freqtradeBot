  "content": "I live in a locality called MINAMA, in Rivers State, but a few days ago I traveled to a state called BAYELSA. When I reached Bayelsa, I saw a taxi that was writing BTC taxi and I was wondering, how? Why was BTC written on top of the taxi? I was beginning to think that the government of Bayelsa state had accepted BTC, but to my greatest surprise, it wasn't for Bitcoin, but an abbreviation of a sentence (But that doesn't mean anything).The reason why I chose to bring this thread here was because I believe that the government don't want to do with anything called BTC (Bitcoin), but I was surprised to see the state government put the sign of BTCBTC in their state taxi, not just one but about 100 of the taxi he bought.Although the government doesn't actually mean Bitcoin, as long as the letter BTC is theirs, it also means Bitcoin, and moreover, this BTC sign will also help spread the awareness of Bitcoin in that state, so every ear must hear the letters BTC. The old and the young will hear about it, so when Bitcoin will start pumping that everyone will be in a rush to join, nobody will say that he or she didn't hear about BTC.",

It will also take more than putting BTC signs on cars to make people understand Bitcoin",

The acronym BTC will only be understood by people who are aware of Bitcoin. Other citizens will not make any meaning from the acronym. I understand your stance but I doubt if an acronym on taxi will encourage people to start rushing to join the Bitcoin space because they do not know those words. It will only serve as a reminder to those who already have Bitcoin knowledge. Quote from: franky1 on September 09, 2023, 03:18:20 PMlet me guessBayelsa Taxi CabsThe meaning of the BTC signs on those taxes is Bayelsa State Transport Company (BTC) and they were bought to help the citizen cushion the effect of the removal of petroleum subsidy in Nigeria.",

But yeah to some extent it will create curiosity among travelers like it creates curiosity in you. But tell me, after seeing this view, did you get excited and think of buying more BTC? Because one should not get into FOMO by just seeing something that he/she does not actually understand fully. (This is not specifically for you only). And how BTC will start to pump just because of this, can you tell me for how long they have written BTC on their taxis? Well, let's assume for 1 or 5 years then why we have not seen any news about it that explains the Bayelsa Taxi Cabs (BTC) helped BTC to gain that much value? Quote from: franky1 on September 09, 2023, 03:18:20 PMlet me guessBayelsa Taxi CabsWell, that was a simple guess and I was googling it thanks for saving the time. I also was going to write in the post that OP you should mention what actually the meaning of it. hehe",

Maybe if it's a trademark they could file a case but btc is decentralized.Let me correct you: BTC written on top of every taxi indicates Bayelsa Taxi Cabs. Franky1 already guessed the right abbreviation for it. But I began to think, what if he or any other person did not mention the right meaning? Then, just due to this post, there would be an extra 100 searches about BTC today. Which would increase its hype too, obviously. In the Google metrics.One thing is true: at least everyone passing by that teriotry must have heard about BTC, whether they knew the back story of it or not, like you mentioned an example of BTS. Far back when I came to know about it, it indicated some band, but later I saw these words in many YT shorts and many movies. I became curious and started to search them out, and at the end I got to know that it meant behind the scenes.¬†There are many words like these, but honestly, as the OP said, after reading them, one must get the idea of Bitcoin. Of course, only those will think of it who know about it.",

But obviously, it is not really bitcoin related since it's colored red which is the opposite a bitcoin believer wanted. It should've been orange or green for the bull run and not red which represents a bearish season. But for someone who is curious, entering BTC in Google means bitcoin although I am not sure if it is the same in other places.",
