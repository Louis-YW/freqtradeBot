Why didn't I just buy it when it was $60K (Condition A), I don't care about $50K or $40K, what I wanted was Bitcoin, not buying it cheap.Above is a short story about people who assess Bitcoin in terms of value in FIAT, whatever Bitcoin's price is now, it will not lose its value in the slightest, 0,2 BTC is still 0,2 BTC no matter how FIAT views Bitcoin's value. Make this price drop as a new opportunity for us to accumulate more Bitcoin (BTC).",

So it is better not to advise anyone to buy, unless he really asks us for forced advice, more than that don't do it to avoid getting into trouble with neighbors.Collect more bitcoins in the market like now is a sentence that I will stick to, because bitcoin has not yet reached the last q years of the cycle it will make us much more profitable when the second ATH after Halving, next year will be brighter in my opinion.",

This last dip after a few days of decline reminds us that other tendencies and feelings are possible.I don't want bad feelings for my friends, relatives and/or neighbors, so I don't talk about it to most of them, at the price of not making them share in the good moments either, but I've always thought that Bitcoin is a door you'd better cross yourself with no invitation.",

I wrote something about it about 4 months ago with the title Bitcoin and global tensions!. In a way this has turned into both a positive and a negative characteristic of bitcoin.When Bitcoin reacts to such huge global events, it shows that Bitcoin has stopped being this small market where only a bunch of nerds on the internet trade. It may not have \"matured\" the way we want it but at the same time it has woven into our society and has gotten so many different people involved that whenever such a significant global event (eg. COVID19, NATO-RU conflict, Iran punishing the NATO backed terrorists) is happening that can affect the economy as a whole; Bitcoin reacts to it just like other markets (like the US stock market that has been crashing in all those events).But also it is a negative characteristic because Bitcoin was supposed to be that \"safe haven\" not something people only buy during peacetime and when everything is fine. It was supposed to be the digital gold and yet gold seems to be more resilient to such negative events.Of course I should add that economy and the markets are too complex to be analyzed like this and be affected with only one reason (such as conflict in this case), even though I say these tensions are the main reason for it. There are lots of reasons that have significant impact on markets including Bitcoin's. The next major thing is the recession. In case you missed it, US was incapable of cutting interest rates and is deepening the recession which means only one thing: more sell pressure on different markets including bitcoin...",

Some weeks back bitcoin was around 65k and look at the drastic drop losing about 15k so in a situation like that what will you do because selling is not an option. When this continues to happen the only choice should be that you add to the one you already have instead of panicking over price.  If your neighbor are someone that is really interested in taking advice then riding in the storm will be the best option. My neighbor here have turned two my friends into lover of bitcoin and have invested and they will always want to invest.  It should not be a case of never or never. It is better to start early and ignore the market till you make that money.",

If this has not be politically motivated, the damage would have been minimal because we already expect a bounce but the buy pressure will be there to control the sell pressure but this time, we have more of sell pressure with FUD.I'm of the option looking for a way to see further corrections, more people will chicken out and sell and people with real intentions of long term hodl will buy and by the time they are done, they will send the price to another level, those that sold will come back again to chase the price once again.",

I didn't even bother checking the market after knowing it went down as low as $49k, not because I'm nonchalant or whatever, but just because I know this coin's gotta bounce back eventually.

Not everyone has cash, but for all the ones that do, this is actually a good thing and we should be considering how we could make this work in the end.

What I believe we will have trouble with is the fact that it is going to end up with people who are too scared and sell, even after dipping this hard. Nobody should be selling at this low point, it's obvious that we are going to bottom out and make a profit.We aren't even that far from the recent prices, we were like 53k or so just a few weeks ago before we went over 60k again, so we are nearly there again and nothing shocking to be fair.
