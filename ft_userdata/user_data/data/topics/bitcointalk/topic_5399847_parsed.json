They don't mine and neither \"mint\" BTC.They are just websites that are paying a very small value (a dust) for your engagement. Your \"clicks\" are worth money to websites, and they are giving a share of that value when you complete faucets. This have nothing to do with mining or anything related to bitcoin protocol.QuoteNow, the estimated amount of BTC in circulation is 21 million, but with these other sources BTC mining here and there, are we not expecting more than the estimated amount?

Besides this faucet are just earning via captcha and ads while giving back some part of the profit to the solver so they are not mining.",

They don't create it, same as casinos in real life. They don't print the bank notes. Quote from: Majestic-milf on May 23, 2022, 02:43:59 PMBecause on a norm, before BTC gets minted, there must be a confirmation of transactions from miners just like regular banks do in the normal Fiat.If by \"regular banks\" you refer to commercial banks, then no way. When a miner solves a block, and broadcasts his success to the network it's easy to verify that he worked for it. You just check his Proof of Work, that is the block header and its hash. On the other hand, commercial banks create credit money in a far less transparent way. You can't know how much credit is owed, what's the bank's liquidity, what's the bank's investments etc.Quote from: Majestic-milf on May 23, 2022, 02:43:59 PMMy question lies in the area of where these other faucets and freebitco.in get their coins from.Same as you do; from other people.",

The balance is kept in a hotwallet which is funded by the owners at regular intervals. This funding comes from the payments from advertisement networks being on the site and being shown to the incoming traffic.QuoteNow, the estimated amount of BTC in circulation is 21 million, but with these other sources BTC mining here and there, are we not expecting more than the estimated amount? Because on a norm, before BTC gets minted, there must be a confirmation of transactions from miners just like regular banks do in the normal Fiat. The total amount in circulation is fixed at 21mil. They are transacting within the fraction of 21mil that has already been mined by different miners. QuoteMy question lies in the area of where these other faucets and freebitco.in get their coins from. From the current total supply. People spend on these sites via their casino, sports bets, lottery, golden tickets, ad traffic etc. This money is recycled back to the hotwallet and the cycle continues. Freebitco.in does run a mining scheme where you can invest, but that is separate from faucet dispenses.",

You need to understand how faucets and mining work on their own and they aren't the same.It's been said above, that a faucet is a way to introduce Bitcoin by completing such a small task as solving a captcha or viewing ads because faucet owners usually benefit and get revenue from the advertiser.  It's free that you can collect a tiny one, but the problem how much the minimum withdrawal before you can withdraw. In mining, that's how you will generate Bitcoin via claiming a reward once you present the valid partial proof-of-work (PoW).While mining needs investment and faucet is totally free that you can get on the platform where it is hosted.",

As far as I know, it is the only faucet site that has been successfully transited from a simple faucet idea to a full-fledged casino, and it is now one of the oldest and best-known Bitcoin casinos around, and is probably the most visited site when it comes to Bitcoin casino gambling.",

Honest sites buy bitcoins or buy mining tools to get bitcoins and then distribute them to users.So where do these sites make the money? In fact, most of these faucets (honest one)  take advantage of either the clicks you make, the ads you see, or access your cookies and try to sell your data, thus generate profits and give you a portion of it.Finally, you should know that these sites are databases meaning that they can claim that they have 30M bitcoins but in fact unless you withdraw those coins (there are only less than 21 million bitcoins) to your wallet, you cannot believe their claims[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=14.0",

That is only a demonstration. I've already used faucets which showed me a personal balance of 0.1BTC or more, while in fact I had nothing, since the sites were scam. The bitcoins only exist in a wallet when you can confirm it by checking the address on the blockchain by yourself.
