  "content": "First Annual Bitcointalk Physical Cryptocurrency Christmas Themed Decoration/Art ContestChristmas Themed Physical Cryptocurrency Decoration contest.Contest #1 - LEALANA physical coin Christmas Themed Decoration contest.Contest #2 - General physical cryptocurrency coin Christmas Themed Decoration contest. (Any brand/maker/year/coin/card/etc.)Rules - 1. Your creation must include a LEALANA physical coin (any type/style/year) for contest #1. For contest #2 you may use any physical cryptocurrency coin brand/make/type. 2. There will only be one entry per person per contest (but this can include a bulk of items together (i.e. a 3 coin set with a drawing next to it, for example). ¬†If you enter both contests each entry must be a uniquely different submission. The design/art has to be much different than the other.3. Valid entries will be considered only if it is original work. Please include the current date and your username in the picture otherwise it will not be a valid entry into the contest.4. Entries must be received by 11:59PM EST December 25th, 2022 to be included in the final polling.5. You can enter both contests but you will have to have a noticeably different coin type and Christmas decoration theme to enter both. Different coin, art style, setup, etc.6. PRO TIP: Please consider blurring out the first bits of your coins if you have an issue of privacy and public knowing what coin address/addresses you have on your physical crypto.7. VIDEO - If you would like to create a video and upload the link with a nice screenshot of the creation that would be acceptable. Video visuals may be interesting especially if you can't see all the details from one angle. Just putting it out there!General Design Suggestions:You are encouraged to make a X-mas themed decoration, scene, 2D art, 3D art, full size christmas tree decoration, snowman, xmas lights etc. Feel free to be creative with the christmas decoration. But remember...you have to include nicely visible picture of physical cryptocurrency coin or multiple coins in the display.Please try your best to be creative with cryptocurrency and Christmas theme in mind. Feel free to use COAs, capsules, redeemed coins, unredeemed coins, graded coins, etc.All entrants are welcome, even if you don‚Äôt celebrate Christmas or the holidays. All are welcome.I‚Äôd like to thank ChiBitCTy as this is themed after their pumpkin carving contest done earlier this year.Contest Start Date: NowContest End Date: Christmas Day, December 25th, 2022 EST How will the winner be picked?: There will be a poll for each contest ran from December 29th to January 5th. ¬†Prizes: 1st place for each contest receives everything shown below. ¬†If there are enough entrants, I will include a 2nd place and maybe even a 3rd place prize as well. ¬†For now it is just a 1st place winner.CONTEST #1 Prize - ONE LEALANA 0.1 BTC 1 oz 999 FINE SILVER DIME ¬† RAINBOW COLORED (no funding included)ORIGINAL THREAD w/ info: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5423082.0CONTEST #2 Prizes - ONE LEALANA 0.01 BTC 0.1 oz 999 FINE SILVER CENT ¬† RAINBOW COLORED (no funding included)ORIGINAL THREAD w/ info: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5416538.0ONE BITCOIN COLOURING BOOK - Donated by aoluainLINK: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406385.0All prizes will be shipped 2-4 weeks after the conclusion of the contest.DONATIONS: If anyone would like to donate prizes to the contests please let me know and Ill definitely consider adding them into the mix.If I missed anything I reserve the right to change/alter/add any of the rules should they be deemed necessary to the success of the contest.UPDATES: 11/29/2022Update:I'm considering doing a sort of tier system where the amount of entrants will determine the amount of prizes that I will be putting up and how many places (1st, 2nd, 3rd etc) will exist for the winners of both contests.Proposed tier system:0-30 entrants = 1st place only prizes31-60 entrants = 1st and 2nd place prizes61-90 entrants = 1st, 2nd, 3rd place prices91+ entrants = GRAND PRIZE across both contests (most votes cumulative between the two contests for two uniquely different entries by a single party) and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th place prizesThis GRAND PRIZE will have a higher value than both 1st place prizes combined.Please chime in and let me know what you all think about this.Note - I will not say what the additional prizes are yet until we hit the entrant threshold of participants assuming I go this path.Clarification - If Bob enters contest #1 and contest #2, that is considered TWO separate entries as the entries have to be uniquely different entries.Also if anyone wants to donate prizes to this contest feel free to PM me and we can decide how to appropriate the prizes in addition to the prizes i'm putting up and going to be putting up should we go this entrant tier system route.",
