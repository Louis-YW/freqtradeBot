If a group of attackers controls more than 51% of the network they could modify their nodes to attack the network, and since they are holding more than half of the network their attack will be a success.

There are different types of nodes some of them are pruned nodes which do not download the complete blockchain and there are full nodes that download the full blockchain.

Back then the mining was done with normal computers and when he started there were no pools, each miner had its own node with the client, nowadays most nodes are not miners at all, and miners are already joining their hashrate in pools, plus there is no trace of the mentioned CPU mining anymoe.So, right now, paraphrasing and simplifying the above, the network is secure as long as honest miners control more hashing power than any cooperating group of attacker miners.",

So in short any node that would collaborate with others, mine in secret a longer (and valid!) chain, and then broadcast it and thus invalidating transactions that were confirmed previously by the now shorter block are dishonest miners (or nodes).Quote from: Upgrade00 on March 08, 2023, 05:17:04 PM Determining the longest valid chain among any malicious attempt to hijack the network would be fairly easy.You don't determine which is a malicious chain and which is not, the chain with more work even if mined by malicious actors would always be the right one according to the protocol, if the reptilians or Illuminati have the capabilities to mine in a split second a chain with more accumulated proof-of-work than the one we have right now that will become the valid one.",
