  "content": "What was the first account created on Bitcointalk ? Well the simple answer is  adminHow about the third ?That is actually  Satoshi  ok precisely here are the first 5 created accounts on Bitcoin talk after Satoshi.siriusnandnorXuniemadhatternanaimogoldSmokeTooMuchWhy did I bring this up and how did I get this info?Now here is a simple trick on how I got these profiles.Open your profile,click merit then click the url text box and edit the last digits after the url.Points to note;1. The digits in the url signifies your unique profile number.2. Now if you place a new set of digits after that url without ur unique profile digits and hit search it will open the merit history of the user with that profile number.Below are a series of illustration Why didn't I mention account 2? This is because I tried using same thing for profile numbers 2,5 and a few others but it didn't return any profile what could be the cause?here is the message displayed.Don't forget to keep your keys safe üòÅ",

Otherwise, tracking IDs will be useless because some accounts will be deleted.BTW Is this your only account? I noticed another account posting a screenshot in the same font you use, and there is a similarity between two accounts.",

Whomever that signed up today this very moments happens to the last user of the forum and such person should be around Millions plus. Profile ID is being arranged from 1 to Millions of total signed up so there is nothing much difficult over there. I believe if his tricks of earning merits are being discovered op will stop maybe he would device a new means.. lol",

Well, this is getting the user account through merit access and not the usual clicking of the account profile, it is somehow a different \"trick\" to get the user profile and account ID, although I do not see any importance to it, maybe others will find it amazing. Besides, each member has the right to create their own topic they want, so let us just respect that.¬† Whether someone will merit this kind of thread is up to them, giving merit as we all know is subjective.",

But xtraelv has created a summary about Bitcointalk's early discussion topics, as well. It's working in a similar way as you've explained for profile links, but for topic links, where we can also reserach about early topics.
