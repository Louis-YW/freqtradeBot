  "content": "Hello,As you may know, March 24 is the final verdict for SBF. He faces 115 years in prison, and the evidence against him is overwhelming. He has pleaded not guilty.His lawyers are asking for a lighter sentence, arguing that SBF won't survive in prison, he'd be more or less autistic and unable to defend himself. In his book 'Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon, published in October 2023 in the USA to coincide with the start of the trial), Michael Lewis claims that the funds did not really disappear and SBF is innocent.Have you lost funds on FTX and do you intend to recover them?",

But I think that the book exaggerates SBF's personality too much by saying that he always wanted to benefit people, while he did the opposite, and the benefit he received is only his benefit and profit. Whether he is autistic or not does not matter, many autistic people cope well with their situation, and by the way, it is autistic people love solitude, and in prison, no one can stop them from enjoying communication with themselves.",

This could just be because many countries are against death sentences, so pronouncing and sentencing someone for life won't make any sense in the ears of many, so they gave a 115-year sentence, which he will probably not be alive to finish. Adding to the fact that he should be around 30-35 years old before this, imagine how many years he will be by that time. It's obvious he is going there to spend the remaining time of his life.",

He has pleaded not guilty.If the evidence is irrefutable, then what does SBF’s pleading guilty matter? In any case, we should wait for the verdict to know for sure how all this will end.Quote from: Becassine on March 07, 2024, 10:07:00 AMHis lawyers are asking for a lighter sentence, arguing that SBF won't survive in prison, he'd be more or less autistic and unable to defend himself. This sounds like a very interesting way to justify himself and avoid punishment.

So, \"Where's the Money, Lebowski Michael Lewis?\"SBF’s guilt will be determined by the decision of the court, not the writer.Quote from: Becassine on March 07, 2024, 10:07:00 AMHave you lost funds on FTX and do you intend to recover them?Fortunately, I am not one of them, because the good old rule “Not your keys- Not your coins” has been familiar to me for a long time.",

If you wanted to really lie and deceive people in the first place, you'd already got the plan to steal the money of many people and of course it would be a part of your plan to lie to them and make them think that you're a legitimate one and that you're not going to run with their money, that's how many charlatans and thieves of the largest scale would do it though, they make you let your guard down by building trust and then in one fell swoop, your money's gone. People should've made some questions already when the talks of bitcoin giving out interests are being talked about, that would've made them uncomfortable and most likely some of those people would likely pick up on it when it was raised as a question but it seems that nobody did and they end up with their money being stolen, I guess the allure of profits from your bitcoin is just too strong that people didn't question the red flags.",

It is better if you have compensation but even so, it will still be a loss for you. You will not receive full amount of your capital stored on FTX exchange before the collapse.Don't store your coins on centralized exchanges to avoid similar collapses like FTX.

I've also heard this news, the compensation is really unfair for the victims but think positively, it's better for them to compensate a little than for everyone to lose everything. At least FTX did many times better than Mt.Gox, who only made promises and more than 10 years have passed but their victims are still waiting. I cannot deny that I am also using centralized exchanges but luckily I have never used FTX. But even if I used it, I wouldn't store too many of my assets on it. Centralized exchanges are not places to store crypto assets, they are just places to trade, and buy & sell when we need them.",
