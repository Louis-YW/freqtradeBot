But if we're talking about general usage, there should be better places out there even for no-mandatory kyc full fledged exchanges.",

There are some exchanges with reserve which they are still a bit reliable than ones with no reserve. You can check Defillama.com for exchanges with Merkel Tree or Reserve. Although, not all exchanges are updated there. Even some are with reserve but Defillama is yet to update them.",

It's been around for about 5 years.absolutely true! the endorser is not the determining factor whether the exchange is trustworthy or not. most of the time, these endorsers don't even know how to use the platform itself as their respective PAs are doing the work for them. the exchange itself is not new in the trading market. maybe, they already have their funds to pay for a popular name. but still, these people are not a guarantee that there won't be any issues that will arise from the platform. so don't get too confident with your funds and store in their platform.",

I remembered the motto: \"Don't Trust, Verify it\" which means you must verify yourself and make sure all think about where you invest the money. and, If we talk about general, no one you can trust if you don't own the private key.I just heard about Bitget today, and when I searched it, Bitget doesn't listed on my Ministry of Trade country, so I will avoid it.",

The only way is using decentralized exchange or P2P which act as an escrow.Maybe it's only on your country, but Bitget have 9 trust score in coingecko [1] so it's quite trusted enough to use this exchange if @OP doesn't matter about KYC.[1] https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitget",

This one seems ok to me.What do you think.When I come across of this exchange called Bitget it was last two years, they are not new but what you will say is that they are not more influential like any other exchange, And it may likely be that what's making them lack awareness is lack of advertisement, a worthy of exchange come from the experience people got from the platform by patterning with them. Forget a popular footballer messi promoting the exchange, its people who trade with Bitget will say how potential is the platform not a celebrity promoter, when binance started they were a lot of inducements that made the exchange to capture the mind of people, so they have a lot of strategic promotions methods to follow to make the exchange influential with a good reputation.",

Most of them need active registration plus an office in the country, so it is understandable that some big exchanges would rather 'ignore' it and just use a proxy to get customers from the local market (like Tokocrypto and Binance for example). Still, I've never heard anyone mention Bitget either, so their marketing is certainly lacking for some markets.

The only way is using decentralized exchange or P2P which act as an escrow.Other than making sure we visit the right address and judge whether a statement is wrong or not (which includes many things, such as marketing materials), I also think it is hard to 'verify' an exchange. A better term is probably to look for reviews from other members, or try it with a throwaway account if possible before you decide to use it as one of your main exchanges. It is impossible to remove trust completely, but at the very least we should be able to control our funds even if the platform we use went bust. I don't think an exchange fits that criterion though.",

I must say their customer support is very quick in responding and solving queries. I had a long conversation with them regarding some issue and they were responding everytime. You can trade with some amount in this exchange, especially their native token, which is quite volatile  They are not upto the mark for P2P trading yet (atleast for me). Still using binance for p2p.However, I never go all in on any exchange, always diversify to be SAFU.I suggest you to move this thread to \"exchanges\" board.",
