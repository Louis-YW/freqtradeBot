Ranking up? Getting merits? No user should be fixated on these metrics. How about just enjoying discussions and actually leaning a thing or two from the contributions of other members? That does not seem overwhelming at all, or something you need to take some days to calm down from, and it actually benefits more that merit hunting.Quote from: Israelgogo on May 31, 2022, 01:48:57 PMAlong the way you will be faced with alot of challenges, criticism, disagreement remember no man is an island,everyone has an opinion ,keep your head up and keep doing what you know how to do best ,put in your best.The sky is wide enough, somedat your effort will be rewarded.Disagreement is not a challenge.Filter information you get, pick out useful corrections and discard the rest. Also, grow a thick skin along the way.P.S, best to edit your second reply into the OP, rather than creating a quote down. Consecutive replies are against forum rules.",

Not really, if you visit altcoins section you will see there are many high ranked accounts that never earn single merit, before merit system was implemented on 2018 you can spam to gain activity in order to rank up. Don't judge the accounts if they're legendary then he's better than hero and so on, even a newbie can be better than legendary user that got merit airdropped by @theymos.",

More so, your post history shows that you are a beginner that clearly needs help and guidance. This is the Beginner & Help section.

It's like someone is forced to join this forum and be active here or like its some sort of a job and you need encouragement. Its just a forum, where people come to ask questions or talk with like minded people. But since this is the only forum I know of where you can actually make decent amount of money it evolved into this ridiculous thing that you can't find anywhere else. Seriously, if you go to any other forum and open a topic like this you would get seriously ridiculed while here you often get merit. Not in this case, but if OP was more eloquent I have no doubts that he would scoop at least a few and as long these type of topics get merited, people will keep creating them.",

This is an honest advice given to yourself. You should have titled your post as \"Self Advice\". I don't know why you craftily changed the title to be Newbies. You are no longer a newbie no doubt but at same time you are not far from Newbies. By categories still belong to the newbie category. If you can honestly heard to your advice, it will be a wise decision.

Well, I had this idea of seeing this place as an academic institution where you will try hard in order not to waste your school fees. Well, after reading Welsh comment about this place, I understand that here is a forum and nothing but a forum. You can give up on this forum but don't give up on bitcoin. No hard feelings.",

Sometimes it is so easy to see what is the intention of their threads which mostly focused on merits because then only they can able to rank up and participate in campaigns, I didn't say this to every newbie who are trying to learn something new with legitimate query but most people try to make guides which is not that exceptional bit expecting merits.",

The way we view things change as we age on. Certain things that were issues of excitement hardly move me this day, and I believe it's the same way with many here.

But about the top ranked members of the past seeing \"the need to put in more effort and more work\" isn't entirely true. Pre–2018, ranking up on this forum wasn't much an issue. All everyone needed do was just post and activity count is generated for rank up.

Ranking up and merits are just bonus blessings. Even if you have constructed a very long high quality thread, you can’t please everybody. Don’t expect that you will be receiving a lot of merits for the topics that you have posted here. Instead of having a mindset in posting a lot of topics and replies just for the sake of ranking up and earning merits, just simply contribute with passion and without expecting anything in return. For sure, unexpected blessings will come along your way later on.",
