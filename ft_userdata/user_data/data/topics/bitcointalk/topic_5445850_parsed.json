  "content": "So I currently have 5,500 NXRA tokens for anyone who doesn’t know this is the token which has replaced the original Alliance Block (ALBT) after it was hacked last month. I totally forgot about these 5,500 tokens to be honest having only just claimed them today and I see I am almost 2x on my investment. Just wondering if anyone else holds this token or knows anything about it? Not sure if I should just hold the 5,500 I have (currently worth £404.00) and forget about it till next bull run or just put it all into a safer asset incase it goes to zero for good.",
