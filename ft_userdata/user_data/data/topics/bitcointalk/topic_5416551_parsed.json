  "content": "inspired by recent events,  about this apparently there is still a gap in this vulnerability, is there a red light or is it purely from something that is not controlled?I once thought could we report to a giant agency?maybe  this service  or its specialist at  this service  ?come on friends, those who are victims will feel deterred from the hacks and hacks that have been experienced, some may be beginners. I realize crypto is a high risk but not with robbery incidents like this.I once lost 800 token cake and it was equivalent to $20,000.In conclusion, no one is forcing you to invest in crypto, but I thought what if other newbies also experienced a similar incident?imagine if a country does not have a place of refuge, this is not a matter of who wants to live, without rules, or die silly.as well as investments and crypto money, what do you think?",

I hereby reinforce my own reasons for only investing long term in bitcoin. many altcoins are, in fact, centralized. even if they say it's not centered. and the Hack incident that just happened to BNB really made some people doubt about BNB. but myself if it is for short term then no problem. and other beginners I think will think the same.",

I underlined that regarding the legal umbrella there is no shade for crypto and that in my opinion is not the reason we are not voicing our future efforts, have you ever thought that every crypto transaction may have its application with taxes and administration, in some countries? I think if the state participates in making regulations, there is nothing wrong with providing protection for traffic, including security from criminals, right?",
