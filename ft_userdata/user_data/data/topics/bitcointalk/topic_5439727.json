After all, the US Dollar is the reserve currency of the world. While BTC and altcoins are a new kind of asset class, they rely on the mainstream economy to survive. People usually tie BTC's market price to existing Fiat currencies (mainly the USD). The US Dollar will no longer be the world's reserve currency after the US defaults, so I wonder what will hapoen with BTC's market price after that? Will it rise like skyrocket? Or will it fall for good? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

For the record, the US has never defaulted since over 2 millennia ago, they can't now when it's in the hands of capable hands and better technology and economic exposure.Your post might have been borne out of the pegging on the debt permissible by the Federal Treasury, which is a debatable issue and could be readjusted if need be. Mind you, if the US defaults today, which currency would fit in perfectly as stable as it is? Do you think the world would even think of Bitcoin as an alternative? If you think so, then you are joking. Another fiat will be a viable choice, but none can still fit the show of the USD, for now, so the USD will still be preferred.Even with the US default, it will have a temporary effect on the USD because they will measure it up with a fix as soon as possible, and the effect on BTC (positive or negative) will be minimal.",

If this happens, Bitcoin is the last thing to worry about because this means that the Third World War has come and the victor will change the current features of the world.US defaults does not necessarily mean an increase in the price of Bitcoin, but rather the failure of the current central systems.",

Yes, there is a lot of speculation, but that's all there is to it. That's why many believe in bitcoin even though in the eyes of the majority it is impossible.",

First, we will congratulate each other for living at least 100 years because I was in middleschool when the US was supposed to default and it's most likely my kid will finish college without it happening.Second, nobody is going to give a damn about the bitcoin price anymore, with all markets collapsing, trade going bust and countries switching from 3rd world to sixth world economies, there will be nothing left to invest in Bitcoin anymore, you can see the effects right now in the markets, inflation war and fears of recessions have pushed the price down not up, it's optimism that has fueled the last bull run which seems to come to a halt, so if by a miracle the US defaults bitcoin will be the last of the world worry and for sure not something people will rush the trillions that are no longer there into.This would be a clear example of: be careful what you wish for!",

This has been talked about a million times already, and that is why I believe that we shouldn't really be wondering what to do, because we don't need to do anything or the price of bitcoin won't be affected or anything like that because it won't happen.I know house has mainly republicans who will want to keep it as it is and not increase the ceiling, but enough protests from people will see them fix that too. I think the best thing about the current situation is that there are too many people who are wondering what to do and I think that is why it's such a good thing that we should be buying and taking advantage of the situation.",

But will they? Was the question I suppose, if not then I do not know what OP is talking about.There are politicians who says they should default the debt and face the reality, or even if not default, at least do not make more and just focus on the ones they have for a while until they are paid off, and I agree that it would be good to pay off debts, but they make enough profit to pay the last ones and make new ones so they won't bother with it.",

That means there is this possibility that bitcoin price could reach levels that we can not imagine now.I could imagine how easy it is to raise the debt ceiling when the whole world depends on the US Dollar as its reserve currency. This may be more of a drama than anything else. It's likely the US will never default during our lifetimes, especially when most countries depend on the US Dollar. The de-Dollarization process would be a slow and steady one to say the least. You can bet Bitcoin will rise astronomically in price if the USD weakens by a large margin. But when this happens, the world would probably be using another currency (Euro, perhaps?) as its reserve currency. American decline is happening before our very eyes, so it should only be a matter of time before the US is no longer a superpower. Let's see how Bitcoin will hold off in the long run.

Print money to save the economy during the pandemic, and now it's time to export inflation and withdraw USD. I still haven't thought of the prospect of them falling, as long as something threatens their position as a great power, they will find a way to destroy it. It can be said that it is very unlikely that the US government will default or the US dollar will collapse.If the US falls, there will be another great power to take its place, and that will be another centralized currency, not bitcoin.
