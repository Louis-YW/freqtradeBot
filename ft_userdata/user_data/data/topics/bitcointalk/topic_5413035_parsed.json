It is not as simple as web3 vs blockchain, sometimes event blockchain is claimed to be part of web3.0 itself. Event the definition is sometimes being contested.",

Web 2.0 is basically the web type of application that is currently in use today as we interact with the internet while Web 3.0 represents its next phase, which will be decentralized, open, and of greater utility. However, Web 2.0 have numerous short comings that have posed some challenges in recent times. Web 2.0 facilitates posting of too much information on the web. There is also security issues such as unauthorized use of people's data, etc. It is expected that web 3.0 will overcome most problems of web 2.0.

How about https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?Is web3 vs Blockchain?Thank you.I think you just misunderstood Web 3. Look, web3 does not mean a website or a crypto project. Web 3 is the next version of the internet or web. That means it is a protocol on which other websites or projects can be built. But it does not mean this is the real Web3 or a fake Web 3. Remember, web3 is not a website, it is just a concept. Now, anything built, such as social media, gaming, or crypto projects that claim to be web 3, is considered web 3. That means they just build their projects on the concept of Web3, which is decentralized. And the concept is decentralized. The decentralized concept is based on blockchain, so it's not about web3 vs blockchain. Web 3 is yet another blockchain concept. I hope you understand. Thank you.",

And where there is a hype, there are always plenty of scammers who want to get rich quick. It's always been like that, as soon as some technology appeared, there was always a wave of scams around it. Web3 has a development perspective, so this crypto-trend is definitely worth watching, but at the same time, more carefully check the projects that are trying to integrate this technology into their projects. Very often it happens that it is done only to attract money to the project and nothing else.",

I am even building a web app as of writing this and I was like curious to how would this change my whole web dev career. Turns out this would be more about decentralization along with machine learning, and considering that one of my favorite language, Python, can be used in machine learning and AIs, this is one of the changes that I could not yet imagine how would it directly impact the whole internet.Considering how surely most of us use Google to find and research stuffs, bots and machine learning would surely enhance this whole experience.tldr: It's not a scam nor a project that you would invest at.My resource: Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 Definitions",

Scammers are everywhere, what ever the project is they can imitate it and make it look more convincing so if you see a project like that, it’s good to have more analysis on that before investing. Web3 might be the next trend, this is why scammers are already preparing for this and I’m sure many already have plans for this especially on how they can scam people again.",

Sure, there are various different projects in nft that fail either because of incompetence, or because they are scams. But that doesn't make erc721 or ERC-1155 scams. They are just protocols that can be used as any other good tool, for making scams or making a difference.It's like asking that is web2 a scam. Sure, there has been many scams in web2.0 but it's a tool just like web3.0",

Web3 is like other trends in the market that you come across like ICO, P2E most recently metaverse which is often mentioned along with web3. The project you mentioned is a project built on web3 trends, it does not represent the entire web3 field, so if it is a scam project, it will not affect web3 technology.Web 3 is most likely the next trend in the market to replace the old ones, and if my prediction is correct then the hype about web3 in the upcoming bull season is a good opportunity for us to make money. Prepare your web3 knowledge carefully and find yourself potential web3 projects to make money together in the next bull season.",

If Youtube deletes your video you can't do anything, you just complain about that. But in web 3.0 all users will be owners of his/her video, post, account or any other thing.
