Before I proceed this post is likely to be an accusation so therefore it does not belong here and should be moved to scams and accusations board (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0) so it could be effectively looked into but come to talk of it,  PayPal is not a Crypto or gambling organization so how do you want the bitcointalk platform to intervene on your behalf? You also made accusations against PayPal without any factual evidence as these you posted here are just mere write-up with no proof to back your claims. I would advise you to register a copper member so you can be able to upload pictures as proof and for sight seeing. Atleast from all I have said, you can be able to know what to do.",

This is strange because i work with PayPal now for about 7y and i did not have any problem. I saved all necessary information and provide them when they need it to verify my identity.Contact support - yes they are slow but they can fix your problem.",

You don't have data to say that, unfortunately, Paypal cannot address your issue here as they do not have an announcement, you should not even post your issue here because they are not a full Cryptocurrency platform, better post your concern and issue here https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Community/ct-p/en you'll get the right response here coming from users of Paypal and you can also ask their support Quoteand all the blocked account with money (hundrends, thousands, ten of thousands etc)  are used for real esate investment.  what you think that they just keep the money on the account? never.

These are all allegations to prove it we need the fact by uploading your screenshots and pieces of evidence, you just want to get back to Paypal from limiting your account, in the first place you should have read their terms of service and other feedbacks before using Paypal because they are so strict and they ask a lot of verification before you can use their service.When using Paypal be aware of how they work and how hey limit their users' accounts.",

Also FTX bankruptcy was done due to their over collateral in their own token FTT.FTX was indeed hacked but it wasn't the reason why it went bankrupt. It went bankrupt because Sam Bankman-Fried stole the money. The mysterious hack took place after it filed for bankruptcy. So it is unfair and extremely absurd to seem to excuse FTX from its collapse because it got hacked. In the first place, it got bankrupt because of sheer incompetence and irresponsibility. OP, is there no way you could retrieve your card details? Is it that hard to communicate with the issuer and ask for those?",

I am not a supporter of PayPal because of its arbitrary conditions and because of its excessive security methods that make it difficult for any customer to access his account. The best online payments companies are Pioneer, Skrill, and Regpack I use them smoothly and I have not had any problems since years of using them, unlike Paypal.Paypal has customer service, and he can try to ask them for a verification method other than this, but I think that without knowing his card details, I will see that he lost the account completely, but he can try his luck.",
