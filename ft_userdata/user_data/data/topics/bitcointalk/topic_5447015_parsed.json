Because if you're really into that business you would do something that will help for your business to boom. If its no progress then it would be consider as a hobby. However, there's a scenario where some businesses are not meant for you, therefore you can connect your hobbies to your business for example, you really like collecting shoes and you've decided to resell as a business. Then it would be easier for you to have an idea on how to run your businesses since you have a good background on how to handle shoes.",

      "body": "According to experts the average period for a business to start yielding profit is 2 to 3years. But it all depends on the kind of business. A small scale business can be profitable in short time span because of the low start up cost whereas a larger would take time before it begins to yield profits. Competition from other businesses marketing similar products could hinder the person growths and at such the business might have to do away with profit first and build the brand. Before considering a business to be unprofitable one most have to look at the potential of his products. Say Electric motors, they have been in the market for long but since the world hasn’t evolved fully to that area and still live in fossil fuel then this kind of business can be given future benefits of doubt. But for business in which people are moving away from its maybe because they seem traditional and the profit isn’t coming anymore then such business should be stopped. Moreover if one has a business and it is in Tenth year or more and there’s no sign of profit and people aren’t looking to move towards that business probably due to government restrictions or policies then it is best to work away from such business",

For example, in times of holidays it is easy to sell sweets, decorative tools, etc. If you fail to achieve profits that cover your losses during two market cycles, it is better to think carefully about what project you are undertaking.The market cycle varies from one person to another and from one country to another, some of which are several times a year, some annually, and others every several years. Therefore, according to those cycles, you will determine whether you will continue or not.",

A few years ago, I tried to open a business with that amount as its capital, after a few months of processing the papers and attending meetings where sometimes politics are involved in a local place, I gave up before it even started.So maybe a big capital like those rich people are starting, they just cannot simply give it up and lose all the investment. But for smaller businesses, 3 years is just way too long to suffer and the capital loss is a bit tolerable.",

Starting a business need those in order to succeed, and you need to continuously adapt into your environment, because if not, you're probably gonna lose your profits and will end up shutting down your business. You also need to know what's wrong with your business, you don't need to shut it down after a year of being unprofitable, you just need to think that there's something wrong. But if you think there's nothing wrong with your business, just shut it down because it won't work that way. Also think if you're suited for starting any business first, because it might not be your field of expertise.",

It all depends on the real reasons for the unprofitability of the business, and a real assessment of the prospects.A business can be really \"calculated\" incorrectly, all the nuances, market conditions, purchasing power, etc. are not taken into account. Here it is necessary to make a willful decision, and simply close the business, or sell it to someone. Maybe - the business is really good, but its time has not yet come. Then - \"freeze\" and wait for \"your time\".There may be a situation when the business is good, and \"for its time\", but the situation in your country is not the most suitable - for example, as in my country - an external terrorist large-scale aggression of a neighboring country, as a result of which many were forced to either close the business, or sell it or just lose it...In this situation, business migration to more comfortable conditions (city/region/country) is possible.And to sit and wait is only to increase your costs ....",

Usually, someone starting a business will evaluate his business in the first 3 months and check which ones need improvement so he can think about continuing his business, increasing his capital, or even stopping business. During the first 3 to 6 months or the first 1 year, he should understand how his business develops and think about what to do. And before the business is not running at all or even unprofitable, he can close it to avoid losses that could be even greater if he continues. The biggest loss is usually the daily operational costs, so the business cannot generate the profit it wants.If, in the first year, he can see the development of his business, he can add capital to spread his business and develop it to be bigger so that the profits are also increasing. But if during that 1 year, he suffered more losses and didn't make any significant changes after the first 6 months, he could think about closing his business.",

Some businesses need more than 3 years to become profitable. Profit-making might not be the only indicator that a business is doing well. It takes a long time for businesses to outsmart competitors and grab more market share. So if you observe that your business is gradually and consistently controlling more markets, it's not a good time to quit because in a few years, profit will start flowing in. A business could also serve as a foundation for a future enterprise. I can start a rubber plantation because I want to invest in plastic household materials in the future. So even when I am not making any gain from my rubber business,  I might make my profit when I establish my future plastic industry. We understand that different type of businesses has their maturity stage.",

Personally, I will start the business related to book publishing if I have the money.

For example, if it is a fairly low cost exercise and the owner is the son of some rich millionaire, then they might be able to keep it going - just under making a profit each year out of sheer perseverance or having it as a sort of side project.  However if you are an owner that relies on it to make an income in order to pay your personal bills, then you have a much shorter runway to use. You should be able to tell within the first couple years whether it has a long term future, because you can see peaks and troughs in that time. However Amazon went for a long time as an \"unprofitable\" business as it sought to claim market share and is now one of the biggest companies in the world.",
