Do they just talk big or can they really make a difference in the industry? Share your thoughts and let's get this discussion going!Memecoin e.g. dogecoin is created without any developmental plans to use for the long term but just for hype let me explain further.

But Ultimately meme coins are just gambled and for short-term speculations, since there is no mechanism to propel further development or an ecosystem where their fit in.",

Unfortunately most people are laggards & only buy once a viral, social media craze starts. By that point itâ€™s usually too late.Just be careful out there.",
