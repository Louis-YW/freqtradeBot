Welcome!I am not a fan of ledger hardware wallet at all, but you could add their products on your website since they are (sadly) one of the most popular hardware wallets in the world.If you want to add more expensive quality device than I would suggest adding Passport wallet by Foundation, and Keystone hardware wallet.There are more devices available but I don't think there are so much demand for them.",

We've always thought the Ellipal Titan and Keystone wallets were pretty similar in many ways, just at slightly different price points.We'll look into this though",

Interestingly, Ellipal appeals more to those who are quite new to self-custody, perhaps it's all in the marketing. Either way, we'll definitely be adding Keystone wallets to the store soon.",

Appreciate the honest feedback!Currently, it works out much cheaper ordering from us rather than going through the manufacturer. We offer free delivery on all UK orders, there are no import fees or additional taxes and you'll get your order much quicker too!We can certainly appreciate that customers may want to maintain their anonymity when ordering from us, at the moment, we don't have any easy solution for this. However, there's no reason why a customer couldn't place an order under a different name or enter the delivery address to a safe storage unit to avoid sharing any sensitive personal info. Perhaps, offering a collection service or delivery to local collection points could be a solution for this? Alternatively, we could permanently delete customer information a short period after they've placed an order.",

How would you process if a customer has an issue with their order too? Deleting after 7 days or a month can be a good idea, but again we won't be able to verify it. Even if we use an anonymous PO BOX to receive the order, you or somebody still has the records.While trust is unavoidable if someone needs to use your service, perhaps you can think to solve this issue. If there is no reliable method to verify, personally I would not use your service even if I have to pay more to buy directly from Ledger/Trezor, etc. Adding another data point that can be exploited by malicious parties is a terrible privacy practice imo.",

Your service definitely makes sense for the domestic market, but I don't see how foreign customers would benefit from buying from you, if it means more expensive shipping costs, possible customs costs and additional VAT. Again, on the other hand, I may be too focused on manufacturers from the EU, and if we were to compare the devices that are manufactured and delivered from the US, maybe it would be cheaper or at least faster for those in the EU to order such a device from you. Perhaps you could show with a few examples how much these costs differ, of course if it works in your favor.",

If we were to automatically delete personal information (or atleast blank certain details; name, address etc.) after a month of an order being placed, then a simple data request from the customer would verify this. I can certainly understand your view on this, however, I think it's worth remembering that larger organisations (or manufacturers in this case) are far more susceptible to data breaches given that they have many more possible points of failure. In any case, we're not expecting our service to be the perfect solution for everyone. However, we do believe it's an important step towards increasing access to the tools and education needed for safe self-custody practices.Quote from: Lillominato89 on March 13, 2023, 08:26:17 AMQuote from: cryptonestuk on March 10, 2023, 05:27:53 PM We're keen to get some feedback from you guys, what do you think of our current product range? what products/brands would you like to see us stock? and most importantly, what can we do to help make self-custody more acessible for newbies?

If reseller businesses weren't an effective (or safe) solution then why would all manufacturers offer and encourage the use of resellers? the answer is simple, it's a more cost-effective solution for many of their potential customers.The way we see it is people generally want three things when they purchase any product online: 1. They want the product at the lowest price2. They want a convenient solution to buying the product3. They want it ASAP+ In relation to Crypto hardware, people want genuine products.In our opinion we provide an effective solution to each of those different aspects. A convenient one-stop-shop for all the latest hardware. Free UK delivery, next-day delivery, genuine products and a team of people ready to help on-board new users to the world of self-custody.",

Thank you so much for the reply, and also thank you for explaining to me what happens behind the scenes of an import&export company, not being a trader, I don't know the dynamics that lie behind the work of companies like yours, so now whoever reads this thread will know ! I also ask, do you work only for the United Kingdom or do you also ship abroad and to Europe?No problem at all! We're based in the UK, so that is our key demographic. However, we ship orders globally to over 200+ countries with fully tracked/insured delivery through Royal Mail.ok perfect, so if one day I want to buy a hardware wallet from you, I know that you also ship abroad with tracking and insurance! this is a point in your favor I would say. instead on the prices of the various devices do you align yourself with the prices of the official manufacturer? Let me explain, I took a look at your catalog and I take Ellipal titan mini into consideration, on the retailer's shop it is currently on offer at $79.99 for the company's 5th anniversary, while you sell it for £84.99 which at the exchange rate in dollars are $102.93, the difference is great especially if the shipping costs must be added as well, the cost rises again, so I ask if you align yourself with the manufacturer's prices. Thank you",

Take a look at the store here: https://cryptonest.co.ukAny thoughts are welcome Hi, I took a look at your site and I must say that it is well done, but there are a lot of devices missing, such as ledgers, onekeys, keepkeys, etc., to have a wide range of possible buyers, I think you should include them in your catalogue. But now the question arises, why should a user X come to you to buy when he can do it directly from the manufacturer's website? many people including me think it's safer to buy directly from the manufacturer but it would still be interesting to know your opinion on the matter, thanksThanks for the feedback  Yes, we certainly have a long way to go in terms of adding all the products/brands we want to work with. We plan to add all of the products you mentioned and more in the coming months.Personally, I think there are some misconceptions when it comes to where to buy hardware wallets and other Crypto related products from. It's well-understood that buying used (or new, but opened) hardware wallets is a BIG no. Buying a product such as this comes with all manor of risks, unfortunately, it it only those who are new to the space that would be susceptible here. Buying from an official reseller (like ourselves), these are usually country specific organisations that aim to bridge current gaps in accessing products at affordable prices in their country. Resellers work closely with manufacturers, allowing them to supply genuine products directly from the manufacturer without long delivery times/additional taxes. All of the products we sell are brand new, un-opened and remain in their sealed packaging just as they left the factory. Buying directly from the manufacturer, whilst deemed to be the most secure, manufacturers often rely on fulfillment services to complete the delivery of items, these fulfillment companies may be working exclusively with the manufacturer or they may work with multiple brands in different industries. Either way this introduces new risks into the supply chain.

Thank youSure, we try to closely match the Recommended Retail Price set by the manufacturer. In many cases, our products will be priced below the manufacturer, however, in the case of the Titan Mini we also price in the shipping costs (Ellipal is based in Hong Kong) so it's worth bearing this in mind. As for the current discount on the Ellipal website, this would be exclusively for them - we aren't able to match this.",

We have a 30-day return policy in place whereby customers can return items for a full refund.The only clause is that the item must not be used or taken out of its sealed outer packaging. As long as the item is still in it's sealed packaging when it's returned to us and there are no signs of tampering then the product will be taken back into stock.For cases of defective or damaged products we still offer the refund under the condition that the fault is readily apparent when we receive the item back.",
