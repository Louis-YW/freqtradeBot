      "body": "I'm a bit of zero technical knowledge but for the puzzle 66 how often do we find public keys from made public? I guess not regular or rare. No matter how hard the vulnerability seems before that time that you speculate that attack will take over the bitcoin devs will surely find a solution around it. I believe since this vulnerability or puzzle 66 attack has been made known solutions are already on their way or maybe someone is working on it to fix it, so pubkeys in the mempool wouldn't get attacked and redirected to a different wallet.",

Integer addition is instant, O(1). Did you mean elliptic curve point addition, perhaps? Edit: For fixed-width integers (e.g., 32-bit, 64-bit), it's O(1). For arbitrary-precision, it's O(n) (with n being the number of multiples of the fixed width integers, i.e. adding fixed-width n times). It's still fast, though.

You can't memorize the addition of 8173 with 2509, let alone with larger numbers. That's why you write it down, and then operate mechanically the step-by-step algorithm for column addition (starting from the rightmost column), as you've learned in elementary school, which has a time complexity of O(n). Computers on the other hand, handle addition differently. When you give a computer a number, it reads it in a fixed-size set of bits. For example, 8173 and 2509 in 32-bit will be expressed as:Code:0000000000000000000111111110110100000000000000000000100111001101The addition here is done bit-by-bit, starting from the rightmost, with the following conditions:If both bits added are '0', final bit is '0'.If one bit is '1' and the other is '0', final bit is '1'.If both bits are '1', final bit is '0' and we keep a carry ('1') for the next addition.Code:0000000000000000000111111110110100000000000000000000100111001101+00000000000000000010100110111010This way, regardless the digits of your number, if it can be represented with 32 or 64 bits, addition finishes in O(1) time complexity, in contrast with humans' algorithm, where time complexity increases linearly as the digits increase.",
