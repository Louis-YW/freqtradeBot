Absolutely! Both BTC and ETH play is planned and will be implemented. For the rest of this month, we are doing beta testing with PTKN (playmoney token), after that we are enabling the possibility to play with crypto.Quote from: Bitinity on February 12, 2023, 05:02:11 AM   I also thought that it is a thread about me.

First I thought it's the first character but then figured it's the 4th additional character on Bitinity. You two consider partnering in the project. It's a mini project from what I see. Good idea. Start small and then if the water taste good then start a real casino. Make sure you have limits in place so that big guys don't exploit it and make your bankroll empty.As suggested by other users, why not create a nice graphic for the ANN thread instead of the only banner at the top. You have the copper membership in place which is great.Cheers,",

So it is better if this thread is moved to Service Announcement (Altcoins) and they may come back to this gambling board once they accept bitcoin. With a username like that, it's a guaranteed rep job for you at this casino.   The casino is a direct competitor of some revenue-sharing casinos like Betfury and seems like it's an early opportunity for some investors since BTNTY is just $0.005. They however are not listed anywhere but Uni. This is the ANN thread so I wonder how large is the community though. Welcome to Bitcointalk!",

Does each PTKN worth $1 or do you just have to set this for any other reason? I'm a bit confused about it when you said the PTKN value is set. I am confused too.Could Bitnity team share a link to PTKN token on Coinmarketcap or Coingecko and its smart contract address, please?If $PTKN token is like a liquidity provider token and is backed by stable coin like USDT or BUSD, it is reasonable to set its value to $1. However I am still not sure what $PTKN token is.The $BTNTY (Bitnity token) is on Coinmarketcap and its price is about $0.006 with low trading volume but it's not too bad actually with about $10k to $20k daily trading volume.Coinmarketcap: ListedCoingecko: The token has yet fully listed on Coingecko but with searching, they have a link to GeckoTerminal. The team should list it on Coingecko officially too.It's great to see the token will be dual chain: ERC20 first and BEP20 later in August 2023.At Bitnity landing page, I found only Terms of Service but it looks too short and simple. Are your team surely write necessary terms for it?I suggest the team to create another page, FAQs as a short version of Terms of Service and with most common questions and answers for convenience of guests and users.If your casino wants to run signature campaign, I am available but of course, you can explore more campaign managers from [Overview] Bitcointalk Services from Bitcointalk Members.Please DM me if you want to get details of my offer.",

You are fast ahead and that shows how reliable and updated you are coupled together with your marketing skills which you have already upgraded your account to copper member inline with the forum policy for new projects so as to meet up with the community standard. I assume you are the sole representative of your project here. I will advise you to be regular and active here so as to respond to enquiry and possible website review by members because this would help you build more futures on your project as it will help in attracting traffic to your website.I had to go through your website and I discovered that %70 of your profit will be shared amongst your investors and stake holders \"House profits are shared amongst stakeholders and bankroll investors.Each month, 70% of the platform's profits are distributed among $BTNTY token stakers.\"Is it not too much of a profit to be shared amongst them?If you can share such percentage then how much would be for game winners. Do you not think that there would be financial lapses in the future? I think you should review that aspect of it or do you want to rob Peter and pay Paul? Do not miss quote me please but I have to say this as a result of compliant and scam accusations that has been going on here linking to ban and suspension of account all pointing to winning and failure to allow winners make withdrawal..Lastly, since you are new here I would also advise you to seek the expertise of a campaign manager as stated by one of the posters here to help you in campaign by advertising and marketing your project here for popularity and reputation of the manager would attract more potential members for you.",
