Either that or the bot you're using must be open-source.Now if you're talking about other kinds of bots (crypto news, prices, whale alerts..) then sure, some of them are quite useful and don't really require anything but launching the bot.",

I tend to ask myself if the trend about telegram bots are just because of the pump we've seen on Unibot and other tokens are really organic or if people really use it, because if you interact with these bots you'd doubt it yourself if they're actually working or it's just the hype on the CT that drives it.

It is safe if you guarantee that the Telegram application is safe and that the bot is open. The source or one with a high rating to trust it, you can restrict the withdrawal permission so that it is not available through the API, but your account can be abused by purchasing dump coins.Telegram bots are bad in terms of privacy and data, as your data is shared between several parties, and they are bad for anyone who wants to enhance their privacy. I advise you not to use it for trading due to the difficulty of finding a highly efficient open source bot, but it can be used for crypto news and whale alerts.",

There could be some legit but you'll be having hard time to find them.It's not really worth trusting unknown source unless you're able to check them if they're clean or not. Just as said about the validity of its source, you can take a test. Maybe if you're keen in trying them like you've found some random bots out there that has various features, don't use your main device (pc/laptop) on it.",

And secondly, to be proficient in using it and dealing with its various functions in a way that facilitates the trading process and not to overlook the completion of operations manually.I do not know if these bots on Telegram are able to work on all platforms, but I do not always prefer to use these tools with accounts that have private data and savings.",

Maybe the strategy that the trading bot is using is not updated anymore? Because as we can see it is working against the market. Or it was simply a poor strategy that are injected to it? Well, majority of them are like that especially if it's only a free one but if it's a paid one, be sure to check for feedbacks first before availing or better if they can offer some kind of a free trial to see if it's worth the money.There must be a trading bot that we can program on our own or we can insert a strategy on it. You better choose a trading bot like that if you think your strategy is good enough and if you want to make trading a passive activity because trading bots are the ones that will trade for your 24/7.",

And even if the effectiveness of the bot is proven through user evaluations, this does not guarantee their integrity in the long run. What concerns me most is the data that developers can access through this bot, which cannot always be verified if the source is closed.I've come across many bots since I've been here on the forum, and I don't remember any of them still working today. The most important example is GunBot, which was promoted by some honest members on Bitcointalk, and which I have not heard any complaints about, but I have not heard anything about it for a long time, and I do not know if it is still working.ANN thread: [GUNBOT] Trading Bot with 136 exchanges available!!!Discussion: Gunbot reviews",
