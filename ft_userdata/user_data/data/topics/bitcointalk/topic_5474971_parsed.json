  "content": "Bittrex shutting down: What can exchanges do differently to avert this trend.Exactly one year ago since the unfortunate collapsed of FTX, Bittrex has also announced the closure of its services after nearly a decade of operation effective December 4th 2023.The reason for the closure has not been made public as of this time but it's worthy to note that the exchange U.S arm of operation filed for bankruptcy in May following a legal indictment by the security and exchange commission (SEC) for operating a security exchange without the right approval but one good news is that users assets/funds are safe and are available for withdrawal as disclosed by the exchange official X platform. A different scenario compared to that of FTX.This news further posses that there are still significant risk accompanied by this evolving industry but the question is what can exchanges do to ensure that they are able to stand the test of time just like the traditional financial institution.There are quite a few other exchanges that has proven to be reliable and dependable on the long run because they have been investing heavily in there ecosystem but this kind of news leaves one to wonder if such scenario won't later occur in future.In the wake of Bittrex users seeking another exchanges, which exchange do you recommend? and do you think they have what it takes to stand the test of time.",

If you're a US customer maybe P2P is a good alternative if what you need is just a simple buy and trade, or wait for a while before choosing any new exchange since it doesn't seem like SEC is going to stop soon. There is a high chance they will sue every exchange before even giving a clear guideline on how to register etc. CMIIW.",

I believe it is not their reason to take down centralized exchanges, peer to peer marketplaces in their country like Paxful.I like the hearing of Garry Gensler in the US. Congress earlier this year, one of Senator told that those recent legal actions of SEC against cryptocurrency companies are to force them moving from the USA. and migrate to other nations.QuoteThe Recent news is Binance founder Changpeng Zhao agrees to step down and plead guilty to violating criminal US anti-money laundering requirements.

I thought maybe I was the only one who noticed, but it's not; someone else also noticed what I saw in the exchange. Like you, my account was also closed after a few months or a year before I opened it again, but when I tried to open it again after many months, I couldn't open it.Even in other exchanges similar to the system Bittrex uses, if you become inactive for 6 months, your account will also be frozen.

We can see a lot going round about Binance. Even though this might reduce their market share, users still have some level of confidence because they have verifiable proof of reserve and customer protection fund. Aside Binance, the 2nd and perhaps the only exchange with customer protection fund and verifiable proof of reserve that has their wallet address public is Bitget.

Before a golden time of Bittrex, it was a time of Poloniex but those exchanges both had shady things in operations and very bad infrastructures to run their platforms smoothly with explosion of cryptocurrency market in 2017. Then Binance stepped in and took over leading positions from Bittrex and Poloniex. Now, it's a time for Binance to go down.Do anyone forget that how Binance security and audit team internally failed to detect massive deposit of Do Kwon after he minted massive LUNA tokens (now LUNC) and dumped it on Binance to kill many LUNA holders. Not sure a big exchange like Binance let it happened and if they did not agree something with Do Kwon for this, their internal teams actually had dead holes that were exploited by Do Kwon.",
