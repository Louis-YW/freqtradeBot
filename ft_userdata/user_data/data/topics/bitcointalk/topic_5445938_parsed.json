In my opinion, it's better to take bitcoin, ethereum, BNB coins that are certain and have a small risk, not too big like shitcoin baby doge",

I decided to invest my last cash at hand on luno, Eth, buying babe doggy, peg token and tron.Do you assume altcoins are more predictable than Bitcoin?Â  It is strange that you buy altcoins that have more volatile than Bitcoin. Altcoins are riskier because no clear future, especially those meme coins. I'm surprised that you bought babe doggy and peg token.Quote from: Godlovesyou on March 22, 2023, 04:43:39 PMWhat future do we really hope for altcoins without bitcoin?No one really knows it. But I assume there is a chance for altcoins to survive without Bitcoin. However, it is unlikely to happen that we have no Bitcoin in the future. Since Bitcoin is the main crypto coin, I think Bitcoin will always survive in crypto space.",

      "body": "Risk is part of cryptocurrency, so unlike your willingness you're taking risk. Whether it is altcoins or bitcoin doesn't matter. With bitcoin the risk is low whereas with bitcoin the risk is high. Most of the people prefer to take big risk, because it have got the ability to give better profit.It is possible to see good number of people lucky to make big money out of altcoins that weren't known to the community. For some reason investment were made and the same coin reaches the peak in short time period giving good return on the investment. This way the selection of altcoins for investment is a big process than just investing on bitcoin and staying on the safer side.",

What future do we really hope for altcoins without bitcoin?And now it's not too late for you to do these things, research what you're investing in because you say you don't quite understand what you invest your money in. So selling to know this market just because you think the price might go up is a mistake for newbies, market knowledge is empty, asset management is not smart,... but that will cost you money. .Anyway, this is a pretty good period when there are many positive signals from the market, and I will not be too difficult for you to make big profits in the next 2 to 3 years, but it is not a big deal. buy indiscriminately and wait for luck to come, instead of using such money, play the lottery for a higher chance of winning than watching your money gradually evaporate.",

What future do we really hope for altcoins without bitcoin?How many months ago exactly? If you bought these coins between June 2022 and March 2023 you have no problem, because it's bear market that causes the dip, and between this period these coins are very cheap, so you are not in any losses, all you need to do is keep holding, we still probably have a year or two to go before another bull market.",

And now the active market is also very active with many launch events of many new projects, moreover looking at the BTC halving schedule I think we are also about to see a bull market cycle.",

But we have to remember that most of the altcoins are too reliant on bitcoin even with how hyped they are. The market is too connected to bitcoin and that's why, everything goes up if bitcoin is up.",

I find it very funny to see people buying some altcoin just because people are talking about it, remember that in the crypto space hype is everywhere, and if you see a coin If there's a potential opportunity being discussed, beware, latecomers have no luck here.",

There are alts who are more stable than in Bitcoin, this is the reason why some of us thinks they are more predictable.The OP is only wrong there because he purely rely on his instincts and he lacks research so he ended up picking the wrong coins.
