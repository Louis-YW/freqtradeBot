You can also revoke the allowance, which in this case, that means the funds can't be moved without your authorization.The term token approval or token allowance is interchangeable.

The information that I referred to on the MetaMask link above should also suffice to get a grasp of what this kind of platform can do.The platform is also open-sourced, so you can run it locally and those who can inspect the code are able to do it. It is one of the listed smart contract revoking tools that listed by MetaMask:Â  How to revoke smart contract allowances/token approvals.",
