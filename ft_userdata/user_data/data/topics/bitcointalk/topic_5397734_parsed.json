  "content": "The world of quantum will hit hard. All the problems in the world from medical (CRISPR) to predicting and stopping tornados will either be resolved or disproven (teleportation) in this world where everything all technology is completely reborn - and fast. The next generation of people of all ages will invent great things just by stumbling on these exploding new break throughs completely on accident. Quantum could be sparking singularity events.Perception is everything.Are you ready?Quantum Crypto?Quanto?B..Mars?..Pluto? (make Pluto a planet? colonize?!)",

Systems packing 13 million qubits could break the network, but that isn't going to happen in the short or within specific number of years. Also there is more time available for the developers to make bitcoin network so strong against the quantum computing.",
