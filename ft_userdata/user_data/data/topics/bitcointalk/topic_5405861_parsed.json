Source: TradingViewMaybe bulls need to break through the resistance at $1,200 if they want to make a sustained move higher, while the bears are looking for the resistance provided by the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) to hold firm and continue to apply downside pressure.(Source: Cointelegraph)",

Also the price movements of Ethereum did also not really indicate that there were a major event happening or something as it basically moved with the overall direction of the whole crypto market. Nevertheless i think it is a good achievement and i really hope that Ethereum manages to do a smooth transition between PoW and PoS. Hopefully the gas fees will go down too then.That the market did not really react to that testnet news is not that unusual in my opinion, because in a bear market. Small good news have no impact at the moment.",

I mean it says that ETH failed to close above 1.3k and that should be a bad thing for the future of ETH, and the testnet situation didn't help as well, but the reality is that the whole market is the thing we should check. Bitcoin already reached above 21k and then went down, if it did then so would ETH as well, we know the market moves together and not one by one.This means that whatever happened in ETH price, happened in other coins prices as well, right now the ups and downs are give or take the same levels. Hence, the failure to close above 1.3k wasn't a thing about ETH, it was just a thing about the market at that time.",

Ethereum is getting failed caused by bitcoin was not able to break 23k rate as the point to bounce back again. So, we must wait until bitcoin can go up gradually.

And even if we have some good news, the price might go up a bit but then again after reaching some high, speculators and traders are going to sell for instant profit in this worsening condition.So can see the same with bitcoin, going as low as $17,500 and then bouncing to $20k which still remains as the next resistance is $28k which is very difficult to break in a bear market.",

This would only be believable if Ethereum had made major gains compared to other coins. As for failure to breakout of the $1,300 level. It's not going to happen soon or if it even happens, price will still drop right back. We are going to have a lot of sideways movements in this bear market.

Not sure whats dragging the price down more as its should be on recovery phase. Apparently, eth has been subject to huge criticism as I noticed on CT and probably a fud but the merge is a success and only OGs could see this as hard sale for alts. Anyway this will stop as soon there is a clear economic reports from fed. Likely due to recession and inflation rate, some are panic selling.",

The whole cryptomarket is dominated by bears and cryptowinter doesn't intend to end tomorrow. It is naive to expect that in the near future the cryptomarket will radically change direction and begin to grow. We will most likely see eth fall further, even below the symbolic value of $1,000. Maybe even $500-700. Current drawdowns may be nothing compared to really low prices.",

For now, either accumulate during this downtrend or let the market do its thing and don't worry about the short-termI know it has always been close,,, which crypto is not close to Bitcoin anyway right? But at the same time, Ethereum has been doing differently in terms of the percentage losses/gains (in general down is down and up is up but not as much as Bitcoin). The problem is the ETH merge is supposed to nullify the losses but it does not look that way. As you said though, nothing to worry about in the short term.

This cherry on top is that people locked up millions of dollars in ETH that may never be unlocked. Consider what happens if the merge fails or post merge the ETH is not unlocked for some reason. Also, ETH 2.0 sharding, when that comes in 2025, only includes sharded data, not true transaction sharding like seen on NEAR or ZIL.",

Although ether is as fundamentally strong as bitcoin, but if bitcoin continues its fall to 10k-14k, the fall of ETH to $700 is a matter of the near future.",
