It is important to double-check the wallet address you are sending your Bitcoin to before sending it, as well as to ensure that the amount you are sending is the correct amount you are supposed to send, to avoid mistakes because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Quote Is there no way or platform to reverse erroneous transactions, especially when the reasons are genuine?Thanks in anticipation!I don't think so because the transaction is anonymous; unless you know the person to whom you sent the Bitcoin, in which case you will ask him to return the remaining balance, otherwise it will be lost forever.",

Any bitcoin transaction with 1 confirmation can not be reversed anymore. If the transaction support RBF and not yet confirmed, you will be able to reverse it before it got confirmed. But if got confirmed, it can not be reversed anymore.",

Read this article to know about double spending.Take note, once the transaction is confirmed, it can never be reversed or it is harder to reversed and may need a huge amount of resources which is possibly we cannot afford.  Only unconfirmed transaction has the huge possibility to be reversed or cancelled.QuoteHow to Reverse Unconfirmed Transactions?There is no sure way to reverse a Bitcoin unconfirmed transaction. However, there are a few methods that may work, depending on the situation: If the transaction is stuck because it pays too low a fee, you can sometimes use a service like Replace-By-Fee (RBF) or Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) to increase the fee and get it confirmed.If the transaction is double-spent, you may be able to use a service like Replace-By-Fee to replace it with a higher-fee transaction.If none of the above methods works, you may have to wait for the transaction to eventually confirm, or simply cancel it and send a new transaction.here is another article[1] that explains how to cancel unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction.[1] https://guardian.ng/business-services/business-roundup/how-to-cancel-a-bitcoin-transaction-if-unconfirmed/",

As far as I know, there is no application/tool to reverse it yourself.It's the same as you send a good/item. Once it arrives at its destination, you can't take it back yourself. You need the help of the person you sent the BTC, kindly ask him to send back the BTC. If he is a good person, he probably sends back your Bitcoin. But if he refuses it, you lose your BTC forever.In addition, if you send it on CEX, you can ask for help from customer services. They may help you or give you a solution!Anyway, it is a must to be careful and always check again the destination address before you decide to send your BTC!!",

In addition it's not safe to keep funds from an unknown source, because unlike fiat cash money, all transactions are publicly registered on the blockchain, and you can get troubles if the funds are dirty. If the mistaken address belong to someone and iBaba put an announce here along with a signed message from the address he used to send the funds, he can maybe get back his funds from the receiver.",

The amount that you mentioned is not that big, and it can be considered as a price for the lesson that you learned by verifying the recipient’s address several times before broadcast the transaction. In general, if you use any Bitcoin wallet, warning messages will appear before sending to verify the recipient address and amount.The only case in which a transaction can be rebroadcasted is before it has been confirmed on the network.

Read this article to know about double spending.Yeah, I have done this a few times and attend some great success with it although, I was sending the transaction to an exchange but, cancellation wasn't the intent but, that's what did result. Having to send either same amount with a higher fee and broadcast on the network would cancel an unprocessed transaction running on the same wallet. So yeah, it's possible before confirmation and not after. Once there is as much as one confirmation on the transaction, its all gone. Not being able to reach out to your recipient for a reverse simply confirms it.",

Make sure to check the wallet over and over again. If you don't feel convinced enough, you can still call the recipients to inquire if the address still belongs to them.

Because a transaction is a what? it's either completed, pending or failed once its in any of these state, like in pending state and due to less fee or not validating by any validator then it will reverse and the amount will not even reflect in receiver's wallet and considered as failed and if it succeeds then it will be tagged as completed. Once the transaction is completed it means the metadata of transaction is updated into the blockchain and cannot be reversed, as we can not manipulate updated data, that's the main purpose of blockchain to keep everything transparent and free of manipulation and that's why governments dislike it.All i can say, please be aware next time double-check your wallets these types of mistakes are self driven and there are many attacks occurred too to make you do this mistake such as address poisonings.",
