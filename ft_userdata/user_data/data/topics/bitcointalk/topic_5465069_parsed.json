  "content": "Hi all,New here! I’m Matt from AmazeWallet. We’ve been building a new blockchain for the last six years that runs on mobile and are looking for people to test the app and become an early miner. Would you be interested?Here’s our chain whitepaper. It is EVM-compatible and uses ZK, sharding, layering and a new VRF-VDF consensus mechanism to deliver over 300k TPS (yes, really). We’ve designed it to run on end-user devices, where your mobile can broadcast, verify and generate blocks! We believe smartphones are the key to mass adoption of blockchain and can overcome a lot of scalability issues—we all have 5G enabled quad-core processors sitting in our pockets...We just launched our app on iOS and Android and are looking for early testers to try it out and let us know your feedback. Here’s the app whitepaper. The chain and native currency are already listed and we’re in discussions with several more exchanges.Here’s a link to our website to learn more.Thanks,Matt",

So Smartphone mining is stupid, sure with some old phones it can makes sense, but building a whole blockchain only for smartphones is not a good decision.If smartphone mining is a way to mine, like verus or other cpu coins then it can be a thing, but not only smartphone mining.The same for nodes, i see no reason why nodes must running on smartphones.What is mining algo? What is your target? I mean you put all key words in your whitepaper - NFT, Game, high TPS .... and Premined coins I think you see the problem.",

Then where do the main calculations take place if the mobile nodes do not consume resources?Do they validate blocks without validation?In the chain WP, we have a few sections that shed light on this. 10. Implementation (under Transaction Performance), 6. Structure (How miners produce blocks and Transaction Processing).Mobile nodes mainly play the role of verifying and generating blocks?with proposer nodes performing the calculations required to form blocks.Besides the algorithm and network structure, the other part is the data load. Most blockchains that use Trie or Merkle Trees have a heavy data load, where 10 state changes can lead to a 200x data load. That means a 300GB ledger taking up 15TB. We've reduced that to just 1 gigabyte of storage, partly through using RSA accumulators.",

Using significant processing power is not a requirement for a blockchain to function, be secure and be scalable. It is totally dependent on your algorithm, system design and other factors. Just as some video games are more or less optimised.We've made AmazeChain far more efficient than current networks, partly by leveraging smartphone devices—without sacrificing your battery power or significant data. There is no noticeable heating or loss in performance for end-user devices. Other node types (proposer, storage) have higher system requirements.",

Keigen has several areas of business, including solar power, e-commerce and software development. AmazeWallet comes under 62090—IT activities—which is a registered Nature of Business under Keigen UK. Most Web3/blockchain brands do not have other services.Thanks for the point about the website footer—added that in!I don't know what 'proof that it isn't a scam' means. Proof is on the claimant—what you've shared so far is your personal take on our website and whitepaper. I imagine that most brands don't reach out via forums like this, so I can understand your initial reluctance/skepticism. There are many projects in the space who have set out to mislead people—and made claims that aren't true. We purposely haven't shared in-depth info on our algorithm, since this was the v1 version of our public whitepaper. The algorithm is our core competitive advantage, which we have kept confidential. We will do in the future once we have a solid user base. The reason we're on forums like this is to share what we've built technically—our CSO was an early BTC/ETH contributor who raised sharding as a scaling solution with Vitalik in the early days. And to get feedback, or to gauge interest, in the project.I'm actually really happy that you've engaged thus far. And done a deep dive on our stuff. It definitely helps us understand what we need to better clarify!",
