  "content": "I suggest a plan to cooperation in trading crypto•   How does it work?   Briefly, it is a financial participation in trading in crypto-currency market. You involve your assets and we involve our experiences and time. So, the benefits are split 50/50.   Let’s describe with an example. Suppose you want to apply for $10,000 and after a period, we will grow it to $13,000. So, the profit equals $3000, which 50% of it ($1500) belongs to you.•   How can I trust you to give you my money?   It doesn’t need to give us any money. We will trade with your money into your account. You should create an account in an exchange (Binance or OKex are recommended), then give us the account’s password in order to login and trade. Be aware, when you give someone the password, he can just login and do trade; not any withdrawals are possible. To withdraw, there are more security options like 2-FA and e-mail verification. So, you can only withdraw.•   What about the profit ratio and risk?    All of the financial markets, like stocks, forex, crypto, … are risky activities. You must note that when you want more income, you need to accept the risk. However, we try to manage the risk to achieve a positive performance. Our predicted ratio is about 10~15 percent per month. •   How long does the plan take? Is it long-term or short?   Actually, we are day traders. The period of each trade is usually 6~10 hours. So, the plan is short-term. But to achieve appropriate profit, we suggest at least a 6-month period. Note that there is no limitation to cancel the plan.•   How can I test your performance?   You can test the plan with a small amount of money (at least $1000) for 2 weeks. After that, you can add main assets.•   Is there a minimum amount to apply the plan?   Yes, the minimum amount to apply is $5000.•   Do you use the robots for trading?   No. In all accounts, human traders do trade. We don’t use robot trading neither copy trading.",

In general, in any type of investment, you should pay attention to the fact that you do not have the right to sell  things that are necessary for your life or borrow. In fact, investing is allocating part of the surplus capital to get more profit, and you must have risk management for that.Regarding why there is a need for cooperation, I draw your attention to the fact that the purpose of human creation is social life. A person may have specialized ability but less capital and vice versa. There is no obstacle to mutual cooperation for common interests. For example, ETFs work with this view.",

Let's assume that I intend to launder money. Usually, such a person will not have the ability to trade and generate profit. While you will find out after 7 or 10 days. In addition, to perform money laundering, I can use exchanges such as MEXC or Coinex that do not require KYC and create a large number of accounts.Ironically, my suggestion is not Binance exchange, but MEXC. Because this exchange has a maker fee of 0 and a ticker of 0.02%, while Binance has a maker fee of 0.02% and a ticker of 0.05%.",

If I'd do that to a stranger, I'd rather learn with that amount with my own trades but then, that's just me.Quote from: GoodDestination on December 07, 2023, 11:23:18 AMSomeone who has been trading for years and has reached enough skill, why should he spend his time for small amounts?For sure you are able to save and don't need the money of others.",

This is just an expected ratio but you won't be fixated on this, you're not using your own money and you're free to take any level of risk (that is if you're legit).In this cooperation, one team shares its time and another person shares its capital. If there is a loss, the time spent on trading is wasted, as well. If you think that money is the only important factor, yes, it is not a fair cooperation, but if the time spent by people in this work is valuable, then it is a fair cooperation.As I have mentioned in a few previous posts, we have included a kind of capital management in our strategy, so that the risk is minimal in each trade, as a result the profit is also low. But with a higher number of trades by our team, we increase the cumulative profit in a day. Currently, the average daily profit of our team is about 1.36% of the total capital. If trading is done 20 days a month, the compound profit will be about 31%, half of which belongs to the investor.",
