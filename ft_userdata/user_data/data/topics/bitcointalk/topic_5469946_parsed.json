It is better to start new than to be a newbie legendary. Start from group up than to be disappointed.My advice is that you should register a new account and use it instead.",

I believe the most valuable lesson on your experience here is don’t deal outside the forum especially telegram. No trusted Bitcointalk escrow will deal outside the forum since their reputation was built here not on telegram. Dealing someone on the telegram including escrows is equivalent to trusting new set of user especially if they don’t acknowledgment the telegram account through the use of their Bitcointalk account.This scam scheme is not knew either and there’s a lot of scammer keeps impersonating trusted user telegram here by changing some letters to make it looks like identical so it’s better to deal only inside the forum rather than the telegram.",

I'm not sure how real the screenshot of the account being sold to the OP is without being faked, did anyone notice this in the first place?I noticed something strange in the picture the OP posted that the scammer sent him, I mean look at the authenticity of those screenshots carefully. The scammer seems to have succeeded in deceiving the OP by falsifying the account identity by editing the image without paying attention to small things such as the vertical layout of profile information. If you are confused about what I mean, then look at the image once again. So I think it's possible that OP was scammed by someone who didn't actually have an account to sell. Fraudsters get another user's account at random and fake their image. I'm not completely sure about that, but it's a possibility when I noticed the screenshot of the account the scammer offered him.Here's the comparison:",

Some time ago I also researched a similar matter and came across the same evidence. There was a similar accusation here, after which I tried to contact the seller under a neutral nickname. He sent me this same screenshot, but he never managed to prove ownership of the account. Without sufficient evidence, I did not want to start the accusation process.That was in March-April '23 if I remember correctly connected to @Alex2012 on Telegram. It is possible that I have screenshots of part of that discussion somewhere, I changed my computer in the meantime, so I would have to look for it.What we have to clarify is that there is no evidence that the original owner of this account is selling that account. In fact, I am sure that the @Markdoy6 Telegram user is not the original owner, but a scammer who offers this account to naive people.What if someone like him offered my account for sale, or yours holydarkness? Here I want to invite nutildah and Little Mouse to withdraw their feedback because they have no obvious proof.

That explains what I've been wondering since yesterday by a lot: how he removed the neutral tag given by actmyname. I initially thought he temporarily distrust AMN, I checked his trust list during the time to confirm this, and [as there were no info of such] I thought he did it for about minutes, just enough to make a screenshot, and then delete his list, so the weekly record didn't archive that.But editing the upper part of the page [or the lower part] made way much sense.I happen to have screenshots of profile pages around the same time of that screenshot [in April 2023] in my gallery, and indeed, the forum didn't change layout or the likes, layout shown on the profile page during April should also shows what we see right now: all text aligned between each rows.Quote from: examplens on October 12, 2023, 04:35:12 PM[...]What we have to clarify is that there is no evidence that the original owner of this account is selling that account. In fact, I am sure that the @Markdoy6 Telegram user is not the original owner, but a scammer who offers this account to naive people.What if someone like him offered my account for sale, or yours holydarkness? [...]I guess there were no easy way to prove the ownership, even if Google+ come and answer here, it'll be a classic he-said-she-said.I can think of two ways to prove or debunk the allegation, but it'll be quite... inconvenient. One is proving the connection by wallet transaction and see if the scammers wallet of which OP send the fund to is connected to Google+. The other is to debunk it [and it'll be very annoying, and I can understand if Google+ refuses to do so] I guess Google+ can ask for a trusted member to verify the dis-connection between his account and this mess by sending them a PM containing a screenshot of his profile from his page.The screenshot bounds to show his email address and the member who got trusted with this task can match if the email written on his profile matched with the one being offered. I'll say again that it'll be very inconvenient as Google+ will reveal his real email address, if we suppose the screenshot above isn't his and the email address truly registered to him was not as above, so I can understand if he doesn't want to go with this method. Might worth to mention that it is not a sure fire, especially if the email was changed few weeks ago past seclog's data [is there a way to get a log way back for months?].",
