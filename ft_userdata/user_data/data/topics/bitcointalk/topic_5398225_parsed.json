I was panic like that years ago when I even did not know why my transaction was stucked for half a day on Bitcoin network.Bitcoin protocol has difficult retarget each 2016 blocks or about 14 days so waiting transactions in mempool will be confirmed later or will be dropped off mempool and people will have to broadcast their transaction again.",

Not to mention the lawsuits. I promised myself I would not start reading about it and checking on it once the entire dump started. But I lied to myself and spent about 2 hours looking at all of it last night. About 10 minutes in you could see it was a scam from the start. Before the 1/2 hour mark you could easily see that the numbers would never work. Anyway back to the subject at hand. 10 sat/Vb are getting confirmed regularly now and if the trend keeps up the mempool should be cleared in a few days.Makes you wonder what kind of controls they have any why in general they decided to do it.-Dave",

Besides, he is a man who publicly says with enthusiasm that 95% of all cryptocurrencies will fail anyway, and that he enjoys watching them fail. I hope that someone will react and accuse him of fraud, although such liars like him usually get minimal penalties, and instead of being a warning to others, they are even more encouraged to do just such things.",

There is a limited supply (block size) and if the demand for it is smaller or equal to that size the price of it (fee) remains low. If the demand increases the price goes up.",
