      "body": "So long as the address(es) you are sending from has been in the wallet the entire time you should be fine. It should keep all the UTXO information it needs for addresses it has. There are some ways to make it not work, but by default it should.By default importing addresses into pruned wallets should not work along with a few other things. But, you can with enough time and effort make make it do some things it should not. If you just prune it all should be good. If you TRY to make it do things it does not want to do then.....Just putting it out there since people have managed to do it and then come here or reddit or other places for help after they jumped though a lot of hoops to make it not work.-Dave",
