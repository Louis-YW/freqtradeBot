  "content": "The EU and some government believe that cryptocurrency have no Intrinsic value and that you should be prepared to lose all your money if you buy cryptos. The head of the bank of England have taken this stance some months ago. In-fact, Bit Coin is highly restricted if not ban in Russia, China, Algeria, Bolivia, Nigeria, Bangladesh and many countries that are left wing. Whether directly or indirectly these countries have stood as Anti-Crypto. My question is are they trying to protect their citizens or what?Personally, I believe competition is good for the consumer but when government officials make this comment, I try to see things from their perspective and analyze them. So, what are government officials saying that they are not actually telling the people in reality.Cryptocurrency are the largest treat to national security: The most powerful weapons that countries has is the ability to change interest rate and what they do is to buy and sell bonds to increase money supply or decrease money supply which changes interest rate. Hypothetically speaking, if every citizen in a country no longer use fiat or paper currency and they only use cryptocurrency then government can’t raise money by issue bonds and changing interest rate. What will happen is that government will go bankrupt.Note: No Government makes a lot of money collecting only taxes. They issue bonds etc.If there is no demand for government currency then they will go bankrupt. Do well to contribute your knowledge on this subject.",

They are the ones with more benefits, because, not every cryptocurrency is centralized, like BTC, etc. Which are not in the control of these governments. So, they are afraid of it because they cannot control it and some think it's just a bubble that will pop up anytime.Quote from: RioBlemz on October 18, 2023, 06:59:59 PMCryptocurrency are the largest treat to national security: The most powerful weapons that countries has is the ability to change interest rate and what they do is to buy and sell bonds to increase money supply or decrease money supply which changes interest rate. You pointed out a good point and there is no doubt about it, because taxes are not the only way of making money, they definitely use bonds but keep in mind that bonds are also not the only alternative option to taxes to make governments money. There are numerous ways, in which a government can make money, and that varies from state to state. Like in our country, they are selling the schools now (hehe) making money a huge amount of money. And the rumors are they are selling the government school for around 1,787,269 dollars. (in local currency, 50 crores). Well, the point is, there are many other ways of making money, but yeah for this particular issue of bonds, they are bringing the CBDC system, which can solve this problem for the governments. Overall, I don't think that a country that has not yet accepted the BTC as its legal tender, can go bankrupt just because the value of there local currency is decreasing, I am not saying that it is not possible but all I am saying is, the probability is very less.",

Although Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that no one can fully regulate, the government is trying to regulate the pace of its development with some regulations. Every government has different regulations. For governments that are still pro-Bitcoin or crypto like El Salvador have fully adopted it as a legal payment, but for governments that only provide regulations that still look gray, it can only be used as a commodity asset.That's still pretty good rather than being banned completely by the government, as happened to China. But there will be ways for users to buy bitcoin or access crypto and that cannot be restricted.",

In some other countries, they believe that the cryptocurrency is contributing to fraudulent activities and money laundering. For that reason, they feel they are trying to prevent the rate of money laundering and also to help citizens from being defrauded. Another thing that I read about is that the governments of some countries that are not crypto-friendly believe that because of the volatility of cryptocurrency. IMO, all of the reasons are not very valid because, if you give an opportunity to people, you should also give them the right knowledge to guide them through so as to prevent mistakes. So what I am saying in essence is that if the government chooses to allow Bitcoin, they can still educate their citizens not to invest wrongly, but instead they choose to ban it. Talking about money laundering, has it stopped even while cryptocurrency is banned? Nope.",

As long as the government is entitled to control everything even those users that are bitcoin enthusiasts, then let's accept the reality that bitcoin adoption will never happen easily because it's clear the government won't allow it to happen. So bitcoin will always remain as a threat to the government and its fiat currency, and for me this is not something bad because it only proves that bitcoin has really the capacity to break the government so that financial freedom will definitely be achieved in the long run.What we need to do at the moment is to continue accessing bitcoin despite of the regulations imposed by the government. Financial freedom with bitcoin will only be achieved if we consistently do it for purpose, and that is to prove to the government that even if they put restrictions or ban its usage, people will always find ways on how to access it ands use it based on its real purpose.",

If such income did not exist, their economies would be affected.

The reason for all this that the government do, is basically because they can't track and control the transaction that has to deal with Bitcoin and if their is one the government really like, it's actually the thought on knowing that they can actually control everything including the financial life of their citizens and Bitcoin as a decentralized currency doesn't support this so they alternative to the best possible option which is actually to ban or restrict it .",

In fact as one of the biggest bitcoin believers I have made similar statements before. 99% of cryptocurrencies are pure garbage so they have no value whatsoever which means you should be prepared to lose all your money when you buy them!This is not some super secret that nobody knows!Not to mention that every single country (their government or baking system) has already issued a similar warning specially after 2017 when the shitcoin market grew a lot.QuoteMy question is are they trying to protect their citizens or what?It's hard to say. On paper issues like this (as I explained above) are rational. But you should try to find their motivation for issuing these statements.We know governments seek full control and surveillance. Something as decentralized as bitcoin takes both of that away. So they seek to regain some of that control. This is why they insist on talking about bitcoin and altcoins at the same time and regulate them together whereas they should be completely separate.For example ICOs (and all the alternatives all the way to NFTs) are banned in a lot of countries but bitcoin is accepted as a legal currency.QuoteCryptocurrency are the largest treat to national security: The most powerful weapons that countries has is the ability to change interest rate and what they do is to buy and sell bonds to increase money supply or decrease money supply which changes interest rate. Hypothetically speaking, if every citizen in a country no longer use fiat or paper currency and they only use cryptocurrency then government can’t raise money by issue bonds and changing interest rate. What will happen is that government will go bankrupt.Well different facts are being mixed here. Bitcoin was never supposed to replace fiat. It is the alternative option and we already know altcoins are jokes. This means this concern has no grounds.Besides, the financial system has to change. It is not a good thing that governments keep playing with fiat supply (print money out of thin air) increase interest rates (screw up the economy by causing recession) etc. just because they are incompetent to keep the economy stable.",

You're right that countries' most powerful tool is interest rate control, which is almost useless in a crypto economy. The crucial, sometimes ignored issue is sovereignty. State sovereignty is guaranteed by currency and interest rate regulation.Why do some nations strongly oppose crypto? Your claim that they may be protecting their fellow citizens is reasonable but incomplete. A deeper fear exists. Governments may lose financial power by fully embracing cryptocurrency. If crypto becomes the main form of payment, countries cant use monetary policy to encourage or slow economic growth. This has major implications.
