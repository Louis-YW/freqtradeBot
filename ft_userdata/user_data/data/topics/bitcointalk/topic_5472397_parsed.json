Perhaps you have some suggestions, please share your thoughts.And if you find the idea really interesting, try to claim an NFT and/or tell your friends about the new project or share it on Twitter(X) with your buddies.If you don't know what is Ethereum Name Service(ENS) you can learn more here:ens web: https://ens.domainsdocs: https://docs.ens.domainstwitter(X): https://twitter.com/ensdomainsens marketplace: https://ens.visionWe've put together some helpful guides for you to get setup with our product quickly and easily.Make a wish guide:Step 1:https://bafkreifgzf3z5kjwn4qtrm65nyxi22ixf4wtzq3g5bb5yhcaf2pvi7ahsy.ipfs.w3s.link/Step 2:https://bafkreibtfio5ahhfrsff57lyfcy5ox4q7xvajxjzqd2od3cjq5g32jkf4i.ipfs.w3s.link/Step 3:https://bafkreihxnp6ltoac7sclxcjyh5edcreugojygsp7crbv7yol23kzx4z72q.ipfs.w3s.link/Step 4:https://bafkreihpf2pqkhpe5ex3nf2veeg3fofo2nn2ggzk2ha5fbqlsfvt3syjoq.ipfs.w3s.link/Official web: https://11h11.ioOfficial twitter(X): https://twitter.com/11h11ethLearn more: https://docs.11h11.ioNetwork: Ethereum, PolygonMake a wish 11:1111h11.eth",
