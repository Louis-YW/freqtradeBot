  "content": "I have searched and found not many recent posts about successfully running miners of Solar/off grid and wondered if others have found a better way to manage turning miners on and off as required.I currently turn the miners on and off via timers but this is a brute force way of handling the use of power.I first tested just turning off the router thinking the miner would go dormant - nope - still chugs away at full power.Does anyone use modified firmware to turn miners on or off? Any help appreciated.My mining setup consisting of 2 x S9's and a Hydro modified S19 (140TH total) running from my Off grid Electrical system that Powers my Shed and Barn.  I still have enough power available to run power tools etc so I can still add a few more miners and just turn some off if I need the power elsewhere.It was going to be Expensive to wire the Shed and Barn to the grid, so I opted to go Off Grid.I have built the system up from new and second hand parts.40 x 250w (10Kw) Panels second hand feeding into 2 x Growatt Inverters (10KW) to 280 AHr 48v LifePo4 Batteries.More batteries are ordered but post is slow.",

If you off your router the miner will still keep running but with less power consumption compared to when the miner is fully working with the internet connection. I prefer having extra juice available when mining with solar panels so that my battery bank can also recharge fully for night use, I hope you have some calculator? I am not sure that running 2 S9 and 1 S19 with extra asic miners on a 10kw is a good idea. I might be wrong but you should do some calculations first.",

My optimum result would be for an Automated turn on/off by time/r option in firmware - will check if HiveOS can help. I have just test loaded DJayOS into an S9 as the old stock firmware was running the unit a bit hot and causing lots of reboots on the hot days.  I now have the S9J under clocked running at a reliable 10TH at around 1KW for our 10 hours of daylight.  The S19 runs at 3K3 watts so in total I have 5300 watts of miners running and accessories(fans/pumps) using only 250W.  So I don't have  an issue is running 6000 watts on a 10,000 watt system. I feel I can squeeze 2Kw more out of the system as the panels still fully charge the batteries by 10 am.More panels and inverters are planned if I can find them cheap enough.",

The more load you add to your solar energy build the longer your battery bank takes to fully charge, also you should know that it won't always be a sunny day, there are rainy seasons as well, make sure you have enough power left to charge your battery bank per day while mining with all the rigs at the same time. My solar battery bank started misbehaving when I add to much load, I meant the battery bank wasnt lasting as it supposed to until I remove a rig, extra power is very important, for buffering sake and keeping the full battery at full.",

      "body": "I don't know why but my opinion is maybe the reason only a few people that successfully run miners using Solar is because the Solar panel still very expensive for running multiple miners and when the night comes you need a battery or keep using on-grid electric. Solar panel is for investment in the long-run and most people still okay with on-grid electricity. Quote from: Jet Cash on January 12, 2023, 11:14:14 AMI fancied doing this from my campervan.

When there's sun, they are mining. No sun, use of battery. Battery empty: No mining. They mine on startup and can also remotely be controlled either via ssh or with the terminal of the GSM-provider.Additionally, there are some miners working in a shed, powered by the excess energy of one roof.  They just run constantly.At the moment, I set up a roof with solar-tiles and a 15 kW battery. Under the building is a huge cave system where I will store the miners (in an experimental stadium, they worked perfectly. They are connected to my network through an LTE-bridge through which I can ssh into each miner individually.",
