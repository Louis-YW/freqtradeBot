We are incredibly excited to share a groundbreaking update from GRIDNET, the world's first successful implementation of a decentralized operating system!We have recently made some pivotal improvements to the GRIDNET Core software, addressing a critical connection issue that arose when switching to the Events' View of the Terminal UI dApp. Our dedicated development team, broadcasted live on YouTube, implemented additional throttling and a dynamic bucket mechanism to resolve the Chromium-induced connection termination.We invite you to test these revolutionary mechanics in action by visiting https://test.gridnet.org, launching the Terminal UI dApp, and pressing CTRL+W within the app (make sure you're in full-screen mode!).This is not just an improvement; it's a testament to our commitment to innovation and excellence. GRIDNET is not just a project; it's a movement towards a more decentralized and empowered digital future. And this is just the beginning!Join us on this exciting journey by following our updates and becoming a part of the GRIDNET community. Together, let's redefine what's possible in the decentralized world!",

As it's almost like deploying apps on Micosoft Windows, Mac OS X (drag & drop indeed!) or Linux - feel invited to write code directly from a command line!ðŸ˜„Greetings from the intergalactic realms of GRIDNET OS! You're about to embark on a cosmic journey through the decentralized galaxies of the very first decentralized operating system, guided by the celestial map of GridScript++. Fear not, for the System API is your trusty spaceship, equipped with all the gadgets and gizmos needed to navigate the decentralized universe.ðŸŒŒ Your Galactic Guide: The System API ðŸŒŒThe System API is your interstellar passport to the GRIDNET OS decentralized operating system. Designed for the savvy space explorer (read: GRIDNET Core application), it can be wielded from the cozy confines of your space cabin (read: terminal) with the mighty 'evalGPP' GridScript command. With its trusty sidekicks, System.user and System.assets, you can retrieve the fingerprint of the universe (read: 'Perspective'), identify extraterrestrial beings (read: logged-in users), and even exchange intergalactic currency (read: assets)!ðŸ›  Your Space Toolkit: your web-browser or SSH ðŸ› Before launching your spaceship, make sure to test all systems in ephemeral mode. This can be done by deploying your code to a file and then executing it, or by executing your code inline from the terminal. Just remember, your code file should have a .gpp extension, and you can use the 'call' or 'callTransfer' GridScript commands from the Terminal. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy!ðŸŒ  Your Cosmic Compass: GridScript++ Namespaces ðŸŒ The System API is divided into three namespaces:System: The control room of your spaceship. It provides essential information about the state of the GRIDNET OS decentralized operating system.System.user: Your friendly onboard robot that helps you manage user-related functionalities.System.assets: Your intergalactic bank that enables asset transactions.Together, these namespaces form the backbone of your cosmic journey, enabling you to navigate the GRIDNET OS and the GridScript++ programming environment with ease and finesse.So strap in, grab your space helmet, and let's blast off into the decentralized cosmos with the System API of GridScript++!The entire article is available right over here: https://gridnet.org/wpp/index.php/2023/08/31/gridscript-system-api-documentation/The future of #web3 and #crypto #technology opening up right in front of us.",

I feel like it makes it look like a joke.When I see a project coming with the idea of incorporating an idea that has already failed by so many, I will call it a lie. Currently, the hype is centered around projects that can integrate existing technology into real-time payment systems, such as in games, gambling, etc, but for anything else. There is no proof that an unexpected breakthrough will be made that the previous one wasn't. A project that cannot raise funds is a good indication it should be abandoned",
