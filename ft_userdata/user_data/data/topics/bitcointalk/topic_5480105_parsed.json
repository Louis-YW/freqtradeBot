Strangely enough, the Blockchair website is not reachable from some of networks that I connect to.You can use the explorer with Tor and honestly I am really unsure what is your network issue to connect to it and use it smoothly.Could you share more what problems you got, with what browser. Someone can help you if there is solution.Quote from: DdmrDdmr on January 02, 2024, 03:41:25 PMThe other blocks on the list seem to be blocks that included many Ordinal BTC-20 related TXs, especially those from September 2023: Block 806264 for example had 91,8% of TXs being Ordinal related, block 806249 84,8%, block 806280 91,6%, and so forth.More than 80% to over 90% of a block capacity is too much.Ordinals become more annoying since February 2023 and in last two months of 2023, they caused more issues for Bitcoin mempools and non-Ordinal Bitcoin users.This is much higher than 50% like they contributed in February 2023.Bitcoin block space",

I thought the average transactions at that time were between 1,000 and 3,000? The strange thing is that there is a difference of one block between these two blocks, with a total of more than 20k   transactions.Knowing the top 5 blocks is not as important as knowing the average.

I only answered the question of OP.There are top 10 blocks in 2015 and from this, I believe your guess about average transactions is closely to the fact.https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?s=transaction_count(desc)&q=time(2015-01-01..2015-12-31)#f=id,transaction_count,timeQuote367,853   2015-08-01 01:06:41   12239367,851   2015-08-01 00:25:40   9647364,807   2015-07-11 04:58:55   6451364,972   2015-07-12 08:55:59   6144365,074   2015-07-13 04:01:36   6084364,837   2015-07-11 10:09:41   5973365,068   2015-07-13 02:48:29   5946364,951   2015-07-12 05:44:07   5944365,077   2015-07-13 04:43:53   5937365,047   2015-07-12 23:02:14   5866Check with this chart, the average transactions per block in 2015 is about 1000 or less than 1000.https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/n-transactions-per-block",
