Since 1971 the monetary system has been based on pure faith, and the banking system on pure faith as well. All set up with a business model that if you set it up yourself they will put you in jail.As for CS, the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority (FINMA) have come to Credit Suisse's rescue. Another one that has been in doubt for a long time is DB, but if we think that to plug the hole we don't need anything tangible or real money but some liquidity and confidence to continue the ponzi, we can see that Mad Max is not going to happen any time soon. Too big to fail banks are going to be backed in one way or another by governments and central banks.As for bitcoin, we recently saw that it reacted in the opposite way to what it had been doing since the inflation crisis. Until now, the price of bitcoin had fallen like other financial assets, mainly due to the liquidation of leverage and dragged down by the lack of confidence caused by scandals such as the FTX scandal. Recently, with the rescue of SVB and the prospect of a change in monetary policy, it has reacted differently to the stock markets, with a clear rise. But this has been a one-off for the time being. I would like to think that if things continue to go wrong in the banking system, this will favour bitcoin because people will buy more but to believe this I would have to see more times that banking or stock market crises favour bitcoin.",

The only difference between these banks and exchanges is that depositors or customers funds are safe according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. I just wish exchanges will be able to have such insurance that guarantees crypto funds in their custody. This would have helped to reduce the constant attack of the crypto sector by the government. The rise in the price of Bitcoin this period is very surprising. This is a clear indication that Bitcoin will someday become quasi-independent from global economic influence. Bitcoin is just unpredictable.",

I do not understand why more people do not realize that banks are using their money to gamble with and make a profit and if some thing goes wrong the governments will bail them out because it would ruin the economy if so many defaulted loans were not covered.",

Sounds nice and makes some sense, but all one has to do is read the thing for a while to become totally disabused of this quint notion.  Some of the most ridiculous retards I've ever run across frequent this place.  Some are probably amateurishly coded bot experiments, and some are probably paid trolls, but I think there are a fair contingent of flesh-n-blood people who really are simply quite low-functioning.Quote from: DeathAngel on March 16, 2023, 04:59:45 PMBe your own bank.Better late than never.",

The dangerous part in all this situation is that the trust in the banks could be again put at stake by the general population who does not hold Bitcoin, pushing people to run for their money and the liquidation of assets in order to get enough cash for them.If more banks continue this trend, only the biggest fish of the tank could be remaining ones in the end, when the dust settles, which would translate in more centralization of the traditional system of banking.Also, I believe you are spot on. With the current correlation of Bitcoin to some stocks, would mean Bitcoin may suffer from whatever could happen next.Let us hope for the best and prepare for the worst this year.",
