This macro indicator wish to say bottom will be in recesion. Recesion is very like to hapened, becouse bond market is saying so.I will give more data in coming days.

At prices under $17k I DCA daily.My plan of investing:  I plan to push 50% of capital in BTC, when i see that most BITCOIN realistics indicators told me that bottom is in50% of my buy indicators will be FED, inflation and recesion. So for additional 50% investment i will need to wait for intrest rates to reverse and to see official recesion.Will i hit the bottom with my DCA? No!

War is just the Fed's excuse that war is to blame for inflation. Inflation was high even before the warWhat affects bitcoin the most is the irresponsible printing of money by central banks around the world, especially the Fed.If we want to stop inflation, financial markets must collapse, unemployment must rise.I can only hope that we stop the inflation before too many people loss jobs.Otherwise, there may be a repeat of the 70s of the previose century, where financial markets suffered",

The following zones can be adapted for a monthly rate one is aiming to buy BTC with:<0.45 = all in (below red line, red zone)0.46 - 0.7 = 75% BTC, 25% Cash0.71 - 1.0 = 50% BTC, 50% Cash1.01-1.2 = 25% BTC, 75% Cash>1.2 = 100% Cash (above fixed investment zone aka the green line)With this strategy, one can invest rationally and give up emotional investing. One has a clear strategy of when to buy into BTC and when to start building cash. A great side effect of this strategy is a passive cash building strategy. When the market is then tanking again, there is enough cash on the sidelines to buy heavily into BTC. In the past, I sometimes had problems to discipline myself not to buy into too high prices. Since I found AHR999, I have been really consistent, strict, and disciplined with myself. Maybe this will help you too.--------IN GOD WE TRUST, IN CODE WE TRUST! Long live SatoshiEAST GREAT FALLS",

It's bottom for you, but it won't be for me. When there is a sudden dump that is lower than expected, I try to accumulate. And we know that a pump occurs after every dump, whether big or small. So I take advantage of it infrequently, but not always. Because it's quite risky, and I only do it when I feel less risky.",

Long live SatoshiEAST GREAT FALLS I see you like to DCA more frequently. Not so bad strategy , if you wish to stay discipletedModern History Facts:1) The S&P500 has bottomed every time during a recession. The exception is the dot com bubble. The present time, however, is nothing like the dot com bubble. A recession has not yet been officially declared2) In the past, a recession was declared when two consecutive quarters of GDP were negative. This time it was not like that in 20223) The bottom of the S&P500 was always reached immediately or a little later (a few months later) when the Fed pivot4) Every indicator I know indicates that a recession will most likely occur in 20235) Unemployment is in good shape, this is probably the main factor why a recession was not declared in 20226) The Fed is likely to reduce rate hikes from 75bps to 50bps in December. This is not a PIVOT7) If the FED PIVOT too quickly the 70s where we had a yoyo market could be repeated. Inflation must remain stable and low in the long term, otherwise we cannot have the next big bull marketThe Fed should stick with tough policy until quite a few zombie companies fail, and hoping not to many people lose jobs fastIF the high interest rate persists, it will have a negative impact on the economy. Tech. companies in particular are sensitive to the level of interest rates. Therefore, it is possible to expect another crash in the crypto world similar to FTX.Many crypto indicators that I follow say that BITCOIN is at the bottom or very close to the bottom. If there was no threat of recession ahead, I would dare to say with some certainty that this is the bottom of BITCOIN.If large companies get into financial trouble, they will also be forced to sell large amounts of BITCOIN, like Saylor.The FTX news will slowly cool down, and BITCOIN may soon go above $23k. For example, if the inflation data in December are better than expected, we can expect milder rhetoric from the FED in December. Such scenarios could push BITCOIN up.This stock bear market has been average so far. Therefore, it may happen that we will experience the bottom of the S&P500 in the summer of 2023. This bottom may be just a little lower than the current bottom - 3.577.This is a sign that even then BITCOIN will reach the bottom at that time, which could be approximately where we are now.In any case, the year 2023 should not be the year where BITCOIN will make a big upward movementETH dominance is sky high for me right now, so I'm only buying BTC right now. ETH has a much better chance of making a new low than BITCOINCould a major stablecoin collapse happen? This is what could finally drive many cryptocurrencies to their real value of $0, and bitcoin would finaly find his bottom.We also should know that FTX news impact at this time on BTC price stronger than FED policyIts my first image that i try to add. After someone will quote picture should workhttps://i.ibb.co/k2XySW3/slika.pngThis bitcoin indicator is still not at his bottom.

Inflation was high even before the warInflation and unemployment gets people selling their coins instead of buying.The energy war (don't forget that too) makes some miners get in difficulty because of the prices.Recession can make also businesses sell (some or all of) their investments.Quote from: franky1 on November 21, 2022, 12:30:22 PMif you simply calculate the mining costs of the cheapest mining on the planet. you find this base numberIf a mining facility works on solar power and got its ROI for both the panels (and related hardware) and miners, the costs would be insignificant.Still, they will not sell under the price of electricity they could sell to the grid, I guess. So what's the minimum by your math? 0? Or the equivalent of 5 cents/kWh?I don't think that they'll be willing to sell this low, no matter what.So I see a contradiction/discrepancy betweenQuote from: franky1 on November 21, 2022, 12:30:22 PMif you simply calculate the mining costs of the cheapest mining on the planet. you find this base numberand Quote from: franky1 on November 21, 2022, 12:30:22 PMif no one can or wants to sell below a certain level on the entire planet. then thats the base/bottom.Bigger money starts going into the system when the news are at the bottom. When the economy starts to recover, the financial markets are already quite a few percent above the bottom.For example, when the financial markets see that unemployment is already too high, they simply assume that the FED will start lowering the interest rate. And if the Fed only give a hint that it will go in this direction, we have probably already hit the bottom...[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",
