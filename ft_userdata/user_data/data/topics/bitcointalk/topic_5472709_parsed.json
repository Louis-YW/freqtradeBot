Even though I'm not really know with the promotion before 2017 aka when Bitcoin price hit $19K",

Yes, of course, there has never been a coordinated and paid advertising promotions done for Bitcoin yet it is able to reach a global audience and is now comparable to many big financial institutions when talking of value. This is actually an amazing story...one of the mystifying reason why I think Bitcoin is really destined to be one of the tools gifted to humanity. And actually Bitcoin is just on its beginning phase...we shall see more exciting developments in the years to come. The growth of Bitcoin is indeed organic...with the power of the mouth really doing its work.",

      "body": "Back in those early days when Bitcoin first started, it was mostly getting talked about on cryptographic message boards, newsgroups and other online communities. It seemed really experimental and niche and the adoption was slow at first as people tried to understand what it was all about.But over time, as more nerds and libertarians started getting into Bitcoin, it started getting articles written about it online and offline, and talked about in the news. People pitched it as an alternative to the traditional financial system where you had to deal with high fees from banks and credit cards and wait days for transfers. With Bitcoin transfers could be free and instant since everything is on a decentralized ledger. Of course, it still felt pretty experimental and risky back then. But the hype around Bitcoin grew as more people learned about its potential.",

And I think it contributes more for Bitcoin for being a enigma like it's creator in Satoshi. Unlike least say Ethereum wherein they still have Vitalik as their nominal leader, in Bitcoin we don't and we don't need one just to promote it.And in the last 10 years or so, we seen it's massive growth to the point that every nation in the world are still divided. That's what kind of noise bitcoin did, disrupt the financial world without any leader and up to now it is still the talk of the town. And now that we are approaching halving and the next bull run, for sure it will be in the headlines again.",

I think BTC has become the next Marvel, DC or any other big brand like Apple that don't have to come up with astonishing features, even the design of new coming apples are similar to some extent (they are just changing the camera size or position etc ) well, besides this, BTC when in start, might be advertised like the faucets, the exchanges, supporting BTC payment or providing ways to earn in BTC.They all were doing advertisement for btc. In short, my teacher of marketing used to say sell without selling. Means, unlike sellers you don't have to convince customer to buy this and that. You just have to share them your enough knowledge about your product or skills that other person will already be convinced to buy it from you. BTC has done the same, faucets, exchanges, ETFs applications, Investor's investments in BTC, companies adopting it, Countries adopting it and many other positive news of how BTC has impacted the life of a middle men. These activities has unintentionally did the work of advertisements and news outlets played an important role here. And this forum, I mean who knows how many times the keyword BTC is being written here everyday. There would be no other keyword except BTC, that would have wrote this much. But now it doesn't need advertisement it already made place in people's heart.",

In the past, I had the habit of always completely believing in the things I found on Yahoo, Google,..., but later I realized that there were things that were completely wrong with the original content, but it was just curiosity, that made me learn more about it.And the marketing story with Bitcoin, I think there is no need to differentiate too much because everything over time I feel is an acceptance of the truth of what it can do, of course it is not completely good or bad when looking at it. That point is built around it by ourselves. In the current social context, where media easily share navigation and people easily find information, whether the truth is exposed or false has an impact on helping people get closer to Bitcoin.",

Bitcoin is decentralized, not owned by anyone, so who is rich enough and brave enough to promote bitcoin when they do not gain any profit from it? Furthermore, it is not a product that needs advertising to bring in revenue, it does not need anyone to maintain its existence and on the contrary, it is we who need it. Not to mention, an extremely high-quality product does not need to spend money on advertising, as long as people use it and share it with each other, it will bring a huge multiplier effect. That's the difference between bitcoin and the rest of the world.",

Bitcoin does not need any advertisement to gain its popularity, it’s have made its first wave and It is listed on every Cryptocurrency exchange, unlike other coins. The price ticker regularly flashes on CNBC and Bloomberg TV. Free advertising. It has a first mover advantage. For better or worse bitcoin is the original, others are copies. Most of the other cryptos are built off the original bitcoin codebase.   Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to gain widespread attention and has become synonymous with the broader concept of digital currency. Note that there are many other cryptocurrencies, each with their own characteristics and advantages. However, Bitcoin's early adoption, limited supply, and strong security have allowed it to establish itself as the most popular cryptocurrency of all time. Bitcoin is very difficult to hack because it uses a distributed ledger called blockchain to record transactions. This security feature has made Bitcoin attractive to investors looking for a safe haven. It has a large and growing network of users, which has helped increase its awareness and acceptance as a legal currency.",

It will be their loss when entering at too high a price. Even we warned when the price was still quite cheap.If Satoshi is still alive?That's a statement stating that Satoshi is dead, you need to correct it again. We don't know if Satoshi is alive or dead and we don't know if Satoshi is a person or just a group.
