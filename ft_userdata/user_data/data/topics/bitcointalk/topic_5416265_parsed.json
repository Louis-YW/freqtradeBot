Our core attributes being awareness, sustainability and abundance,encouraging our customers a more natural approach to living. https://merkaba.nz/With The Cardano Block-Chain, we found much we resonate. Open source,decentralized, Proof of Stake. Being one of the most eco-friendly BlockChains, Cardanostrives for balance, and sustainability. In a world where the circulation of cash hasnotably reduced and on the cusp of branching international, Merkaba, HempInnovations core currency, was the natural step in our progress.https://merkaba-token.io/The VisionTo build a new cryptocurrency on the Cardano Block-Chain, In which generates enoughcirculation to be adopted as a currency. Leading the front in branching Block-ChainExplorers to tangible goods. Providing access to consumers not only with our owngoods, but extending this means of purchase to collectives with similar attributes.Built on Cardano?MERKABA, native to the Cardano Block Chain.It is a competitive world with all the different ecosystems in place, each making its claimas the next greatest network.After combing through, and trialing many, the team here from Merkaba found Cardanonot only superior, but the MOST user friendly.We are so grateful to the Cardano community, and aim not only to support all of thoseinvolved, but to guide as many new members (that of the general public, and fromcompeting block chains) to the Cardano Block Chain.COST EFFICIENTNo ImportingNew buyers/traders quite often can get tripped up on gas fees, not only in trading, buteven at times simply as 'importing' a token to your wallet on numerous networks.Despite this already being complex for some users, here on the Cardano Block chainwe have this luxury where not only is there no gas fees for importing a token, once anew Token or Asset arrives in ones wallet, you can view this automatically.Cheap gasAt currently 0.16 ADA per transaction, which is $0.4US(approx), this is quite a margincheaper than some of competing Networks. We find higher gas fees intimidate newusers wanting to diverge in the crypto world, but quickly find it too expensive. Cardanoallows access to a much wider community.ECO FRIENDLYMiningCardano claims to be \"the most environmentally sustainable\", with its mining processconsuming a substantial amount less energy than alternative networks. Sustainabilityand eco alternatives are at Merkaba's core, so it is only natural our team chose to buildon Cardano.LESS CONGESTIONCardano evolvesAs different Crypto's generate more popularity, so too do they generate morecongestion. The founder of Cardano Charles Hoskinson and his team have found aningenious means to surpass this. This is achieved, with the introduction and utility ofEpochs in his system he dub's 'Ouroboros'. This blockchain can scale in a linearmanner at a new block with more users.MERKABASomething RealMerkaba, the collective, has been present for at least 7 years. Merkaba Token, is a fullrepresentation of that. Our token is heavily intertwined with our collective, our brandingand our team. Where you find many starting out once their token is a success, wealready have a physical store presence, and nationwide awareness.In New Zealand, there is a notable reduction with cash circulation, this opens thedoorway for new currencies to take its place. In a country based on greener living,where crypto is something people are only just waking up to, we will teach Cardano isthe Natural direction for such progress.RoadMap26/04/2022PHASE 1-Develop Token-Discord Giveaway-Commence marketing campaign-Private Sale-Presale-Merkaba Hemp merchandise sent to Influencers-Add Merkaba Token to the Cardano Token Registry-Listing on Cardano Dex (MuesliSwap)-Create Merkaba/ada LP (SundaeSwap)-Airdrop Giveaway-Launch!-4200 holdersPHASE 2-Audit-Marketing Campaign-Coingecko Listing-Coinmarketcap Listing-Burn 10% of Token Supply & burn 89% more-Adopt Cryptocurrencies To Our Flagship Store-8400 holdersPHASE 3-Collaborations With Stores to Accept Merkaba token-Collaborations With Platforms to Accept Merkaba Token-Exchange Listings.-16800 holders-Merkaba Accepted as a CurrencyPHASE 4 (Extended Projects)-Merkaba NFTs-Mobile App-Merkaba Wallet-Merkaba DEXTokekomicsOriginal Supply: 42,000,000,000,000Total Remaining Supply: 420,000,000,000157,000,000 $MKA sold during private sale.746,000,000 $MKA sold during presale.Decimal Place: 2Burn: 4,200,000,000,000 10% 99%Marketing: 42,000,000,000 10%Available Supply: 239,400,000,000 57%Liquidity Pool: 29,400,000,000 7%Listing Allocation: 21,000,000,000 5%Development: 21,000,000,000 5%Team: 12,600,000,000 3%Airdropped: 12,600,000,000 3%Collaborating Liquidity Pools: 21,000,000,000 5%Rewards System: 21,000,000,000 5%DistributionThe team from Merkaba has a smooth and calm approach to navigating such volatilemarkets. Slowly releasing our token out in a structured manner in which not onlyicentivices our holders, but preserves our price, encouraging stable growth.Private sale/PresaleWe hosted over a period of three months. This duration was longer than most, butdesigned with the intent to filter out overnight investors likely to dump as we reach themarket, whilst taking the time to develop our project in a structured manner for thoselong term investors. Highlighting our patience as a presence that is soon to be reflectedon exchanges.Liquidity PoolConcentrating our initial official Liquidity Pool to SundaeSwap, releasing a small portionof our overall liquidity pool supply. We will continue to feed this pool over a period oftime so as not to flood the market.AirdroppedOur team has formulated a structured ‘Airdrops’ roadmap, distributing Merkaba at ascaling ratio, designed to generate the maximum awareness, flourishing our project,whilst maintaining genuine benefits, to those who receive.In conjunction with this, utilizing facilities provided by DripDropz, we have a ‘slow feed’release, continuous to each epoch, with the base rate of 42 $MKA available to allstaking wallets, and 420 $MKA available to staking wallets delegated to partner pools,(those partnered with DripDropz, and [DEEP]Deepend).Reward SystemWith the latest release of our Series 1 cNFT collection, and potential of futurecollections. We have an allocated amount of $MKA to incentivise holders of our cNFTs,and to encourage the value of these to increase.Collaboration Liquidity PoolsBuilding on Cardano, we respect the ever growing community that drives the blockchain. We aim to collaborate with many projects in a diverse manner of ways, part ofwhich includes the formation of Liquidity Pools, offering communities the opportunity totrade Fungibles directly with these friendly projects.Tangible GoodsHemp ProductsOver the period of seven years, Merkaba, as a Hemp Collective, has beenproducing/buying and distributing hemp products. Growing from what once was amarket table, now stands with a physical Bric n’ Mortar store based on the main streetof our hometown, Raglan, New Zealand. It is these products which are soon to bereleased internationally, and purchased with our own currency.Pairing StoresOnce all systems are in place, and we find transactions processed in a fluid manner, wewill approach like minded collections/communities, offering a similar format/process ofoperations facilitating a new means for their transactions of goods and services, withour currency at its core.DevelopmentOne of the many virtues of hemp is its versatility. With this sacred plant, lays thepotential to create a natural approach to just about any industry. As Merkaba, Raglan’sHemp Collective continues to develop, so too does our range of products.SourceAt present, our expertise around growing is mostly practiced through consultation. Ourhandmade products are produced from raw materials, supplied from hemp crops grownin the South Island. Products we can not yet produce in New Zealand, are imported. Asour resources increase, we hope to be producing directly from our own fields.TeamDaniel LeishmanFounder - CEOLawal MusaCommunity ManagerPascal WeimannLead StrategistMathew HeltonMarketing ManagerConclusionThe founder of Cardano, Charles, views the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies beyondany protocol or utility, respecting the system of community. Building from these virtues,we experience now what he set out to achieve, a better Block-Chain than those whoprecede.Merkaba token, grown from passion at its core, and at its heart is our community. Withhemp, we generate awareness, and spread abundance, reconnecting everyone back toa natural, more sustainable way of living. With our token we will do just the same. Wewill generate further awareness around the most eco friendly and sustainable blockchain, Cardano. Hemp is a renewable resource, something we can cultivate inabundance. Help us generate this awareness and share this abundance back with you,encouraging healthier lifestyles and sustainable living.",
