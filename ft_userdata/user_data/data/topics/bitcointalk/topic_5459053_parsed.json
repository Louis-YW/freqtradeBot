      "body": "Honestly, I don't see anything justifying the term \"Most Effective\" when it comes to mixers, because you don't offer anything that other similar services don't offer. However, you offer something you don't list as \"Key Features\", which is the ability to mix ETH and USDT.As for Switzerland, I would not agree that servers in that country provide any extra security, and I believe that the Swiss cooperate with everyone who sends them a request when it comes to possible money laundering, terrorist financing, and similar things.Since this service is new, I recommend caution until the legitimacy of the service is established.",

I am sure if the management is dedicated enough and have done research about their competitors then some day they will start attracting clients and establish a good business.Quote from: MixGuru on July 08, 2023, 09:51:43 AMWe're MixGuru! - For the past 2 years we have been developing an innovative & trusted mixing tool designed to restore & maintain on-block anonymity, using CoinJoin technology to provide users with untraceable coins, protecting their identity and keeping transactions private - All housed within a simplistic & accessible User-interface teamed with 24/7 customer support.2 years is a long time. The domain registered only couple months ago if I am not wrong. I am assuming you were in the development phase all those time and tested it offline. To improve the service I think you need a .onion version. You also need a dedicated bitcoin address that will represent your brand name and all sorts of verification should be done using this bitcoin address. A public PGP key will help too. Last but not the least, a proper marketing plan. Let me know if you already have that. I have bitcointalk marketing experience and providing the service for the last few years. I can help you with that if you need any improvement anywhere. Here is my service page: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5328445.0Welcome to the Bitcointalk community.",
