  "content": "Greetings all,we are happy to announce that we have successfully developed a software background service that mines crypto while you charge your electric vehicle. We've been developing it since 2019 to make it stable and reliable. The technology uses the kWs that are not being used by the EV while charging and uses the charging station full power. Use your EV as passive income with a few simple steps. You can see which cryptocurrencies can be mined/hour on the different types of charges in the table below:Charger typeETCBTCDOGEMonero22kW0.0040.00020.050.03450kW0.0910.00040.110.075120kW0.1010.00080.1820.14180kW0.1380.00100070.20030.21The software is optimized for BMW, Kia, Fiat, Nissan, Mini, Renault Hyundai, Volkswagen, Audi, and Skoda it is being installed as a feature through an OBD, it does not affect any of the systems on the vehicle as it is installed separately. The software can be installed through a remote session all over the world.Why loosing all these precious kWs while charging your car and not make them as a passive income during your charging station stay Price: 0.28 BTCThe price is for a car and it's a lifetime purchase with NO other subscriptions or fees.  Inquiries and purchases for now can be done as a request to our email office@sftdx.com or just DM us until we launch the official site.",

What are requirements for network connection?Any video, documentation? What is the power consumption?We have more than 6 months delegated in testing and collected data for each of the brands we support as described in the previous post. It is usb powered device and uses the internet connectivity of the vehicle if it has or if it doesn’t it needs mobile data as a hotspot or wifi connection while charging but this device is only for operating with the grid, the mining is done through the hardware of the charging system on each vehicle . It does not use the vehicles battery it uses the available electricity power that the charging point has. Contact us on our email and we will send you demonstration video of how it worksQuote from: coolindark on September 27, 2022, 08:59:02 AMI don't want to be offensive BUT why a person will pay 0.28 BTC for an unknown software will place in your car's ECU? Also even it's legitimate you need to charge your 180W battery for at least 280 times for ROI. This looks so suspicious... Typical charging of an EV is every single day. We’ve put a lot of effort and RND to make it happen so the price is calculated due to this. Also the average option cost for an option for a vehicle is 0.07 BTC at the current rates. Last but not least the main point at this stage of the market is to cover the expenses for electricity as the prices nowadays are constantly rising.",
