I have removed it and it's been running smoothly ever since.I'm now overclocking the crap out of the other two, I don't care if this T17 breaks, it is a really bad model and a waste of a good $1000.",

Later on, it stopped detecting the first board showing \" failed to detect all chips\". That's how I decided to remove it.But I'll remove a \"healthy board\" and replace the one I think is faulty. If it works, then your theory is right, maybe it was a PSU thing all along.",
