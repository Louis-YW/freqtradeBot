To fully utilize the services provided by KuCoin, it is necessary to undergo the KYC process. Therefore, if you want unrestricted access to KuCoin, completing the KYC is required",

Exchanges and other centralized sites are the ones that require memo. Not required on a noncustodial wallet. If the memo is not correct on centralized sites, like exchanges that would be a problem that will require you to contact customer care. The exchange may have rules for such issue that might lead to money loss, rules like if the amount sent is not up to certain amount. In anything like this, centralized sites are always not better than you having your private key. Some exchanges have given me problem before, but noncustodial wallet can not because it is my keys and coins, not an exchange keys.With the correct ripple address and tag, I remember when I sent ripple to my one of my exchange accounts and nothing reflected until the second day when they refund me after contacting their customer care, ripple falled that time and I lost more than 30% of my money because I wanted to withdraw to fiat. That is just one of many examples, others which I won't be able to discuss for now. Do not compare exchanges and noncustodial wallet, it is not your keys on exchanges.",
