What annoys me is that newbies invest in bitcoin without doing DCA and expect a have a certain profit within a period of time.",

      "body": "It depends on each of us, we all have different strategies, targets and sales thresholds. We also have different notions of risk, as well as different sensitivities to FUD and the negative buzz in the industry.Some people choose to invest only what they can accept as a potential loss, and under these conditions it is always easier to hold on to the long term.Others simply don't have the knowledge and understanding to have a sincere desire to hold their BTC, and the same goes for self-discipline, it depends, we are only human after all.The important thing is that people are happy when they sell their BTC, that they do not sell it at a loss or with regrets. For example, selling BTC right now might make sense if you came home with purchases made at 15-16k, although in my opinion it would be better to wait.We are 1 year away from the next halving, so we can speculate that next year and the year following the halving, the price will tend to be active in terms of movement. In my humble opinion, it is better to wait and see what happens after the halving, so as not to miss out on future profits. But no one, neither you nor I can claim to know what the FIAT value of BTC will be in the future, so in any case, no one selling their BTC should be judged negatively for doing so.",

There is more to Crypto trading or investment, not everyone can bear the risk especially when the market is not moving so well but a lot of people don’t know this, they only join because of the benefits they have been hearing people enjoy. He joined because he doesn’t want to miss out but since its clear he can’t keep up I advise he should withdraw immediately for his own safety.Quote from: SatoPrincess on March 19, 2023, 07:32:54 AMNot everyone can be patient to hodl for long term, some people lack the discipline it takes to be a bitcoin traders/investor.

It could be that he invested more than he can afford to lose, that’s why he’s always concerned about every little dip in the market. I also believe that the reason he is so concerned is that he has invested more money than he can afford to lose. Some people don't conduct enough study before investing in or trading in bitcoin, which usually doesn't pan out well for them because they were hoping for a quick and large return. To invest or trade bitcoin successfully, you need to have discipline and be ready for the worseI’ve seen this numerous times not to invest what you can’t afford to loose and never invest money you have later plans for but some people will still ignore.",

Money meant for short term expenses should be kept away from bitcoin because of the volatility. Should this money be invest in it one could lose some of it, if the market stays bearish for that short term. Only long term investment money can easily be saved in bitcoin to avoid much risk",

Price volatility, security risks, user errors and other threats can make your bitcoin disappear and you will have to bear the loss. But we are not only thinking about the negative things, while many other positive things such as future potential can also be expected. In the end, the best advice is always to invest what you can afford to lose and minimize any risk.Optimism about the future and the possible long-term gains is what we often hear from many people. But that's not without reason, and in my opinion bitcoin is one of the best performing investment assets compared to gold or other physical investment assets.",

If you often look at the charts, it always leads to wrong actions.It is hard to stop looking at your wallet often as a new new investor but I think the best advice is to look at it periodically. Sometimes people are not patient enough to wait until they make some reasonable amount of profit. Having a good investment plan could help new investors stay focused and not distracted by predictions from all corners. Not investing more than you are able to loss is another helpful tip for new investors because it will reduce anxiety and fear.Quote from: Ndabagi01 on March 19, 2023, 02:59:18 PMMy advice now is to keep holding out for better days. When the market is in an uptrend, don't get too excited about small price increases. Wait for the mega bull run, and you'll be so excited you didn’t touch any of those coins during this period of temptation.People can sell their coins because of pressing needs or uncertainties such as health issues or other problems. These circumstances might make an investor not to wait for the bull run. It is also possible that it is the profit margin the investor has set for his investment. If he gets to his profit margin, the next action is to sell his coins. But if his motivation to sell is influenced by the fear of the unknown, he should be patient because the big bull run is coming.",
