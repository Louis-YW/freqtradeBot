If you are OK with that and it is a legit bet and nothing is fraudulent to your account, you will get paid. They have been online since 2 years and have always paid so far out. You can check the reputation section; there were some accusations but they have all been solved!",

But for your more information, bigger bets always alarm the casino and will check you thoroughly so a KYC will be always be asked and other related docs. Once okay then good for you but sometimes casino will give you opposite response that you violate this and that.",

Any reputable casino, if it lets you bet an amount, and doesn't block it or give you a message about it, will pay you if you win. What happens is that after certain amounts you may be asked for KYC, as you have been told, which happens in almost all casinos nowadays. So don't be surprised if they ask for it.",

Be prepared for KYC though since high wins like this would most likely put you on their list of accounts to watch, and once you want to withdraw them then they'll likely hit you with that. Casinos aren't exactly poor plebs that they'd risk the reputation they built from years of operation for what, $40,$50k. Or, as I said earlier, if they've clearly set the limit then they've clearly set it up so that the max you'd get would be that amount no matter what you do, which is on their side of things so I see no need to worry about that too much.",

I don't think opening a fresh thread to ask this kind of question is very necessary, if this question is specific to Duelbits Casino, then you can ask the representative directly on their announcement thread, you will have all the answers you need to your questions instead of speculations but if this general, then I must say that as long they are on bitcointalk for a while, you will likely get paid your winnings as long as you don't violate their terms and condition and KYC is now a problem with most of this casinos, always get one at your fingers in case they want to use that as an excuse for not paying.",

If that person has no problems at the casino, the casino will pay for it without taking too long. But if the casino's balance cannot pay it off, maybe the casino will tell the winner to be patient for a while and will send it two or three times until it is paid off. But usually, if the casino is big and reputable, it will pay the winners and maybe share the success story with the public or its social media. But it is also possible for the casino to withhold the winnings if the account looks suspicious to make sure everything is safe.",
