They are regretful when that money is actually meant for something else and they gamble it.I felt this one time that I should have new car tires already if I just listen to my gut feeling that I will lose what I just won. With a capital of $50 and then turned it into $230, its one reason to stop but I didnt.",

It’s normal to feel a short term remorse if you lose instead of being happy about your losses. If you are destroying your life or affect all the person surrounded you due to this remorse feelings then this is the time to be alert because you are already causing damage. I’m gambling what I can afford to lose but I’m still feeling upset when I lose a bet or my total bankroll because that’s how our emotion works. Money is important to us regardless if that is just disposable money. Don’t be alarmed if you are still upset  when you lose because even professional player feel the same. They just don’t make it long term and just let go in short period of time.",

Just use the amount that you can afford to lose to gamble and you will not feel remorseful if you lose. But if you lose a big amount of money, or the money meant for your parent or relative to gamble and you can not lay back, that can make you feel more than remorseful because you will be depressed and be looking for ways to get the money back.",

You shouldn't be gambling when you carry strong emotions like that every time you play. Maybe this applies a lot when the money lost from betting was meant to fund something else.",

It might be triggered by loss of funds, unethical practice, or due to cultural or religious beliefs. You might be remorseful if you gamble more than your budget and lost, it will bring regret and remorse. Also when you cheated or violated the terms and conditions of the casino because you want to cheat the system, it could lead to remorse. When your religion or culture forbids gambling and you fail to obey these laws it could also bring the feeling of regret. You might feel remorseful because you have committed a sinful act. Gambling is meant to be a fun filled event, so we must avoid any act that will make it a sad experience. You need to be alert when you feel remorseful because of the money you spent on gambling because it might be a sign of over-gambling.",

Feelings of regret always appear even when experiencing a large amount of money loss but regretting it is not the right thing because you can never return things to how they were before.It's better to learn from mistakes and forget about regrets so you can be more careful and also always consider everything so that what makes you regret doesn't happen again.Too much regret for mistakes will have a bad impact on ourselves because it only worsens our thoughts and moods so that in the end we gamble carelessly.",

Therefore, for me personally saying about regret after gambling seems like an inappropriate expression but yes, I also know that of course it will be different for other people. But for me personally, even though I had a losing streak in gambling, as far as I can remember I have never regretted it and thus, I will try to do it better and be more careful.",

I have had this feeling several times, and in all those cases I lost money that I did not intend to gamble with. I think that remorse is a useful feeling that allows us to pay attention to things we don't see right away. In my opinion, remorse is something like an inner voice that sometimes needs to be listened to.",

Is he regretful because he promised his girlfriend to not gamble anymore?It really depends on how serious is the situation the gambler is involved with. Sometimes we feel remorse for details or insignificant things, therefore it's not something you should be alert about. You just have to take easy with yourself.",

The same applies to the opposite when you ask yourself why you didn't bet more to win more. I don't gamble that much, so I have a good control of my spending in that regard. Most of my gambling happens when I meet a good gambling buddy of mine somewhere who loves all sorts of gambling. Because of that, I often keep him company but always keeping an eye to not get myself or those close to me in trouble with reckless spending.",

Now it's not about the loss of the money that erupts the feeling of remorse but the idea that your action has halt the project which was maybe supposed sort of an important piece of your career or achievement.
