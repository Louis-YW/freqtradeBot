  "content": "I was holding some OMI tokens in my trust wallet. Today i check and saw that it was showing the number of coins i held but not showing the price against it.I checked the details on coingecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ecomi) and saw the announcement that it has been migrated from its own chain (GoChain) to the new ERC20 contract. Now my concern is why my old tokens are not automatically converted to the new chain   Do I have to do some additional steps in order to move my coins from the old chain to the new chain?",

I think it's been more than a year since this token is migrated to a new chain however the good thing is that you are not late because the ECOMI team has given no time limit to make this swap. You may do it anytime.Detailed instructions on this swap can be found at ECOMI x Immutable Migration: Manual Token Swap. In case, you need to see visually step by step, you can watch this video OMI Token Swap Site Tutorial Using Trust Wallet & MetaMask (Full Tutorial)",

I will check sometime later when the gas fee is lower so I can do this conversion. Also, i wish the price of ECOMI tokens increases meanwhile",

It is true that you put your assets at risk if exchange hacked, but when you withdraw your money to the wallet, it is also at risk because of the possibility of burning these currencies, changing the smart contract, the need to follow technical news and the possibility of some blockchains to ban currencies even if they are inside your wallet.You was lucky that you can still access these currencies using https://medium.com/ecomi/ecomi-x-immutable-migration-manual-token-swap-294d37bfa0c7, but you may not be so lucky in the future, so if you do not devote yourself to following the news and updates continuously and weekly, keep it in exchanges.",

I believe Omi is trading on top platforms like okx, gate already. I just noticed they made another list announcement recent. Bitget is the newest platform onboard the train. https://twitter.com/ecomi_/status/1767145866916245917?t=NBG90Ki1kx3Wss2iXBiemg&s=19",

I just checked the coin as well and seen the price was a surprise to me ECOMI OMI Price $0.001105. and op I don't think you can see the token price in Trustwallet but you can see it in exchange. And also or if you want to see it or convert to the new chain then you have to update the token app to the latest wallet so that it will be automatically changed or you contact the owners on telegram or any social media platform they are using to ratify the problem.Those are some of the things I also observe from your complain.",
