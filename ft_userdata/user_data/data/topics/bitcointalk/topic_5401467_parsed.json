Riding on the back of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is the matter of India's GDP. Moving from a 6.6% contraction in the year 2020-2021 to an 8.7 then on to 8.9% growth in 2021-2022, it looked like they had cause to celebrate. But it looks like the celebration is short lived as concerns have been raised by policy makers, along with the Reserve Of India (RBI) as they regrettably announce it's first interest rate hike in at least four years. India, one of the countries with a high GDP, import more than 80% of its crude oil and is also the largest importer of edible oil, but with prices skyrocketing and inflation rising, it has taken a toll on their economy. According to the RBI, consumer inflation has hit a 6.95% and as a result, has slashed it's yearly growth forecast to 7.2%. Meanwhile, Prime minister, Narenda Modi gave an announcement earlier that plans to introduce tax breaks that will offset higher food and petrol costs are being made. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/28/india-economy",

      "body": "The problem started kick in when they gave state to state authorities on imposing the taxes. There is at least few cents of difference between petrol and diesel prices itself within the country. This is because India's Central government and State Government incurs the taxes on the basis of GST structure. This further divides into CGST and SGST meaning (Central & State Service Tax). This is not the bad part, the bad part is this tax is entirely different from the Import duty, which gets CESS added up. It's mind wobbling when you see the tax structure in here. Now, further to the case, after pandemic hit hard, India's economy was hampered too as the case with entire world. With Russia Ukraine war, India being friendly nation is now in ambiguity to whom to support. Though Russia has decreased a little charges on crude oil, government continues to recover the funds through taxes and thus everything is becoming very very costly in India. Its fuel, then causes cost appreciation in transport, logistics, products and services. The whole circle keeps rising.",

So the US-India relationship is on the rocks right now because of that move by India to buy cheap Russian crude oil when almost half of the world is condemning Russia for the war against Ukraine and US and it's ally put a sanctions on them.And then reports surfaces that India is reselling the oil to the US and the West that comes from Russia. For sure this is going to rise the tension now and their relationship is going to be tested.As for the rate hike, I think it's inevitable, countries economy has been devastated by the effect of the Covid-19 and it will take sometime for any government to recover from that. And now is the time to start and obviously, government's treasure chest is empty now and they have to find ways to bring money again thru new tax measures.",

India's internal oil consumption is so high that they have to import almost 94% of their consumption from other countries. India is buying Russian oil because They are getting it cheap. They are not reselling it to any other countries. read the below, https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-is-not-a-conduit-for-russian-oil-sales-jaishankar/article65491475.eceBuddy, try to understand US gameplan. US is the only country who has violated the human rights number of times. The countries like Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq are devastated due to their attacks. US is responsible for most number of wars in the history of humankind. US devastated the economy of Venezuela by imposing ban on them so they can't sell their oil to anyone. US has now looked at Europe and trying to bring down the Euro dominance. UK is supporting in this effort. Don't US know what will be happening in Europe if Russia stops oil and gas supply there? These commodities will become pricey so will the inflation and in turn the consumer goods will become pricey. The GDP will reduce so will the Euro dominance and its value. Whoever trust US and their actions, may God save them!",

There will be an increase of the oil supply, but I wouldn't call it \"drastic\". The oil price won't be dropping at levels below 100 USD anytime soon. The fuel prices will stabilize, but that doesn't mean that the fuels will become cheap and affordable.The Russians didn't  agree specifically to sell oil at discounted price to India, they are just selling it to whoever is buying.My country is consuming lots of Russian oil, but the gasoline and diesel prices are high and they keep going up, despite the cheap Russian oil.",

Hmm, India is buying oil at a discount rate but they are selling those oil by refining to European countries when oil price in their own country is skyrocketing. When people are suffering because of these price hikes then govt is making a hell lot of money. They can not reduce oil prices in their country when they are already buying it at a discount rate then how OPEC countries increased oil supply will decrease the oil price?",

The Prime minister is clearly aware of these issues after he has made deals to take on extra Russian oil at the now cheaper prices, however there is limited room for maneuver when you are in charge of the second most populous nation. India does produce a lot of exports in the form of food, but any imports will hit it hard because the average citizen is still fairly poor. It'll get little sympathy from places like Europe and America in future after being so duplicitous and failing to stand up for the free people of Ukraine.",

Or merely returning to pre-pandemic levels.It closely parallels the ongoing discussion as to whether global economies truly recovered from the 2008 crisis. A significant percentage of united states economic growth post 2008 was caused by the federal reserve injecting liquidity into stocks and bonds under QE (quantitative easing) programs. A high percentage of claimed economic growth in that era occurred in financial markets and was described by some as merely representing an expansion of the fed's balance sheet.It is possible that global economies have been caught in a bubble since the 2008 economic crisis. And later the global pandemic crisis. I'm certain we've all heard plenty of doom and gloom of the past 10 years predicting disaster. Its nothing new under the sun.I for one have to admit current era markets and economies are much more robust and durable than expected. India itself is no exception. I thought india's economy could be devastated by their rupee recalls. Tensions on the india china border which had some predicting future war, certainly did not help. But somehow economic disaster in india does not appear to have occurred. It is possible that modern day economies are more durable than equivalent economies in the 1920s. Improvements in communications, productivity, shipping, infrastructure and the internet could all contribute towards economies being more diversified and impregnable. I would guess india will be ok.",

That would exhaust the resources Russia can spend on the war very fast, they'd lose the war, be in a terrible economic position, and then Western countries could demand trial for war criminals and build new economic relations with the new Russia. That could all be over very fast, and that would in the end have had a smaller negative impact on global economy.",
