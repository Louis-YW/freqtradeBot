The only reason i could find valid is they never made changes but then again they have been doing business all this while,... so possibly i think the owners have been fed up of the things going on... they have been legit all the time ... and that could be the only reason they have left the crypto space...",

He was making decent money, but resigned in 2019 after they've aded KYC. He said the number of clients dropped by 50% after that and he wasn't making enough. He ended up putting his own ATM in a nearby shopping center where you could withdraw without limits and no KYC.

You can pay for any goods or services there including bank transfers, there is someone listing monero for sale there currently, but you can also get bullion, cash in the post and bank transfers.Particl also has a fully decentralised and trustless cross blockchain atomic swap exchange (basicswapdex.com). The developers are currently integrating the exchange directly into the marketplace so that you can pay in pretty much any cypto. So it's not so much a local bitcoins replacement as an \"any crypto\" to fiat, bullion and cash in the post replacement.The exchange is proving very popular with the monero community who have been extensively testing it and are considering including it as a plugin with their default wallet so any monero user can access the exchange as well.Here is a neat video on it: https://youtu.be/1gYNX4ue_O4",

It's called Particl marketplace. LB was an exchange, not a marketplace, the two are completely different.LB was used exactly because it was easy to deal with it, you would just look at the prices, decide from who to buy and which method, and at least here in EU with instant national transfers you could get your coins or funds in minutes and finish the trade.That's why some don't get why other solutions are not getting traction, as the situation is now fewer people care more about privacy than about how fast and easy things can be done, that's why Bisq has dozens of traders and Biance p2p thousands.Quote from: hugeblack on February 10, 2023, 07:13:35 AMI do not have charts for trading volumes, but the platform seems profitable, perhaps their profits decreased and therefore they preferred to stop rather than the platform dying, but the advertisement is somewhat strange.Most likely.https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/ALLTheir volume went down as BTC went down, from the 45 mils a week to 6 mils a week, at some point maybe the profit from it simply doesn't make sense anymore and you're better off just quitting. Assuming they are getting 1% of all that volume it would be $3 mil a year, with 50-100 highly paid employees in Europe as they claim just the wages and taxes and rent would drive that to almost zero. If he's an early adopter probably he has 100x more than what would be left over a year stashed in BTC already.",
