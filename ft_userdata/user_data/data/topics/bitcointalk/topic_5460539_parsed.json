I too would have done the same thing, as we say here in Italy \"there is no certainty about tomorrow\" I would have done the same and opt to get the prize as long as I would get half billion dollars who the f cares about the huge taxes.However I used to work in Italy as I have been working in many different countries and if I recall correctly there is something different,the winner of the best state lottery goes and claim it much further than the draw and usually I have seen in TV there people wearing masks to not let other people know who they are because of the risks associated with that.I doubt that in the USA it would consist of such risks but still even USA is a dangerous place when people know you have become filthy rich out of nowhere.",

The tax is part of the prize and every powerball knew that. They still just add the tax on the grand prize to make it more appetizing to all bettors.What really surprised me is someone claiming that he won jackpot prize publicly.",

I also think it's better to withdraw it directly even though it's taxed and don't get a lump sum payment it's better, than depositing it in the casino and or dividing it in half into two withdrawals it's the same, or it doesn't make a difference he will be taxed too.But if using two withdrawals doesn't get as big a tax as using one withdrawal, I think making two withdrawals is a good thing to reduce the tax that should be, and he gets money that shouldn't be paid for taxes, although yes he becomes a millionaire and the money is taxed doesn't affect him, but we need to remember that money with that amount of tax is really a shame if you don't have money or run out of money later.",

I'm confused, how would you type out one billion eighty-five million? wouldn't it be $1,085 Billion? so, why would a $1,080 with a \"billion\" next to it be mistaken for a trillion? I also wrote Billion next to it for more clarification.",

I think the government should know how to separate things and adopt another tax collection model in the lottery, for example, the government could charge tax when each person buys a lottery ticket, something like if a person were to buy a lottery ticket that cost 1.50$, so when that person paid the 1.50$, then 50% of the tax value would be deducted and the government would keep 0.75$ while the lottery organizers would keep 0.75$with that, when someone hits the winning ticket, that person would keep 100% of the amount they won, I think that only in this way would it be fair to all the people who win the lottery. now about this person who has already moved in while no one has seen any official government announcement, I think it is not good for someone to rush like that, mainly because she has not yet been declared the winner and has not yet received the money, she is exposing herself in an unnecessary way, mainly because nowadays there are many criminals and they could do her some harm while she has not received so much money from the prize",

Even the price money for the mart where the ticket was sold is a good amount for the owners to improve and take their business to the next level.

So we shouldn't even bother ourselves about them take a junk from it as tax as the remaining one will still be more than enough for the winner.Now my curiosity is, what if the winner fails to show up before the deadline? According to the video url you posted the man said, the winner has up to a year to claim their reward so what then happens if no one shows up to clim the reward of the lottery or comes after a year to claim the reward will she still be awarded or will her ticket become void?
