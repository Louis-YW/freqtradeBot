  "content": "After reaching similar oversold levels to January this year (~20), yesterday Bitcoin closed it's first Daily candle above oversold levels (<30) on the Relative Strength Index (RSI):In January this led to a 35% increase in price from $35K to $48K in the months to follow, but in May this was only a dead cat bounce from $28K to $32K before further downside. The equivalent rebound in percentage terms, even if price is to go lower, would be $19K to ~$25K.  Meanwhile, the Weekly RSI remains considerably oversold after reaching lower levels ever seen and is currently 27.5. Are you still expecting further downside before a recovery?",

      "body": "The rsi relies quite a bit on momentum too though, in the past when bitcoin has been oversold it's taken time and stagnation to bring it back to neutral (~50-60). I've seen long times of flux between those levels too (particularly 2018) so it's possible we could see the start of that. I think we're due some stagnation if we're in a bear market (and then for selling pressure to have an effect when buyers see nothing has happened for a while).",

      "body": "Good trading indicator, not sure if we are proven medium term yet though.  I use OBV which includes volume as well, depends on the exchange as volume is split also but roughly I find it useful.  That indicates we are fairly neutral now and with alot left to prove before prices into 30k or above is reliably achieved.    In momentum terms we are above weekly average and so long as we're staying above 20.5k I'm willing to take market as positive.  Also above 2 day average so its been quite a good week, closing the weekly bar will help with the longer term picture I guess; however just being flat today and tomorrow leaves us below the 200 week average & some will be shaken by that a little.   Momentum is fragile",

We stayed longer on this level before and we might wait a little longer with the current trend. We all know the next big thing will happen if a coin reach the oversold level, up trend are more possible to happen so better to watch out this but don’t expect too much and stay focused on that analysis.",

But as I do not like to look only at indicators, I do not rule out that there is some event that will push the price down, so I think we would go below $17k and we would be close to the Celsius liquidation price, if they do not add more collateral to lower the liquidation figure as they already did. But I think the figures below $20k are strong support and the rebound from falling back to those levels would not take long. What is clear to me is that the best of the cycle has already passed, unlike some, who I see them making some predictions that they seem to think they are in November 2021, and have not heard about what has happened after that.",

      "body": "We are in formation so big, that the best is to start looking at weekly or even monthly candles because dump is like 220 days old where last 3 months was only down without even a small dead cat bounce. And on the weekly candles bitcoin was not as oversold as it is now ... never.Same on the monthly candles. Recovery to 25k and even 30k is very possible even if we are about to see 10k per bitcoin in 2023.",

This is starting to look similar to $28.5K to $30.5K trading range, so while it doesn't look immediately hopeful, it's more likely price will return to the upper boundary of volume around $21.3K in order to retest resistance levels before any further downside.At least this time around there is some volume low down (around $19K) to act as support, but it's far from substantial. A temporary break of $20K wouldn't be confirmation in itself of further downside it seems. The month ends tomorrow, so ideally price would return to the 50 Month MA by end of day for a close around $21.3K. Another close below the 200 Week MA (without continuation of downside) would be insignificant imo.The Daily RSI otherwise remains bearish but hasn't yet returned to oversold conditions. A return to oversold conditions would more or less confirm a dead cat bounce:If the RSI can bounce from 30 (oversold level), possibly around $19K prices, then it would provide some hope, especially with the Weekly RSI still considerably oversold.",

You are right that it could and we have seen it do both ways for the same thing, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't check the charts and try to read what it is saying.I know that we should be not trusting charts alone and we should be ready for anything that could happen, but that doesn't change the fact that crypto is a volatile thing and it could go either what the charts are showing, or it could literally go the opposite way and it could screw us all. Which one it will do? We have no idea.",

It's a lot to ask for right now.Given price has already bounced once from local support, only to confirm more resistance above, it looks like less likely to do so as the support weakens, even if still possible.Quote from: dragonvslinux on June 30, 2022, 03:59:51 PMThis is also the last day of the Month.

Failure to do so makes the possibility of a bounce less likely.The RSI has again left oversold conditions, at a lower price this time it seems, around $19.5K, arguably finding support again from oversold conditions on the Daily time-frame. While some media outlets have incorrectly reported on a bullish divergence of the RSI on the Daily time-frame since falling below $20K, this isn't the case as the recent Daily closes didn't fall below the close of June 18th, even if this is a bullish sign in itself of making a higher low. Price has otherwise found support from the level it needed to find support from, which is a positive sign in a short-term. Getting rejected again from $20K again would further confirm the resistance above however, as what happened on July 1st, otherwise the target for the current move in the short-term would be $21K as referenced two days ago.",

Without a break of $21K price is still consolidating sideways in a bear trend continuation pattern. For longer-term trend, price needs to close back above the 200 WMA and clear $23K. Then we can consider a trend reversal in a more serious manner. For now, I just see short-term relief rally, until proven otherwise.Quote from: dragonvslinux on July 02, 2022, 02:52:10 PMWhile this means a push back to the resistance level of $21K and volume point of control becomes more likely, this is otherwise a bearish continuation pattern within a strong downtrend",

Had forgotten to check hash ribbons today until you posted this. It's true, the indicator is signalling that hash rate has recovered from it's correction (and lack of capitulation). While not yet confirmed without a buy signal (positive price action to follow), it's none the less a very exciting sign imo. It shows the network is regaining it's strength, and price will likely follow suit.Quote from: aoluain on July 05, 2022, 09:02:31 PMThere seems like something is going to happen......This I'm now starting to finally believe. The volitile price swings on lower time-frames between $18K and $20K is showing signs that's things are gearing up for a bigger move. Bears are casually shorting the price from $20K, but the bulls are yet again heavily defending $19K, irrespective of the short-term bearish price action. A buy signal with the hash ribbons indicator could really turns the tables imo.The Daily RSI is now starting to trend upwards are finding support from oversold conditions, after previously struggling to find buyers when returning to bearish.I still see $21K as strong resistance, but there's now an increasing chance that longer-term bullish momentum can over ride the short-term bearish sentiment.",
