Try asking the CIA miners. They use separate servers for hard drive plotting, maybe they can give you a solution. Can these servers be upgraded to 512 GB of RAM?Then you can make plotting using RAM resources.",

Usually, special motherboards with a large number of SATA ports are used for this mining. The server is needed only for plottingOnda B365 D32-D4 Magic Editionhttps://www.amazon.com/Motherboard-D32-D4-Magic-Ports-Mining/dp/B093SXQR8T",

If you are not interested in this and you do not need servers, then consider selling or leasing them.For example, these servers can be used to install an accounting program for a small company so that the server is not located in the office.",
