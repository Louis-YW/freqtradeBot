And then which country do you think will be the first to follow?I feel that any country that will use the US as a yardstick to kickstart a crypto strategic reserve will first understudy the US. A crypto strategic reserve will not do so well because of the country. Rather it will do so well because of the policies that created that enables it to thrive.Any country that wants to follow first will have to ask the basic question of how has it improved the economy of the US? Has the economy become more stable? What about their debt, has it decreased? And has the quality of life of the citizens improved? There are other questions which I feel they will ask too.While a crypto strategic reserve may work for a country as the United States, it may not work for another country with different dynamics.",

As far as Bhutan goes, their reserves come from not buying, but into mining. That's why they are selling it at some point to take profits. And then just continue to accumulate thru their mining.We haven't heard about the British government though, but maybe they are secretly buying already for all we know.",

As to which country would follow the US, there's a number of countries that have shown interest. The Czech National Bank, for example, has mentioned that it considers having a portion of its Euro reserve in Bitcoin. There are also countries like Argentina, Japan, Brazil, and others where bills for a Bitcoin strategic reserve are filed.Belarus has also considered going into Bitcoin mining to accumulate Bitcoin reserve. Even Russia could get into the game.

Switzerland QuoteSwiss National Bank is considering adding bitcoin to its reserves alongside gold. A public referendum could soon make Switzerland the first nation to officially hold bitcoin as a reserve asset.Germany QuoteIn Germany, influential voices such as former Finance Minister Christian Lindner have suggested that the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank consider bitcoin to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar.Hong Kong QuoteHong Kong legislator Wu Jiezhuang has advocated for integrating bitcoin into the city’s financial reserves, aiming to enhance economic resilience and stability. Russia QuoteAccording to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Russia has begun using bitcoin and other digital currencies for international transactions as part of its strategy to bypass Western sanctions and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar.BrazilQuoteBrazil has introduced the sovereign strategic bitcoin reserve, also known as RESBit, which aims to allocate some of its international reserves to bitcoin.Poland Quote Poland Presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen has proposed creating a reserve to transform Poland into a hub with favorable regulations, low taxes, and supportive engagement from banks and regulators.Maybe any of them listed countries or more might follow. I guess some are waiting for the US to start accumulating before they join the moving train. https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/01/03/nations-states-turn-to-bitcoin-as-a-strategic-reserve-asset/This thread: Everything you wanted to know about Bitcoin Strategic Reserve  by @fillippone is a good guide on Bitcoin reserve.",

And for me if I'm the head of a country, I wouldn't just follow what the US will do, I will secretly buy it and do not want to attract attention and be silent on how much our nation has bought.

As for other countries that have legalized cryptocurrency, such as Canada, Australia, or others, they may still be looking and considering whether or not a cryptocurrency reserve is needed in their country. Those countries may not be like Trump who is so hasty to launch a \"half-baked bitcoin reserve\", they may think more about the framework and discuss it further until it can be launched properly.",

We need to know that the executive order Trump signed to create the bitcoin reserve does not need to be passed by Congress, which means it can easily be repealed when a new president takes office. Calling it strategic reserves is not wrong, but it is not entirely correct because it is not approved by Congress and national reserves are managed by the Fed, not held by the government. What we should be more concerned about is the bitcoin reserve bill that Senator Lummis proposed, as it will be introduced to Congress and passed. The national strategic bitcoin reserve will only be perfect with congressional approval.",

Not much, I think, for now; reserves of crypto are not something that many countries dream of, given the fluctuation conditions. Just look at how America makes a reserve only from criminal seizures. Their policy is not as strong as El Salvador's. Just look at the current many countries trying to be strong, such as China. Quietly, they developed their technology without much news. One of them is AI Deepseek, which has caused a stir in the world economy. I don't think there will be many countries that follow America, but making room for crypto development seems to be increasing. In addition, its growth will probably lead to more investors believing in Bitcoin.",

Actually, before now some other countries have been discussing about it but it seems they have been waiting for the US to approve theirs first. It will come as a shock to see that countries we do not expect will be the first ones to adapt it. But if i should predict which countries will follow. I can say those countries that have more stable economic system, no government ban on Bitcoin, and the country that has enough money to cover for the reserve. Some countries might be willing to start but finance might be a problem. You know the US government has more than enough to reserve Bitcoin. If this strategic reserve works out as planned from now till the maturity date. Trust me, the US will buy 10x of what they bought now again.",

The idea of ​​selling gold is not a viable solution because to do that, they need to convince the Fed and as we all know, the Fed has nothing to do with the US government's strategic bitcoin reserve fund established by Trump. Overall, many ideas have been put forward but the problem is that they are not feasible and US government spending is in trouble. Don't say they will have more money to buy more bitcoin to add to their reserves.Any spending by the US government must be approved by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and we need to know that the Democratic Party holds half of the seats in both houses.https://www.yahoo.com/news/senate-vote-advancing-gop-funding-160005843.html",
