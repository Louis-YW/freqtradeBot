  "content": "Hello everyone,We are currently looking for a skilled developer to help us create a package for VEIL that will make it easy for mining pools to integrate VEIL-ProgPow into their systems. We believe that this will make it easier for miners to access VEIL-ProgPow and help to ensure a more decentralized mining ecosystem.Our goal is to create a plug-and-play solution that can be easily implemented by any pool that wants to add VEIL-ProgPow. We're looking for a developer who has experience in mining pool software and can create a package that is user-friendly and easy to install.We would like to clarify that this project will be community-funded and not funded by the VEIL team. We believe that community-driven initiatives like this are an important part of building a strong and decentralized network.Additionally, we would also like to invite any existing mining pools who are interested in adding VEIL to their platform to reach out to us. We believe that by making VEIL available on more platforms, we can further support the decentralization of the network and make it more accessible to a wider range of miners.If you're a developer or pool operator who is interested in working with us on this project, please reach out to us. We're open to discussing the details of the project and compensation.Thank you for your time, and we look forward to hearing from you!",
