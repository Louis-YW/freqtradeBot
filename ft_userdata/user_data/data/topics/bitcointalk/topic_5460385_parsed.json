If the explanation first doesn't work then do it secretly if you still want to gamble. But i don't think someone who has to be inherited to their children have the mindset of not giving it to their children for something like that, but maybe who knows. Now if you can be patient following your father is a good decision, once you get your inheritance then do the gambling again lmao.",

If there's money that I will easily get if I stop gambling and the amount is big enough that I can't even win it through gambling even if I master a good betting strategy, then I will quit gambling and have that money. If we are realistic, however, we know that there isn't this method that makes us easily win in gambling, even in sports betting. In reality, even if we only bet on heavy favorites, it still doesn't guarantee us that we will be profitable overall. Also, in real life, anybody could easily pretend that he/she is not anymore gambling even if he/she is. So, in this case, one could still get his/her inheritance without really quitting gambling.",

But in your case, you are not wasting it instead you have made a strategy that is to keep winning but AFAIK, there is no such one or two strategies that will keep you winning all the time.This means to say, one time will come when your strategy will not work, even if you have so much experience. But if you are into gambling for so long and your father knew that, and he also knew that, once your strategy will be failed then you will lose money so that's why he (your father) hesitates to give away all the money in gambling.Even he didn't want to inherit his money to a gambler's son. And he made a quite good condition for you, because he has earned the money with effort, not by just risking money and earning more money in gambling. So, this condition of 5 years will make him trust on you with multi-millions. The amount is so big that, even a normal gambler will think how he will use that much money to make it double, triple and end up having nothing. So does his father. If I am in your place, I will quite gambling and turn to a good pathway which leads to a healthy and wealthy life full of happiness.",

If that's the case then you should stop for the sake of the million dollar inheritance.I would not consider crazy against gambling let alone follow his desires, we know gambling is more losing than winning, so it's better to win the inheritance by any means because gambling in online casinos can be secretly without your father knowing, and that whenever you want you can play again as many people state.",

Having financial security is more important than the enjoyment I get from gambling which can easily be replaced by other forms of entertainment. No matter how successful you have been in sports betting, the outcomes are still out of your control and it would be nearly impossible to consistently be on the winning side and still earn large sums of money. Winning big requires big risks. I would be more satisfied with guaranteed money from inheritance.",

This addiction makes traditional methods of collecting money such as a job seem impossible to you, why wait until the end of the month to get money when you can earn it within a day or two? Why establish a company from scratch and wait five years and you can achieve millions from gambling? why plant the land and wait for the crop and you can earn in less than 24 hours.If the gambling mentality becomes dominant in your thinking, it is better to stop gambling, no matter how profitable it is, because it will destroy your life, no matter how much you achieve profits.Destroying your life is not only by losing your money, but by losing your sense of the value of patience and waiting to get incentives, whether those incentives are salary, financial incentives, or even in your personal life such as wife and children, family, sports and others.",

Primarily, individuals who are gambling are the ones who are willing to make more money simply out of luck instead of working harder or going the traditional pathway of minting dollars. Gambling is a form of entertainment which can be risky enough where we can lose entirely and end up in the middle of nowhere but risking the money which has (possibly) been earned by your parent or inheriting and risking your great-grandparents money is entirely off the charts.On a personal note, if I was in such a situation as mentioned in the topic I would never inherit the money wholly and risk them. Rather, I would donate them partially to the needy and leave my gambling addiction and build a casino startup to create a better gambling world with the remaining money. Through this, even if you are at the risk of losing the inheritance when your company fails you have tried to build something in your field rather than wasting your time in so called luck!",
