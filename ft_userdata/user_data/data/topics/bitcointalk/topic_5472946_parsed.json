You can talk about gambling with him and also talk about games that you are using to gamble and also know how much that you are gambling with. I think you have known all these already. All you have to do is to just advice him because I think you are close already, but in a polite way like you are not advising him. He will have something to talk about it, if he says it is not affecting him, just leave it be.Know first when he started gambling, if it has been a long time like over 10 years, I do not think he needs advice. I do not think someone that has been gambling for over 10 years needs advise. But if it is not long, like a year or two years ago, you can discuss about it like not in an advice way and give your own opinion which the man can see as an advise.",

Gambling I know might be one thing he enjoys doing but getting addicted to it isn't good for an aged man",

He will be thinking about something that he is doing even before he knows you, and suddenly you came and told me to stop. Which I believe he will see as bad; however, why don’t you just free him and let him continue his gaming activities as he has been doing since he is only doing it for fun and he has money already, even though he has already retired, but there is a pensioner monthly and also children to support him when he needs financial assistance, which is why I said you should just leave him.",

Another fact is, it is quite an impossible task to change the habits of a senior citizen all of a sudden and probably that is one of the few things he can enjoy now.",

So why do elderly people gamble? For fun!The problem is if your neighbor ends up committing his entire retirement to gambling or if he owes money to the bank, this could even affect his heirs' income in the future.Other than that, I don't see many problems for him.",

You said he gambles only during the weekend, I don't see anything bad in that, but if he is really addicted to gambling, he should be gambling maybe every day or almost every day.You said his children don't know about gambling addiction, it's better you keep it away from them. If the children don't notice it by themselves, they shouldn't hear it from you that their father is addicted to gambling. You shouldn't try to cause some problems in the family. If you are close to the person, you can just caution him about his gambling activities if he is going to listen to you, but if you are not close to him, then it's better you mind your business, don't involve yourself in things that will end up causing problems for yourself.",

It might sound disrespectful as a neighbor to intrude into another person privacy and want to advice him on what to do and how to live his life.",
