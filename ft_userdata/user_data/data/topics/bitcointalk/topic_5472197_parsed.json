This is an old casino that is somehow forgotten and then comes back to life once again.I'm not sure if they are already asking KYC but in the early days of Bitcoin, they don't. There are similar games as Keno but in some casinos, they call it lottery. So basically, it's in every casino today. There is even Keno in https://www.betcoin.ag",

Shuffle has many original games including keno. Apart from that, Shuffle also has a vault. I like this feature so I can save my balance there. Maybe you thought I suggested shuffle because I used the shuffle signature. But seriously, shuffle is great in terms of UI and gaming options. You can take a look, if you don't like it you can look for another one",

But I did not know OP is talking about a particular game called keto which are games about food or something like that. This is the first time that I heard about it. I look for such game on livecasino but I was unable to see it, but it is a good casinos and it has many games.House games are those games that originally provided by the casino and not from other 3rd party games. It‚Äôs not about specific game but rather who developed the game. Livecasino.io understandably doesn‚Äôt have house game since they focus more on live games which they still doesn‚Äôt have on there own.I believe their sister company cover the house games especially like the Bitcasino Blackjack.I think you might be interested to try https://www.l0tt0.com/, it‚Äôs not a keno but it offers different lotto variations which is same mechanics to keno.",

Not considering that every user's preference is different...and for that fact, different users are treated based on This said preference... A user might desperately be seeking ways to dupe a casino and, what happens at the end when all efforts becomes futile? THIS!

Hard to believe this is fair.Also, when you bet 0 or some cents you are winning, once you put in real number the graph goes red and will never recover.Just my own experience and observation, online casino games are not worth the time.
