  "content": "A survey showed the optimism that most large cryptocurrency investors present for the coming months. The respondents also expressed that their confidence in the progressive improvement of these assets could be extended for many more years, since the expectations regarding these are very high.QuoteIn the outlook category, 63.5% of the respondents expressed optimism for the crypto sector over the next 12 months. And when the time frame was extended to a decade, 88% of the surveyees indicated a positive outlook for crypto.Source: https://cryptopotato.com/over-60-of-institutional-investors-bullish-on-crypto-for-next-12-months-survey/Seeing this type of news from people in this category, with so many years of experience in the cryptographic market who consider that investing in these assets continues to be and will continue to be one of the best decisions that could be made, since it will probably continue to bring surprises later. , they fill one with confidence and security, but for those who until now are entering this world and are afraid of what will happen. And I wonder how many people in this forum who have also spent years learning and handling cryptocurrencies, specifically bitcoin, think the same way as these influencers. How great is your optimism that increases in volatility will be seen again? Increases that could become historic.",

I don't actually give much attention to those you call influencers because they are all out doing what they know best, but there is no perfect expert out there who can give a 100% adequate price prediction unless the person wants to tell me that they are in charge of market manipulation. Bitcoin is on the rise, and the more institutions and other huge and recognized bodies are buying the idea of allowing their investors to also partake in some share of Bitcoin investment, the higher the limit to which Bitcoin could possibly reach. I can say that we might likely see a bull run that could get us close to the previous ATH, which we last sighted at $68k, so if Bitcoin could ever break this record again, Then another history will be made, which will be another look up to price, which will double the investment of a lot of people who are patient enough to hold till when that will eventually happen, price will pump to a level that we don't expect. That's certain; the only thing I see as uncertain is the actual time and date that it will occur.",

The interest stays on it and based on my experience, it's scary at first until you experience the first halving of your life and then the bull run and there goes the bear market. So for someone who's optimistic of Bitcoin's growth, I'll likely wait until it reaches newer highs such as 6 digits to 7 digits and even more.",

We are almost at the 4th Halving which will be the best cycle to multiply profits. The optimism of investing in crypto is quite strong, but it depends on what type of crypto is being invested in. Bitcoin is the top crypto that is recommended. See how it has grown from the beginning to the present, it has grown a lot of profits. And now if 63.5% of respondents expressed optimism for crypto investment in the next 12 months, they are on the right track. The halving will happen in May 2024, before and after the halving will be a time of growth for the crypto market. Increased volatility and optimism are enough to reach ATH again.",

Now it is more a matter of when, not if, the next bull cycle will occur.Staying steady on $30,000 for the past week continues to bring wonder as to what the short term outlook is. I believe another surged of demand before a economic or sudden bad event will ensue, to crush confidence before the next run begins. Of course this is biased by my want for another buying opportunity.In terms of the long term, we all know where we are going (up!), though I must admit it is very surprising to see the public survey such a positive opinion.",

I guess their optimism is related to their ability to keep making a profit through this activity regardless of the crypto price. I doubt their view on growth is similar to the average user's. While long-term exposure exists as a reason, the number is comparable to market-making and arbitrage activities, which are basically still trading activities. CMIIW.The report also suggests that most institutional investors expect more regulation and institutional involvement to become the major reason for crypto growth. Not really sure what they mean by involvement other than making everything more centralized.",

It is one of most common reasons by which people are introduced about Bitcoin and joined the market because of that. Although it is a bad introduction, people must DYOR (Do Your Own Research) because this market relates their money. If they do research, due diligent, they will figure out inaccuracy of introduction and understand more about Bitcoin.QuoteThe implication of a long term investment is that it will have its ups and downs. Bitcoin is highly volatile.Because its high volatility, Bitcoin traders will have risk to lose their capital. Bitcoin investors with longer plans can ignore ups and downs in the market and hold their bitcoins to enjoy Bitcoin growth with time.By holding, I mean holding their bitcoin in non custodial wallets.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

I mean ok they must be referring to the bullish mode of Crytposphere and taking into account that less bullish means less optimism. Because optimism means how much you trust the industry. Well, other than that, this also indicates that a bullish run is not going to start in the upcoming 12 months because if the stats are legit and directly from institutional investors then they are always having good information and they also know that the next bull run will come around in 2025 because halving is in 2024 April and the bull run starts after a while so they also have the same feelings about the market as we have.But the confusion is they just do not publically express or represent their sentiments towards market analysis because this could be a divergence or some kind of FOMO too to lure people into thinking the same I wrote in Paragraph 2.  Well let's hope for the same results we are expecting",

Everyone that is keeping bitcoin is optimistic that the price will go up. But I am just fascinated by what bitcoin has achieved this year. This year there have been serious attacks such as the suit against Binance and Coinbase which was targeted at causing FUD in the industry. But it was surprising to see that instead of causing fear, it built the confidence people have in bitcoin, which even made the price go higher. The recent application of spot bitcoin ETF by BlackRock, Fidelity, and others was another boast. Plus the establishment of the exchange EDX Markets (EDX), financed by top US financial firms which include Fidelity Digital Assets, Charles Schwab, and Citadel Securities. All these development are indications that gradually Bitcoin is been accepted even by former major critics because they have realized that they can not stop its ever-growing level of adoption. I have a lot of hope that the bitcoin sector will keep increasing both in price and scope. More countries, organizations, and individuals will become friendly in the nearest future, so with this in mind, I am fully optimistic that I am investing in the right sector.",

Given this track record for many years, I also place my faith in bitcoin and predict that big things will take place in the cryptocurrency industry as a result of some prior evidence very soon because of the halving period that is approaching .Therefore, everyone who has benefited from bitcoin will be certain and convinced that the price of Bitcoin will definitely increase soon because of it past records of bull run that often occurred after halving period.",

That's what made me keep investing in Bitcoin and I think people also have the same reason to keep investing in Bitcoin.And in the next halving, it will make the price of Bitcoin rise again so high that people will choose Bitcoin as their main and long-term investment. Even though Bitcoin's current movement is not good, the situation will reverse and that's when the price will get a long rally that can increase the price.Those still afraid to start investing in Bitcoin will regret it when they see the price could increase because they bought Bitcoin at a low price too late.
