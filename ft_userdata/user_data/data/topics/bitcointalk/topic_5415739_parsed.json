Which is why I think we should first have mass adoption then the stable \"value\" would happen naturally.The only people who don't want it are those who thought bitcoin should make them rich overnight.",

I am not antagonizing. I am only asking everyone this challenging question that appears to have been avoided many times.@pooya87. Stable in value against what, however? Where would we get the basis for bitcoin's value? Also, agreed to your reply that we need bitcoin to be stable in value.",

It is hard because value itself is mostly measured in terms of fiat and if we measure it in terms of anything else (gold, a barrel of oil, bag of potato, ...) that too can be volatile. But I suppose the best way is to measure it in terms of a combination of goods and services instead of fiat.For example we can say bitcoin value is stable if your cost of living is 1BTC and remains that way regardless of what happens to the price ($1k to $10k to $100k to $1000k).",

I think it would have been so helpful to some readers like myself if you had include the thread link, so that those with interest to read the replies you talked about can easily go over it, instead of the stress to searching the topic. About this topic, Bitcoin is not a fiat crypto so there's no need it should be stable in price. About Bitcoin halving on every 4 years, I believe lots of investors invests into Bitcoin during bear market and wait for the next halving or bull market. So I think Bitcoin volatility is not a problem which in my opinion is better to continue that way.",

Volatility makes it good for trading and speculation.I'm not sure if a stable Bitcoin price is really what some users want. But so far I think Bitcoin has always worked as it should even though the price volatility is so volatile it doesn't stop people from owning more. I honestly admit this question is easy to say but looking for the right answer will be a bit biased. Because even though the current Bitcoin price is unstable, the fact is that it is still the target of investors. Vice versa if the price of Bitcoin is stable, adoption may be much greater where stock investors will flock to buy (what I said could be wrong) may be criticized!",

Bitcoin can never be stable, it already has its technology and foundations as such, and it is an asset that could be held and traded in the interbank market. How could such be stable? Many decisions are dragging the price of Bitcoin, it will always fluctuate due to that, while the side with the highest liquidity takes the trophy just like any other floating market where demand and supply decide the price.",

Volatility makes it good for trading and speculation.I strongly disagree with both of these statements. Price stability is an invention of the fiat economy because you only can dictate the prices of goods if you can manipulate the supply of money. By meddling with the supply of money, you ensure that all prices remain relatively stable. That is not possible in the free market based on non-government currency such as bitcoin. In the free market, the price of money, a.k.a purchasing power of money, is the result of fluctuations in balance between the supply of and demand for money. These fluctuations in turn directly influence the prices of all non-money goods and services, making them volatile like money itself. There is no \"stability\" in such a market because the balance between supply and demand highly depends on the decisions of individual participants. What makes bitcoin or any other asset a decent store of value is not the stability of the price, but limitations of total supply and issuance coupled with relatively high demand. But given that fluctuations in demand cannot be alleviated by corresponding fluctuations in supply, the price of a good is always fluctuating and cannot stabilize near a particular level.",

      "body": "Volatility does not change the store of value property of Bitcoin. This is explained in two ways:1. Average volatility per year is less than 15%2. Daily changes in price of 1BTC is insignificant when buying daily necessities and groceries paid in Bitcoin adjusted against a fiat currency.The main effect of volatility is in trading that asset. Again this applies more to altcoins over bitcoin. Hence I believe bitcoin can become both a transactable and tradeable asset in future.",
