When I signed up here in 2015, I had no expectations that one day I will reach such milestone. And I have no expectations that I will reach 20 000 posts in the future. It's possible, but it will take many years to do it and you never know what will happen.Though, I must admit that if I would through my post history, I would delete many of my posts, especially from my early days here. But probably many would do same things. It's something similar like going through your old photos on social media - maybe it was ok to upload it when you were young and stupid, but nobody wouldn't understand if you would upload such photo now.I know that reaching 10 000 posts isn't something very special and at least 128 members from 3.5 million have made more, but I don't pretend to be somehow special.",

It's something similar like going through your old photos on social media - maybe it was ok to upload it when you were young and stupid, but nobody wouldn't understand if you would upload such photo now.You've likely changed as a person over the years you've been posted, and it's quite a common reaction to have to not like older posts since you don't identify with them anymore. There's no real shame, and I bet everyone here has something that they would've said differently looking back. Hell, even going a year back someone might think that it was stupid to say.Also, times change, and with those times changing so does the general attitude. For example, we've got a lot more strict as time has gone on over the quality of posts. This wasn't something that was massively discussed years ago. Whereas, now it's almost the center of the discussion for much of the Meta discussions. Congratulations by the way. Milestones should be celebrated if they're of an importance to you. No matter, what the outside world might think about that.",

Well honestly there's no point to delete our old post, as long as it's not plagiarism it's completely fine. Back in the early days, I think the forum isn't strict enough where they will delete any one liner post without any point. But I don't know what will the moderators do if there's an user who report a low quality old post",

With what I congratulate you. It just so happened that in my previous post I reached 2.500 (the same today), that is, exactly a quarter of yours. You won’t believe it, but I have about the same feelings as you: somehow I didn’t notice that I had reached this milestone, and if you ask me in the “past”, then 2.500 would also seem to me something unattainable. Time goes by, posts accumulate and even the value of 10,000 posts becomes achievable. I also think that most of my early posts are mostly useless, like old photos, but without them there would be no \"real\".I wish you to reach the mark of 20.000 posts and even more.",
