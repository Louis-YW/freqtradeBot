It has also become commonplace to read in local newspapers that someone has been scammed by an unknown person who promised him a profit if he invests in Bitcoin - and often quite large sums of money are involved.It's hard for some small countries like mine to measure up to what's happening in Russia, especially if everyone knows the fact that Russians have always been among the most interested when it comes to cryptocurrencies. I recently did a little experiment where I promoted a certain website, and about one third of the traffic still comes from Russia and Ukraine.",

I think there's more of an incentive to network and remain hidden in a lot of places too and only reveal yourself to people you think would be most likely to \"invest\" which could also be done in a lot of places where this doesn't seem like a large scam - or maybe people just got smart after the first few successful attempts in the past (like bitconnect).",

The law enforcement agencies are learning too, but probably one step behind.Quote from: zasad@ on October 19, 2022, 07:40:49 PMAre there a lot of scams in your countries too?I didn't follow them, but I expect they're plenty, although I'd expect people be a tad more reluctant throw their money into them. I don't know if my expectations are according to the reality, I don't know of reports to look for, but people are also more afraid of the tech money - from credit cards and internet banking to cryptocurrencies - (and the \"businesses\" that accept fiat in hand can be caught easier).I will add something else. I think that comparing Russia in \"flat\" numbers with most of the countries is not a good math. Of course that smaller countries (i.e. most of the countries) will have less such problems.What I mean is that maybe it would matter more to compare as % of total number of businesses, for example. Not that I would have numbers, but in case somebody has them, this could be a better comparison.",

Banks in my country take deposits at 8-14% per annum, investment companies offer deposits up to 30% per year (although there is a lot of fraud), but when you are offered 200-500% per year or more, then this is definitely a scam. But every year more and more people believe the scammers and lose their money. The main question is why people do not get smarter?",

The internet and cryptocurrencies have only made it easier for scammers to be present in literally every home, and people feel safe in the safety of their homes and make bad decisions very easily.In addition to all that, scammers are very encouraged to carry out their activities because they know that very small fines await them even if they are caught by some chance.

The bull is always the time you see more projects flying out and people perch on them because of the promise that they feel is real then suddenly comes the bear and everything dries up like a small river.
