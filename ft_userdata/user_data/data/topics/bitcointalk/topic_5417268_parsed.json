      "body": "If you are using the Omni layer on bitcoin blockchain, then there must be a bitcoin transaction with an OP_RETURN output in it. The bitcoin address you posted has not received any transactions ever.You can check this on any bitcoin block explorer and see the outputs for yourself (if there is any transactions). To know the validity of the payment on Omni layer and the respective balance you'll have to use an Omni explorer like the following although I can't vouch for their correctness since I don't use them:https://omniexplorer.info/address/1G2tBBU8znuDqbgbk54avdrfXLarTBZJJF",

It's very easy to be trapped actually, and I've almost made the mistake last week. Fortunately I saw it was the bad blockchain at the last minute before sending.@fuyicn you should tell us on which blockchain/network you wanted to withdraw your tether and you should try to check if you haven't made your withdrawal on another blockchain/network . Your address looks like a bitcoin address but Tether is now available on many blockchain/networks as you can see here https://tether.to/en/transparency/",
