      "body": "Bitcoin is essentially a geocurrency that is managed through blockchain technology. Bitcoin is basically a cyber currency, which is not controlled by any one country or government. Many experts on this matter believe that Bitcoin exchange can have adverse effects and may be misleading or side-tracking according to experts. Bitcoin's value has fluctuated greatly since its inception. It's only natural that the more people know you, the more criticism you'll get, and it's the same with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a difficult technology. People of Bangladesh have very little idea about this kind of technology in Bitcoin. Lack of awareness in all these countries, people in all these countries have been cheated by investing in various MLM companies. Therefore advanced technology like Bitcoin does not want to be recognized by the government of that country. I believe Bitcoin exists and will exist in the future.",

Therefore, it is the job of the economists you are talking about to scare Bitcoin holders and buyers. After all, Bitcoin has been around for quite a long time and has not only recently attracted attention. Since the first time Bitcoin touched the ATH, real estate economists began to worry that the decline in paper money was increasingly losing trust. So there is no need to be reminded that our decision to invest in Bitcoin is indeed the financial method we want where complete freedom of our rights is truly legally and solely controlled. Returning to the economists you talked about above, their concerns will get bigger whether they like it or not, this will definitely happen.",

As a result many people are leaning towards buying this Bitcoin. However, many experts are warning about this.➤  How safe are Bitcoin transactions?If you ask about how safe Bitcoin transactions are, I will answer \"quite safe\" because so far I have never had problems with Bitcoin transactions. And if you say about the Bitcoin currency that has received the attention of many people recently, it seems like you are the only one who has just realized this because the attention of many people for Bitcoin has been going on for a long time and is even present every year. So don't brag if you yourself only realized this now.QuoteRegarding the reason for the recent increase in the price, he said, \"A few days ago, its price was 1,000 dollars. Before that, it was 100 dollars. Within a year, the price went from 100 to 1,000 dollars. Then, within a few months, its price went up to 19,000 dollars. It is rational. not behavior”.It seems you forgot to ask about the year of price increase that he mentioned, because for more than ten years Bitcoin has experienced several price increases which are still happening to this day. So not only recently, but in the past it has also happened after the pandemic so you still need to ask the person who said that about what year this price occurred.QuoteHe said that now many people are investing in it for more money. In such cases, if these people suddenly withdraw from the market, many will be in danger.I want to know which person you are referring to? If there are many people who withdraw from the market, it means that they have profited enough and will enter again when market conditions become more favorable for them. Because Bitcoin has been on the market for more than ten years with quite a lot of traders and users and they all still continue to like Bitcoin because they have experienced clearer and more tangible proof of profit. So I want to know which people will be dangerous as well as who will withdraw from the market?Quote\"That's our fear,\" the economist warned. \"Since there is no authority, there is no room for more supply of money. So there is no mechanism to control when it collapses or goes up.\"If you feel afraid because there are economists who say that about Bitcoin, you don't need to be too close to Bitcoin because Bitcoin will only be approached by brave people and also by people who already believe in Bitcoin's potential. So you also don't need to bother to heed the warning from the economist and tell him also that don't bother to think about authority and control of the money that goes into Bitcoin if he himself doesn't like Bitcoin and doesn't know about Bitcoin completely.QuoteHe said, the central bank of Bangladesh is saying not to invest in Bitcoin. It is not an authorized currency. It is not worth investing in it.It's really funny, mate. If you have more time to deal with the Bangladesh Bank, please tell them to shut up and don't look at Bitcoin or care about Bitcoin if they are still very afraid of Bitcoin for reasons like that. Bitcoin also won't collapse if for example they don't believe in Bitcoin and one question from me to you is also \"When did you find out and recognize Bitcoin?\" If on October 27, 2023 you know Bitcoin, it looks like you should have more time to read and study Bitcoin without having to panic like this, mate.",

Some of these economists would even advise you not to invest your money because they are afraid you will lose it particularly when they don't have much idea about the platform or when there are associated risks.Nonetheless, these guys have forgotten the risk of being an investor, or, more broadly, of being a living person. They overlooked the notion that we must make difficult decisions in order to be able to freely make life-changing decisions.My thoughts on this are, I may not be so accurate but, before investing in Bitcoin, it is most preferable for a person to analyse the market trend for that period and then look at what most effective approach to take, which might be dollar cost averaging in some circumstances, particularly if the person is a beginner. However, advising people not to trade or invest in Bitcoin because of the risks or volatility associated with it is not a good idea.",

The only thing they are right about is that the volatility of cryptocurrency, can not only generate additional income, but also the loss of assets invested in cryptocurrency ! Citizens of the country should be informed about this, familiarized with the risks, and take the risks on themselves, so that then do not run and do not demand from the state to save them from their own ill-considered steps.  Cryptocurrency is not a fraudulent scheme, but it is a specific market, with the possibility of manipulation and speculation, and this should be taken into account if you want to \"make money on crypto\"",

How did they conclude that investors will suddenly withdraw all they have put in? Even if they sell it, other investors will still buy the coin. Bitcoin has gone through the process of buying and selling for many years and the system has never collapsed. I suspect that these are armchair economists who want to promote FUD. QuoteHe said, the central bank of Bangladesh is saying not to invest in Bitcoin. It is not an authorized currency. It is not worth investing in it.This is not the first time central banks are issued such a warning. They are just scared of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and want to promote fake news about the coin. The use of Bitcoin has kept increasing in my country even when the government restricts its use and discourages people from using it. Bitcoin has proved to be a hedge against inflation and offers better payment options which is why people will keep embracing it regardless of these attacks.",
