(...)By simply existing the feature to implement such protocols doesn't actually mean that they should be created/implemented in the first place. Sure, adaptability and flexibility are great in the technological era but I believe that there has to be a core idea that would have to be followed in making sure that each ramification of the technology stood the ground against their foundations. Otherwise, what would it stand for?I'm not against progress and improvements to the concept of Bitcoin, don't take me wrong, but I can't seem to find a reason to believe that adding NFT imprints in the blockchain is something that would allow the technology to remain faithfully to something it stood to reach (someday).Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on April 21, 2024, 10:49:04 AMQuote from: LoyceV on April 21, 2024, 10:19:00 AMI'm now teaching my kids to use MoneroYou're a father figure!

This is an acceptable discussion and one that has been going on for some time and I easily see more this as acceptable regarding what can be made than Ordinals/Rune implementation and is totally understandable that Bitcoin simply cannot answer with efficiency when nothing could prepare us for these new NFT concepts when Bitcoin was first created. I wonder what more can/will be created that weÂ  haven't imagined regarding Bitcoin - ~ 14 years to create \"fungible NFT\" on the blockchain, I wonder what it may come next. As an additional perspective, not one of my friends in real life, those who just want to hold bitcoin, is aware of what is going on regarding high fees, fungible tokens, Ordinals, Runes. But then again, like BHC said, the free market is the concept that dictates this behaviour - if people didn't care about NFT, these implementations wouldn't have any kind of relevance. Problem is, I don't see NFT going away any time soon and with the amount of bridges being made for the Rune implementation, I fear that this may just be the beginning of a troubled period in Bitcoin existence.

The fixed block size limit certainly contributes to the occurrence of congestion. Â On the other hand, there are concerns that larger blocks could lead to centralization and decrease the number of people who can participate in the network as full nodes.You raise a valid concern regarding the scalability limitations of layer-1 solutions, especially when considering the onboarding of billions or millions of users.

What I don't believe anyone should have to do is to compete with spammers who are not making P2P online payments with electronic cash, and are taking away many of the features that normal people love.

Now you won't be able to use the Bitcoin network if you cant afford its a bitter reality.",

Because Bitcoin's purpose is to be aQuoteA purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfIf blocks are only filled by 10%, 20% or 30% with P2P online payments of digital cash, then something has seriously gone wrong. I have no problem with a free and competing fees market. That's how it's supposed to be. If you are willing to pay more than me to make an online P2P payment of electronic cash, then all the power to you my brother. I will have to wait my turn or reach deeper inside my own pockets to offer a competitive fee rate. What I don't believe anyone should have to do is to compete with spammers who are not making P2P online payments with electronic cash, and are taking away many of the features that normal people love. With those, I mean a cheap, fast, and borderless way of sending payments in any amounts you want.Â  Â The Ordinals is something that I didn't expect to be on the Bitcoin Network till but now Rune as been added, while others may claim everyone has freedom on how they choose to spend their Bitcoin/Sat and when you try to remind them that this was not what is written on the Bitcoin whitepaper they respond with Bitcoin is now bigger than Satoshi  but I wonder how they justify this when others suffer from this fate, bitcoiners are depending on Altcoins for making payments.Anyway if the dev still decides to let the spam continues, it doesn't matter after all we have been on this issue since last year and nothing have really be done. Though I don't really know much but one thing I can say is that these should be scrap out of the Bitcoin Network.Bitcoin being only use as a means of payment and been great for years while if anyone think Bitcoin needs to expand then, why don't they, make Bitcoin usable for everything Ethereum and other altcoins are being used for since they fail to see how it is feasible on the Bitcoin Network.",

      "body": "ignoring all of blackhatcoiners BSbitcoin is code, code can make rules for whats expected. and yes we can denounce the core roadmap and fight against/prevent new exploits and clean up the code and create rules via code which dont just allow junk..we can close off majority of opcodes that have no conditions(no validation requirements thus anyjunk is allowed) we can close off the miscounting and the 'assume valid' and 'is-valid' exceptions that just let junk throughcode can clean up the network. Â idiots and bullsh!tters just dont know it or dont want to admit its possiblewe actually can get back to a system where every byte is accounted for, has purpose and conditions which nodes have set rules for.. we can harden consensus again and add new validity checks for any active opcode. the issue is not a physics problem... its a social/political problem of dev control.. instead of being sheep to one master reference client(core) we can have multiple brands of different teams making reference clients where they all are allowed to propose new features whereby the best feature gets adopted by all brands and then the feature activates..this hardened consensus then ensures proposers actually think more about their feature, develop its idea better, display the benefit better and actually unite the community around good beneficial features to then get activated via true network consensus of network readiness... instead of the last few years of softened consensus of centralised trojans rolling in bad crap unchecked because the gate keeper wants a blind/softened system of lax gatekeepingand dont pretend its \"censorship\"there are many buzz words used by core themselves'depreciate','evict','orphan','reject','ban','prune','strip' (list goes on)where by bitcoin always HAD and HAS decided on which transactions are relevantbut the softening of the rules has now allowed more irrelevant unchecked junk.. and that junk can be cleaned up..",

So your suggestion is joining the shitwagon? There are no benefits. Even the profits you might earn aren't worth destroying the best chance of an uncontrollable way of sending money that we have.Â  Quote from: Faisal2202 on April 21, 2024, 07:06:15 PMBut don't you think if the people from crying category enters the embracing category the hype will increase more and thus the tx fee will also. How does that help anyone? We should all upload bananas and enjoy the high transaction fees? That's what you are saying.",
