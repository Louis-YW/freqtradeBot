I was just surprised when I was going to buy from his store, there was a poster that said \"We accept Bitcoin\" as payment, I smiled at this neighbor of mine.I asked him what motivated him to do this, and although it's good that he did it, Then who will be the customer who will use Bitcoin to pay for his goods? His answer to me was me, I laughed even more and was happy with his answer. Because apart from me, even his children, when buying their goods, he will also teach them to pay with Bitcoin. You're doing a good job, teaching your children and awareness about Bitcoin, keep doing it and I'll support you in that matter.And his answer to me is that his cousin is doing bitcoin trade and he mentioned to him that bitcoin is his cousin's primary source of income, and he also advised him that bitcoin can be used as an option for payment for his goods. , and also taught him how to do it.It's funny because at least I'm not alone in our place anymore, and I also told my neighbor that if he wants to ask a question, He can ask me anytime.",

Bitcoin price is very volatile recently which might affect all his sales on Bitcoin if he didn’t convert in fiat immediately.It’s nice to see a local small store using Bitcoin as mode of payment. I will be happy to support store like this if I see in my area but so far no one here is doing this kind of movement for Bitcoin. What particular area you are. I’m assuming you are from Philippines too because sari sari store is our local term for mini store.Posting some picture of it will make this story more interesting.",

      "body": "Since you just said that your neighbor heard about it from his cousin, which implies that he only heard bitcoin stories and became interested, I think from your statement that your neighbor didn't know how bitcoin transactions work. Your neighbor needs to learn about bitcoin transactions before accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in his store, however, as that would enable him to operate in his store.However, if you also want to teach, don't advise him, as he said his cousin did instead and explained the risks involved. As a result, I believe it is now your duty to teach him how the bitcoin market functions, as you also want your neighbor to be a bitcoiner in your neighborhood.",

You don't need to be surprised because your neighbour receives Bitcoin as payment, it is nothing new.

For your neighbour to make decisions of accepting bitcoin as payment that means, he already understands bitcoin and have a good reason for the new means of payment which will be beneficial to him and his business.

But if many already used crypto to your nearest neighborhood then its expected that adding bitcoin as payment method will gonna happen. But still this good news to be heard since for making this to happen it open other door to your nearest merchant to follow the same since they can create a little discussion about what they do. And this is free marketing especially when many talk about bitcoin and merchants accepting this.",

Maybe your neighbor really knows how good bitcoin is, although it might be a struggle for him because of the price fluctuation and volatility, and hopefully he/she will not sell on a lost specially if he needs to sell to cover up expenses in his store and sort of keep his business as he needs to buy needed items to be sold in his store.

Even if it will be dozens or hundreds of similar shops. I also have doubts that at least someone other than you will pay with a bitcoin at least once in this store for purchases. Despite the negative forecasts, there are still positive moments in this. An important point is that in such stores there is an alternative to traditional money. The more such stores and places there are, the more beneficial it will be for the entire bitcoin chain. But I still believe that for efficiency bitcoin should include big chain stores in the payment method. That's when it really takes a leap forward. And what is happening in your region is nothing more than an inconspicuous trifle on a global scale.",
