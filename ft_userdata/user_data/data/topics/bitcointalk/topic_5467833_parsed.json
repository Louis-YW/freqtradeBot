Why not getting a copper member for your project to be able post images here i think this could also help in gaining people's attention to your project.",

You can find the details of the project in other links. There is a video about this. We constantly share on our Twitter account. We continue with a 100% success rate. We use artificial intelligence in the most effective way.",

It often comes with a lot of backlashes. Sometimes, we don't want to blame this community for favouring such unsavoury responses towards projects beginning that way. I guess it comes from bad experiences we've had to deal with in the past. Getting a reputable manager to run such would save face. However, most of these new projects don't like paying for such services and that's simply because they know before hand they're going to scam. I'm not saying the project OP is advertising is a scam. I ain't saying it isn't also. I'm just stating a fact.",
