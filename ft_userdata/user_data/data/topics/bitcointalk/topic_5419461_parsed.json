Many people doubt the existence of NFT and its applicability, but I still think it will come back and grow even stronger in the future. Polygon will face new competition from two competitors that will launch in the near future, Optimism and Arbitrum, which are also considered two very potential and formidable layer 2 projects.",

I was a little expecting these to the social media platforms and I'm mostly anticipating on Instagram and twitter since they are giants in social media space aside from facebook. Polygon for me is a great choice and I do expect for them to add multiple blockchains in the future and of course their own network, Diem or Libra? Since it was develop by Meta. I guess Instagram could possibly have a new marketplace feature for NFT LOL.",

It's not really mind-blowing at all, but it's something that is to be expected, especially since Instagram is ramping up its whole identity to be 'the brand' for content creators to flaunt their content and the updates on what they do, and hopefully create a product out of that and bam, you got Polygon sorting these final stages out.",

Why does meta need to create a new blockchain while there are so many blockchains with large user base available in the market? im thinking about the fallen of meta stock price was also affecting this decision.

Not only is it a sign that the company is not abandoning its blockchain development, but it also shows the rapid pace of growth for the Meta platform as it expands into other mediums. I don't know exactly how this Polygon integration will work just yet, but it seems likely that it will involve a lot of in-app purchases. Users will be able to purchase tokens with their Meta balance and then transfer them over to the Polygon platform. This is a great concept.",

Most of today's NFT projects are centralized and mostly built on two blockchains, polygon and solana. The volume of NFTs generated on polygon and solana outperforms all other blockchains. I think NFT projects choose them because they have low fees and faster speeds than other blockchains.Where did you get this data about Polygon? I agree about Solana, because there has been increased activity there lately, if we are talking about NFT. Ethereum blockchain has always been at the top of the list, and Polygon is not even in the top three blockchains. Here's the data for June 2022Show me the data where it shows that most of the projects are focused specifically on Polygon.",
