  "content": "Of a truth poverty have been a major setback in the improvement of our standard of living. Poverty has made the society so porous to the extent that it has eaten deep in the mindset of various individuals in our society. This has been a major setback in rapid development of our environment because the inability to meet up the demands of earning a living can make an individual to indulge in some social vices like criminality, frauds, Internet scams and so forth. This is a very critical issue that requires urgent attention as it has led to lots of setback. Imagine a scenario whereby someone does not have means of livelihood and he/she is being persuaded to get involve in an act that will fetch them money you will see that they can be easily convinced. Moreover, an idle mind is the devils workshop as someone who doesn't have something doing can easily be enticed to commit crimes.So i believe the best way to eradicate this dreadful thread is to get involved is some vital skills. At least learning a skill can make one financially independent and stable as you don't need to be employed before you can work.An again skills acquisition should be organized to aid individuals about a particular skill that will help them to be financially independent. Indulging in self skill acquisition will make people to be committed in their areas of specialization.And again an awareness needs to be given to individuals on projects and some programs that will help embrode the knowledge of individual.Furthermore, I suggest the rich ones among us should build factories and industries that will aid in employment of unemployed youths. But it's unfortunate that rather than build factories and industries that will bring employment opportunities to our youths, they prefer to build hotels, night clubs, and some immoral platforms that will corrupt the society rather promoting good morals. The rich gets more richer and doesn't even care about the masses. At this point I believe that the best way to rejuvenate this mayhem is to elect credible leaders that will have the interest of the masses at heart. Leaders that will take proactive measures to make sure that the voice of the masses are heard and also enact laws that will check corrupt practices in the society.",

You dey top about electing credible leaders like say you no dey Naija for 25th February this year wey INEC no gree upload presidential election because them sabi say we comot vote credible person. For Nigeria to change for good me I believe say no be through election again oo because elections for Nigeria never produce the elected but the selected. Those politicians wey know say them no fit win election go always go back door to enter and that means Dem go bribe even mosquito wey dey road so that road go clear for them and when them enter, them go begin collect their money back and before you go know 3 years don reach and them go use the fourth year to begin plan for election and go through another round of bribery. Na so Nigeria see the country, it is unfortunate.",

No intention to be sarcastic but abeg you get any credible leaders wey fit match that description?

      "body": "Nice one! You came up with a good thread, but there is one mentality that is affecting our Nigerian people: they depend on the government, and the government cannot provide everything to the communities; rather, we also living in those communities must play a vital role in seeing Nigeria become a better place tomorrow.You also came up with a nice idea of engaging in other handwork and other business, which is the best way because the government can’t provide jobs for all graduates. Let's take bitcoin as an example. If you can invest in bitcoin and have another source of income, I bet you, you will even forget about unemployment because if you have your money at hand, noting will disturb you or make you think about getting a salary-earning job because it is stressful and not favourable because you will waste your life working for someone else.So please, my 9ja people, let us learn from our mistakes and stop blaming our leaders in some aspects. They are trying their best, but corruption won’t allow us to see it because those in the high offices in Nigeria are embezzling the money that we are supposed to benefit from the government. So my advice here is that we should be guided and also keep praying for a better Nigeria.",

      "body": "You did a fine work on the thread and got many things right. It's a problem we have been facing for ages but it has only gotten worse in recent times thanks to policies that have made living conditions harder and operating conditions for businesses even harder.Quote from: Egii Nna on September 28, 2023, 08:01:25 PMNice one!

For instance, the pump price of fuel did 3x in an instance with a dried-up economy, how do these businesses survive and they're still being taxed?The resources are there but it's obviously being used to prop up government seats.Quote from: Richbased on September 28, 2023, 04:47:49 PMFurthermore, I suggest the rich ones among us should build factories and industries that will aid in employment of unemployed youths.

These ways those business owners fit get share of the national cake, otherwise, them go miss out entirely.I know we have a mentality problem but if a government is not functioning properly then it's people suffers. That's the simple and obvious truth. Don't hate the players too but hate the game (corrupt governance with misplaced priorities).",
