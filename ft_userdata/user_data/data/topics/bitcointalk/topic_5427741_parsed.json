  "content": "Hi,I am trying to move from creating a transaction using createrawtransaction on a networked computer and sigining it using signrawtransactionwithkey on a non-connected computer to using psbts. The createpsbt function seems to work fine, but I don't know how I can sign it in the other system using the key? There is no \"processpsbtwithkey\" function?",

I guess, we don't have any for now. walletprocesspsbt is the only way, unfortunately.Yes exactly, it would be very useful for offline signature of PSBTs. Is there any plan to add such functionality? I am right that as opposed to an unsigned raw transaction, a PSBT contains all the required information to sign it offline (excluding the private key)? Thanks!",
