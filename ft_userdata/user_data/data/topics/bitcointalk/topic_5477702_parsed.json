What do you think about Satoshi Nakamoto right now? Do you believe he's still involved or has Bitcoin? What's your opinion on the mystery around Satoshi's identity and role in crypto? Do you think it's important for Satoshi to stay anonymous for the crypto market's stability? In case Satoshi came back from no where and reveal his identity what to you think will be the impact to crypto space?",

The point is, he just wants to remain anonymous, and that has been achieved over the years, and I believe it will still continue.¬†For the aspect of him coming out and revealing himself, who even wants that? If eventually he does and there is solid evidence that he is, he might probably get arrested or invited for questioning by the so-called regulatory bodies of world powers.¬†His last active date on the forum is the birthday of someone close to me. What a coincidence and a good way to keep that in my memory.",

In case Satoshi came back from no where and reveal his identity what to you think will be the impact to crypto space?It's hard to say if he's alive or not, making the question quite challenging to answer. If he is alive, he likely has a significant amount of Bitcoins in other wallets, observing the Bitcoin scene like a show on his laptop. Staying anonymous seems wise, especially given the increased attention from government bodies on Bitcoin. To stay safe, it might be better for him to keep a low profile and enjoy his Bitcoins, just like any other Bitcoin enthusiast.QuoteIn case Satoshi came back from no where and reveal his identity what to you think will be the impact to crypto space?It could have both good and bad effects on Bitcoin and crypto space at Large. More investors might put money into Bitcoin, making its value go up and benefiting those who already own Bitcoin. But there's a risk. if there are a lot of accusations and pressure from government bodies, there's a chance he might be forced to change things. Maybe they'll take away the decentralization in Bitcoin, which is an important part of why Bitcoin was created. I think decentralization upsets the government more when it comes to Bitcoin.",

Secondly, with my view on what Bitcoin is (my own point of view) it's just another evolution that time has brought through some he/she/them to the world. just like paper money the Identity of the creator of paper money has been anonymous till date it only record the first time it was spent and looking at it from my subjectivity it has the same story line with Bitcoin which I have concluded that Bitcoin founder will never be known same way paper money founder is not known. To all the questions OP I usually say this; Hey man! wake up from such dreams....üòÅ Your imaginary questions are too wild I can't answer them all.",

Satoshi could be a Man or woman, at least Human for sure. Satoshi might be in this forum, might not be in this forum. Satoshi might hold a significant amount of BTC, but might not hold. Maybe theymos is satoshi, maybe not. Maybe he is still alive, or maybe not. Maybe he saw the thread you created and cursing you for attempt to him or maybe not. Final question, If someone want to stay away from you, should you try to find him?",

That would absolutely suck to be him if he did not.2. I believe that he's just vanished into the night. Looking at this stuff and what we have to say. I'm quite surprised even with his full name and stuff we still cannot find him. Especially seeing as how big Crypto is, surely there's gotta be some leads.3. I'm unsure if it's important for him to stay anonymous. 4. If he came back I feel like it would be huge big news, maybe crypto hype?5. I feel like he used a GMX.com email purposefully so someone could recreate it years later. Seeing how in the Bitcointalk database his email literally is \"satoshin@gmx.invalid\" he knew about the risks of using GMX.",

Yeah, I believe yahoo62278 is right we are all keeping the dream of Satoshi alive and in a sense we're all Satoshi. The original founder of Bitcoin made Bitcoin for us and left it for us so he may not get extra priority for his innovation. Such a brilliant mind and a freedom lover, where-ever in the world he is I would thank him for Bitcoin.",
