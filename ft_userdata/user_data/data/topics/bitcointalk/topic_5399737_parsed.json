  "content": "Hi...my old account has been banned due to inactivity, how strict you are...  Let's see if anyone can help me, I have created with a friend a software in python that analyzes the Coinmarketcap APi in search of Altcoins that do the opposite of the market, and that follow a positive pattern, with the variables of volume, % 24h and % 1h, it rules out the pump&dumps, it basically tells us the good opportunities in numbers, but I'm missing a filter to avoid false coins, is there a real website that somehow certifies new projects? I share with you the one that comes out with the best numbers, it has made a x6 in less than a month, the drop has not affected it, it continues to rise and it seems that it maintains the volume and there are no massive sales by the staff or large holders.PLEASE, nobody invests for this data.!!I just need someone to help me with the investigationThe currency is Quint coin ( https://quint.io/ ), I have searched for errors on the web, I have investigated if the staff is real and if they cite the project on their networks... but I do not know how to analyze the smart contract, to see if it is a copy of another.Anyway... if anyone is encouraged to write me a private and we continue the investigation.Thank you very much!!!Matt.",

      "body": "Never have I looked through certification websites to know how legit their certifications are but I do know CertiK is a very well known one.  Maybe look over there and see what they say about the smart contract of this Quint Coin.But always take the 'certifications' with a grain of salt.  I am entirely sure some of them tacitly accept bribe for a positive smart contract review even if the project is crap.  Is there no Reddit or Bitcoin Talk post about this coin?  Maybe someone more familiar with Bitcoin Talk's search feature could chime in?-Regards,PrivacyG",

      "body": "I could always be wrong, but one look at this chart and something smells fishy to me...We're in a bear market right now and a token that launched in April has done nothing but go up with hardly zero retrancement? Come on now, lol...a $1,103,932,763 market cap and what, not hardly a single person has sold any? Along with that, a $1,103,932,763 market cap yet the token has done a measly $931,122 in volume over the last 24 hours? I can see dozens of other tokens ranked close to what QUINT is ranked at on CMC which do similar volume to that and still have only millions in market cap as opposed over a billion. I also find it a bit strange this project has over a billion dollars in market cap shown, but yet is only available on PancakeSwap.As I said, I could always be wrong here and I hope it's a solid/legit project for anyone investing in it. But for me personally, I looked at it for less than 5 minutes and I already see things that just don't really add up. Takes me back to that old saying...If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck then guess what? It's probably a duck! Basically, if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.",

No, it's a 12X profit , LOLIf I had known, I would sell the entire portfolio , put it here and buy a new house, but nobody has a crystal ball to see the future.If you have made even 12x profit I think you should sell and withdraw all your money before it's too late a coin seems to just try to pump and dump and nothing stands out. We are in a bear market, making profits is not easy don't be too greedy, know to stop before it's too late.",
