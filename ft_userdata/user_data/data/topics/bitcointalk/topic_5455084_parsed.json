  "content": "Before venturing into the learning of bitcoin, I used to think that it was just all about buying and selling bitcoin when the market is favorable. With my experience in buying and selling of physical goods, I thought that there was nothing that difficult to learn about bitcoin, that all I needed to do was just buy it and sell to make profit. Basically that is what it is, but joining bitcointalk has opened my eyes to see that there is more to trading bitcoin than just buying and selling.The term \"Newbie' in this forum has really humbled me to know that I have to do research, learn technicalities and terminologies of bitcoin first before I can start trading it. Otherwise the reality of failing and loosing my hard earned money is imminent.I feel like I'm in an online course now studying about bitcoin. I see myself getting forced to learn the terminologies and complex nature of bitcoin if I have to succeed and I'm prepared to do so. Without understanding the terminologies of bitcoin, it will be very difficult for a newbie to contribute meaningfully in threads that discuss about bitcoin trading, because the newbie might continue to make a fool of himself in trying to contribute.My first contact with Bitcoin here, terms like blockchain, cryptography, Coinbase, Dex, Cex, Fiat, Halving, Wallet, Private keys, Dust, Satoshi, etc used to confuse me. The person who introduced me to bitcoin told me something about the founder of bitcoin and gave a strange name that I almost immediately forgot until I came here and remembered what he mentioned was Satoshi Nakamoto. It is here that I started reading about Bitcoin anniversary and how someone bought pizzas with so much bitcoin that made my head swell. I have been reading and learning online from  https://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitcoin-glossary and that is where most of my bitcoin knowledge come from in addition to this forum. I'm putting more time to staying online which is not my usual habit. Some of those confusing terms I can put now in my understanding of what they mean. I'm still learning.1: Blockchain - This is a list of all blocks that have ever been listed. I see this as a bank statement of account.2: Coinbase - The first transaction in each bitcoin block. I learnt also of Genesis block which is the ever first block by Satoshi.3: Cryptography - Secured techniques based on mathematical concepts. This is still not too clear to me completely.4: DEX (decentralized exchange) - A cryptocurrency exchange where people can trade cryptocurrency without a central company or middleman. The term middleman is popular in my type of business.5: CEX (Centralized exchange) - A cryptocurrency exchange where people  trade cryptocurrency with middlemen involved. It is the opposite of Dex and those who trade there are exposed to loosing their coins if the Cex shuts down because they don't own keys to their bitcoin on the exchange.6: Digital signature - This is something that can be attached to a message to show that the sender is the owner of the private key.7: Private Key - This is a set of alphabets and numbers associated with wallets to show you are the right owner if you can produce them to claim the bitcoin in it.8: Seedphrase - This is a set of words like a password to a wallet. I see it is also like a private key.9: Wallet address - This is a set of letters associated to a wallet that we give out to people to send Bitcoin to.10: Satoshi - Units of Bitcoin, just the way we have units of our local currencies in denominations.11: Dust - Bitcoin transaction output with little value, like tiny Satoshis.12: Fiat - This is the one that shocked me most. Until now I never knew the traditional currency I used in buying and selling is also called a fiat. This humbled me.13: Bitcoin Halving - A preprogrammed of the bitcoin block subsidy, which occurs every 210,000 blocks. Some say it happens every four years also. A lot of people are talking about it here with excitement that it will happen in 2024.There are many more of these confusing terms and I'm ready to acquire more of them with belief that they will become easier the more I read about bitcoin.",

But sticking around bitcoin and getting involved will make them stick because experience sometimes makes it easier to remember them since you would have be accustomed with them.Although this are terminologies that could make your journey easier but if you’re venturing into trading then I will advise you take up reading of lesson on fundamentals and technical analysis.",

It does not require too many knowledge, experience, skills like trading. You only need to understand basics of Bitcoin, have a belief in Bitcoin, buy and hold your bitcoins.With trading, you must learn too many technical indicators, trading strategies, terms of trading on exchanges, and practice a lot of time, spend a lot of months in this market to master it and gain profit. Not many traders can gain profit on all market, not only on Bitcoin market. So don't believe that you can get profit with trading.Anyway if you like trading, Awesome Crypto Trading",

For example, the purpose of me signing a message saying \"I own the account odolvlobo\" with the private key of a previously posted address would be to prove that I own the account, and not that I own the private key.A private key in Bitcoin is a 256-bit number. It allows you to send bitcoins at the address associated with it. It can be encoded in the WIF format as a set of letters and numbers, but that is not what it is as that is just one way to write it.A seed phrase (also called a recovery phrase) is not a password. It is the value used to generate all of the addresses and private keys used by a wallet. It should be kept secret like a private key, but it is not \"like a private key\" because it is not used like a private key.When someone writes \"wallet address\", it make me wonder. Perhaps they mean an address in a wallet, but is there such thing as a non-wallet address? A wallet is not an address nor does it have an address. A wallet contains addresses (and their private keys). A wallet can contain one address or it can contain thousands of addresses. So, I would suggest avoiding the term \"wallet address\" and just using \"wallet\" or \"address\", depending on what it is.",

Understanding these terms is indeed very important, especially if you have entered and joined this BTT forum. If you don't understand these terms, you will definitely feel confused when one of the forum members writes these terms in a thread or in a post. So I think these terms will indeed be very useful when participating in discussions on this forum and will certainly make it easier when trading on bitcoins. But if in my view, if you trade or invest in bitcoin, if you outline it, it's actually about buying at low prices and selling at high prices. Staying up to date with market trends, volatility, and sentimental or fundamental analysis is also necessary in trading on bitcoins.This is the main point in trading or investing in bitcoin.But having more knowledge about bitcoin would be very good. So continuing to learn about bitcoin and all its systems is very good and will be very useful for your bitcoin trading.",

It's really useful for a beginner. The only problem with btc now is very small number of people using it. However, the more people using btc - the more load for mining facilities...

It may not be possible to do but you have to understand the simplest of them all like bull or bear, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) FUD ( Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) etc. Every aspect of life has a way or terms that they use. You just need some to be handy with you in your head so that you can easily get the drift of what it is that you are reading, then you can search others using google when you come across them. What you need to do is type the word or abbreviation and including crypto or cryptocurrency, you will get a meaning to it relating to cryptocurrency.",

I'm still learning.Here's some additional information to expand your knowledge a bit...Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM1: Blockchain - This is a list of all blocks that have ever been listed. I see this as a bank statement of account.In the beginning, when you're first trying to understand, it's probably fine for you to think of it as a bank statement of account.  As you learn more, you'll discover that what it stores and how it stores it is nothing at all like a bank statement of account. Don't let this initial understanding confuse you when you start to dig deeper. You'll need to unlearn some of the assumptions you've made.Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM2: Coinbase - The first transaction in each bitcoin block. I learnt also of Genesis block which is the ever first block by Satoshi.This is one of several terms that seems to have multiple meanings depending on who you ask, as well as when and where they learned it. In many cases, \"the first transaction in each block\" is called a \"generation transaction\" (because it generates the new bitcoins that are entering the system) or a \"block reward transaction\" (because it is the transaction that pays the solo miner or mining pool their block reward).  In those cases, \"coinbase\" is the only a small portion of that transaction. Specifically, the portion that would be called \"inputs\" in the other standard transactions. Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM3: Cryptography - Secured techniques based on mathematical concepts. This is still not too clear to me completely.Cryptography is the study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. There are many types of cryptography. Only some of them rely on mathematical concepts. Bitcoin relies on a few clever mathematical algorithms such as those commonly known as \"hashing\" and \"digital signatures\".Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM5: CEX (Centralized exchange) - A cryptocurrency exchange where people  trade cryptocurrency with middlemen involved. It is the opposite of Dex and those who trade there are exposed to loosing their coins if the Cex shuts down because they don't own keys to their bitcoin on the exchange.That risk can be reduced (but not eliminated) by removing your funds from the CEX whenever you are not actively engaged in making an exchange of currencies.Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM6: Digital signature - This is something that can be attached to a message to show that the sender is the owner of the private key.Correct.  It is a piece of data (essentially, a number) that is calculated by using the original message in a digital data form and the private key and a specific mathematical process.  Then providing a public key to anybody that might want to verify the signature.  Another mathematical process (a verification process) can be performed using the signature, the message, and the public key. That verification process can prove beyond any doubt that the only way that the signature could be created is with the specific private key that is associated with the given public key.Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM7: Private Key - This is a set of alphabets and numbers associated with wallets to show you are the right owner if you can produce them to claim the bitcoin in it.The \"alphabets and numbers\" are just a convenient way (for computer programmers) to represent really big numbers.  In the case of Bitcoin's signature algorithm, the private key is actually just an integer. A really, really big integer. you don't \"produce\" the key to claim bitcoin. Instead, you use the key to generate a digital signature when you create a transaction.  That digital signature is then provided to demonstrate to every node on the bitcoin network that you are authorized to spend the specific bitcoins that you are attempting to spend.Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM8: Seedphrase - This is a set of words like a password to a wallet. I see it is also like a private key.Just like a private key, this is also just a clever way to store a very big integer.  Really, really big numbers are difficult for humans to remember, and are prone to mistakes when humans attempt to write them down or type them.  The \"seed phrase\" is a way to convert a really big number into a set of words, and to convert that set of words back into the original really big number.  Once the seed phrase is converted back into the original number that it represents, there is a standardized process for generating a HUGE quantity of private keys from that one number.  So, as long as you have the phrase, and you have software that knows the standardized process for converting it back into a number and knows the standardized process for generating private keys from that starting number, you can always regenerate the exact same set of private keys.Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM9: Wallet address - This is a set of letters associated to a wallet that we give out to people to send Bitcoin to.You may start to see a pattern in what I'm saying here...  That set of letters is just a convenient way to represent a very big integer.  In that very big number is all the information that a wallet software would need to be able to create a bitcoin transaction output script. It includes things like the public key (a pair of very large integers), a checksum (a number that software can use to determine if you mistyped the address), and a script type (a number that tells the wallet software what type of transaction to create).Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM10: Satoshi - Units of Bitcoin, just the way we have units of our local currencies in denominations.Specifically, there are 100,000,000 satoshi units in 1 bitcoin unit. Some other units you might hear used are millibitcoin and microbitcoin. Here are some other conversions:1,000 millibitcoin = 1 bitcoin1,000 microbitcoin = 1 millibitcoin1,000,000 microbitcoin = 1 bitcoin100 satoshi = 1 microbitcoin100,000 satoshi = 1 millibitcoinQuote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM11: Dust - Bitcoin transaction output with little value, like tiny Satoshis.Bitcoin transactions have a certain minimum amount of bitcoins that are typically required to be paid per unit of size (vbytes) of the transaction. Dust is often used as a term to describe transaction amounts that would cost more in transaction fees to spend than they are worth.So, for example, if the average cost in transaction fees to spend some received bitcoin is about 800 satoshis, and you receive a transaction with only 700 satoshis, then any attempt to spend those 700 satoshis will require you to pay ALL 700 of them to the transaction fees AND still come up with an extra 100 satoshis from somewhere else. This means that including those 700 satoshis in a transaction will not result in the recipient receiving any extra funds, and will just cost you even more money.  You come out ahead financially by just NEVER spending the 700 satoshis.It'd be a bit like if I gave you a special coin worth $1, but the ONLY way you could ever spend that coin would be to pay an appraiser at the time of your transaction $100 to verify that the special coin is not counterfeit and is actually worth $1.  You'd be better off just tossing the coin in the trash than ever trying to spend it.So, you are correct that \"dust\" is an output with little value. Specifically, many people use the term to describe outputs that effectively have negative value.Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM12: Fiat - This is the one that shocked me most. Until now I never knew the traditional currency I used in buying and selling is also called a fiat. This humbled me.It's a word that's used to differentiate modern currencies which get their value from their relationship to the government that issues them from the older currencies which were backed by a physical quantity of something valuable such as gold.Cryptocurrencies are neither.  They don't have a government that issues them, nor are they backed by anything physical that a holder can dependably exchange the currency for.Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PM13: Bitcoin Halving - A preprogrammed of the bitcoin block subsidy, which occurs every 210,000 blocks. Some say it happens every four years also. A lot of people are talking about it here with excitement that it will happen in 2024.Since blocks happen on average approximately every 10 minutes, 210,000 blocks mathematically works out to be just about 4 years. 210,000 blocks takes an average of about 2,100,000 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 35,000 hours. There ar 24 hours in a day, so that's 1458 (and a third) days. There are 365 (and a fourth) days per year, so that's 3.99 years (or just about 4 years).Quote from: Kelward on June 04, 2023, 07:30:25 PMThere are many more of these confusing terms and I'm ready to acquire more of them with belief that they will become easier the more I read about bitcoin.Feel free to ask about any terms you see that aren't clear. There are many people here that are willing to help. Be careful though about who you rely on for information. There's a lot of misinformation and people that will confidently state things that are entirely untrue.",

      "body": "I think it is also important to know the different address protocols of Bitcoin.  Aside from learning the stated list of @OP, I believe it is important for newbies to learn and differentiate the difference between Bitcoin address protocols.Legacy address = P2PKH (Pay to Public key hash) = 1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2QuoteA pay-to-pubkey-hash (P2PKH), or legacy address, is the oldest and original bitcoin address format. This address format is not widely used today as transaction costs are higher using this format. However, support for this in applications is still encouraged to be compatible with older legacy wallets that have not upgraded to new address formats.Legacy addresses begin with the number 1, can contain upper and lowercase characters, and are case sensitive.Script address = P2SH (Pay to Script Has) = 3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLyQuoteA pay-to-script-hash (P2SH), or script address, can have additional rules and functionality attached to the address. Script addresses are commonly used for multi-sig addresses, which can specify that signatures from several keys are required to authorize the transaction.Script addresses start with the number 3, can contain upper and lowercase characters, and are case sensitive.Segwit address =P2WSH (pay to witness) = bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdqQuoteA pay-to-witness-public-key-hash (P2WPKH), also known as native SegWit or Bech32 address, is a modern, more efficient address format. SegWit addresses are opt-in, so not every application supports them, but the majority do, and should, today. SegWit adoption can be tracked on here.Benefits of SegWit addresses include more resistance to input errors (as they are case insensitive and use error-correcting codes), and lower transaction fees. The fee saving will depend on the type of transaction but for a common transfer of funds it can be 30-40%.SegWit addresses start with bc1q and are case insensitive.Example: bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdqScript address - P2SH #Taproot Address = P2TR (Pay to Taproot) = bc1p5d7rjq7g6rdk2yhzks9smlaqtedr4dekq08ge8ztwac72sfr9rusxg3297QuoteA pay-to-taproot (P2TR), also known as a Taproot or Bech32m address, is the most recent and advanced bitcoin address format. Taproot introduces more advanced security, privacy, flexibility and scaling to bitcoin. Like SegWit, Taproot addresses are opt-in and not currently widely supported. Taproot adoption can be tracked here.Benefits of Taproot include the ability to use Schnorr Signatures, offering better security, lower fees, and more flexible multi-key transactions. Multi-key addresses using P2TR look the same as single-key addresses giving users of multi-key increased privacy. Taproot also enables more advanced scripting, enabling more complex smart contracts to be built on bitcoin.Taproot addresses start with bc1p and are case insensitive.Source",

What you can do now is only learn how to save and how to hold your Bitcoin. Besides that, we must not just learn and read, but also practice. The blockchain is exact knowledge and math, we have to know basic knowledge like code, and how to implement it when creating new innovations. So, in Bitcoin technology, you don't know anything if only read without practice. you will stagnate if only reading the substance.",
