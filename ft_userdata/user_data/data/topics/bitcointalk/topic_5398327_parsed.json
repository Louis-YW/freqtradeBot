      "body": "Some whales realized that after a certain threshold, Luna could do nothing to stop people from crashing it. I do not remember the exact amount but it was something like 350 million dollars if I am not wrong. So if you spent over that amount, then you could crash Luna and basically UST. This would force Luna team to sell all their holdings to keep UST high, which means selling that much bitcoin.So, if you did that AND shorted bitcoin at the same time, it was basically guaranteed to make a profit. This is what whales did, and Luna team tried to defend and that is exactly what whales wanted them to do, and we never really recovered from there.",

Feels bad for the 8 people who are suicide, just one of learn we can take for this. Never use financial money to invest and always use free money.But, off course can't really expect this crash \"LUNA\". Since the coins are being listed on MAJOR exchange, this \"LUNA\" crash reminds me of a mortgage crash in America while no body knows the loop for that case until it's happening.",

A pain in the crypto market that we will never be able to erase. I hope Do Kwon is prosecuted and paid for this. After this incident, the government will have more reasons to tighten the cryptocurrency, even more countries continue to issue bans on cryptocurrencies.Sad days of the crypto market.",

The stablecoin should of been pegged properly to the US dollar and this shouldn't have happened.The issuance rate couldn't keep upwith keeping the peg at 1:1 and seems that both the UST and LUNA pairs are getting removed from most exchanges as we speak. Basically its like $40B gone in a week or two. This was much worse than the Bitconnect scam back in 2018.People are mad because Do Kwon made it seems like keeping it backed by BTC would make it more secure and decentrazlied than tether and people kept their life savings in it.",

But it's a matter of life of death when it comes to all in your life savings. Share your thoughts how you would improvise your portfolio? Cases related to financial investment leading to bankruptcy in the past have also happened a lot, and now this is happening again. I too have had very difficult periods in my life, but never have I wanted it to just stop at such negative things. Life has so many lessons that we need to overcome, and death never comes. There is a good solution to help life. When the results lead to such a loss, then think about what you have learned before and sometimes talking about life's destiny is an answer that is probably not a good way to look at it. In every person's life, money is really important, but you should consider it as a tool to develop yourself. Don't make it an ideal of life so that the influence makes those who cannot control it stop the journey of your life. I don't want these things to continue, but maybe they will still choose the end. If you see this, share it. Remember that life out there is still a lot of hungry people every day. They don't have enough food. We still have to be optimistic to continue because this life is really precious. We can create those things. Don't let it control us.",

The popular advise about investing what we can afford to lose.This is how it goes. Because if you do invest everything that you can in a very volatile market, you'll definitely going to be upset when you see all of it go down.That's why as you invest, make sure that you only put what you're okay to lose. And do not worry, if you invest to bitcoin and ethereum, they'll eventually recover. But to the coins like Luna and UST, we'll never know if they'll recover or not.Always be vocal with what you feel to your family so that they'll guide you and that money can still be worked on to recover.",

I know that if they were loosing bunch of money. They can't even cutloss or something else.
