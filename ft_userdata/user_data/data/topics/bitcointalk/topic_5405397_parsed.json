  "content": "Hello guys,I have installed the Electrum Android app (version 4.2.2) on my mobile phone. Creating a wallet, importing the master public key (which was created on a Coldcard MK4) and putting some funds there worked fine.Now I would like to spend some funds but I can't find any possibility how this could work. I want to use PSBT so that my MK4 will never be directly connected to devices such as computer, smartphone etc.Do you have any idea how this should work? I have read through a lot of guides which say that you just have to click on the right button/menu entry, but I can't find any in the app providing this.Does this maybe just work with a Windows/Mac version of Electrum and not with the Android version?Thanks a lot in advance for your help.Best wishes,Manny",

      "body": "The Android app version of Electrum is a subset of full Electrum functionality. It's more of a companion app than a full version of Electrum. Having said that, it might be worth logging an issue/feature request on their GitHub to see if they would implement the feature you're after... or if anyone else has requested it and if it's in development.",
