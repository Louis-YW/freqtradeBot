I could be wrong, but it seems like it, and if it was the case, it could explain why the thief tried his/her luck on breaking a Bitcoin ATM instead a more traditional target, since those are more sturdy and fixed to a wall.",

Anybody who has heard of Bitcoin might have already a rough idea that Bitcoin isn't hard cash. So they're probably not after the Bitcoin but the fiat money that is fed into the Bitcoin machine. Targeting this much smaller machine is of course easier for them. They cannot easily do the same with the usual fiat ATMs. But this does not prove that Bitcoin can't be robbed. There were already many cases of Bitcoin robbery.",

The idea of \"not your keys, not your coins\" is the best possible way of explaining it. Most of the people who have enough idea on how to store and protect bitcoin know this. Bitcoin ATM might be possible yet I guess it is more on transactions online and making some withdrawals via physical money. You might not get the idea clearly but you will only able to access bitcoin wallet via seed phrase or key phrase. Stolen keys, stolen coins as well.",

This is nothing new anymore, that's why privacy is really important for Bitcoin holders.After all, bitcoin is also money, an asset like any other property, as long as you become the target of robbers, they will attack you and can take your bitcoins at any time. We can't even call the police if our bitcoins are robbed because their anonymity is difficult to track, or it's a property that has not been protected by law. Bitcoin gives us privacy and anonymity, so I think even if bitcoin is widely accepted, I will not go public as an investor or holder of bitcoin for my safety.",

It's a BATM that does accept banknotes.Besides, if the thieves had enough time they could have simply cashed out a lot of Bitcoin in multiple transactions once the BTAM was broken.Insert $1000, buy coins, grab the money through the hole, feed the BATM again, and buy another 1k worth of BTC or even more, you didn't even need the BATM to have any cash in it, you could use your own as you would get it back immediately.",
