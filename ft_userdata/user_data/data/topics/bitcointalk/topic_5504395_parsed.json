  "content": "US Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris team just made contact with Coinbase, Circle, and Ripple Labs. The campaign team initiated the contact in a bid to develop a regulatory framework and promote responsible crypto business practices, Fortune reports. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said he is open to engaging with Harris' team. Why is this election different from others? Why the contest for the votes of crypto enthusiasts?",

Candidates speak about everything every day but we read only about crypto speaches That's exactly what's happening, we are cryptocurrency investors and what we care about the most these days is news related to cryptocurrencies . It's just that we are ignoring a lot of other news, they are focusing on many different issues, they are not just focusing on cryptocurrency and considering it the most important factor determining the election results. Cryptocurrencies and bitcoin haven't even had any impact on the economy yet, how can they make it a priority ? Candidates are just trying to fully exploit votes from every field to increase their chances of winning .",

Candidates speak about everything every day but we read only about crypto speaches Many young voters are into Bitcoin and cryptocurrency so don't be surprised that crypto matters will be a priority to these candidates to get more votes. They can decide to ditch anything that is related to cryptocurrency when either of the candidates becomes president but at this stage they need the votes of people that have interests in cryptocurrency. I wouldn't say that crypto is not a big deal in the coming US election because election is a game of numbers and if a lot of Americans are adopting it, then these candidates will not miss any opportunities of getting their votes.",

Anything to get votes.If someone believes that Democrats will now support crypto, I pity them. So now Elizabeth Warren who fought bitcoin for years is going to support it? Please Kamala thinks North Korea is a friendly country and US supporter. I bet she doesn't know a thing about bitcoin and her campaign managers told her to act like she's not against it because rich people support crypto... I'm also not surprised Garlinghouse wants to talk. That man is anti-bitcoin scum and a CBDC shill.",

Candidates do not do everything they say, but they say many things about different topics in order to reach everyone during the election period. In fact, we can say that this is the summary of the election. Every politician has to talk about the issues that concern the people they want to vote for, otherwise they will not attract attention.Regardless of whether the number of votes is high or low, there are speeches on every topic and people interested in the topic follow these speeches. This is the summary of the event and I can say that the same things happen in every political speech.",
