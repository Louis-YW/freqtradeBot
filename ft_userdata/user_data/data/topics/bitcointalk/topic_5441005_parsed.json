Your questions would be answered if you know the sport very well and the current teams like its strength and weaknesses. It would be the same if you take it into a mathematical sense and use statistics, like how the variables and parameters determine whether the team is weak.To be clear, there's no prediction that is certain, meaning 100% correct, unless you are cheating.",

As far as I know, no sports/football/MMA betting prediction platform can predict 100% accurate. If there were, I believe the agents/bookies/owners of online sports betting sites would go bankrupt.Every bet that we want to place, of course, has a different level of risk. MMA is risky and football is also risky, in essence, all types of bets are real luck for the user himself.If you talk about profit, no matter what type of bet you want to place, the profit is based on the odds you place, the bigger the bet you place, the bigger the multiplication, in essence: it depends on your bet amount. if you are lucky.The easiest prediction for me football, history, team, field conditions, coaches, opponents and so on can have a good chance to determine your predictions, rather than MMA, boxing and others, sometimes in MMA it's what we take for granted that's the thing. the champion.",

      "body": "Both of them have prons and cons but football is more safe and better rewarding. In MMA you have a chance for lucky punch or maybe a injury which will end a match in that moment, but in football even if there is a lucky goal there is time for other team to come back. Other side football is more complex cause there are 11 players and coach and a lot of stuff outside the game that can affect the final score. Since there is a possibility for a draw in football there are bigger odds. I would say pick your poison and decide what fits you better.",

In fact, all types of bets, whether football or MMA sports betting, have the same big risk.However, if we compare the two types of sports, it will be easier to analyze and predict soccer betting because in this type of sport we can predict who will win based on the performance and strength of the teams competing and seen from the last few matches of each team.We can also see that there are more gamblers who like football betting than MMA.But here I am giving a little advice that you must always be careful when placing bets on sports matches because in them there are often and many manipulations of winnings which will certainly be detrimental for us when betting.",

If you want to win you must have good experience in the mentioned two subjects. You can do well in mentioned subjects where you have good skill and experience. But naturally, 2 options bets are slightly more likely to win the game than 3 options. Another common point is that risk is present in all sports. If you can analyze it properly and bet accordingly the chances of winning will be higher. There are both advantages and disadvantages to betting on MMA (mixed martial arts) or football.",

I will advice you to go for both and see the one that is more good for you. As for me, I prefer football and I like betting on football. I will also advice you to choose the one you like, it depends on preference. As for the football prediction site, there are many of them, some gambling sites even have their own. I mention that to just let you know that prediction sites can help, but not up to 100%, even not up to 50%. You can make use of prediction site and still lose, so be wise. I use soccervista and Zulubet the most.",

In football, A dominant can completely control the tempo of the game through strategy and substitution while MMA is purely based on fighters skills and luck when landing a strike.I think the same goes for football.  I mean, if there is an upset win in MMA, surely, there is also an upset win in Football.  If you visit this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5435885.0, it tells about a huge upset since the supposed to be winning team was beaten after an epic comeback in the last quarter.I would say, MMA is far easier to predict if we remove the element of upset.  Why?  Because it is just a two-fighter, meaning limited data to study and compare, while in football there are lots of data to compare due to more players involved.  Also, there are strategy and counter-strategy that is being implemented in-game, even though the team is dominant, the opposing team can always implement a strategy that can suppress key players of the opposing team.Quote from: dimonstration on February 23, 2023, 04:55:04 PMBut this varies too based on your preferred sports. It will be easier for you to bet on MMA if you are watching MMA most of the time and vice versa. My analysis above is based on the game technicality alone.I agree, if a person is more fond of MMA then he can easily tell which one is the underdog and which one is not, so he can easily tell who is more likely to win.  Same goes with football I guess.",

Which one is more likely to easily predict than the other? I'm afraid there's no clear winner here, just like in any other sport. Football is a team sport, so you've got to factor in things like team performance, player injuries, and strategy. Whereas in MMA, it's a one-on-one fight, so it's more about the individual fighter's skills, strengths, and weaknesses. That being said, I would say that MMA is more unpredictable and if you want something more predictable, football is probably your best bet.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on February 23, 2023, 04:49:03 PMAlso, I need a platform where football prediction is certain, is there any of you guys using any reliable platform? Betting always involves some level of risk, and no platform can guarantee certain predictions or outcomes. That being said, there are many resources available online for football analysis and predictions. You can check out things like statistics, past performances, and player ratings to get an idea of how each team is performing. There are also many websites that offer free tips and advice regarding betting on football online. There's no such thing as a perfect prediction, but at least this way you'll have some idea of which teams are likely to win or lose.",
