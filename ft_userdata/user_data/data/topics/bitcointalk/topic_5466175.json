The forum is broad, and it's really going to be helpful to you if you are the type that reads a lot. You will develop yourself faster than you imagine, and then you can earn from the forum with the knowledge that you have. In the aspect of signature earnings, which is one of the most popular and common means of earning from the forum, you will have to give the forum a little of your time in order to gain those activities and merits that could prepare you to attain the rank that will help you qualify for a signature campaign. Aside from why you are learning about crypto, you can also advertise your personal skills that you have gained outside of this forum. There might be people here who are interested in what you do and might hire you for a job for which, at the end, you will earn money for executing that job.",

If OP really wants to learn and look for information related to the crypto world, OP is in the right place. Because this forum can be said to be a forum for people who are/will invest or trade crypto. So you could say this BTT forum is a place for crypto investors to discuss. So if OP has questions or problems related to the crypto realm, don't hesitate to ask them in this forum. But before that, make sure first to read the rules listed on this forum.• Beginners - Read before postingThen to the question of how to make money on this forum. OP can take part in a signature campaign or crypto giveaway. However, both of these have certain conditions to be able to participate in them. So my suggestion, now OP should focus on increasing knowledge and knowledge about the crypto world. Because if OP can contribute well to this forum, and OP understands everything in this forum, I'm sure OP will definitely get income.So the point is that the OP must be able to prioritize seeking knowledge first, don't be immediately tempted to get immediate income.And to be able to get good knowledge in this forum, OP only needs to diligently read posts in this forum, the arguments that OP needs and discuss with members in this forum.",

Let me welcome you with the message from theymos, the head admin.I quote some important part of the message.Quote from: theymos on September 23, 2018, 08:58:25 PMWelcome to bitcointalk.org, the Bitcoin Forum! You can access this welcome message from the \"help\" link in the top menu bar at any time.As a member of the forum, you are surrounded by legends; phenomenal successes and catastrophic failures. The forum was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and saw the first exchange, the first altcoin, and the first ICO, but also catastrophic software flaws, massive thefts, and incredible scams. You too have an opportunity to become part of the forum's history: whether and in what way you do so is up to you....This forum exists to provide a platform for the free (but ordered) exchange of ideas. If you have an idea to express, then it is probably possible to do it here as long as you follow the rules.A lot of people come here primarily looking to make money. The forum administration is very happy that people are able to use the forum in order to better themselves; indeed, one of the reasons for Bitcoin's creation was to break the artificial barriers which prevent so many people around the world from attaining prosperity. However, if your attempts to make money conflict with the forum's primary goal of enabling discussion, then you are swimming upstream, and you will not be sucessful in the end.If you view the forum as some sort of \"job\" where you complete some basic tasks and get paid, then you will almost certainly be disappointed, and the forum administration will not be sympathetic. If you do make money using the forum, then it will be through innovation and entrepreneurship, not any sort of mindless busywork.QuoteWhat are possible ways to earn from the platform and whats involved  not forgetting how I can make progress in my journey in the crypto world .Forum is not an ATM, you must be a good member to join signature campaigns to earn.Other ways is learning about blockchain, designs, whatever can help you to get jobs and get payment in bitcoin or cryptocurrency.Cryptocurrency job listQuoteHelp is neededSearching by yourself helps you most and best.

      "body": "I think your post is not going to be very popular, because in theory the money that many of us earn with signature campaigns should be an extra that people who enjoy exchanging opinions in forums like this one get, and not the main objective. Although the reality is that we know that there are many people who come to the forum basically attracted by the money and there are many who have been here for years like this. Think that even if you make a good contribution to the forum it can take you a year to start making money here (if you are very good it will be less time), so I would take it as a long term thing where you worry about learning about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and other areas, such as economics, and entertain yourself exchanging opinions.",
