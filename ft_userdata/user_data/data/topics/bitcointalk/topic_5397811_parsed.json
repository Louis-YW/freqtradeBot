  "content": "Hi,I'm currently traveling on Turkey and need to charge my Vodafone SIM with ~50 TRY to use while on this hotel (their WIFI is the worst I have ever seen). However, Vodafone doesn't accept my \"overseas credit card\" for some reason. I need someone who can use his local card to put the 50 TRY on my number through https://online.vodafone.com.trCan pay something like another 50 TRY on top of that, with BTC, a stablecoin, etc...Thank you for the help. edit: Got someone!",
