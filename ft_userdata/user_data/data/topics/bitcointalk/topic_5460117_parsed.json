The recent comment by presido Tinubu say if court remove am for office because of say him no get 25% for Abuja, say anarchy go dey. I see this talk as a big threat because e go make the judge them afraid and in a tight corner. With statements like this, if care is not taken, anything wey them judge, people go revolt. Una no see say na problem we don enter like this? Imagine Nija in complete chaos untop the suffer wey dey already; how we wan take survive? Abeg, anybody wey sabi somebody wey no know person wey be politician, help us tell them say their choice of words dey very important as whatever them talk, people dey use am work.Â Imagine say Peter Obi been talk say him no gree for the election result, come tell him supporter start to protest.... by now we know where the country for dey now. Thank God say Him touch Peter Obi mind so that him no talk wetin for make the country burn.As e be like this now, I don't know weda we go begin dey prepare to run as court must rule for the matter; but to where?",
