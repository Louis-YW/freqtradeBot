I do not think there are a lot of public (not-tor) nodes which use VPN to hide their real public IP, but it is possible too.Due to the IPv4 exhaustion and the sale / transfer of IP space even between regions a lot of those services are best guesses.Yes, the IP I have from my cable company is setup properly and the IP geolocation is accurate, BUT I have a friend using a small rural ISP who has an IP address that is still, as in YEARS later, linked back to an out of business ISP and their address & geolocation THAT IS NOT EVEN IN THE US. No matter what he does, a lot of places still think he is in Canada.-Dave",

Take, for instance, the case of bitrawr[1] who uses the data from bitnodes to showcase how Bitcoin is spread around the world. Right at the end of the page sits also an important information that is worth to be taken into account when looking at the ~17,700 active nodes:QuoteBitnodes uses Bitcoin protocol version 70001 (i.e. >= /Satoshi:0.8.x/), so nodes running an older protocol version will be skipped.As a closing remark, I once kept these[2][3] links shared by Luke Dashjr[4] that supposedly were scraping/listening to the nodes and recording each entry. I don't know if it is still being updated but considering who did scrapper, for sure it may be seen as reliable. I do like this[3] section of his website where we can see the amount of nodes that is running each Bitcoin protocol. I wonder if there is some way to verify these numbers?

And Bitcoin Qt version lower than 0.8 can't even perform initial block download anymore[2]. So i wouldn't worry too much about number of undetected node (which accept incoming connection).Quote from: RickDeckard on April 13, 2023, 09:48:13 PMAs a closing remark, I once kept these[2][3] links shared by Luke Dashjr[4] that supposedly were scraping/listening to the nodes and recording each entry.

I wonder if there is some way to verify these numbers?It seems to be updated since current number is different from past snapshot on internet archive[3]. As for verifying the number, i guess it's impossible unless you run Bitcoin DNS seed node where your IP node/domain is added to list of DNS seed on Bitcoin Core (and optionally other full node software).[1] https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.8.0[2] https://blog.lopp.net/running-bitcoin-core-v0-7-and-earlier/[3] https://web.archive.org/web/20230326174034/https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html",
