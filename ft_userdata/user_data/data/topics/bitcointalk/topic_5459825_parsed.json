  "content": "Hello everyone.I am trying to understand how to setup my multisig environment, and I am with some doubts about it. Beforehand, sorry for the naiveness and ignorance of my question, but I am still a newbie. So, I have two native wegwit wallets, let's call them:W1 with the MPK zpubW1; AndW2 with the MPK zpubW2.I was thinking in creating a new segwit wallet W3 with the MPK zpubW3, that would be my multisig wallet, and then I tried to do so by using Electrum 4.0.9. To do so, I followed the steps File > New/Restore >Type \"W3\" > Next > Multi-signature wallet > Next > 2 of 3 > I already have a seed > Type the W3 seed > Options: (Checkmark \"Extend this seed with custom words\"; Checkmark \"BIP39 seed\"; Ok) > Next > Type W3 seed extension > Choose \"native segwit multisig (p2wsh)\" > Choose derivation path \"m/48'/0'/0'/2'\" > Next > Copy the generated W3 Zpub > Next > Enter cosigner key > Type \"zpubW1\" > Next.However, when entering the zpubW1 or zpubW2 in the cosigner MPK field, the message \"Wrong key type p2wpkh\" appears. So, after some hours of duckducking, I dicorevered that, actually, the multisig native segwit cosigner MPK must start with Zpub (upper case) rather than zpub (lower case), and that, in order to \"convert\" my zpub to a Zpub, I have to create a multisig native segwit wallet for each one of the cosigners, that is, I have to follow the aforementioned steps in the Electrum by using the wallets W1 and W2 respective seedphrases, then save the respectively generated Zpubs (let's name them as ZpubW1 and ZpubW2), and finally use these Zpubs as cosigners MPKs.I am not sure if the above process is right, and, honestly speaking, it seems to be quite strange. Is this logic right? Why do I have to generate Zpubs for W1 and W2?Thanks for the attention, and sorry for any crypto vocabulary misuse .",

The reason for this is to avoid ambiguity between the pubkey standards is that they want to avoid the scenario where the public keys for both P2PWKH and P2WSH are reused. To avoid this and further confusion about what type of keys to use, they just used a different version byte for the master key.It has nothing to do with functionality or security but just to make it a more straightforward and less error prone process. You can also use tools to convert them, but going through Electrum is a bit longer but also much safer.",

So, if I want to sign a transaction from my W3 (multisig wallet), can I simply do it by signing the transaction with the private keys of W2 and W3?

Why do I have to generate Zpubs for W1 and W2?You are mostly correct.You cannot (or rather, you can but only with a lot of difficulty, and therefore should not) use the seed phrase or xpub/zpub from a standard single signature Electrum wallet to generate a multi-sig wallet. If you want a 2-of-3 multi-sig, then you need to create three new multi-sig wallets, have each one generate a new seed phrase, and export the Zpubs from each one. You should also try to do this on different devices - if you set up the multi-sig on a single device then you still have a single point of failure (the device itself).Quote from: massivescam on July 14, 2023, 11:18:00 PMThanks for the answer. So, if I want to sign a transaction from my W3 (multisig wallet), can I simply do it by signing the transaction with the private keys of W2 and W3? Or is there also another step?If W2 is a standard single signature wallet, then no, it will not be that simple. This is why I said above you should not do this, because you will run in to significant problems trying to access your coins. You need to set up three new wallets, each of which is a multi-sig wallet.Quote from: massivescam on July 14, 2023, 11:18:00 PMCould you cite such tools?Here is one such tool: https://jlopp.github.io/xpub-converter/. Once again though, if you convert your zpub to a Zpub in order to create a multi-sig wallet, you will not actually be able to sign any transactions or access any coins in that wallet without significant difficulty. You should instead create three new multi-sig wallets.",

Let's call MW1, MW2, and MW3 the 2-of-3 multisig wallets for W1, W2, and W3 respectively, I can generate MW3 by following the steps outlined at the first comment of this thread by using the Zpubs ZpubW1 and ZpubW2 as cosigners MPK, but, how am I supposed to generate MW1, and MW2? Because, both, MW1 and MW2 will require 2 cosigners, that is two Zpubs each. Should I first generate the Zpubs ZpubW1, ZpubW2, and ZpubW3, and then use them for creating the MW1 and MW2? That is,MW1 <- Cosigned with MW2 and MW3;MW2 <- Cosigned with MW1 and MW3; AndMW3 <- Cosigned with MW2 and MW3.Thank you and regards.",

Once you have three seed phrases and three Zpubs, you can again follow the steps above to create each multi-sig wallet, using one seed phrase and the other two Zpubs each time.

Is it possible to make a \"test\" on-chain transaction? Let me explain what I mean by test. Whenever I setup a wallet W, I send a tiny amount, a dust, of SATs (Satoshis) to an adress of W (input test), and then I send the received SATs to another address (output test), that is, an input and output test. Since I am dealing with a 2 of 3 multisig setup, I would like to perform this input/output test over my three wallets, which would require at least 4 on-chain transactions, for instance:Departing from an address of the Unkown Wallet UW to an address of MW1;From an address of MW1 to an address of MW2;From an address of MW2 to an address of MW3; And finally,From an address of MW3 to an address of MW1.Thus, I would like to know if there is one way of doing this input/output test without spending SATs, what would happen due to the on-chain fees. Furthermore, what happens if I send a wrongly signed transaction? Let's say, for example, that I create a transaction TX of X SATs from MW1 to the Unkown Wallet UW, and that only one of MW2 and MW3 sign TX, or that MW2 and Another Unkown Wallet AUW sign TX. Probably the on-chain would reject such a transaction, but, would the on-chain fees still be discounted?Thanks for the attention, and again, I am sorry for any vocabulary misuse. Regards.",
