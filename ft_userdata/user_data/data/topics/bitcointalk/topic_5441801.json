  "content": "I've been thinking about this for a while and I understand that there are a lot of people who don't have enough knowledge about crypto or they blindly follow anyone who says that \"it's easy to trade crypto and get $1000/day\", but I still surprised that there \"influencers\" are still active and have a huge audience.It feels like people don't remember what happened yesterday, because a lot of these guys say \"bitcoin will go up tomorrow\" and when they are wrong, they just ignore it and say \"NOW it will go up\" and they do it until it will go up to say \"I told you so\". If you look at all these posts you will see that they are wrong almost all the time and try to hide it to save this \"rich trader\" reputation. And people still follow their advice and believe them.Most of these traders don't really earn money from crypto, they promote some scam projects or exchanges. And that's the second point of this post. There are so many \"influencers\" like bitboy that act like a crypto god or the CEO of bitcoin and promote scam projects like FTX and stuff and THEN when the sh*t goes down they pretend that this doesn't happen. Bitboy literally acts like he is the only reason SBF got caught. So my question is this: if people are more aware of crypto/ bitcoin and all these scams, why they are giving power to these \"influencers\" to earn more money and scam more people?And despite us having a strong and smart bitcoin community, why can't we win over \"influencers\" by showing people that they are all fake and lie all the time? We just literally need to who facts to do that. My opinion is that these Twitter people are turning the crypto community into a freak show and people treat it less seriously because of that.",

Others are also too lazy to make their own personal research and instead they will watch YouTube videos or Tweets from these guys that are not really there to care for their money.By the way, if you can fix your post by giving it more space, that would be better for us to read it.",

I mean i can totally understand it, that if you are completely new to crypto and have no experience whatsoever in this space, that you are looking up videos of youtubers or influencers. If you are in this space for at least a few months though it should be pretty obvious to everyone with an average IQ, that those influencers are not trying to help people to make money, but they are only trying to increase their own wealth with the help of their followers.They are either paid by the teams to shill their project, or they got a allocation to the private sale and then they are shilling that project in order to dump on their followers.",

It's insanely lucrative job to be one and they get paid a lot for different teams covering their coins. Reason why they exist is because crypto twitter exist. There are ton of people in crypto twitter who know what they are saying, and masses of newbs or even older ones  can't tell paid influencers and actual crypto enthusiasts apart.I would say that tik-tok and youtube influencers are way bigger problem though. People are actually following what they say just because they show their face and make a show about it.But being smart has never won over masses. Being a populist and putting up a show is what attracts people. IMHO you are giving way too much credit for crypto community or for people in general. People are stupid so markets are behaving stupid too.And we have always been a freak show, there's no way covering that up.",

And, well, teams just pretty much abuse that and hire influencers who would promote their project. If you know Coffeezilla, he recently did a video about how he hired a Twitter influencer to promote his own fake NFT, and the influencer didn't even look at the contract or the project itself properly, he just went ahead and did it. It's why I never use any of my social media for news, I just use it to follow hobby-related stuff.  Quote from: crypticj on March 02, 2023, 08:56:22 AMI agree, but I'm surprised that there are so many of them.

Offering decent pay, these influencers will surely work hard and pay back what they have agreed with. We can't question them actually because they are just looking for a job but too unfortunate that this only lead to ruining their reputation.",

They just want to follow someone whose idea can be follow. Its just like copy trading. Someone promote or say I'll buy this and that then they show results. Of course you cant deny that there are some who wanted to have that kind of gain just by following someone. More or less its bit of a hassle to followers who are just been fooled. Im noy saying some influencers are all like that, there are true to their post without any money involved from the project but unfortunately there are who really doing that for money and they got a tons of followers. These people are the one that should be penalize for just using their power of community since they are famous.",

You can visit the speculation boards and you'll see all sorts of predictions but only a few get it right. Some members seem more professional showing some technical analysis but still the market turns the other way. What makes us better than those influencers?",

The twitter \"influencers\" gave the signal and you're already a millionaire. No need to study, no need to work, no need to develop. It only takes a couple of necessary words from a respected expert impostor who will help you become rich. The reason is similar to people playing the lottery or gambling, where a magical bet will suddenly improve financial situation.Perhaps, my opinion will be in solidarity with the fact that these \"influencers\" have a negative influence and create an unfavorable, or rather, misconception, about crypto currencies.What suggestions can be made to change the situation?",

I know a friend who tried once and he failed big time because it really requires a full-time work amount of effort to become a big influencer. Its not just tweet once or twice a day and follow people and all that, its literally building relationships with everyone, possibly with big communities. First when you start out you need to have a twitter account and join a community and grow there and then share your twitter so they would follow you, after you get some followers you need to keep repeating that, go into communities, grow there, and be friends with people there, and then get more followers from there too. All of these takes time, some of these influencers have been around for 5+ years, that's a ton of work. Sure they make a good amount of income now, but they worked 5+ years to make that money.",

Besides, it was not only the responsibility of the forum, but it was also the responsibility of the investors to assess the project that they are investing in.
