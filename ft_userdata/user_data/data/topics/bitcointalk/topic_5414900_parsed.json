      "body": "The police was probably on the track to be on safe distance behind the suspect. Maybe he instinctively judged that fully crossing the track will be too close to the suspect, and the difficulty of crossing back through the track to escape attack or shoot out may have been considered as well. You actually need a quick thinker or quick problem solver to quickly make the right decision in dangerous situations like that, especially at night, to avoid parking on the track and to consider the life of the suspect parked on the track . But anyone could easily make similar mistake at night (esp parking on the wrong spot) in dangerous situation or under the fear of losing ones life while trying to arrest a possibly dangerous criminal.The police officer could be lucky in this if the suspect committed the crime and deserves that kind of punishment (the vehicle she's inside getting hit by a train) . It's important to note that if she is guilty then the officer has actually succeeded in stopping her from causing greater problems with that arrest which was unfortunately done at night with most of the environment possibly covered in darkness... Another important thing to consider is that his vision and clear understanding of that environment would be very limited at night. If it had been in day time it probably would've been a different issue entirely. Police should be well trained and informed about their environments before and during their assignments mostly for safety reasons and to do their jobs well with little/no problems in order to avoid things like that from happening If the girl is innocent then I suspect it was planned, not necessarily by the officer or humans. In this case, the officer could be dismissed (whether what happened was unintentional) and replaced by officer who would be more aware of his/her surroundings and would care more about human life by putting his/her life at risk to save the life of the innocent he/she was employed to protect at the expense of his own life.",

      "body": "I truly feel terrible for the suspect that was hit by a freight train while she was left inside the police car. It was so wreck less from the police officers to do a vehicle stop in the middle of the train tracks. I don’t think that the police officers really cared about the suspect. Even in the middle of the night, you might not see the train coming at first but if you hear a horn approaching and getting closer. You wouldn’t be thinking twice to get out of the way, and it wasn’t like the police car had broken down.",

I hope they go to jail for a long time.  Fort Lupton police officer Jordan Steinke faces one count each of attempted manslaughter and second-degree assault. Sergeant Pablo Vazquez of the Platteville police faces five counts of misdemeanor reckless endangerment and traffic charges.",
