That's Because a lot of us have made complains about these off topic post that is very nonsensical here on Bitcointalk. Op, I know you might not understand the rules here on Bitcointalk because I guess you were invited by someone who obviously told you that posting anything here will give you money. I won't speak much anymore, because everyone is silent and no one is speaking up. You all should continue though it's a free website. Good luck.",

True true this discussion is very necessary because at first there be need for sexual education among young adults such as we here because a lot need to be learned even as a married couple and not just single people,  but also we need to make a bold statement as regards to rape and even the federal government gave life sentence to those that commit that crime,  rape is animalistic behaviour and a mental disorder same as rituals and the rest of those mental deray line of thinking. But then men are more involve in this case due to the fact that,  men have more physical energy to force a woman more than it is that a woman can possibly do same to a man,  so the case of rape is like gambling,  even though women involve in gambling,  it is still referred to as the man thing at some point.",

      "body": "Firstly, your topic contradicts its content, you should've given it \"Rape and its unequal consequences on both gender\". In your next topic, try connecting the topic and contents harmoniously.Secondly, I think you need to read more about how to create a quality topic, this post lacks the very ingredients to be a  quality one. I still thank you for trying to enlighten others in your own little way. But bro!, A lot needs to be learned. I'll suggest you continue studying other quality posters to see how they construct their posts and the quality of message they pass across. I think you need to visit these threads:Unofficial list of (official) bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQNewbies stop teaching when you need to learnKeep learning newbies, the forum has a lot to offerWhy newbies find it difficult to rank up in this forumFor old and new forum membersWhy newbies get bannedI think the above threads could get you in the right direction and mentality of engaging in the forum. Try your best to read the contributions in the threads and not just the topic alone, there are lots of hidden wisdom there.Finally, we've all seen the importance of what @Hatchy proposed earlier which is the off-topic thread. It continues being relevant as topics like these keep appearing in the board. These could've just gone to that thread with no strings attached. The continual presence of these less substance threads continues to harm the reputation of our local board.",

Dear men, stay woke and focused so you don't allow the pleasure of a few minutes ruin your life and your family name. Is RAPE still prevalent in the current structure of the country? Citizens are more likely to face more difficult challenges that divert their concentration away from these detrimental vices, but I would not be surprised if some continue committing such heinous acts. This corresponds to exactly the topic of discussion I had with colleagues just a few days earlier; there's a lot going on in the country, and we should constantly stick to what's right and distance ourselves from the negative things in our lives. We only have one life to live; there is no such thing as a second life where we can simply make mistakes without being corrected; all activities we engage in should be taken seriously and anticipated with the highest quality.",

I will have to correct you here, that men are more and most involved when it comes to the case of rape is a fact, but that they are more involved due to their more physical energy compared to women is not a fact.I am not a doctor but medically speaking now, sexual desires are typically higher in men than in women, male body contains more testosterone and androgens, which makes sex drive in men way higher than that of women.So speaking of rape, the above is a real factor, to why we have more men that engage themselves In such a barbaric act of raping women, than women do to men.And for the records, I've been sexually harassed when I was about 7 to 8 years old, by two different girls, one in her late 20s, the other in her mid 20s I believe.So yeah, women do rape men too, but not as common as men raping  women, for the reason I stated above.",

Most importantly we have to check the ratio of male rape cases vs that of in female cases to be able to place a balance between the two and along with this discussion.",

OP you should understand that your topic first needs to bear the theme of the message in one sentence.   Quote from: Usasauki2004 on October 25, 2023, 10:23:34 AMWhen did you hear a woman sentenced for rapping a man or even sexually assaulting small boys? You think women don't do this things too? The world is entirely against men. What women will do, and they will consider it less offensive. If a man does the same thing, he will be prosecuted for that. I have heard several stories of women molesting male children and these cases are reported to court and nothing was done of it. They said the young boy enjoyed it. For long time now they have mainly focused on news relating to female abuse especially raping and neglected the male child.",
