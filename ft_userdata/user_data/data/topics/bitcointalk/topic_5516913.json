      "body": "Firstly as at yesterday evening before I went to bed I checked bitcoin's price on coin market cap and I saw about $68k+. I was up this morning running my daily routine and I came across some notifications on telegram relating to bitcoin ATH I then rushed back to coin market cap to check what was going on and I came across a whooping $74,900 I was surprised that the election turned out to work that way.Now why am I narrating this? Well the government runs a country and as a result their decisions affect majority of things and even probably the world as a whole depending on the world power they hold and we all know that the US is part of the world power. I believe that the idea behind the trump movement wasn't really to centralise bitcoin, rather to create a government that supports bitcoin and decentralisation.  Take a look at the EL Salvador approach I think that's pretty much what Trump's supporters are after.",

Quote from: pooya87 on November 06, 2024, 12:22:56 PM Will US government stop attacking Bitcoin?The US government will not openly attack Bitcoin when it promises to acquire more Bitcoin and never sell them. However, these are promises, time will tell.Quote“If I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, United States of America, to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future,” .SourceQuote from: pooya87 on November 06, 2024, 12:22:56 PM Will the US government stop forcing American miners to censor transactions which is a clear violation of one of the main principles of Bitcoin?This will likely stop as I believe the new administration will not toe that part. Trump would want the mining business to flourish as he has once hinted about desiring that all the Bitcoin mining be done in the US. So, anything that will be like a threat to mining may not be his choice of action. Quote from: pooya87 on November 06, 2024, 12:22:56 PM Will the US government stop attacking anything remotely privacy related?

Will the US government tone down its surveillance and attempt to control everything and everyone specifically those who own cryptocurrencies? Will the unfair rules they keep enforcing on centralized services like exchanges stop? Rules like invasive and strict KYC and the nonsense with \"taint\" censorship?This is where the real problem will be, America will always want to control everything, know who gets what and how. Their stance on mixers, privacy, KYC and anything anonymous might not change and that will be the first major test of the new administration.

As to the fulfillment of the promises, we'll the cross that bridge when we get there, as others would say. Reason, alibis, excuses, just like promises, are handy and cheap, after all. Overall, campaign promises are exaggerations. They're not to be taken literally. No voter should fall for obvious hyperboles like, \"On my first day of office, I will fire this man and that\" or \"My first business when I'm sworn is to do this and that\" or \"I will release this and that criminal the very first day I'm in office\". All this won't just happen. Voters should realize that there are complicated processes involved, and that the president doesn't have absolute power. In the end, we should be cynical when dealing with politicians. On the day of reckoning, he/she will just tell you, \"I'm sorry, but I did my best.\"",

The rest of the market, they hardly care about these things, the only thing they care about is how to increase the value of their portfolio and how to maximize profits. That's why people support Trump, they don't care what Trump will do with Bitcoin as long as its price can rise and they make a profit. Trump knows that so he doesn't even need to fulfill all his promises, just bitcoin price increases and everyone profits. The market will quickly forget all his promises and even praise him.",
