But if you only have a couple of rigs and then run them, windows might be fine for you so the list I'm going to go over is first we have windows and after windows we have linux based mining OS so that would include Hive OS or Rave OS and all the different linux based mining OS.",

      "body": "I am a bit paranoid when it comes to my gears, I don't think using online websites that have direct access to your miners is a good idea, broadcasting the IP address of your router, the IP addresses, and login username/password for every single miner is something I am not willing to do.My setup is rather simple, I use Anydesk and Remote desktop (Anydesk is recommended for beginners, don't use TeamViewer because after continuous access they will think you are using it for a \"Business\" and will block your access for a few hours unless you buy their expensive Business plan) to access a PC on site which is on the same network as the miners, the PC has AwesomeMiner installed which I find to be the most reliable management software, AwesomeMiner is FULL of features, I probably only use 20% of its functions.I set a few rules to automate the farm likeIf the temp is > x > pause/reboot the miner and send me an email.if the hardware errors are above and the miner uptime is <n time > send me an email.if the hashrate is below average for more than 5 mins, reboot and send me an emailand the list goes on, basically it would do anything you would do manually if you were sitting there watching the miners, in some cases physical intervention is needed like when PSU dies or something, which is where CCTVs come in handy, you will always know what likely is the problem before having to send someone or go there yourself.You can always pay a little extra and get cloud notifications like SMS and telegram, but I find emails to be more than enough, just make a new email address, sign into the email on your Phone and enable notifications, change the alert sound, every time you hear that sound you know AwesomeMiner has found something wrong in your farm, then from reading the title alone you would figure, example miner (x low hashrate - reboot), I don't even bother unless I get another email with the same error, because usually, that reboot would fix the issue.if you want to reduce the number of times you would need to drive to the farm, you are going to need some smart PDUs because for some miners, you are going to have to power them off and then on, they would just freeze, nothing can be done on the software level, it would be a pain in the *** having to drive for hours just to unplug one bloody cable only to replug it after 5 seconds.",
