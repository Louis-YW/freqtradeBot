Saudi Arabia believe that Iran might attack its territory because of Tehran's warning about a Saudi owned media house coverage of the protest in Iran. Although Iran has claimed that this alarm is baseless because there are no proofs to back Riyadh's claims but the US believe an attack might be eminent. An attack on Saudi Arabia would lead a huge shortage in oil and gas supplies which would to increase the price of fuel drastically. The world would go through hyperinflation if Saudi's suppliers is challenges and the US and her Allies understands the implication. America and the West would do everything possible to protect the interest of Saudi Arabia and I hope Iran understands that implications of an attack on its neighbor. The world might not survive a conflict in the Middle East, especially in the territories of major oil suppliers. Therefore we expect that these nations would be able to sort-out their differences without resulting to military confrontations.",

Granted Saudi Arabia pretends to be an ally of the United States and we would likely defend them in the event of an attack by Iran but I don’t think that’s a strong possibility. This situation does serve as a reminder that our commander and chief has depleted our oil reserves and stopped domestic production where his predecessor had us producing a surplus of oil that we could be cashing in on right now. It should be blatantly obvious to anyone with half of a working brain how much better of America would be had Trump beaten Biden in the last election.",

They're alleging that Sauid Arabia are involved in some nefarious way and they're plotting an attack as retribution.Iranians finally having enough of the Islamic and theocratic fascism so they revolt against the police and the government. Iranian women taking off the hijabs and throwing it in the dirt. They've had enough. The regime won't tolerate it.",

Iranian women taking off the hijabs and throwing it in the dirt. They've had enough. The regime won't tolerate it.The Iranian regime, in light of its policy of not acknowledging that a real societal crisis is raging in the country, will continue to convince itself that everything that is happening is part of a conspiracy that is being orchestrated by enemies abroad. And since it has many enemies, it is easy to claim that one side or the other is behind the turmoil that the country has been witnessing for about two months.Iran’s accusation of Saudi Arabia of being behind the incitement to the protest is not surprising, but it is somewhat unlikely, especially since the movements that Iran is witnessing are of a human rights nature, while the difference between Saudi Arabia and Iran is a sectarian difference, as each party represents a different religious sect, although both of them adopt the Islamic religion. .",

We are still suffering from the effects of the crisis between Russia and Ukraine, we don't need another one to add to the difficulties.",

They never found out what hit them, who and from where. Aramco went up in smokes and Saudi oil production was cut by at least 50%.So the answer is no, they won't be attacked at this point. This is pure psychological warfare to first increase the expenses on both Saudis and Americans (eg. every minute a F22 flies costs thousands of dollars).This is also to increase pressure on Saudis to stop their support of different terrorist organizations and also to shock the global oil market to prevent the price from falling.The threat itself is very real though. The attack will come eventually. If I had to guess, it would be in winter. There has also already been two small attacks (more like warnings) on Saudi occupied ports in Yemen.Quote from: OgNasty on November 03, 2022, 11:01:13 PMThey have a lot of common goals and interests.You don't know either one of these countries. There is absolutely nothing in common between the two, geopoliticallly, economically or ideologically speaking.Quote from: OgNasty on November 03, 2022, 11:01:13 PMwe would likely defend themWell the US military hasn't been capable of defending its own bases in Saudi Arabia when Yemenis forces attacked them, neither could they defend Aramco, Saudi airfields, etc.Quote from: OgNasty on November 03, 2022, 11:01:13 PMIt should be blatantly obvious to anyone with half of a working brain how much better of America would be had Trump beaten Biden in the last election. Trump was fantastic for America; during his \"reign\" the attacks against US military bases increased by 400% according to CENTCOM, Saudis were hit multiple times including Aramco, the $220 million USN \"super stealth\" aircraft was shot down in Persian Gulf with a single shot, the CIA E11A jet was shot down over Afghanistan carrying high ranking spies, amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard went up in smokes in Naval Base San Diego, the largest ballistic missile attack ever against United States took place leaving 140 dead and a 1000 wounded, 2 men infiltrated highest US intelligence circles by pretending to be agents with the Department of Homeland Security to extract all kinds of secrets for months and, a lot more...He was obviously fantastic for US military and intelligence community at least. I didn't even mention how he posted classified information on his twitter account or how Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff effectively stripped him of all his powers in his last months in the office since he was considered a national security threat...

The regime won't tolerate it.According to the London based propaganda machines yes but in reality more than 15 million people who marched on Friday Aban 13 (November 4) supporting the government and protesting against Western/Saudi terrorism and propaganda disagree with you.",
