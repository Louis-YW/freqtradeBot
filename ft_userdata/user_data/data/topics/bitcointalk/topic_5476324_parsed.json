  "content": "Although opay have been around since 2017-2018, at least that is how far back that I started using Opay while as an undergraduate,  the fintech seemed unpopular back then but was still available and gave their customers the best of service, a digital bank which offers some other investment and point of sales services (POS).Recent events in the financial sector, with the cashless society and naira swapping crisis in 2023 be for the presidential elections, alot of these fintech banking systems become the best alternative for Nigerians, this leads  to increase in the popularity of most of the fintech companies ranging from OPAY, MONIE POINT, PALM PAY, KUDA and the rest, of many of them that are thriving today.But even at that, most Nigerians still have they reservations about the digital banks due to the non-physical office and representations, but recent events have shown a different paradigm and one of those digital banks is gaining awards and physical offices opening.OPAY RECENT PROGRESSFirst was an award as best fin tech company, and the second is the opening of a physical offices in some major city's in Nigeria.",

They really helped a lot of Nigerians during the time of cashless policy when money was not available as a result of change of currency. That was the time I heard about the bank and have been using it since then. Many people keep complaining about their lack of physical office but they still stand out and beat a lot of commercial banks in Nigeria in terms of everything. I hope they expand their reach more and become better for everyone to use them.",

      "body": "Opay has really made transactions more easier and faster within the period that it started gaining attention. Opay started gaining more recognition during the naira redesign period, so due to the frustration that bank customers were facing from their various banks as at then, so a lot of people were introduced to use Opay and it helped lot of people perform several transactions without hitches. I think Opay can be trusted since it not centralized here in Nigeria it was only licensed by Central Bank of Nigeria so since the platform isn't centralized here in Nigeria I believe it will be unlikely to defraud it's users so Opay is recommended for safer, easier and faster transactions I also commend them for recorded a sustainable success so far and I pray they continue. I also applaud them on their recent award as it is well deserved.",

One thing Nigerians prefer with this opay transaction is very fast and no delay,  no much charges fees compare to other banks. In other banks sometimes you find it difficult to access your money for days. Is as if opay fon look see the problem of other bank and make their own be what people are looking for.",

Opay has an effective customer service in their platform and as an Opay user I know what am talking about. I have to bring it to your knowledge that you can't open an Opay account without your bank verification number (BVN). Just like every other Banks opay has what is called Tier 1, 2 and 3. And each of these tiers has their maximum amount they can carry and for you to upgrade to a higher tier you will have to provide your documents and do a video verification to really confirm if those documents are yours. So I think opay has a good customer validation and kyc process. I understand we are Nigerians and we are used to life in the hard ways, and this makes us not to appreciate technological advancement. Opay and others are making life easier for everyone to do things at their convenience and at the comfort of their homes. Quoteif you mistakenly lost ur sim u are a goner they will just do forget pin and your money is gone a friend of mine was a victim of this and they even borrowed money on top of it This is not possible, if you lost your Sim and someone tries to do forgotten pin and tries to reset your pin the person will be asked to provide the BVN associated with the account for the pin to be successfully reset and only you know your bvn number. That's why it has been advised several times not to store your bvn or other sensitive information like your seed phrases on your phone.Quotecurrently some banks are planning not to transact with this digital banks because of there little or no effective kyc registrationCan you provide a reference to this your claims as I haven't read or hear anything like this from the newspapers or any radio or TV station. Let's be careful in sharing unverified news as they can be misleading. I will really appreciate if you provide a reference where others can check and see if what you are saying is legit.Quote I for one do not trust this banks and people keeping a large some of money in it should be extremely careful because everything has an end I know many people will go contrary to my statement but that's my stand federal government made a mistake by granting it cac and now they are looking for a way to ban them but because of the cac federal government can't.Another lie here, the federal government can withdraw any cac issued to any business operating in the country once they noticed that the business is harmful to the citizens. I laughed when you said the federal government can't are you joking? Let's go for knowledge first before making some comments in public domain.",

Because any of them would just disappear with customer's funds and there'd be no one to hold responsible. It would be more better if more and more fintech banks follow the open route and get offices. It's already a successful business - why not just open an office and serve customers better?Btw, congrats to the Opay team on achieving the feat.Quote from: Wiwo on December 02, 2023, 06:58:44 PMAlthough opay have been around since 2017-208, at least that is how far back that I started using Opay while as an undergraduate,  the fintech seemed unpopular back then but was still available and gave their customers the best of service, I digital bank which offers some other investment and point of sales services (POS).It used to be Kuda until they mandatorily charged users N50 for every transaction into their accounts.

This physical office that the Opay team established will create more adoption for Opay because some people refuse to use Opay because they don't have a physical office and people think they will run away with people's money one day, but thanks to this new development, it will increase people faith in using Opay service. As e be so I dey enjoy Opay service die if I do P2P trading two seconds I don see my money for my Opay account and I fit do three free transfer each day.

Kuda was my favorite but since they started so much maintenance on their site and most times i find it difficult to log in my Kuda account. The remedy to this at times, is to reboot my phone then sign in again before it can work.  It funny how i have to do that before assessing the app. Although am suspecting that whenever i restart the phone it helps the Kuda app refresh by that it will allow usage. When it comes to OPAY everything is swift and fast i have never had any bad experience on it. My reviews are positive one thing they should try to do is to focus on bringing good features on their platform since they have gotten more users now.",

And other bonuses which make it more better than bank. And anyone can just open at the comfort of your zone without stress. I think many people who were afraid of going to bank due to que, has all gotten an opay account. And if care is not taken opay might replace normal banking system. The reasons why opay is easy than normal banking system is as follows. (1) opay is cheaper in transaction compared to bank. They can never charge you for maintenance fee or unnecessary expenses. (2) opy is fast in transaction. Your money can not hang or you can never complain that you did transaction, and it never went to your receiver. Even if such happened they will quickly rectify it even dey don have bank or head office. (1) anyone is able to own an opay account without age restriction. Just by owning a Sim car and NIN you are good to go.(4) you can be claiming daily bonus and cashback at any card or data you have purchased, making you to have a small amount of money that will serve as a deduction fee that would have affected your capital.",

Concerning the new office have heard similar story last month say opay go open new office, an opay agent stays in my area and the lady was telling me to create opay card for free and I asked what if the card expires and she said office go soon come that's why they're doing the card for free",

While people using other banks had to wait for long, at times more than 24hrs to receive credit alert for transfer with that period due to the congestion of  network it was a different story with opay. Not a promotion though but I must confess it saved me from those market women their wahala after buying a product where you will have to sit and be waiting for them to receive alert before you leave  Efficient, fast transfer and reception without transfer fees deduction. Many persons are scared of using Opay or leaving handsome amount of money their Opay account as a result of them not having physical offices networked throughout the country where a customer can work in a lay a complaint, so I think if Opay can make provisions for this to allay this fears they will be stealing many more customers from those other physically situated  banks in no time.Congrats to Opay for the award, it's well deserved.",

If our banks can start operating like this then I can say we have started improving both in tech but instead they are taking over the network.
