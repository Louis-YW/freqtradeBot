  "content": "Hello from Ukraine!I am not entirely sure if I am breaking any rules by posting this information in this thread, but if I am, I apologize and ask the administrators to move this post to the appropriate thread.I represent the team of military volunteers \"Sho Ti Dyadya\" who provide support to our army. We are from Zaporizhia, which is only 40 kilometers away from the front line. We are the ones who help our servicemen to reclaim our lands with minimal losses. We have donors from the cryptocurrency community, and perhaps others might want to support our work and fight.https://uafree.org is the website of our foundation, which displays the intermediate results of our work. It is available in Ukrainian, English, German and Polish.https://www.facebook.com/shotidyadya is our Facebook page (unfortunately, only in Ukrainian) with daily reports on the funds raised and the work done.I have been a member of this forum for over 5 years and I believe that there are people in our community who can support our fight for survival.Thank you in advance.",

And it isn't the Russians who have done it. It is the greed of the Ukraine government people, trying to make personal profits for themselves by making alliances with the US and Nato.",

      "body": "This is a very common Russian narrative, but when you're here and you see what the Russians are doing, it looks a little different. Firstly, if it weren't for NATO, we would still be fighting - we would just have lost more territory and more people. And secondly, have you ever lived in the \"Russian world\"? I have, and I've seen it - that's why I don't want that for myself or my children.",
