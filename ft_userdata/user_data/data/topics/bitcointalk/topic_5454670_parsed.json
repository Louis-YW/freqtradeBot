Ledger is a good hardware wallet.  But if you are looking for another open source hardware wallet and want to switch there then you can choose Trezor as we know it as a good hardware wallet. Charles-Tim has already linked a list here that lists several open source wallets. You can choose your preferred wallet from there but as per my personal advice I think it would be better to use Trezor. I have nothing more to say than that",

This is just what I've needed. You can never trust a company (Ledger) that could easily side with the government for unknown reasons. The private key/seed recovery service tells us the company is already compromised. Why not educate people on how to protect their keys instead? It goes against their claims that they cannot access or know your keys. The hardware wallet is closed source (AFAIK) so there's no way to know how your keys are stored/encrypted on the device. I really hope open source alternatives win for the good of the crypto/Blockchain industry. Who knows if Ledger is bound to die soon? Just my opinion",

I did not see anyone talking about the Electrum mobile app for smartphones.Electrum mobile is great if you want to make frequent transactions or payments, but if safety is your primary concern I recommend using Electrum on an offline computer. If you need to make transactions, you can always use Electrum on a smartphone or online computer in watch-only mode. I am not saying you should not use a good open-source hardware wallet, but if one is too expensive for your budget there are other options that can be almost as secure (if not more so).",

I guess that's inevitable unless they want to go out of business after their last recovery fiasco. Kinda weird that it needs to go this far before they even consider asking themselves whether they are doing a smart thing or not.

I believe he refers to using Electrum with a cold storage setup., not a phone/a hot wallet. You can also force yourself to use a phone and never turn on the internet I guess, but why not use other devices at that point? Anyone who uses their phone to manage their crypto should realize the risk in the first place. CMIIW.",

I am using safepal hardware wallet because i am holding new Altcoins chains also and Safepal is suitable for me but this wallet is not open sourced and also multi coins hardware wallet is not best option to store btc.However i searched on google and found that trezor and keystone are recommended by many users.  Trezor are most demanded wallet and i saw many users are reviewing positive about this wallet. ledger nano are now changing and it's becoming more centralized which is against the reason users want to choose hardware walletI asked ChatGpt about best open source btc hardware wallet and here is answerQuoteAs of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there are several open-source hardware wallets available for storing Bitcoin (BTC). However, it's important to note that the landscape of hardware wallets can change over time, so it's recommended to conduct your own research and verify the latest information before making a decision.One popular open-source hardware wallet for Bitcoin is the Trezor Model T. Trezor is a well-established brand known for its security features and user-friendly interface. The Trezor Model T supports multiple cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, and offers features like a touch screen, passphrase encryption, and a secure recovery process.Another option is the Coldcard Wallet, developed by Coinkite. It is designed specifically for Bitcoin and offers advanced security features such as multi-signature support, hardware-based entropy, and air-gapped signing. The Coldcard Wallet is open source, and its firmware is available on GitHub, allowing the community to verify and audit the code.While these are popular choices, it's essential to consider your own requirements, security preferences, and any additional features you may need before selecting a hardware wallet. Additionally, it's always a good practice to check for the latest information and reviews to ensure you make an informed decision based on the most up-to-date knowledge available.",

It is safer than using a closed source hardware wallet.Electrum is nice. But it's not as convenient as a hardware wallet per se. Since it's a software wallet, you can risk losing your BTC if the hacker gets access to your device. With a hardware wallet, they'd need to get physical access to the wallet and enter a PIN to steal all of your coins. Electrum allows you to create a cold storage wallet, but I'd certainly won't be using that to make day-to-day payments with BTC. That's why I prefer hardware wallets, even though some are expensive. The list of open source hardware wallets seems to be growing each day, so only time will tell us if Ledger will become history.

However, it is certainly better compared to using Ledger after their latest fiasco. You can simply build your own device and verify the firmware/etc since it is open source. Using multiple wallets increases the burden of making backups. Sure you can do it, but if you use closed-source software then I don't see it as a significantly better option. CMIIW.",
