Why does this transaction exist?I don’t think a normal man would make such a nonsense transaction.Bitcoin miners always choose transactions from tip of mempools to confirm if it is not their own transactions. It is very basic algorithm from miners and from any business. Don't blame it on miners.Blame it on people who are ready to pay very high transaction fees for useless things like Inscriptions and can afford to lose money for transaction fees because of Ordinals and even lose bigger if those inscriptions turn to zero in value.Bitcoin developers from their technical side must think of solution to resolve this issue but users have their responsibility too.Decentralized? Yes Bitcoin network is still decentralized.",

You took the risk and the worst happened. Now you have a stucked transaction on the blockchain.

There isn't a central authority to come and say what should be confirmed next and after. There isn't a middleman to say what is fair and what is unfair regards transactions' confirmations. The system regulates itself following logical rules.Quote from: itsmyfirstaccount on December 22, 2023, 11:36:55 PMThe miners are too centralized,and a lot of dust trans was made every day.I don't know how centralized the hashrate is right now, but anyway it's not a monopoly.

You can face the developers, not the miners. Either they should do something about Ordinals and BRC20 tokens or get a way the mempool will not be congested as this.Now I am starting to feel like Satoshi should have made some provision to lock the blockchain (restrict) from getting used for other off-chains that are now cause of such high congestion on it. I know that this will make it look like a centralized blockchain since it won't be available for other projects to be utilized, but it surely would have stayed decentralized for Bitcoin without compromising its integrity. I am not sure if this is possible technically or not but imagine a world right now with blockchain that is only dedicated to Bitcoin, it would have been smoother for miners, developers, and users. You know, the kind of thing where we have dedicated servers for \"X\" Virtual Database (VDb), with another one as the disaster management server. Similarly, it should have been only one Blockchain that is a highway for Bitcoin. Like a clean network with no other data getting mixed, such as Ordinals.",
