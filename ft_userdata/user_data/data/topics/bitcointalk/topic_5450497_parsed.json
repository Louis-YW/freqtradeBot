This attitude is common among children, where you tell them that if they keep running like crazy they will fall and hurt themselves, but they ignore you, keep on running, until they fall and hit the floor. Then of course they cry, but when you ask what happened they say nothing. You ask about a lump on their forehead and they answer that there's nothing there, they weren't running and they did not fall. They know that they weren't listening and you were right, but they won't admit it. The best part about it is that if you confront them they'll keep denying until you touch the lump and they feel the pain. Then they get their reality check and start crying again, because they know they can't hide the proof that they did this to themselves. We all have our own ways of dealing with problems. Some will shut down, some will deny, some will get aggressive, some will run away. Such is life.",

Ofc I'm fully aware of what I do and what I gamble with, unlike OP's case here which is more apt to be called \"putting the blame\" to someone else instead of blaming someone. At least, to what my understanding of what those words mean, that's well, what it means. Kinda dumb as a petition though. I mean, I reckon it should be pretty easy to find traces (plus most gambling related stuff need KYC nowadays).",

That is exactly my challenge on this crime that I can't get my head over with. Some punitive measures are just as good as not pronounced because they don't in any way measure with offenses. I have some issues with some legal system because I think a punishment is suppose to wade people off a certain crime, what is pecuniary fine of 150,000 (about $210) as option against a jail term of 7 years or a crime of squandering $8,000 do to prevent future perjurers in gambling crimes.",

I bet they are just taking their chances to use the law to recover their losses since this kind of incident is really happening that hacker use someone bank account to purchase online or gamble. I believe they have a family history of being a compulsive gambler because they can pretend that they really hacked if they don’t have history of gambling. KYC is not an issue since they loss the money and probably casino doesn’t asked them to do KYC since they didn’t manage to withdraw the funds. KYC typically applied when they already want to withdraw the funds. I think the prosecution evidence on this case are their family  background since a mother and son not typically joining together to gamble if they didn’t do this most of the time. With this, they just waste money on fine or jail time instead of just accepting the losses.",

But they directly invested almost $8000 in Nigerian currency Nairo in Sportsbetting without due diligence. I don't know what legal action can be taken if someone gives wrong information and loses betting without checking it.But I don't follow anyone's information in gambling, if someone has given me any information in sports betting, I must have checked it carefully before following it. As every gambling has ricks and these ricks will be borne only by the user himself. It would not be reasonable to impose this liability on anyone else in the event of a loss, and every gambler must be 18 plus years of age.",

Because there are several conditions that make me supposed to win but I fail to win due to external circumstances, like my friend who doesn't advise me to play in certain matches but I really believe that I will win. In the end I didn't place the bet and realized if I had just placed I should have won. Isn't this my friend's fault? LOL.",

If you can question this people and ask them how they gambled aways that kind of money without realising it or stopping themselves, they will say they did not know when. This is the height of addiction. As individuals we should be careful entrusting money to people who we know have a gambling problem.",

It only proves that no matter how smart you are, rules will always be rules, and you can’t get rid of it so you can free yourself and continue gambling. Though it’s safe to gamble as long as you are using your own funds, but in this case, the mother and son have really set their plan but unfortunately, they fail to succeed this time. And even if they can fined theirselves and become free again, I believe these two gamblers will never get rid of gambling.",
