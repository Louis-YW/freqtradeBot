  "content": "I had a shed delivered back in March of this year to finally be able to get my mining equipment out of my basement.  It wasn't so much the noise, but the fact that it was sucking the cool air out of the house.  My a/c unit would run non-stop and at times couldn't keep up and keep my house cool and I only have a 1200 sq ft ranch home so it's not like it was a lot of space to keep cool.  Some of you may not agree but this has been the best move for me.  It's now just about getting the shed running smoothly and as cool as I can keep it.  I've been documenting the progress on YT so if you want to check it out, have a look.Shed Playlisthttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcp3x_5xhfiD_FeoiMPpdnkhZSnzXI8sRRuskymx",

My most recent purchases are the asics.  I haven't bought GPUs in  a few months.  I do have a rig of 8x1660tis that I'd like to replace with 3070's but haven't done it yet.  I am mining Neoxa on my 1660tis, Flux on my 3070s, triple mining Ergo, Kaspa and Zil on my 3060tis and 3080 rig, radiant on my 2070s and Alephium on my 3070tis.  Currently, my electric rate is ridiculously cheap.  I'm on an unlimited plan and it works out to about $0.05/kwh.  I believe that contract expires at the end of November and I will be facing a significant rate increase so I'm mining as much as I can until that time.Ruskymx",

I don't see the possibility of earning at the rate- 5 cents per kilowatt.  I don’t have electricity limits for ASICs, and I don’t want to buy several ASICs, although they are now mining better than video cards.",

I too tend to scale back or shut off mining in the summer due to not wanting to exhaust all the cool air from my house only to have to power my air conditioner to recool it. Besides the added electrical cost, you’ll wear out your AC unit and have costly repair bills. It’s too hot where I live to get by with a mining shed or I’d be all over it.",

It’s too hot where I live to get by with a mining shed or I’d be all over it.  Air conditioners have always been expensive cooling for mining. Miners therefore use ventilation, and fans are inexpensive and have a long lifespan.Video cards with good ventilation tolerate heat well and at temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius on the street I had no big problems.",

It’s too hot where I live to get by with a mining shed or I’d be all over it.  The shed was the best decision I made in mining so far.  It's been fantastic once I figured out the amount of intakes I needed.  It took a bit of trial and error, but I now have plenty of intake and can filter the air coming in.  I'll be able to regulate the intake too by increasing the MERV rating of the filters and using more restrictive ones if I need to.  I may have went a little overboard with the intakes, but it was just over 90 F here and everything ran fine.  Cards still were at 60C where I have autofan set and no issues.  Plus my house AC didn't have to work even harder to keep the house cool.  Now I just wish I ran more power to the shed.  Maxed out on my 100amp panel",
