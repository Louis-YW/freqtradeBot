Just don't borrow money from \"fast loan\" companies. They are way worse than a bank loan.In my country, even consumer loans are covered by a collateral or by somebody, who guarantees the loan for you.AFAIK, Life insurance is also a must for applying for a loan(at least where I live).That way when something bad happens(the borrower dies or gets injured) the insurance company would pay a compensation fee, which can be used for covering the loan.I prefer to stay away form credit card debt. I used mostly paper cash for spending. I have nothing against credit card debt in general, I just don't need it.",

All my life I tried to live within my own means and never take out any loans - which of course doesn't work. I needed a loan back in university to finish my studies and I needed another loan to help our families keep our house and renovate it. In both cases it was necessary to get the money from the bank and there was no real alternative. In my opinion it's best to look at a loan as a means of last resort that should never be used lightly. We shouldn't be borrowing money for leisure or other unnecessary expenses, because the risk of getting used to living a lifestyle above our means is too great. Before you take out a loan make sure that there is no alternative, maybe you can hold of your purchases for a few month and save the money first? In my country it's not really easy to get a loan, the bank asks for a lot of collateral and if they see that you already got money from another institution they will likely not accept any new loan.",

How would you deal with the problem ? I am all ears.First of all you should not take a loan if you didn’t have the capacity to pay it on time including all the interest. Second taking a loan just to pay the first loan will just make you pile up with more debt due to more interest rate. You should have a stable income from salary or business in able to manage this kind of connected loans.I do this sometimes when I first apply for a business loan. I struggle to pay since my business is just new and can’t generate enough profit to pay the monthly dues and interest rate so I decided to get another loan to assist me on paying the monthly dues and interest until my business can generate enough profit to pay the loan itself without affecting its own budget for operational cost. I plan this loan including the emergency loan in case shit happened in my business since I have back up funds from my crypto.Availing loan is very good to get capital without the need to spend yours if you are planning to have a business. But taking a loan for personal expenses alone is a very bad idea especially if you just use the money to purchase something luxury like car and house while your salary is not enough to pay for it.",

Even now that there is a small tightening, the debts do not stop growing.In the end, the individual does not have a printer and ends up going bankrupt if he enters the circle you say. Or selling the few assets he has. A very typical case is that of someone who has a half-paid mortgage, but gets into a spiral of consumer debt and credit cards, and to get out of the hole what he does is to take a Home Equity Line of Credit.I avoid debt like the plague, although I recognize that sometimes some debt is smart, and many companies do it but for most ordinary people it is usually a disaster.",

For loans, Only take or borrow money that you are certain you can pay back, If not at once but in not more than three installments. Taking money from a bank or someone with the hope to be able to raise the money, that is , you have no means to repay but relying on just hope to be able to get the money before the agreed time for repayment is a highly Irresponsible behavior. Avoid getting used to taking loans as a way to raise money, that habit can be bad for your financial life.",

I've seen relatives of mine and friends that had hard time getting out of that cycle.If you're going to take a loan, make sure that you'll be paying it from your means/source or salary. Because if you'll going to get it from another loan outlet then you're just sinking yourself to a problem that's hard to deal with.Yeah, there's probably the majority of us that has loans, be it from the banks or from personal loans to the people we know.

If you have a steady job, you can buy something like a house, or a car to get to a job if you need one. You shouldn't buy things you don't absolutely need. Because at any time your financial situation could change. And not getting behind on your bills from a luxury thing you thought needed will make you regret your life decisions. And even if you think that you got everything under control. Your investments are doing fine and you got a job. Those can be gone in a week. Pandemic taking your job, nearby war crashing your finances and making the price of everything more then 2x in a month. There could be a bank run. And last thing right then is need to pay up those bills of the things you can't even afford using anymore.Having a credit card creates a great buffer that works as safety if something happens that you haven't budgeted, but you can soon forget it's for your safety only and can easily use it as bonus money.

So how to deal with it... simply by cutting down your expenses, quitting some expensive \"hobbies\" and moving to a moderate lifestyle.

When unable to pay back a loan on time, borrowing money from other sources may provide some respite, but in the long run, it just increases the financial load.Prioritizing debt repayment and developing a budget plan to efficiently manage spending are smart ways to handle this problem. Planning the loan repayments in accordance with the terms and circumstances of the loan agreement is essential. It's crucial to let the lender know about any troubles you're having paying back the loan; they could offer you some other solutions.Finding methods to raise income, such as by taking on a part-time work, selling unnecessary possessions, or reducing spending, is an additional option. A financial adviser may provide advice on the best course of action and assist in developing a strategy for repaying debt.Furthermore, it's critical to take charge and refrain from taking on new debt until the existing obligation is repaid. One might concentrate on creating an emergency reserve for unforeseen costs and strive towards financial security rather than depending on loans.",
