  "content": "Base on the info shared by Wasabi wallet on Twitter as from June 1st, Wasabi wallet will longer support coinjoin service. QuoteWasabi Wallet will continue to function as a regular bitcoin wallet, users can generate private keys to receive and send bitcoin. Even without coinjoins, Wasabi’s client-side filtering architecture, Tor integration and custom coin selection make it the most private light wallet available. However, the nature of the bitcoin blockchain prevents users from obtaining complete privacy without coinjoins.This also affects users of other wallet clients that connect to the zkSNACKs coordinator, like Trezor Suite and BTCPayServer.Wasabi Wallet is a free and open-source software and will continue to be maintained. Anyone can contribute, open new issues, submit pull requests, or even fork it. zkSNACKs will fund the continuous maintenance of Wasabi Wallet’s basic features.https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/zksnacks-is-discontinuing-its-coinjoin-coordination-service-1st-of-june/After what happened to Samourai wallet https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5494114.msg63988345#msg63988345, I guessed we all expected this to come also.",

But United States is trying to take down everything that is about privacy for bitcoin. At least the wallet will become reputable again on this forum on June first by not having conjoin.",

The American government hates privacy, especially with regard to financial transactions. This is against the government’s policy, which wants complete control. The concept of privacy and decentralization is completely against governments.The US government is currently attacking decentralized wallets, which appear to be subject to US regulations by force, and the Wasabi wallet has been blocking US users from accessing its services a few days ago.",

So the decision by wasabi doesn't come to me as a surprise, everyone is trying hard not to be at the wrong side of the law. Who knows what's next? Perhaps, government's next course of action would be forcing DEXs to start collecting users data. Our privacy has always been a threat.",

Did not cost a lot of money to do.  So now the USA can and will always say we do not want a 911 attack ever again. So unfortunate that a brilliant and successful attack on 911 has now caused perfect reason for the entire world to lose its freedom.  No matter what country you live in no matter whom it is you side with you do not want a 911 style attack to happen so every government if they choose now hides behind the fear of that attack to justify more security and less freedom.Since moving wealth with coins on the sly could mean terrorists are getting funded.",

Whoever wants to create a tool that gives people back their right to privacy should do it while they are anonymous, too, and it should be the tool that is as decentralized as possible so that the government just can't take it down by seizing a couple of servers.Looks like some of these people never ever borrowed a leaf from Satoshi. Since they are well known, they are now in panic, and they know that they are the next targets.",
