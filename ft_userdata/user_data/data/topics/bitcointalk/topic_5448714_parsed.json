Please Inform me About it,, if you know If you are sure that someone is scamming, and you have the proper proof of the scams they have done then the best child board for you is \"scam accusations,\" at that board you can report those scammers. But, keep in mind that if you are accusing someone for scamming, and your proof is not showing enough details to prove the scam then you will be responsible for defaming that member whom you reported.It's always better to get proper proof of someone's scam before accusing the person. And, if you are accusing someone due to hatred or any other reason that has noting to do with scamming, then instead of that user you might get punished for such behavior.",

Where will I report about them. I posted but.  The post was deleted. Please Inform me About it,, if you know The reason why your post[1][2] was deleted was that you failed to read the rules of that thread, it was clearly stated at the Op that newbies and jr members are not allowed to make posts in that thread and since you're still a newbie you went against the rule. Quote from: Timelord2067 on April 14, 2022, 10:23:36 AMNo \"Newbie\" or, \"Junior Member\" can post an investigation in this thread.  They can however post a link (once) to a thread in the reputation section where their investigations can be investigated and analised.The only way in which a newbie or Jr Member can post is if they are appealing NEGATIVE trust being left on their trust feedback page.  (If the post is neutral, then their appeal *may* be deleted)So it would be better for you to just create a new thread in the reputation board since you're trying to catch bounty cheaters. P.S. Why do I read the bolded text in your Op as \"how do I get merit?\" [1] https://ninjastic.space/post/62090544[2] https://ninjastic.space/post/62085279",

Please Inform me About it,, if you know Scammers are people who steal funds from others, or are likely to do that, if you think someone is a scammer you can start a new topic to tell other forum members and leave negative feedback too. If you find two accounts in the same bounty, PM the bounty manager; do you want to take their place in the bounty campaign with your main account?",

Please Inform me About it,, if you know If you're reporting a scam, there's a board for scam accusation, you can also use reputation to report such user, but while doing this, ensure you have enough proof to back you up which will serve as reference to what had been detected, as for the reason why your post is found missing, maybe you posted on a wrong board or didn't know how to report as appropriate, it might have been moved to another board or deleted as you have suspected, you can learn how to report scam from the previous threads made on scam accusation and learn.",

Where will I report about them. I posted but.  The post was deleted. Please Inform me About it,, if you know To get \"Mertie\" you have to change a lot of things in yourself first. To begin with, it is necessary that others can understand what you write without guessing and putting together puzzles. Maybe I will disappoint you, but exposing a scammer or cheater is not done to gain merit, or Martie as you say.Copied proof of post or your guess is not enough proof for anything, you have to try a little harder. If you are going to accuse people only based on your insinuation, you better not do anything. btw. I find you spam Zenland bounty with POA posts even if they do not ask for that. https://ninjastic.space/post/62110759 which confirms what I wrote at the beginning of this post, that you need to pay much more attention to your posts here.",

To avoid it from happening then you should report it to the bounty management that someone is cheating.

Exactly, also my point is why a newbie wants to accuse someone of scamming, that post looks sus to me and you find out the exact reason behind OP posting here. He has something personal with other bounty hunters and now he wants to accuse him of scamming so he created a brand new account.For a member to understand the forum rules and regulation takes time, but he already figured out that some people are copy-posting and scamming",
