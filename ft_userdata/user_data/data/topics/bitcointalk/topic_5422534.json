      "body": "FTX and luna were both rumoured to collapse/face issues before they did. Aside from rumours it's been historically impossible to prove without potentially causing a collapse before the company - which remains one of the main proven ways to do this. Generally large acquisitions by regulated companies have to be reported and this is one clear way to know if a company is overleveraged or not. There are sites that let you see the positions institutions have open but I think they're all aggregated into one or two as apposed to listing individual companies - but I might be wrong on this one.Also if the company is publicly traded, you should be able to access information on what they own and how they run (but be careful if they're not publicly traded or you're not checking their parent company - coinbase uk always functions at a loss and doesn't have many assets iirc likely for tax purposes or other reasons).Edit: don't interpret this as me saying that coinbase is a safe place to store funds.",

USDT, USDC and BUSD now have regular audits and there is much more regulation over those coins.For example, take a look at tether transparency:Quotehttps://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports",

AFAIK, the CEO of it, another young guy who has traded the deposited money of their users too. I think it's a good idea to know from these exchanges who are also betting with their depositors money through margin/leverage trading.Since it's like a free money to them, they can make money out of thin air if ever they win with the money they used for leveraging and just return it without giving notice to their poor and innocent users.",

That CEO went to India and died there, and the only ones who saw his body were a doctor and supposedly the deceased's wife. As for all those CEOs who are intoxicated with the billions of dollars they keep, I think that few can resist doing something illegal, especially if they know how hard it is for someone to discover them until everything goes downhill.An interesting infographic perhaps best shows some things.",

That CEO went to India and died there, and the only ones who saw his body were a doctor and supposedly the deceased's wife. Before he went to India, it's said that he's been playing with their users fund transferring here and there trading with leverage on other exchanges. And that might be the reason why he went to India and did what he has to do. This is where the different theories and conspiracies comes in about him having a facial surgery to runaway from the ruckus he has left.Quote from: Lucius on November 22, 2022, 11:46:30 AMAs for all those CEOs who are intoxicated with the billions of dollars they keep, I think that few can resist doing something illegal, especially if they know how hard it is for someone to discover them until everything goes downhill.An interesting infographic perhaps best shows some things.Those that have the ill intention will eventually have to think their plans if they want to execute the same thing as what Sam and crew did. I guess on this age, the most transparent companies will be the ones that will be trusted by most investors.But, they can't blame many of us if we're no longer putting trust to any of them.",

Should we care so much on something that is less concern to us, once you're not part of those identified with exchanges and your asset are safely secured in your wallet then you should be more interested in the yield that might come through your holdings and investment with bitcoin than which exchange is next for a fall.Quote from: Professorofbitcoin on November 22, 2022, 01:09:29 AMAlso does Tether (USDT) scare anyone?Well this is a stable coin of which is more safer than many of those alts coins you could think of because it's pegged together with USD standard rates.",
