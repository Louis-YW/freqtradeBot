Some developers are leaving for Aptos and Sui. Solana also shuts down when there is too much load, this appears to be a recurring problem. Also, the founders, do they remain commited to the project? I reckon if they do something similar to what Dan Larimer's team did with EOS, where they said they will leave the project to the community, I am certain this is a signal that they are leaving a sinking ship.",

Those NFT migrated to the another blockchain didn't mean if the owner will be dumping all of their NFT. I see nothing happened even if they were having some versions of NFT. The migration from those NFT might be decreasing the traffic a little bit but it doesn't mean those migrations were creating panic sell for SOL. It seems like that the dump happened caused by bad news.I saw that solana was in a critical situation at this moment.",

They started from it but now the dev's have implemented a bridge to ETH and Polygon. I don't think the reason for it is about the fees as I never heard SOL before experience an increase in fees like on what we see in ETH and maybe in polygon but that's because they got a lot of traffic but I still think that the increase in fees in matic is not that much as compared to ETH, so it was still a good alternative.It's reported before that Solana is undergoing some issues but it's still far from dying as it's devs are still looking for a way to fix it's issues. I don't think it's devs will let that happen. So people or it's supporters should keep the same faith for the coin.",

I don't think it's devs will let that happen. So people or it's supporters should keep the same faith for the coin.I also do not believe that Sol will die but investing or continuing to hold Sol needs to be carefully considered, investing in sol at this time is too risky. One thing we should know is that even though Sol has dropped from $230 and its current price is $16, angel investors like FTX or Alameda only buy it for $0.50 in private round. So even if it drops further, they still make huge profits, so I wouldn't be surprised if it falls further. But also retail investors like us who buy at high prices should consider cutting losses.",

If SOL drops, it will be totally unrelated to this, and if it ever goes up it will be unrelated to this as well.I believe that we are going to have some sort of trouble in the long run if we just trust SOL to be good based on the projects it has, because those projects could leave at any moment, if you want to trust SOL then trust it directly and invest into it because SOL is good and not because of any other project.

Therefore, in order for Solana to regain confidence again, new investments must be entered, and this seems unlikely at the present time.",

I only saw people blaming meme token BONK for it. I had to google DeGods because you mentioned it and as i've seen that word around but never looked it up. I have followed NFTs from the sidelines i am constantly missing out free mints. Now this brings me 2 questions.1: Why an earth people think NFTs have died when some of them have outperformed every altcoin out there in the bear market?2: Where do i find new free or interesting mints of PFP art?",

Can't blame them though, nearly every collection's floor price tanked and volume kept declining. But just like altcoins, NFTs likely will follow the broader crypto trend.2. Yes it can be tough. You gotta be involved in some communities, which are mostly active on Twitter and Discord. Join some top collection's Discord/Twitter groups and see where it leads you",
