Let's start with bitcoin transactions well currently I'll say fees are ok and as good as new compared to periods of early this year and late last year. Lol I remember vividly the time transaction fees were so high to the extent that averagely fees were around 11- 15 sat/byte.Now concerning the bitcoin bull, I don't really think that bitcoin will be hitting the $100k mark  anytime so soon or rather this year. It's definitely going to take a while based on some certain price movements this year. If you can recall vividly, bitcoin hit the $78k mark recently this year which was the major bull price I speculated this year . Anyways hitting a 100k would be nice though I don't see it too soon this year.",

Bitcoin may be sitting at $60,000 today but in the future when the price of Bitcoin is ten times higher, you will be reminded of today over and over again to regret it. I have a firm faith in Bitcoin that one day it will serve as an indicator of the wealth of people on earth, the more bitcoins they have, the richer they will be.",

We must try to remain positive, can't stay forever on this declined market definitely we are going to raise a new ATH other than what we have as of now.",

What is your personal opinion about BTC?Do we need to care so much about the price of Bitcoin reaching $100k? It's not important because the most important thing now is to acquire as many Bitcoins as we can, as for the price it can reach any ATH with time so if the price hits $100k and you only have just very low fraction of it in your possession do you think the price hitting $100k will make much sense to you? not really so what we should be doing now is to accumulate more Bitcoin and forget about if the price will reach $100k sooner or not. Bitcoins future is already convincing so what we can do to help the process now is to buy and hodl more Bitcoins.",

But Bitcoin is something that is accompanied by a volatile nature where there is no stability in price during an increase or decrease in the market, And Bitcoin will certainly grow much more in the future and encourage everyone who tends to be involved in Investing in Bitcoin, Bitcoin is one thing that is very interesting in my personal perspective of course.Quote from: Wonder Work on August 27, 2024, 06:46:58 PMI have been familiar with BTC since 2012.   One very interesting achievement from me for you. where you know Bitcoin for such a long period of time, it seems like you are one of the Investors who already have quite a long flying hours in the world of Investment especially in bitcoin.",

It's surprising for a beginning Bitcoin supporter who joined earlier. Most of them spent their holding, like buying pizza, as we all know the history. But for us, we are witnessing how Bitcoin is growing since we joined later. To imagine a Bitcoin future, we just need to study Bitcoin history. We can't exactly predict the future, but we may imagine where Bitcoin will reach. Once a time, buying one Bitcoin would be a dream. But still, it's at a reasonable price, and we aren't buying. Definitely, we have to regret those who aren't holding Bitcoin.",

What is your personal opinion about BTC?Bitcoin is very likely to go upside soon. September is coming, and many investors are confident Bitcoin is going to enter a new bullish trend from that moment on until December or even the first months of the next years. I believe in a new ATH which has potential to push Bitcoin above 100,000$, although it's not a guarantee, since we have never crossed the 73,738$ mark. Before talking about 100,000$, Bitcoin still has to hit 80,000$ and 90,000$, which aren't easy achievements at all, considering they have never happened before.Anyway, I feel optimistic and confident about Bitcoin on short run (next year). There are also some other factors to influence Bitcoin price right now, especially US elections, which can boost Bitcoin or not, depending the results.",

But the correction was supposed to be a thing that won’t last but due to the current economic crisis creating fears we are still in the ranging market. I have also tipped bitcoin to reach a six figure this year after it broke the $70k so early but as things stands now with the globally economy I don’t think the prediction would actually manifest, but one thing i still have conviction about is that the market will pump hard in the last quarter of the year year but I don’t think it will be enough to get it to a six figure.",

What is your personal opinion about BTC?My personal opinion is that it won't matter what the price of Bitcoin is going to be soon when you don't own any Bitcoin. We should buy Bitcoin because it is going to be the currency of the future. The price for Bitcoin is going to go up and down always and this gives an avenue to buy Bitcoin but the people losing are those that refuse to buy because they decided not to believe in Bitcoin hence they miss out on an avenue to make profit. There were people that refused to buy Bitcoin when it was cheaper than it is now and they are angry. Anybody that isn't buying Bitcoin should be buying sometime more better because if they buy things that do not matter, they will be among those writing threads and wishing they bought Bitcoin below $100k. Bitcoin isn't going to die hence we should be preparing to welcome it into our life by making sure we don't miss investing in it before it has more value.",

You still think bitcoin will do well in the near future or bitcoin is already doing well? because I don't know how you see bitcoin but a paradigm that came in with a price of 1$ only and now it's around 60kish price and has hit an ATH of over 73kish + I do not know how you think of bitcoin but it's over what you think of it right now, bitcoin is not longer struggling to do well rather it is already doing well at this point. My personal opinion is that bitcoin is a paradigm shift that has moved our think of money (currency) from a paper that is always depreciating and printed overly every year by some few calibers of people called government, and bitcoin has help privatize our life's where we can handle or hold amounts that we can hold in banks without being questioned in it, it has cleared my international transaction with out stress. bitcoin is currently my favourite innovation or invention.",

Also, bitcoin’s performance in Q4 will largely depend on the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates. If they cut rates as planned, we could see strong growth and vice versa. Not only us, the whole world is waiting for news from them this September and December.
