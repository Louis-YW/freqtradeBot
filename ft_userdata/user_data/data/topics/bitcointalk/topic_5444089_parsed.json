      "body": "The wallets generate the transaction fees for you based on their estimation of mempool (unconfirmed transaction volume) congestion across the network. Higher numbers of unconfirmed transactions will cause most wallets to apply higher fees in order for your transaction to be confirmed within the next block, or the next 5, 10, and so on.",

      "body": "When you make a bitcoin transaction, you are the one who sets the transaction fee. Since the block size is limited and miners can't include any number of transactions they want, they have to pick some transactions. To maximize their profit, they pick the transactions with higher fee rate.Therefore, if you are in a hurry, you should use a high fee rate and if you are not in a hurry, you can set the fee rate as low as possible.",

I understand that transaction fees are generated, but how? Please help me out. There's no particular entity that sets the transaction fee.It's the wallet's estimation depending on different or unique factors; or what's set by the user.For example, Electrum has 3 transaction fee sliders which work differently:ETA which uses complex algorithm based from the newest blocks and mempool.Mempool which is solely based from the size of your server's mempool.Static which is a set pre-set values.For generation of \"fee\", it's simply the difference between the inputs' and the output's amount.The \"fee rate\" is the 'fee' divided by the transaction's virtual size.",

I understand that transaction fees are generated, but how? Please help me out.Fees aren't \"generated\". They're set. And they are set by the user. If you subtract the total value of outputs from the total value of inputs, you get the transaction fee.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on March 09, 2023, 01:12:30 PM1. Minimum 1 sat/vbyte fee rate due to default node policy which doesn't broadcast transaction with fee rate lower than it.That was the case, until recently, though. Now most nodes will not accept 1 sat/vb, due to the exceeded memory usage. From a quick search at mempool.space, most nodes will purge anything < 2.53 sat/vb. Just in case I'm confusing OP: Just because some nodes decide to purge some transactions due to exceeded memory usage, it doesn't mean they're invalid. A miner can normally include them in a block if addressed.",

      "body": "Blockchain transaction fees are generated by users who send transactions across the network. When a user submits a transaction, they include a fee as an incentive for miners to include that transaction in a new block. The higher the fee, the more likely it is that the miner will include the transaction in the block.In the Bitcoin blockchain, for example, the transaction fee is determined based on the size of the transaction and the current network load. The larger the transaction size and the busier the network, the higher the fee should be in order to attract the attention of miners and speed up transaction confirmation.Transaction fee payments are made to miners who created a new block and included transactions in that block. On the bitcoin blockchain, for example, miners receive both a reward for creating a new block (which is currently 6.25 bitcoins) and for all fees collected from transactions included in that block.Thus, transaction fees are the mechanism that provides the motivation for miners to confirm transactions and create new blocks on the blockchain.",
