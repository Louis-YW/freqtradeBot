  "content": "After Coinbase multisig vault was discontinued in 2018, a third-party multisig-tool was introduced on Github.But that one stopped working as well.According to this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436171.msg61722006#msg61722006 the forked version (https://github.com/dlajarretie/multisig-tool) still works correctly but needs to be run locally.I am stuck halfway in the instructions provided on Github and would appreciate if someone could guide me through the rest.My progress so far:-I installed Linux Ubuntu on a spare computer-I installed npm and browserify-I cloned the repository from: https://github.com/dlajarretie/multisig-toolI entered the following commands in the multisig-tool repository in the terminal:-npm install bitcoinjs-lib-npm install --save bip38-npm install bip38 crypto-browserify --save-browserify -r bip38 -s Bip38 > lib/multisig/bip38.jsThe latter command didn't show anything in the terminal, but I do see the \"bip38.js\"  file in the lib/multisig folder so  it could've been successful.Are there any other steps I've to perform before going further?When I enter \"make run\", I get the following error:cd lib/multisig && \\../../node_modules/.bin/browserify -r ./vault -r ./views/addresses_view > ../../multisig.jspython -m SimpleHTTPServermake: python: No such file or directorymake: *** [Makefile:2: run] Error 127I look forward to hearing from the community and very much appreciate the help.Also shoutout to o_e_l_e_o for being extremely helpful in the DM's.",

      "body": "Never use this Coinbase vault recovery before but based on what I understand from the guide on Github under the \"make run\" it looks like a permission issue.Code:Running locallyIf you wish to run the tool locally, you need to do it through a local web server. The easiest way to do that is by running:make runThis is because we use Web Workers for decrypting your BIP38 encrypted shared key seed, and Web Workers are not permitted to run through the file:/// protocol.Another alternative is to run Chrome with the --allow-access-from-files parameter.That is I think it suggests running Chrome with this parameter \"--allow-access-from-files\"Why don't you just use the hosted one since it's ready to use?They do only need the online on the first step when pasting public keys after they found balances you can now turn internet off and start the recovery process.",
