  "content": "Thanks for everyone who participated in the poker chips that I did earlier this year, they turned out great!I was thinking of what else I could do to contribute to the Bitcoin collectible community and thought about a Bitcoin version of the game Risk.  Here is what I thought of so far:Game mechanics cannot be copyrighted, so using the Risk gameplay ideas should not be a problem.  We just need to make sure names and graphics are unique, should not be a problem.https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/  allows for custom boxes, cards and boards,  prices vary based upon how many copies.I was thinking of making the 6 armies being:Green - US Dollar/banks.  Game pieces would be ¢, $ (5 units) and a bank (10 units)Orange - Satoshi/Bitcoin   Games pieces would be Satoshi symbol a Bitcoin symbol and a round Bitcoin for 10 unitsBlue - Ethereum   Game pieces would be Ethereum logo and ?Red - BRICS     Game pieces might be small gold bars?  and a bank 5 units?I need advice for the 5th and 6th army, as I am not really into any other crypto...lol   I am a fan of Elon, so maybe Doge (yellow) might be an option.  Maybe XRP (which for the record I totally despise),which would be a great villainous black army!Countries - I would want the map to be updated to avoid any copyright concerns and would want El Salvador to stick out.  I was also thinking of making a \"home country\" for each as a variation.  For example, in Risk if you own the country when you trade in cards, you get 2 bonus armies, I was thinking of making that 4 if you own the country and it is the home country of your particular currency (El Salvador for Bitcoin, Eastern US for dollar/FED, Russia for ETH, China for BRICS, etc.).Cards - I was thinking the same overall concepts with the cards, except rather then the soldier the horse and cannon, we could have an ASIC, a pick (if we go with gold) and a printer for the money printer go brrr.I believe Slumberjack is interested in doing some of the artwork.As for the game pieces, I was thinking we could get MM to 3d print the pieces, I have a 3d printer and will gladly help.This would be similar to my Bitcoin Poker Chips where I will not make any profit, just looking for assistance with the design of the game.  I would like to ensure that Slumberjack gets paid for any artwork contributed (his work is awesome and I think is a necessity.Think of the glory of winning a game with Bitcoin dominating the world, game theory at it's finest!Please reply with any interest and or volunteer interest with the design.  Thanks!",

      "body": "Yes, Currency Conflicts!And I want to make it somewhat educational...  I was thinking of each current having a special feature:Us dollar - fractional reserve attack - basically the idea to create extra armies out of thin air for one attack, then have them disappear after, one per gameBrics - some extra defense since the currency is backed by gold, once per game allow an extra defensive dice.Bitcoin - either proof of work with a bonus for each country conquered, or borderless transport to allow reinforcements anywhere.Ethereum - proof of stake, sacrifice a turn to stake your eth, get a percentage bonus of armies.I'm still thinking of cool ideas.  Any contribution is ideas is appreciated!",
