The reserve will include the current holding of the U.S goverment, but the secretary of treasury and commerce is authorized to introduce plans to buy more bitcoin, as long as it doesn't cost the taxpayers anything.

I am surprised with this news, honestly and I did not expect it.But I spent some minutes to think about it, and my thinking is you know who is Donald J Trump, and he is smart, and knows well that it is easier to pump other cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin. It's my first thinking.A second thinking is he will possibly announce to add Bitcoin to this strategic reserve later. It's not big deal with him. He did it many times in his political career, changing quickly and oppositely.",

Bitcoin won't be flipped by any altcoin, because it can not be stopped and attacked easily like any altcoin in this market.

Surely he has contacts with many interests in those cryptocurrencies and hence the inclusion.

If the first by far in terms of USD equivalent invested is bitcoin I will not see it so bad.",

Glad you corrected your post because he has been vocal about bitcoin, including ADA, SIL and XRP in the post now confirms while he later change from using bitcoin to cryptocurrency which means they are planning to hold a huge bag of different selected cryptocurrency. The market has already responded positively to such news with bitcoin over 10% already. With this announcement, I'm more convinced that Trump will be making good with his promises on cryptocurrency.
