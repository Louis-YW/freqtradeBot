  "content": "Some things are happening in some states, they are very unbearable , some of us are taking laws into our hands ,by taking violent my force and fire ,Now today I saw some  videos of how some guys were shot dead today based on the fact that they went ahead to destroy ballot boxes and shooting at the air with guns ,some army men shot them dead , because of that .my question is that can we really vote in peace without killing and violent ?? Just now I washed news and there were videos of how ballot boxes and the vote cast, were destroyed and burnt ,some places were disorganized because of that too.Some were being flogged and bruised for attempting to take away ballot boxes that votes has already been cast on, some people expectially the men took risk today and lost their lives ,so like what's the need of doing all that ?? I just kept asking my self if we all can vote in peace .Now there are three main people contesting for the position of a president in our country ,can there really be peace during this election???",

My polling unit was slow but peaceful, I waited till all the votes were counted I just got home a few hours ago. I’m seeing news that there was interference in the elections by interested parties. Just saw a video of votes for labor Party thrown in the gutter. I just hope that INEC will disqualify those polling unit with these issues.",

We have people who wants to vote their choice into power and people who maybe employed by political parties or candidates just to frustrate the citizens efforts.I believe say some of this election violence they happen because the incumbent government actually endorses it, we have security agencies, The army, police and other who should be deployed without bias or sentiments into polling stations to prevent such violence.",

Our leaders of tomorrow risking their lives for small amount of money, why not go cast your vote instead. I even heard that president buhari ordered the army to gun down anyone who tries to run with the ballot box or destroy them so why still risk your life when you know say you no chop odeshi or juju wey bullet no go penetrate you. Even a young graduate wey just de serve was shot dead around my area as he was trying to run with the ballot box can you imagine that.",

      "body": "Do understand that most video circulating are old videos and a popular example is the Wike speech with laptop (talking to someone about defecting to APC) the video with the guy coming down from a bike and shooting upwards while others destroy the ballot boxes is an old video and it surface in last election. After reading some comments during the last election it was uncovered that it was an army exercise on how arm forces are to act (I can't verify this) but play the video, watch closely those guys aren't Nigerian and chille was been shouted by someone in the background. Abeg who dey call person chille if no be ghanians?As for other videos circulating, it's quite true that the election has been violent and not just from one side, all three parties has their incident of violence. Some has more than others but the violence reach everybody. I see people dem beat because dem wan vote APC and see people they restrict access to voting because dem be Labour. Guess what most of this incidents na for west and south. Nothing badly serious I dun here yet for North and yet we think say dem be the problem?.",

The violence is instigated by politicians, it is very obvious. People were willing to conduct themselves in an orderly manner just to ensure that they casted their votes.Many Nigerians turned up in mass to cast their votes, the youths who have never been involved in elections where out in their numbers to ensure that they made their voices heard, they walked long distances, waited for long hours, stood under the rain, and waited long into the night for their votes to be counted and uploaded, but INEC seems compromised and not independent in their decisions because them just dey do like dem want make the election nor go smoothly, dem dey give room for rigging. They have delayed in uploading some results, made the process not transparent enough, and given room for politicians to take advantage off. If INEC announces a false result, it will be too obvious because are not stupid anymore and that has the potential of causing a crisis, bigger than we have ever witnessed in Nigeria. To answer your question OP, violence can be avoided by INEC, by ensuring the results announced are as the people voted.",
