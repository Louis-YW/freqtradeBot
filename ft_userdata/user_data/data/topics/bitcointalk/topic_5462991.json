Even if you clicked a random link in the internet and it directed you to the technical board or the gambling board. After surfing for the day, you should atleast click the Home of the website.

So one would recognize wrong quotations and wrong formatting immediately and could still correct the posting. If you have forgotten to do this and/or simply do not have the time to do so, it also helps to proofread the post you have just written after you have sent the post. If you notice errors at this point you can still use the edit button and correct the errors. @OP You have already been recommended a lot of links, I personally agree with the first poster and would also recommend the very good thread(s) and postings of Ratimov. So you get a very good overview of what Bitcoin is, how Bitcoin works technically and why Bitcoin is so ingenious. Besides that ... What are your main areas of interest? Are you interested in the technical background of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies in general?Are you interested in investment options?... or are you also interested in projects that are not directly related to Bitcoin but are in the cryptocurrency area?",
