And obviously, in crypto market, bear market is when the price goes down hard and this might take 2-3 years. As compare to stocks that might recover in short amount of time.And if you wanted to make money, then buy at the dip in bear market and then wait for the next bull run to happen (usually right after bitcoin halving, as this process is the catalyst).",

It's always advisable to buy crypto during the bearish market. The cycle will always be buying when it was bearish and then sell when it was bullish. So many people will be scared during the bearish trend. The bad thing is when people are thinking to buy during the pump and sell during the dump. One thing that must be known by anyone if they shall not buy any tokens that owned by scammers just like when the owner of token was refusing to pay the salary for its bounty manager. The scam project is a thing that must be avoided.",

A bear market might sound opportunity to others but in reality, the best way to take advantage of it is to find the best coin that will have a high chance to recover once the bull market comes back because not all of the coins in the market will recover in the future for some of them will remain at their lower price forever.",

Bull market is considered the price will always increase, trading in bull market can reduced your profit since you didn't sell at the peak. If you're still holding, you can sell when the price is on the peak.",
