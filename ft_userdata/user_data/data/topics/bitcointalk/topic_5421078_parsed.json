After looking on your site, it seems it's a custodial P2P since you're act as the escrow, also you will ask KYC when it's needed, right?QuoteEscrow Funding & WithdrawalEach time you want to fund your account, the system makes sure everything goes smoothly thereby providing an Escrow system to protect both parties.QuoteFull data privacy complianceI wouldn't use your service if it's custodial and ask anyone KYC, it would ruin my privacy concern.",

This would solve global online payment issues.After reading your FAQ page I think that you are creating one more shitcoin that you call ''custom coin'', can you confirm this is true or not?You are calling this semi-decentralized finance, but all I see is full centralization for people that need to create account and hold everything in one account.There is no word about using Bitcoin blockchain for anything, and I don't understand what ''Full data privacy compliance'' means, do people need to pass any verification or not?I would like to hear more from you with explanation about questions and concerns I wrote above.",

      "body": "Never heard about peerwallet and the solutions that you've mentioned really are going to be great and helpful. Although that actually breaks the purpose of crypto for which it should be a P2P as you've mentioned and it should be crypto-crypto transaction and settle the crypto-fiat transaction. But since most exchanges and services like this are into convenience, we will eventually forget of what an actual P2P in a crypto setup really is. And to say with this service, there will be other competitors that will try to build up and be the better version of any existing one now.",

If your selling point is just because they're available on the same platform, then competing with existing and to some extent, trusted platforms will be difficult. Not to mention your web design is very similar to those scam ICOs with its long presale service (which will disappear after that).",
