The main purpose of this thread would be share the experiences which any of us has had with this service which intended use with Trezor hardware wallets is to be able to buy, sell and even swap cryptocurrencies directly from your secured device, which sounds good on paper.Since I believe the ownership of Trezor products among Bitcointalk hardware wallet users must be relatively high, I would like to know your experiences and opinions about +Invity, because I personally tried it once and unfortunately it felt lacklustre (I could not even finished the operation I intented to make), this was several months ago and lately, I have been curious on the general concensus of the Bitcointalk community on +Invity.Please feel free to also discuss about other services similar to +Invity, integrated in other Hardware Wallets.",

      "body": "I am not a Trezor user, but I think this partnership is something similar to what other hardware wallet manufacturers have done in the past, such as Ledger. Trezor probably takes a cut which makes the rates worse than what you would get exchanging/swapping directly on the platform in question. Then there is the similar claim that Trezor is using about remaining in custody of your coins throughout the process. More precisely, they call it \"direct-to-custody trades\". I am skeptical about that, the same way I was about Ledger's custody claims. Lastly, depending on the amount and maybe the taint level (ridiculous) of your coins, the exchange you use for the swap could ask you for KYC.",

      "body": "What is more concerning to me is that they use many unknown exchanges and that should always be the highest priority even if you pay 0.5% more. The only thing that I could imagine is that the exchanges pay to be on the top spot, since they are not well known. So in fact you will not pay a cut to Trezor which would be ridiculous.",

Also:ChangeNOW has Bitcointalk account (with red trust) and dedicated thread:Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2811013.0User: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1307188According to trusted members of our community this service may be selectively scamming their clients ,probably those who swap large quantities of crypto, allegedly they have stolen over 100 BCH from a victim and allegedly they are being several services.If true, this does not put Satoshilabs in a good position...I found this thread on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8wsgir/changenowio_scam_fraudsters_have_stolen_100_bch/I believe it is worth taking a look at it, it seems that after doxing and tracking down the people behind the exchange, the guy finally got his money back after months.",
