  "content": "A movie by Dinesh D'Souza called 2000 Mules (2022) has just been released, and attempts to expose the concerted effort to thwart the 2020 presidential election.I know this has been discussed here before, and all the power in the universe came down hard on all those promoting \"conspiracy theories\" about the validity of the 2020 election.  The real conspiracy was the effort by the media to marginalize anyone who sided with Trump as a conspiracy theorist.  The far-left leaning operatives of Democratic party colluded with the media to squash any attempt at rational discussion.  Any one questioning the validity of the election was written off as a right-wing nut-job conspiracy theorist, and subsequently ignored.  All the \"Fact Checking\" seemed to diminish the value of real, hard evidence that there was a criminal effort to steer the election away from Trump.Now this move shows just how real the threat to our elections really is.  Not to fear, however, the misinformation machine is already in full swing with more \"Fact Checking,\" excuse making, and deflection.  Just do a quick google search for \"2000 Mules\" and enjoy the hair-raising vacillations of leftist operatives.So now, we have at least two verified methods used by the Media and the DNC to steal the 2020 election: The killing of the Laptop story in October 2020, and the far-reaching evidence of mass-voter fraud.  The Criminal Enterprise known as the Democratic Party needs to be stopped.I have a feeling we'll soon be hearing about Georgia, Mariposa County, and Dominion Voting Machines again in the near future.  But, don't expect those headlines to trump the January 6th \"insurrection\" as a \"threat to our democracy.\"",

It’s the republicans canceling democrats in their fantasy world apparently. I haven’t seen this movie yet, but I have a couple friends who have and claim that it is irrefutable proof that Biden did not win the election. I’m not sure what good it is to expose this, but just like when it was proved in court that the Clinton campaign and not Trump were the ones colluding with Russia and the media still claims it was the opposite. This will be no different. You could have a judge rule that Biden lost the election and democrats would still claim it wasn’t true. If you want to be angry and see the evidence that the election was stolen, maybe this movie is for you. I’m guessing most people won’t take the time to watch and will continue believing whatever they want. Shocker huh?",

Exposing the crime is the first step to admitting that we have a problem, and the first step towards preventing it from happening again.  I don't plan to watch the movie, because I'm already pissed off and I already knew this was happening.  I knew it as soon as I saw the results of the 2020 election.  Trump got more votes than any other presidential candidate in the history of the United States, and somehow I'm supposed believe that BIDEN got more?  What a fucking joke!Quote from: suchmoon on May 10, 2022, 08:41:09 PMLuckily elections aren't decided by movies.Nor should they be, but the validity of our elections shouldn't be decided by biased, corporate media either.  Our ability to question the validity of elections shouldn't be squashed by big-tech or the media.The hardest part about this is that we now have solid evidence that the United States is currently a bananas republic.  All the horrible things the Democrats and media told us about Trump were the things of which they were actually guilty:Illegitimate president?  Remember that?Russian Collusion?  Hunter's laptop should clear up who's been colluding with foreign powers.Stolen election?  They failed to steal it in 2016, but not for lack of trying.Nazi in the White House?  Lets not forget that the Nazis were socialists who limited gun-ownership and free speech.  Sound familiar?If a Democrat opens his mouth to deride a conservative, you can rest assured it's to accuse that conservative (notice I didn't say Republican) of the very thing of which he, the Democrat is guilty.And speaking of Republicans, where the fuck are they?",

The people decide who's getting into office (ok, in theory one vote from some deep red states in the midwest are having more \"voting power\", so that's why most of the time a Democrat has the most votes but not the most electoral votes and a Republican gets president despite more people voted a Democrat, but hey)So yes, if a Republican will win, he can destroy the environment, fill his own pockets, pack the court brazenly in his favor, make shady deals for his corporate friends and lower taxes for rich people and so on, he's allowed to do it because he's elected. I don't say that's beneficial to society or the planet. But he's elected and needs to be elected! Maybe you just need a third party + like here in Germany, we don't have much problems because different parties need to collaborate. Except the far right (Nazis) and the far left (Communists) we don't have any problems compared to USA's 2 party system. In Germany, the far left and extremist right are combined at 15% currently.

Their only program seems to be \"TRUMP\". It would be beneficial to everyone if there were less Trump supporters. Republicans should just get over it that Biden won the election and nominate a sane conservative Republican next time?  They have the perfect opportunity. Ron DeSantis, former U.S. armed forces member and Harvard Law graduate. Someone that's actually competent. I'm worried that the neo-MAGA minority of the Republican party will elect Trump in 2024 to be the nominee. DeSantis might not even run if Trump is on the ballet because Trump usually destroys anything and everything that opposes him. So he'd be willing to destroy one of the best potential Republican nominees if it meant he could have his way. Biden won the election barely sentient. Trump should have won this walking away even with his normal antics. But as I mentioned, the propaganda arm of the democratic party (ie nearly all MSM organizations) was too powerful. They have too much sway in these elections and have nailed the propaganda wars down to a meticulous science.I remember when George Floyd had his run with fentanyl laced pills causing his demise, how the MSM demonized Trump for enforcing law and order after left wing domestic terrorists began to torch cities in the name social justice. If the media can fool the average American that violence and lawlessness is okay as long as it's in remembrance for a BLM martyr, they're dangerous entity that deserves scorn and contempt. That might say a lot about the American populace, being so malleable to the MSM narrative put in front of them, but propaganda is effective, even on an educated demographic. That's why it's dangerous.",
