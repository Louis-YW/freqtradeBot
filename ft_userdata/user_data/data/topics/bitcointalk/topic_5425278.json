The reason why many weak hands in crypto is because they keep investing money that allocated on other necessary things like life savings, insurance, and personal necessities. The urge of using the money invested on Bitcoin is the force that keeps making crypto holders failed to hold. If only you will invest money that has no purpose other than purchasing Bitcoin. You can easily hold your Bitcoin even if its until forever because you don’t have any reason to use it.",

How we have seen many beginners who lost their money due to their impatience and making reckless decisions in selling what they owned at the bottom. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general started their launch With cheap prices, and now see how much their prices have reached?!, There are those who bought since 2009 and 2010. Can you calculate their wealth now or before several years if these investors were not affected by the FUD or if they had not sold what they had?! Patience is the key to success in the crypto world, so yes, we have to invest part of our capital and wait for the bull market.",

You cannot guarantee how someone will handle their money, and you may be the one to blame for their misfortune. Investments (such as holding bitcoin) do not only require patience, as the OP is suggesting. While it is a vital characteristic, you need to be able to afford forgetting these funds, possibly for a couple of years, no matter what. If you barely make ends meet, then it's certainly not advised to use your savings in Bitcoin. If something occurs and you need them, chances are that you might have to sell at a loss.Edit: 2500th post, woo",

No one probably will fool people who will invest in a higher price and sell when the price is low. So if you understand the BTC movement, you did not worry about your holding but instead just patiently wait on it until your desired profit will come. That is definitely right, patience is a virtue and those who have this will claim a better prize. Avoid panic selling because when you are holding BTC only the amount will reduce but the quantity is not, if you owned 1 BTC it will always the same amount in your wallet, there is nothing loss not unless you will sell it on the exchange.",

I can see the huge benefits of doing this but unfortunately, not all can do it in a very consistent matter, many had fail because it sometimes contradicts their beliefs and instinct. As we can see, many traders went unsuccessful and this is one reason causes for their failure as not all are willing to hold but have been influenced by their emotions. Hold is a simple word to say but very difficult to execute. And it is not to wonder why many traders never win and reach their goal.",

If we are talking about altcoins, I am not sure about it because not all altcoins are able to rise up and grow, survive and develop. but Bitcoin can really be trusted and valued, moreover for long-term investment. W can learn from the previous bearish era where for Bitcoin. this crypto can always survive and then pass the previous ATH. But for altcoins, not all are able to do it. that is why we must be sure and smart enough to choose which crypto is going to be long-term holding with patience.

Patience to hold is the most important thing if you are in for safeguarding your money. Otherwise all you'll be doing is selling at the wrong times and buying at the exact top when it's actually time to sell. But the sad part is that this patience only gets developed with time. You cannot expect a new investor to be patient right from start, he'll go through many losses until he becomes this patient.",
