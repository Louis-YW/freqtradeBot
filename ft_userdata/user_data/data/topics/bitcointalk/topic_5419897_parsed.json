Did you find out why your documents where rejected?2. Are you sure of the documents you presented?After answering this questions then you can go to their ANN thread just as PX-Z suggested.Most times you might have provided the real document required but maybe you didn't submit it in the required sequence or format and that isn't their fault.So I think you should provide more proves to what you said, so you can get better assistance from over here. Thanks",

Which likely means you are using an invalid document. Like your name on the document is not correct with the name that you used to register on the gambling site, or you are using a document not mentioned as part of the ones that can be accepted on the gambling site. These are the reasons I know that can lead to automatic rejection. If you know that your document is valid, you can contact their customers care.But before contacting their customer care, you can try another document. I mean if you use voters card before, you can change it to national ID or driver's license to see if it would work.",

Because the casino must have a reason for taking every action they do, of which they are in better position to explain more about this. However, i just made some search on the reviews about this casino on \"Trustpilot\" and other sites, and to be frankly speaking, I must say the reviews I got weren't that good, as the site was rated 2.9/4, together with some bad complaints aboutt deposit, withdrawer and e.t.c, of which the casino is yet to respond to. So for me, in other to avoid scam, i will advise people to use popular sport booker we have here on the forum, such as Duelbit, stake and Trustdice.. And have peace of mind",

If it has been defaulted early and they explained with you the information why it was rejected then that will resolve and know exactly what's the issue. You don't have to lable them scam just because you have been rejected for the first time nor many times if you aren't the one that abiding on their terms.",

You don't usually get rejected for submitting documents for 1 account while having 2 at the platform, given that the other account is unverified. Having 2 accounts may lead to a ban, but not to a rejection of KYC. Very common reasons for documents being rejected is low quality, some parts of the document being covered, expired documents, only 1 side of the document visible and not all required documents present.",
