I can expect an even bigger recovery in the following months - that's very likely.Quote from: Stalker22 on August 18, 2023, 08:12:05 PMQuote from: _BlackStar on August 18, 2023, 07:42:26 PM-snip-No panic here.

I love this approach - in fact I've been doing it almost every month since getting to know bitcoin. Not as much as others do - but it's a nice approach than keeping it in fiat.Quote from: Stalker22 on August 18, 2023, 08:12:05 PMDo we know what caused the flash crash?

So we could simply say it is just  speculation by People.But just like you have stated above, it is certainly a time not to panic but to even accumulate more if the funds is there. But we all know not many will heed to this mostly those who invested to get a short time gain, so holding for long will be a big challenge for them. That’s why the advice is always to invest with money that isn’t need for a long time",

In this moment do it continues to accumulate BTC and when the time comes when Powell's speech is positively born it makes the market recover quickly and one more thing, if the BTC price tends to be stable and rises, Bitcoin Miners do not sell their assets in large quantities. I think these two items are enough to make the market push up and BTC will soon break through its resistance step by step.",

Something like 100M liquidations took place in that 5 minute period.Basically way too many people went long and not enough orders were able to close all those positions and it lead to massive slippage.

I was wondering what this was all about - but my quick search says Elon Musk seems to be one of the reasons for the decline.I initially thought not, but it seems that the sale of bitcoin by SpaceX has affected the market downwards, although it was only after the fact that we learned of the sale. If I remember correctly, the same thing happened with Tesla. The fact is that the rate hikes are not helping either, so it seems that we are not going to be happy for a few months. If anything, we will gradually recover recent levels.

Will there be an even harder drop or will this be the last low that will be the momentum for Bitcoin to begin to reverse course and climb high again?Everything will be answered daily from what we see in the market. And when the price volatility remains as before, we must be calm to use this best moment to keep accumulating more Bitcoins. This is another discounted moment that Bitcoin is giving us so we have to make the most of it.Don't think too much about volatility because that will be it. We must be able to hold Bitcoin until the price target we want is reached. And after that, only then can we breathe a sigh of relief that we have come out of the long wait so that we can get big profits in the future. We are also one step away from seeing a Bitcoin price reversal. So fasten your seat belt and enjoy this price change.",

This is one of the reasons I do not have much confidence in the technical analysis. I believe the effects we are seeing in the market today is coming from the fundamental aspect of the market. There was when I said that I will no longer listen or follow the news of Elon Musk in the market and truly I was no longer following it, but that surely does not stop his influence in the market. He is too big and his project is too big to be ignored by the crypto-currency market. That guy is still very influential in the industry.

It's all just market movement, we can't expect the market to always go up without any correction. Moreover, we all know bitcoin's nature is volatile, and a 10% drop is normal. I don't even care about the halving, because the market goes down and then inevitably goes up because that's the law of the financial markets.

In addition, it is unlikely that Musk would sell his Bitcoin holdings at a price lower than the purchase price, this is far from businessman thinking.There may be more than one reason for this sudden decline, including, for example, the interest rate hike in the United States of America, as well as the news of huge sales and long liquidations in many exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and others.In any case, yes, there is no need to panic, because this is not the first time, and it is certain that Bitcoin will return to its position soon.",
