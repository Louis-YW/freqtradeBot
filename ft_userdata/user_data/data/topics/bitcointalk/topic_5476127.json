      "body": "There are several factors to consider if you're thinking of setting up an outdoor Bitcoin mining operation.Care about the weather: Your equipment needs to be protected from the elements, such as rain, snow, and extreme temperatures. An enclosed box can help, but it needs to be weatherproof and designed to prevent overheating. Outdoor setups might require more frequent maintenance due to exposure to dust, debris, and fluctuating temperatures.Bitcoin mining rigs can be quite noisy. Placing the setup underground can help mitigate noise, but you'll need to ensure that ventilation and cooling are still effective. Also, consider the practicality and safety of an underground setup.One more point that should be called here: Outdoor setups can be more vulnerable to theft or vandalism. Security measures will be necessary to protect your investment.",

      "body": "Oil filled container? You would have heating issues from that more so because it is in a sealed box.Problems with the local water supply and type of soil might affect the heat dissipation but not sure about a sealed box. Maybe you can experiment with a heating device in the same setup and see how much the soil is being affected and how much the device is getting heated?Like @seek3r said, weather issues is the biggest problem which seems to downplay it. Another point to raise is whether soil temperature affect the flora and fauna, my guess is that it would, but I cant confirm.How you access the devices in case you have to physically get hold of them is another question.",

Would this overheat the ASIC or could you build an oil filled container to hold it.Well, outside or inside doesn't matter as far as heat is concerned, unless it's directly exposed to strong sunlight, but if it's 10c outside and you are supplying that air to the enclosed box and pushing it from the other end, the miner would run cool enough, as long as it's protected from rain and moisture, so it depends on your climate.The miner type also makes a huge difference, some miners are fragile, while others can sustain harsh conditions.Generally, I'd prefer building a small shed, just high enough for you to walk in, could be 2 square meters small just in case you decide to add more.QuotePlacing it underground would limit the noise and keep it from the elements. I am just brainstorming ideas. Thanks in advance for any tips or to just tell me I'm an idiot.if you talking about a bunker, it would be a great idea, but if you talking about 0.5M deep hole you make with your shovel, no.",
