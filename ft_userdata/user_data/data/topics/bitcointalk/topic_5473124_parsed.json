ARB however, I would expect to do well in the next bull mrkt it has everything it could possibly need to make that happen.",

I always experience that whenever it's close to bullrun maybe a year to bull run or few months to it we often witness huge volume of different projects launching to always utilize the bull run, correct me if I am wrong there are projects that are being launched before bullrun and after bull run we don't get to know any update about that same project. Even most of the reputable exchange like Binance do get such project delisted if they aren't making any progress in there platform I have witnessed a scenario like that before, to whatever quality you may finds those projects we should also think that altcoin are very risky to rely on hence they can fail at anytime.",

PEPETBH, I'm thinking of investing into ARB a few months ago, and I have the money at that time. What prevented me from doing it is the fact that, it's tokens are being given to people thru an airdrop, and all the time, those who got it for free will just sell it immediately, so basically for them it's free money. I waited for a long time, hoping that it will reach below a dollar. Well, it went below for quite some time, but I don't have money at that time anymore because I invested it into another asset already.As for PEPE, I hate shitcoins. Like I really hate them so much because of the fact that many meme coins are being created just to scam people. Yes there are some who are making profits investing into it, and some who became rich investing into it, but how many investors lost their money just because they choose to invest into these meme coins rather than investing into safer, and established cryptocurrencies? We have a choice to invest into safer coins, but we choose to invest into riskier, and a shitcoin like PEPE who doesn't have any use case at all.Thoughts? I will not talk anymore about PEPE, but for ARB, it's ATH is around $8.6 base on Coingecko. There might be a chance that it might reach that price again or even surpassing during the bull market, but there's a chance that it might not be just like what happened to EOS. Their potential? ARB is a good token, and will surely go up in it's price during the bull market. Same might happen with PEPE, but will not touch that shitcoin.",

In my opinion, it's a miss. Pepe is a meme coin currently valued at $500 million, and it should be noted that it is not the only meme coin on the market, the competition is huge, and the only thing Pepe has is a name. Will it grow in this bull market? It is possible, but I wouldn't put my money on it, because Pepe is already overvalued by at least 100x, meme coins have been used by scammers to extract money from investors for at least 3 years - that should be enough. It is possible that in the current bull market we will encounter a new type of tokens (maybe AI tokens or new crypto ETF candidates after BTC is listed?). Definitely, when in 2017 we had a bubble of \"next, better ETH\" - neo, nem, eos, lisk etc. their popularity ended with the end of alt seazon and during the next one, people focused on defi, nft forgeting about previous bull market stars.",

You'd hear people call them shitcoins,, that their used to scam investors and so on, this has really discouraged me to have interest on anything altcoins. But if I were into altcoins I'll consider buying the ones that have the potentials of staying long in the market, i also know that the best and most profitable time to buy anything crypto related is in the bearish run, so I'll take advantage of it and invest what i can afford to loose, because of the risks involved.Risk is a factor in any investment, but some investments like altcoins carries more risks, so if new altcoins are minted I'd look at the outcomes of similar coins that were minted during bearish markets and see how they fared afterwards, that'll at least be a guide on how to invest in new altcoins. For now I'm just content in bitcoin investment, because it has proven to withstand the test of time.",

If the founders release their project in a market condition that is not going up then the project would have something to hold on. Whereas those projects that come out in bulk market are projects that are meant to profit the founders. I have seen a lot good amount of memecoins came up in 20121 when the market was having an upward trend. These coins are still active but their as those who invested still believe in their potential. Most of them according to my judgement don't contribute anything. Yet, the craze and hype of such projects still exists.",

I totally understand that it is on me because I was conscious when I jumped in. Nonetheless, I knew it could go south. How do you mean that the price of a coin doesn’t matter? The reason Bitcoin is priced where it is today is not just because it’s the father of crypto. It has value and offers something. I know you may want to talk about memecoins that are meaningless but still have value, well, I’ll give that to the hype. When the noise is louder, the price goes higher. But a currency needs more than hype to be reliable. It should be able to solve a problem, etc.",

There are really indeed new potential coins on which we can really say that it is really having that chancebut of course everything wont really be that so sure.2. PEPE- Then it do gets easily listed on Binance in together with FLOKI on which there's something behind or having plans with this meme coin.We dont know if this one could FLip out SHIB yet there are tons of rumors about it.Currently the coins that i've been holding is GFAL,KAS,QNT,TAO.They do have different narratives but turns out that these projects are worth to hold --- Not a financial advise----",

Apart from that, I also know that many people will say that this Pepe coin is worthless; it is a shit coin; it will not help us; instead, the capital that we will use here will be wasted; the risk is too high; these are the words that we often hear when others see it as a meme coin.The question is, what if this is a meme coin? What now if there is a risk? Why is Pepe Coin the only one with high risk in the crypto space we live in? Go ahead and say that at least one crypto is risk-free in the industry we live in. How many of us here have said bad things about meme coins like Pepe coins and ended up being embarrassed by what we said like that?  Honestly, personally, I have holdings of Pepe Coin, not a large amount, but somehow at least I have, because first there is the first time it will participate in the bull run or the upcoming halving; the daily trading volume is not that bad at all to be considered. It's a joke if we look at it, and I also saw that he has the potential to be able to keep up with the rise of Bitcoin, not even as much as its value. This is my assessment and observation.",

My biggest concerns with ARB is that only 12% of the supply is worth around $1.3B with over 87% still going to come into the circulation. At 10B ARB tokens total supply, it would be difficult for ARB to reach a price of $10 - $20.  It's a really good project, However, the upside potential isn't much due to the reasons I already mentioned. Another point I'd like to note is that ARB isn't the only L2 project right now. If ZK and other competitors goes live, ARB won't get as much attention or traction and it has now.As for PEPE, I haven't owned it before and somehow I have zero interest to do so since I already missed it's insane ride earlier this year.",
