Sooner or later, you will not only look back and feel proud that you had the balls to buy when others were selling, you will also be making some nice profit. I hope you are in for a long-term HODL. And I hope the money you spent on Bitcoin is not intended for something else so that you can keep your Bitcoin for as long as you want. The sad thing about some who really intend to keep their Bitcoin is that when emergency arises, they have no choice but to sell.",

Usually segwit can help you to save some cents in transaction fees and it seems the service you used it is compatible with newer address formats.",

It was a brave move to buy bitcoins because many people would not make a purchase and instead wait for the price to drop again.And you are lucky to be able to take advantage of the decline in your favor so that your bitcoins have increased even more.

It would be great to share the feeling of owning bitcoin for the first time, it was a very memorable moment and worth celebrating. As for the next purchase, I no longer find it too important or attractive because simply as an investor, it is very normal for us to focus on accumulating bitcoin. This topic is really nothing to discuss, it's not as engaging as when he first bought bitcoin.",

Penny for penny and gradually you will be able to accumulate a tidy sum. Keep up the good work and don't give up on your goals. Let others say what they want, most importantly, do what you think is right. One day, your investment will pay off many times over and confirm the effectiveness of your strategy.",

Before you know it, you will almost be in the 1 Bitcoin club. It is achieveable.Bitcoin has a huge potential. If you can afford investing, it would be a great idea given that the price is still 'down'. But unfortunately, not all people could do the same thing especially small investors of this industry. It would be easy to say \"just invest an amount you can afford to lose\" but in reality no one wants to lose in an investmenr right? Also with \"just endure the market and set aside your worries\" but in real life situation, investors are really anxious on every downfall from the moment they have entered. That is just indeed how this industry works and it won't work on people who are looking for an assured profit. The market prices are filled with inconsistencies and uncertainties which causes risk to investors. So it would be better to be prepared first before engaging towards crypto investment.",

If you do see that this current market price specially on bears is an opportunity then it is really your own choice whether you would get in or not.Lots have the interest on accumulating but usually they are really minding about bulk buying and trying out to go into their limits or something those amounts which arent supposed to be invested.Its not bad on being optimistic but you should always consider out about the risks involved and this is something should really be standard.",

The amount you start with can increase, during the current period you continue to increase investment, buying on the decline will always be special in bitcoin, because we will get a large amount from the usual standard price.If you are just starting to invest in bitcoin, then my advice is to keep buying in declining conditions, because in the next year it is likely that bitcoin will recover and put your investment in a more stable stage.",
