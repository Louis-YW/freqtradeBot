This works great, sending, receiving, no issues.Now I loaded one of the seeds  into a Trezor Safe 3. I thought I could replace one of my jades with this Trezor. However, on the sparrow signing tab (see image)https://orange.surf/content/images/2022/10/multisig-demo-spend-4.pngit is unclear how I should sign with a Trezor. It is connected to my laptop, but signing only seems to work with QR codes. Any suggestions how I can sign with my Trezor ?",
