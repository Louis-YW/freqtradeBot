The bad news is that the recession is getting worse which has been putting pressure on bitcoin price, pushing it down. It is also not going to get any better any time soon.The good news is that the effects of it is becoming less and less, specially since bitcoin at the end of the day is still a hedge against inflation and we are also seeing inflation. Additionally bitcoin has the only market that is known for not having any correlations with any other market. This makes it an excellent choice at times of economical turmoil.",

The truth is that I have seen the coin on the bearish path since February, so what is doing now is not a surprise to me as I follow the trend of the market regardless of the noise attached to it.As it is now, the $20k is a very good judgmental level, we've not had a successful break below it yet, but if we do, then a long-term sell might be activated.",

That's because a decrease in value would mean better earnings for the miners. Also, many people don't really like crypto because of its rising prices. It will be very cool to see what the future holds for cryptocurrencies and how their popularity continues to grow. I want to share my opinion. I think Bitcoin is a pretty good idea, the currency, while volatile, tends to fall in value. This is because supply is steady, so the world is becoming increasingly cashless and trust in government-backed financial institutions is falling, it is likely that Bitcoin will be seen as a safer option.",

It is a correlation between bitcoin and the global economy. The best example is 2019 or the worse part of the ongoing pandemic. For example when US economy got dumpstered people started selling every asset they had hence crashing the stock market, one of the things they sold was also bitcoin hence crashing bitcoin also.Interestingly enough when bitcoin started recovering early in 2019 and went up 330% in only 2 months all those other markets were still struggling to not-get dumped anymore. Ergo the lack of correlations. Things are the same today. When the US inflation grows and they fight it by increasing the interest rate and fail to control inflation, it causes recession. In a recession people liquidate their assets. Bitcoin is not an exception.",

DCA is still a good idea like always, but be careful when you choose at what price to start DCAing.Be safe, bros.If inflation starts to fall, they will stop raising interest rates but have no intention of lowering rates yet. I suspect a rate cut will only happen from mid-2024, and as you say, this year is still a good year to accumulate bitcoin. Bitcoin has fallen by over 80%, so whether inflation continues to rise or lasts longer, DCA from this price level is the best fit. Although the world economy will not know where it will go, bitcoin always has surprises, so don't wait, let's collect it now. Don't get too greedy and expect bitcoin to drop to $10k, it's very unlikely.",

I am no longer comfortable with the movement of Bitcoin, although I already know that bitcoin is cyclical in nature, but most tmes I do not wish that it happens because we do not expect it when it happens. It would have been fine if bitcoin had a strong support at $20000. Whatever cyclic movement it is making it should go above 20,000 and do not come below 20000 dollars. This will give us the resurging confidence to continue. But any movement below 20000 dollars will create some panic that may pull the price below 15,000 dollars, which is not good for businesses and investments in cryptocurrency.Yes, it's time to accumulate, but how about those that has accumulated and waiting for a rise.",

Most traders get wrecked in this market because it's heavily manipulated and there are people with more money who just watch leveraged position to crush them and make a profit. They saw another hawkish FED move and a lot of uncertainty among traders because there was no trading volume last week, so they crashed it. It doesn't matter for the long run because bear market is going to end next year with their manipulation, or without it, but for now there's nothing we can do about it. Quotemany of you who trade experienced it no? it's also like gambling thrill but here we can control our loses in gambling all our funds are at risk. I hold bitcoin for years and I don't feel any risk. It's going up at some point and whether I have to wait 2 months or 2 years doesn't matter.The risk would be only if I was willing to sell it cheap out of fear.",

I also supported your opinion until I saw Bitcoin trending at $25,000, thinking that it was unlikely but not impossible to go below $20,000 again, but I was certain that it wasn't over. Now, I'm positive that there's still a possibility to see a new bottom for Bitcoin. The economic situation hasn't gotten any better, and inflation is still soaring around the world. Whether we like it or not, we still have a long way to go before we can expect a possible recovery; one or two years is the bare minimum.",

Obviously all of us want it to be more stable, but since there are no government nor foundation back its value, then no one can guarantee it but yourself.
