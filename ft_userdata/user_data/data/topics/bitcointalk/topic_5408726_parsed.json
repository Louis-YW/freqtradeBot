In my country, people play these competitively and you can sometimes see two persons who walk into a casino to play these games with both of them having the intention to prove that they are better at the game, this competitive nature is the same for all sports.It is my opinion that as things change and more interest are represented on the Olympic stage, there will be vacancy for the inclusion of more casino games like blackjack and baccarat as a sport between countries to compete for a medal, it is very possible.",

When we mention sports, basketball, boxing, and the likes come into play. Chess is considered a sport, although it does not involve lots of physicalities in order to be considered one, just two people using their minds to better the other. In poker or other card games, that is also the case, although luck and randomness play key roles in the success of the players in the game.",
