Am not aware of any other wallet which allow such thing. However, there are some dapps which let you send tokens to different addresses. They are used mainly in airdrops but I can't vouch for any of them. QuoteIs there any difference is performance between metamask mobile and metamask PC wallet? Security wise.Metamask is open-source (not sure if this still true) and no critical vulnerability has been found and there are no reports of security incidents so it's as good as it gets.",

No, I do not think it is possible. It is not about MetaMask, it is about the way transactions work in general on the Ethereum network. You can make multiple transactions only using a dapp or custom smart contract, as far as I know.",

Security wise.I assume that any wallet used on mobile phone is less secure than the one on PC simply because people take less care of what they download, on what kind of networks they connect etc. Either way, Metamask should be only used as a hot wallet and not for any longer term hodl.Quote from: khaled0111 on October 18, 2022, 07:01:30 PMHowever, there are some dapps which let you send tokens to different addresses.

Unfortunately, you can't.Because Ethereum transactions have a nonce.Â  You need to wait for the first transaction before you can proceed to another one.However, in Metamask, you can speed up your transaction to become faster, but it requires more gas.

Yes you can with supportive tools but when you are sending to multiple receivers in a single batch transaction, you must check details carefully before you broadcast it. Because if it is sending to one receiver, if you make mistake, the value of the mistakenly broadcasting transaction should be smaller than a batch one.QuoteIs there any difference is performance between metamask mobile and metamask PC wallet?

Either you want to send ethereum or tokens to multiple addresses in one transaction or one after another without actually executing one after another via smart contracts and some Dapps tools. Generally bounty managers uses this to send the bounty rewards for the participants batch by batch cause even if we say multiple still there is a value ad maximum addresses can be added. I don't want to mention the names here but Google search will give you better idea than explaining everything here.To your second question using it in the PC is more convenient and only possible solution for your first query.
