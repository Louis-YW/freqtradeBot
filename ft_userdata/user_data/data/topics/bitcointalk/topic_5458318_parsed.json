As at then, it didn't recieve any serious response or actions from DTs because it was one among thousands of projects that were developed in the early days of cryptocurrency.  The team behind the Rubycoin tried their best to sustain the project but in the end we gave up just like how many altcoins died during 2017 bear market. If when you were active in scam bursting, you didn't consider it a scam as at then the knowledge of it was fresh and you didn't even leave a neutral tag, why do you consider it is worth discussing now when the project is long abandoned/passed and you cannot even recall what happened then? Are you saying the forum should bring back all the projects that were started from 2010 that didn't survive and start discussing them? If you can be truthful to yourself and go back to the 2019 thread you created and go through it, you will understand that there is no case apart from the trend of creating coins which came and passed.",

These so-called scam busters, forum police are doing everything to be sure that they stay in the DT and harass members. You best guess is very correct.  You are knowledgeable of the things happening in the DT. The whole issue started in the John Abraham thread where I gave my opinion but some felt rby is nobody to speak on the matter. Read this statement QuoteYes bringing up the subject is a bit off-topic here (for now) but it is odd seeing accounts that barely frequents the Reputation board giving their unsolicited two cents on this particular topic.I was actually giving my unsolicited opinion among BTT judges.First, they tried to link rby to naim027 but to no avail;They came up with the accusation that rby is a shitposter, and now they came up with speculative accusations without prove.I can also recall where I disagreed with the accusation that Naim027 is also Royse777. Quote from: rby on June 20, 2023, 09:42:10 PMQuote from: Royse777 on June 18, 2023, 06:12:49 AMQuote from: Despairo on June 18, 2023, 06:08:47 AMRoyse777 ≈ Cratoon ≈ John Abraham ≈ naim027 now? You really think I have time for signature spamming, account farming and all these shits?Royse777 must be a superman or a bot for him to be naim027, John Abraham, AnotherAlt, cryptoSoul, Cratoon and one other account I can't remember it's name. It was used by naim027 for ban appeal. Someone who can farm these accounts is really someone who has no other things to do apart from posting and applying in signature campaigns and not someone like Royse777 who manages upto 5 different campaigns and also manage bounties and other services. It is now I began to study the feedbacks left Royse777 and some other persons and I understood that there is a gang and if you belong nowhere and appear in the reputation board you may be taken down. No wonder people avoid reputation board and allow judgement in the hands of few. I surely know that if a DT member delights in destroying people's account by leaving red tags without proves, even if nothing happens to them, the community is seeing. And they may not be on DT for so long (for ever).",

They also said I post shit in the WO thread to farm merits while I got around 7-9 Merits from the WO thread from the general discussion in my forum lifetime. It's too easy to accuse someone in this forum. While accused members get tagged if the accuser is right, why they don't even apologize if it's proved that they were wrongly accusing someone? I mean I am saying you are a scammer without any proof and I failed to prove it, shouldn't I apologize for accusing you?",

In my opinion, DT must be fair, if you accuse and are right, please tag, if you accuse and are wrong, then improve your reputation and apologizeIn the previous thread, it was very easy for you to accuse me, without any evidence, based only on your opinion.

How do you explain this difference because its one thing (and natural) to improve English level but in your case the opposite happened and your English got worse.  Rikafip, you can read below because of you and the rest of the community. Rby was created way back 2014 only for the purpose of promoting the Rubycoin. The Ruby team was behind the promotion of Rubycoin even outside the forum. It was not a solo project, in the team had someone whose duty was to update the thread and others seriously working on the backend then. A unique password relating to the name of the project was used then to allow every member of the team access to any of our handles including BTT but it was the exclusive duty of one person to update information in the media. But incase of unavailability anyone can step in.Later on trader daddy bot was introduced immediately the project was changed from PoW to PoS. This was an attempt to keep the project going, but I wasn't working as planned. I think there was some kind of disagreement in the team. It wasn't obvious, but it was a consensus to continue the project or to rename it, and restart with a new concept. There was no clear agreement and the community was loosing interest in the project because many projects saw their end then. The team separated and everyone went their way. One of the guys in the backend asked to be allowed to continue the project and it was granted him. That is all I can remember about the project.Down to 2021 (not 2022), After the covid-19. I remembered this forum and the rby account. The password wasn't changed and it was a unique password every member of the team could remember. I inputed the password and had access to the forum. I tried the password in our proton mail address and was denied access(which means someone changed it).I had to reset the mail here in BTT but couldn't use the account because the project for which the account was created ended. I abandoned the account again till I discovered the gambling discussion board and started posting there. I later understood I can subscribe for signature campaign and earn why having fun. I tried to join signature campaign managed by yahoo62278 then. He didn't hire me for like 3 times. I decided to inbox him to enquire why I cannot be hired. Yahoo62278 told me that most of my posts were in altcoin board and I post burst, that if I continue so no manager will hire me. That was when I decided to delete majority of the posts in altcoin board and edit unnecessary ones to keep my timeline neat.Later Hhampuz hired me and I worked for him for more than a year.I left the TrustDice campaign because it required that I make majority of the posts in the gambling section. There was a serious discrimination between people posting in the gambling side and the rest of the forum.I decided to leave TrustDice to sinbad.io where I can be able to interact freely on the forum. 3yrs of my active involvement in the community has passed and someone is accusing me of a scam that never happen. When newbies bought coins and the market went bearish, they raise alarm of scam. Even then, many people considered BTC a scam. No one was supposed to make me write this long episode of the past which I am struggling to remember. But it has happened and I take it in a good fate.BTT is a nice place and we all shall be here. I am an old human being, so no one can bully me from the comfort of his home because of the DT strength given them by the community.",

For those of us who read the posts there (and elsewhere) had no doubt that the current rby account operator is definitely not the creator of the account. I think you and Poker Player should have a tag team together. Don't validate your nonsense misusing of power by including some others name who are much sensible than you two and respects the system. Clearly others are not as harsh as you. They don't feel happy after tagging someone. You both are messing around and bossing others who has less influence in the community to take a stand against you two. Sadly, many of us are bord seeing all of these dramas from you two resulting you two are still have a place in the DT system. Perhaps Poker Player is not a regular, but you made your place somehow permanent.Let's talk about you now because I think Poker Player is just trying to follow your footsteps and he is yet to find his own identity.You are benefiting the image that you used to have before, which was creating one after another scam accusation threads for ICO and other projects [There was another account and many times I felt you and that other account had many similarities, both accounts used to have the same interest and same mentality. Many times, I thought both accounts are owned by one person but since I am not the type of person who finds fun to policing others, I never took it out. I have not seen the other account to be active from long time so let's forget about it]. The best part of your career was hunting down 1xBit guys and since then I don't see you were able to make a positive impact to the forum. You ran out of ideas since the ICO started to die. From last a year or two, you don't find any good topic to speak, any decent conversation to continue. It's easily noticeable. You go to a very old thread and bump it with answering some very old comments, you make a comment asking others to bring you information so that next time you can make another comment to increase your post count for the signature campaign you are promoting. I have no problem with all these. It's okay but I really don't feel good to myself when I see all of your efforts are destroying forum members who are trying to make themselves noticeable. The moment you lose your argument, you start to feel insecure and use your DT power with these cheap tags. You need a break. Don't destroy the forum. It took us a lot of sweat and blood to create a community, to make this place crowded, people like you are destroying all the good efforts.rby, Learn Bitcoin, PytagoraZ and others, the best you can do is to distrust JollyGood for the red tag that was left.Go to your trust setting then add ~JollyGoodSomething happened [whatever it is] 9 years ago, our head of police department has filed a case today because the criminal spoke something that he did not like. It sends out a message, if you are not strong enough to argue with the law [created by the head of the department] then you will be destroyed by their negative feedback. No wonder why many people don't step in and make a loud voice.",

For now, in my opinion, making trash posts is better than finding other people's mistakes, other people are make a trash posts for signature campaigns, Jolly also does the same thing, finding other people's faults for signature campaigns.Maybe I'm new, but still I'm free to judge Jolly, just like he's free to judge me, the difference is only 1, he can tag me while I can't. not fair indeed. But I know that the judgment thread cannot be opened freely without preliminary evidence and preliminary analysis. So what are you doing wrong, is such an wrong not worth for tag? it is an abuse of your status as a DT, just like a judge judges people without proof, you can be accused of defaming people. I think we all use positive law theoryI don't care who is right and wrong here. But the way you accuse and open judgment threads without preliminary evidence is clearly wrong. It's very dangerous if all the DTs do the same as you. Maybe this forum will lose members. I think a lot of members are afraid of being marked and they're changing for the better. It's time we build forums, not destroy forums. Everyone has the right to changeBitcoinGirl.Club I've added ~ in front of the namejollygood = My advice, attach the evidence or close this thread",

      "body": "BitcoinGirl.Club has made a valid point. But all those deleted replies, threads whenever someone called out RBY for his role in various projects in this space kind of points out what kind of a big scammer the original owner of this RBY account was! For instance he/she scammed his/her Rubycoin community, he/she was asked to verify his/her stance in different projects back in the day, he/she responded to some and then totally ignored in most cases back in the day. And suddenly when a known ban evader/altaccounts user was being mentioned in present days in this board- this RBY account had to butt in probably for the first time in this board to divert the conversation. It sure as hell seemed fishy. You simply do not scam people openly and then after years of taking a break come in the community with same account and expect things to go unnoticed. Quote from: noganoo on February 03, 2016, 12:25:36 AMI was in the Rubycoin community since day 1.  Kassado the dev changed his name to FuzzyHobbit in IRC after he scammed a man for a lot of BTC.. He likely used much of that stolen money to pump his own coin and created artificial volume.. He switched from from PoW to PoS after only 10% of coins were mined.. keeping this information in his pump and dump group so that they could corner the market.  He has been promoting some conditional freeware trading software for over a year with no results.  Rubycoin is a SCAM!  - nOgAnOoQuote from: hunnaryb on December 08, 2015, 10:27:40 AMUp until a few months ago, they had malicious code that allowed them to sabotage staking reward. All ruby clones were obviously affected, and some other coins were attacked.

Rubycoin was one of the alt coins I started off with - back in the day Dev's of those alts were active in their threads and would answer numerous questions newbies had when setting up wallets and mining scrypt based coins.I still have my ruby coin wallet - set up on an external hard drive. So, if need be, I can verify any signed messages from rubycoin wallet addresses.(I'm away until Friday, so it won't happen until then)If rby is indeed the \"original\" owner, then they wouldn't have any difficulties setting up a node.",
