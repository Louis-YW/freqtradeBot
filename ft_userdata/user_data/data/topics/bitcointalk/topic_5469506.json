Another things is that the representative account has been inactive for quite some time now so I don’t think they’ll be able to get any information about this thread and since he (the Op) already tried telegram he should also include the link to this thread and see if they’ll be any difference.

I saw this similar thread on the gambling board. If the accused account, which happens to be the casino representative, appears to be inactive, I think either the OP or any member can just send a PM here on the forum. If they happen to use a valid email, at least the mail notification could be able to drag back their attention here on the forum, as the PM will be detailed enough with the accusations thread included on it, as there have been many cases of that nature where the accused happens to be inactive, and PMs usually trigger their attention. This method can be used if their support fails to respond through Telegram.",

It's possible, but any site trying to make it (even if exit scamming) is not going to screw someone over for less than $50. I'd say send a pm, see if you can get a response.

I was able to withdraw a 100. I was on the site a few years now. I've never tried try to withdraw until recently. I was able to withdraw a100 that I won from a promo. No problem, how's able to withdraw 100 coin?  That I won from a promotiown ocean. That I won from a promotion.And probably 3 weeks ago now so probably 5 weeks ago now I deposited. 100 doge tried to withdraw 1200 after I made several 6-900 doge depos that day and I never received it. I hunk support got sick of me asking about it on every channel finally I got a reply back said its probably a risk management thing and mind you support was one super responsive I had a very good relationship ship with 8b3t email  team now just ghosted besides the 1 shitty.reply in 5 weeks",
