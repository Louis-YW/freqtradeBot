Having done some research concerning Bitcoin be stolen or lost, the possibility of recovering such asset has prove to be too difficult or not possible. Few articles has it that in some possible ways, it's easy to recover such a stolen or lost asset, this authenticity hasn't be verified by anyone, yet some people claimed it's recoverable. Here I'm asking this question.• Is it possible to recover a lost BTC ? \"• Does password crackers app really worked as claimed.The following blog post has it that, it's possible to recover lost Bitcoin, But I'm not sure if this is true, Can anyone here verify these claims1. https://www.bankrate.com/investing/how-to-recover-lost-bitcoins-and-other-crypto/2. https://changelly.com/blog/how-to-find-lost-bitcoin/",

      "body": "FYI, if someone can crack the lost Bitcoin then they also can access all the 21 million bitcoins and can posses all of them. Some claims with quantum technology it maybe possible to crack the private keys but as of now its close to impossible since even with the fastest computer we have on this planet it will take atleast w century to find the keys and access Bitcoins stored in there.Those two articles posted in OP is mainly talking about how to access the private keys in case if we lose access of it like failure of hard drive where we stored our keys and decryption of an encrypted keys in case if we forgot the password which is likely possible but more expensive also not really 100% guaranteed.",

Here I'm asking this question.An article of a recovery service? That could probably be a scam.Quote from: Lordsilvabtc on October 15, 2022, 08:59:43 AM• Is it possible to recover a lost BTC ? \"It depends. Quote from: Lordsilvabtc on October 15, 2022, 08:59:43 AM• Does password crackers app really worked as claimed.Yes, but it also depends. Assuming you lost just one word from your seed phrase, or you lost few characters from your private key, or few characters from its password used to encrypt it, it is possible to brute force the remaining seed phrase or password.Backup on computer is not good nor recommendable, but I have read in the past about someone that its private key or seed phrase was recovered from his PC. The password, private key or seed phrase could have been deleted but yet recovered. Backup not on computer or any online device is not recommendable at all, offline backup like on metallic sheet or at least on paper in different locations is better. Some people were able to recover back their coins while some people did not. There is even a man that have spent a lot just to be able to recover his bitcoin private key that is worth millions of dollars now, yet, not recovei till today.But we should be careful of recovery services online because most of them are scam.",

The only exception is if the thief makes mistakes and gives up his KYC, but that's also difficult.* If the user has misplaced his wallet or even removed it, certain tools may help* if the user has lost access to a centralized service account, he may be able to recover that.It really depends from case to case. Holding bitcoins is not an easy task, it's a responsibility too many take too easy.Also, as @Charles-Tim correctly pointed out, many services claiming to recover lost coins are fake / scam.Quote from: Lordsilvabtc on October 15, 2022, 08:59:43 AM• Does password crackers app really worked as claimed.It depends on the password and it depends what you want to crack. Also keep in mind that most of  \"password protected bitcoin wallets\" people sell on the internet are fake.And cracking bitcoin addresses is not possible.One has a huge chance that instead of getting/stealing some coins with those crackers, installing malware on his computer and actually lose passwords, accounts, money.",

      "body": "There is no way to recover stolen BTC or lost BTC unless they swap for USDT and the team helps you to block the address, that's if the amount is big enough for the team to worry about, meaning they will make the asset to be useless for the hackers but you aren't going to recover it either. My advice is don't lose your BTC, the chance of getting it back is minus Ninty-nine percent.",

If some bitcoins are OP_Return command they are completely lost or say burnt and they can never be recovered and you can take out them from total supply so this is one case.Now if someone has lost his coins through seed misplacement or say have not full 12 words then it's hard to brute force and crack the order of remaining words but if more words are missing then it's near to impossible to recover your coins.Like some people don't find wallets with bitcoins in them and after years they find out wallet.dat file on the system and recover their coins so lost bitcoin for them were recovered but it depends on the actual scenario at that time.",
