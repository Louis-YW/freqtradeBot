QuoteThe bill, sponsored by Anna Kelles, would not only impose a two-year hold on approval of any new Bitcoin mines, but the proposed moratorium would also prevent the renewal of permits issued to existing PoW cryptocurrency miners using carbon sourced energy if they seek to increase the amount of electricity consumed.But now, New York is planning to finally ban bitcoin and other crypto mining that are using proof of work (PoW):New York's push to ban crypto mining triggers response from communityQuoteOn June 3, the bill to ban PoW mining was approved by the New York tate Senate. If approved by the governor, the bill will ban mining in the state and would hinder the renewal of previously-approved mining permits.It is not now about global warming, it is now about energy consumption which will know will be always proposed by PoW critics.",

      "body": "I think it's pretty simple when it comes to Bitcoin mining which is always banned because of the energy impact it generates. A simple example: the greenhouse effect of buildings in New York does not have a big impact on the environment? They banned it because they did not have access to control the mining process and the overall results. Due to the fact that when heavy mining is in the gold, coal, Nickel, Gas, and Oil mining sectors, it is easy to legalize. Surely you know the reason? well, they have a percentage of the tax that has been set for the elite of the council and for sure the governor in the region has had a separate share of the income earned.",

These miners can always find a friendly state that will allow bitcoin mining. On another note, this will also push miners to utilize green energy as much as possible. In the long run, it is also a beneficial move for them. It may incur high expenditures at the beginning, but later on, it will be free or with minimal maintenance only. So if they have long-term plans in the crypto mining business, they can always invest with their green source of energy and reap the rewards later on.",

I just wonder if this is pushing the problem around and not really solving anything, if Bitcoin miners were to take large amounts of \"green energy\" while all remaining users need to be topped up with coal, oil or other dirty energy then you're just building an illusion. As always it is typical politician behavior as they try to grab friendly headlines without understanding the complexities surrounding wider energy usage. Out of all the places which could effectively produce renewable energy, New York has to be one of the most expensive so people will simply take all of their miners elsewhere instead of trying anything there.",

There are plenty of cheaper places to mine so how much of an impact on the NY energy grid is that going to be? If anyone decided to mine at 2x the rate in other states, it had to be a small operation, especially that NY had strict laws regarding bitcoin businesses for years.
