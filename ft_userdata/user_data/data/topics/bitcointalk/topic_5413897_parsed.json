      "body": "Do you have something more specific or is the question more general?It'll provide liquidity and buying pressure on the currency of the country the freelancers are in because they'll have profits and maybe even their full wage being converted into a currency they're going to want to spend at some point.They might also provide import and export taxes (ecommerce) and VAT on products sold. Larger ecommerce companies could also benefit from getting local contracts/makers and then might have less administration on things like returns (like many large companies do with distribution centres that can hold stock and quality test them).",

      "body": "Well, if these people are law-abiding citizens and are paying their taxes on time, that is how it boosts up an economy of the country. If their services or products are used or bought by other people from other countries, they will be paid, and that payment should be filed for taxes that apply depending on what the payment is for. Needless to say, it still boils down to taxes. Plus, there is also a possibility that the country who regularly uses the freelancers services may recommend the said service to other people, providing a wider market for the freelancer and thus netting more income, in return, paying more taxes.",

So if this is the case, they contribute to the GDP of the country since they make up the supply chain by buying what they need and money go into the country or economy and the government benefit from there. The fact that they buy what they need which money from them go back into the economy through the chain of distribution , they are contributing and the government is benefiting. Such level of job may not be taxed directly like in Nigeria but they are part of the supply chain, like they buy call cards, internet connection, feed, shelter and more that goes into the system.",

The benefits are the people get jobs despite the efforts by the local government moreover there is no need to setup proper establishments you can just start these things at your home, which means these incomes come even if the governments don't invest on infrastructure. Then this constitutes as export of services which means foreign exchange will flow into the country which is extremely good for any country as it will strengthen their forex reserves. Not to forget you'll get a better educated population as well.",

In this specific case, IT is a highly demanded profession nowadays due to the digital transition of all societies, so it does contribute.",

If so, then I'm one of those you're referring to.To answer your question, our country benefits from us because we also pay tax to the government which contributes to the economy. We need to declare our monthly income in order to get some insurances and process legal documents. Our income also helps the economy when we spend it on commodities.",

In addition, the lack of maximum legal protection prevents some people from starting their jobs and businesses from finding opportunities in the IT space. On the other hand, some countries demand unfair taxes when considering this risky space.",

Not only that but also the less developed parts of the world can adopt new ways of doing business and achieve much better results. This is not only possible for us humans but also for companies that can find cheaper IT job opportunities.I think the role of the government also exists, the government needs to understand this phenomenon. There must be changes in the education system to ensure that the right skills are being developed in a given country's workforce. Countries can do this by hiring IT experts to develop programs that will be used in their country's education system. They should also start having programs where freelancers can be paid on freelance ecommerce websites, so that they can earn while they are still working on it.",

I am not sure what OP is trying to find out here? Or are you trying to ask income of freelancers who may or may not pay the taxes because they get money through cash or online payments and they may show lesser income than what’s expected ?In any case that’s small portion of countries economy. Most of the giant ventures around the country pay their taxes every time so does not seem to be an issue for “national” income.",

But of course here every time e-commerce is accessible in the country of residence, every company and newcomer will pay taxes on its operations. So you don't have to worry because the state has control over every e-commerce operating in its territory officially and has agreed to an operating agreement.",

Countries without a stable and fast internet connectivity will struggle in the modern world to keep enough jobs growing for their people as more business moves online. The best part is the wide range of activity that suits people of all types - whether you are doing low level data entry (like converting old newspaper articles into an online repository) or doing super advanced stuff like developing apps which might go on to serve many millions of people. Even low level jobs like shop assistants and food service industry jobs may slowly disappear as elements get replaced by technology, so learning a useful computer skill (even just typing at a fast pace) is going to be essential in future.",

And this will also impact other sectors because people buy their necessities of life in local stores or online, and that will provide income for them too.If a country can improve its IT infrastructure, other sectors will impact it. But this all needs support from the government, and the government that can provide permits and infrastructure so that the country can be ready to improve its IT.",

Other than the fact that these people would be earning and wouldn't be a burden to the country, they would also be paying taxes which is the lifeblood of the government. Moreover, freelancing, e-commerce, and IT skills are what the modern world and its future is all about. So a country having them means she's more or less on the right track.",

Also freelancers got incentives for their works and it's really great as i am one of them. On the other hand, most users who are having IT skills, are now getting remote jobs which also have same impacts like freelancers, however they don't need to pay any platform fees like freelancer.",
