Conflict, no.It's capital flow in cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin will pump first, then it cools down and capital will pour to Ethereum to pump ETH. The pump of ETH is a condition and a trigger for an altcoin season.You see the capital flow from BTC > ETH > Top altcoins > Shit coins. After that, market will be in a bloodbath to reset and wash out greedy gamblers.",

Recent months, Ethereum and some top altcoins hold their prices when Bitcoin moves up and BTC Dominance increases a lot. Ethereum very likely to break out its resistance and I believe it will have its big bull run but only a recovery in bear market. After Ethereum, some top altcoins, old altcoins will recover considerably.I am not so sure about shit coins whether they will have their shows after all.",

      "body": "Even though they are correlated they don't always trade together. Look at ETHBTC chart, what do you see. It looks like a diamond formation which is basically very difficult to trade. However for the past few days ETHBTC has been gaining so there is a chance it might break the formation to the upside.The larger issue is the ETH staking unlock with the next upgrade. Many are thinking there will be lots of tokens dumped when they become unlocked and many are waiting until the event concludes before they take a long on ETH. I don't think that upgrade will be a bullish upgrade. Kind of like MtGox releasing bitcoins later in the year.",

There will be no conflict as Bitcoin remains the basis of a cryptomarket.As you can see right now, ETH was able to reach its peak for this month and almost hitting the resistance level but failed to do so, expect a correction after that. BTC corrections are still possible on a daily time frame, better to play short for now and wait for the possible bottom of this trend.",

Crypto is just to volatile and can pump and dump for small reasons (i.e. the massive jump of dogecoin some days ago as Elon Musk again made a tweet about this). There is no chart that can predict stuff like that.",

Some are still into Bitcoin but they are now diversifying their funds in altcoins. This have affected the value of Bitcoin but it's not alarming since we see that Bitcoins price can still pump heavily. Altcoins still has their own contribution to Bitcoin and to the crypto industry.If BTC is in bull run, people will just sell and some of the profits that they will get can be use in ETH because it is dumping. ETH supporters doesn't need to worry because ETH can catch up. BTC is only leading the way like on the past bull runs that we have.",

The thing is that if Bitcoin is pumping or performing well, it affects the whole market positively and the most bullish event for Bitcoin is Halving which is coming in a year's time, when you look at the price action of Bitcoin historically, it has been bullish for Bitcoin. Ethereum will do well but might outperform Bitcoin in BTC term, remember Ethereum didn't touch its previous ATH in BTC in the last bull market, If L2 continues to draw TVL, I don't see how this is positive for Ethereum, because I see them as another L1, because they can use their own tokens to pay for gas prices on their own chain and the last bull market all the Ethereum killers outperformed Ethereum significantly and this is the reasons I am very bullish on L2 then L1 in this coming bull run",

The difference direction of the current price move? Mate, not every time BTC and ETH have the same pattern in price move. But if you learn their price history, ETH mostly follows the price move of Bitcoin. I believe this will continue since the top coins probably will raise their prices toward the bullish season. But now, we are still in bearish season, the price move is sometimes unpredictable. So, nothing wrong with BTC and ETH, both won't have any conflic. For the long run, they look to have the same direction.",
