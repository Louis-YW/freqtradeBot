This is definitely not good news whether by book or by logic, we are not doing great as humans since few years. The probable cause is pandemic when worlds literally stopped for one year straight and foreign exchanges stopped everywhere. Take a look at the below graph which gives clear negative bar for the GDP. QuoteAnnual percentage growth rate of GDP at market prices based on constant local currency. Aggregates are based on constant 2010 U.S. dollars. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.World gdp growth rate for 2020 was -3.60%, a 5.93% decline from 2019.World gdp growth rate for 2019 was 2.33%, a 0.7% decline from 2018.World gdp growth rate for 2018 was 3.03%, a 0.25% decline from 2017.World gdp growth rate for 2017 was 3.28%, a 0.67% increase from 2016.",

Inflation is getting worse as well but I don't think we can clearly demarcate inflation and recession as well! Because in the same country we might be seeing both of them happening at various locations and also it might also be artificially done by the government. Inflation is price surges, seen in petrol, gas etc. And recession is basically unemployment and slow economy that's why we cannot expect one to work since they are opposites, don't think we can have clear borders and individual situation would be different as well.",

When the Russo-Ukrainian war broke out, we saw the impact of the overall micro and macro recession in certain areas that fall into the category of allies. Be it from the Russian side or worse is the extent of the recession felt by the Ukrainian alliance. The reason is the creation of a recession due to a spike in food prices that jumped dramatically when state finances slumped after being hit by a prolonged pandemic. This tactic can be a reference for Russia that other countries will first take care of improving their respective countries' finances before contributing humanitarian aid.If we look at the impact, without us realizing it, the economic recession has undermined the most important production sectors such as raw materials which are basic daily needs.",

Economically recession is defined as a period of degrowth in the economy where the available money in hands of people is too high but yet the overall GDP is falling because of lower consumption. Dip or crash is something when stock market is lower, but this type of situation doesn't necessarily signify a recession. We have seen a lot of stock market dips yet no major recessions. Recessions generally kick in when some big firm with tons of employees goes bankrupt and kick starts the process of low income in hands of individuals.",

You probably right. There are prosperous countries, and there are not very prosperous ones. Based on who is lucky enough to be and where, the recession will be perceived differently. Some countries are still in a state of permanent depression and recession, therefore, the deterioration of the state will not stand out so much from the standard situation.

Oh yeah. The duration of the consequences is highly unpredictable and can last for decades. The Great Depression is an example. How many are ready mentally and financially for such a long time?There is a version that the world has not moved away from the economic events of 2008 so far, but how much time has passed.

I ask because I know from other sources that the current world is on the verge of a major economic upheaval and I would like to compare with your forecasts.

Judging by the ridiculous inflation going on it is inevitable that we will end up in a recession. It's also a fact that all recent recessions have taken place after record oil prices, just like we are seeing right now. Economic outcomes are often revised up and down in later quarters so it might be misleading to only rely on current estimates. Covid really threw everything out of whack and caused a mini cycle of its own. Let's hope this is a short and sharp recession, not one that is longer drawn out.",
