I swear, sometimes I feel like I need to make a set of tinfoil hats because this looks like someone wanting to piss off Bitcoiners and intentionally making services available but with intermediaries and higher fees, just to make it look as Bitcoin payments are not the best alternatives.  No surprise that usage is losing steam and nearly everyone thinks of \"investments\" rather than daily payments./rant over!",

Paypal is not needed, but on the good side, Paypal is in a way, making Bitcoin more adopted. So I guess all in all, its somewhat of a good thing rather than a bad thing. But I just do not see Paypal in Bitcoin's future. At some point even Paypal will have to recognize the fact that it is a completely unnecessary third party in the payment solution.

Yeah for sure, it was like star wars compared to the rest but nowadays? Meh!!!A large part is inertia. Not going to name names, but lets call the person DaveF...yeah that's a good name.Lets say this person has a day job, that generates a paycheck and a side job that deals in crypto. And he is happy and all is good.Then he decides to start selling off a lot of old junk he collected over years decades. But, he does not want to setup a merchant account to take credit cards. So, it's either cash (and crpyto) or he needs a way to process credit cards and for that he dusts off his old PayPal account. The rates suck, and the process is not great but it's there and ready to go. Because at car swap meets that's the way it is cash or card.Same with some small businesses, as I said above there are better / cheaper ways to take cards. But if you have something that you hacked together years ago that works but you hard coded in some PayPal integration would you spend the money to switch? If you are processing enough they the answer would be yes, but if you are talking under $50000 in cards a year the amount you save would be minimal.Don't know how it is in the rest of the world, but here credit cards are expensive to take as a merchant, but if you don't you loose customers.-Dave",
