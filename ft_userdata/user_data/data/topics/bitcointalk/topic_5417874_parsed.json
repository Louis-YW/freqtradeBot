  "content": "What is wrong in having link texts (text with links) at the end of a topic you created with a demarcation between the link texts and the body of your main post, plus using distinct colors for the link texts and making them bolder than the main post? Can you consider the link texts a signature if the posts the links are pointing to are relevant to the thread you created but not part of the topic hence the demarcation, or what if the link-text posts can be useful to readers when they read the main post? You see, one of the reason I don't like signatures so much is because of the possible lack of feature that allows forum members to turn-off signatures for certain threads they are not relevant/appropriate in. I prefer to wear signature that only display in all/most of my post they are relevant in. For example, I don't want to create topics about something that belongs in \"Politics & Society\" Section while having Irrelevant Betting Signature appearing below the posts... Or irrelevant Trading Signature under a Faith-based posts, etc. So, I think parts of the solution is to have the option to turn-off your signature for such posts, or options to switch to another signature that are relevant to the post incase you are promoting multiple signatures that are meant to be displayed one at a time. There are links i was sharing as signature (the typical way people display signatures) but I stopped sharing them in that way because the were not displaying properly and I don't like them appearing on threads they are not relevant in. So, my solution to such issues is to include the links in my posts (only relevant posts) rather than placing them in the signature box/section and having them appearing in all my posts.  Do you see anything wrong in this? If yes, what exactly?",

A newbie account can just copied BBCode of Hero user signature and attach the signature below of his post, this will make the restrictions of each ranks are useless.This has been discussed on few years ago, but I can't find the thread.Quote from: Ucy on October 14, 2022, 09:08:32 AM[moderator's note: removed fake signature]Now I wonder why you're not put the BBCode or texts on your signature? you're a senior member and can wear a decent signature with limited style.",

Can you consider the link texts a signature if the posts the links are pointing to are relevant to the thread you created but not part of the topic hence the demarcation, or what if the link-text posts can be useful to readers when they read the main post? There's a rule against posting a signature in your post if it's done repeatedly. If it's done once then it's fine, if it isn't then expect to be moderated and banned for it in further instances.There's options to disable viewing of signatures, your in thread signature won't have this and then it'll become annoying. I don't see an issue with signatures being anywhere on this forum tbh (I get they're not in some places but that feels like more of a way to stop the posts counting for signature campaigns as some signatures add different things to threads (as a good example, I saw a newbie ask what gambling sites were trusted and they got a response from a lot of fairly trusted gambling signatures within the first few posts). If a signature isn't relevant to a thread (like gambling in P&S as you've said) does it make much of a difference to anyone else but you? I've not seen this as a complaint before except many years ago when people suggested having some different signatures/profile appearances per boards but it was more to enrol in a signature campaign and self advertise on some boards.",

I think that the problem is the repeated advertisement[1], as advertisements are not allowed except in the signatures area, and therefore even if it is just a link at the bottom of each topic and it was repeated, you will be deleted or banned for a temporary period, as you are trying to advertise and not discuss.Thus, we do not need to define the signature, since any repetitive advertisement is prohibited (This includes making high quality posts.)If this signature is in a topic or two, and it matches the content of the topic, it will not be deleted.[1]Quote24. Advertisements (including signatures within the post area) in posts aren't allowed unless the post is in a thread you started and is really substantial and useful.[9][e]",

I do this especially when I feel people will be confused without them.I think this is something to also be discouraged unless there's only one or two links there (preferably you'd only link your last topic on a similar subject and do that on the other threads so it's easier to traverse an read without being considered spammy or unnecessary).

As I attempted to say above, if it's unique and relevant enough it probably won't be acted on by the mods.

I think there should be clear definition of what signature means, so my related posts don't also get reported as signature. Generally: signatures include advertising and are the same size as a signature text (and might have other hints with them too). It's up to the moderators how they define and enforce this sort of thing so it's unlikely you'll get a clear definition of what is acceptable and what isn't. The rule was only mainly brought in to try to stop people from extending their own signature spaces and to prohibit those with signature bans from evading the rules and posting signatures in their posts instead.",
