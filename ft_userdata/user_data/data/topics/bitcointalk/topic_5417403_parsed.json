  "content": "Celsius, a cryptocurrency exchange facing bankruptcy, leaked an enormous collection of its users' transaction data through an unusual sort of privacy breach: a court filing. As part of its bankruptcy proceedings—in which the company's owners are accused of pulling tens of millions of dollars worth of crypto out of the exchange before revealing its insolvency—the company's attorneys released a document that appears to include the transaction data of half a million of its users from April of this year until it ceased trading in June. That database was briefly posted as a 14,500-page PDF to the court records website PACER before being taken down—but not before Gizmodo copied it to the Internet Archive, where it was widely downloaded before being removed there, too.Incredible \"legal\" leak.

A leak would mean that someone gained illegitimate access to the data or a serious mistake or misconduct caused it to become available somewhere. But in this situation, you can thank the courts and the US government for making it mandatory to make court documentation public. Celsius is responsible for bankrupting their customers and their company, but the court made the data intentionally available to the whole world.",

However, not all decentralized services as they advertise are actually decentralized. I would prefer to use non-custodial wallets as my main priority.Data leaks can occur in many types even in unbelievable or unexpected ways like Celcius case.",

For example, I know a guy (friend of a friend) who is a pro stock trader for many years (he doesn't want to trade crypto, he says its too volatile and stressful for him), before that worked in IT for top company so he is not technologically illiterate yet he didn't want responsibility of holding his own bitcoin and instead invested in it via Grayscale. I tried to explain him how easy is to take care of it by himself but he thinks of it as being too risky (afraid of losing seed, hacks, $5 wrench attacks, what will happen with it if he dies etc).Quote from: NotATether on October 17, 2022, 01:14:05 PMBy chasing a high yearly APR,'you are effectively selling your privacy (and lets be honest, you would be lucky if you make it through the first year).When you think about it, ~10% APY ain't that much at all, well at least not enough for me to risk my bitcoin and give it so a 3rd party.

Quote from: tranthidung on October 17, 2022, 11:49:23 AMWhy do they have to pick custodial wallets to use if they can have non-custodial wallets to use? Because it's easier to register an account with a centralized wallet service than to be in full control over your money. No matter how silly and simple it sounds for us who don't think to much of backing up our own seeds and consider it a normal thing, most people have lived their whole life relaying on centralized control and they don't care to have more responsibilities. It's only when they get bit that they will start thinking if there are better ways to handle their crypto. By that time, it can already be too late.

For example this guy was claiming he has paid account. Ah, I'll also add exchanges too (some are overly careful with the source of money). However, they are boasting some of their customers, take a look for yourself.I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theory guy, but this kind of services real and being pushed by some.",
