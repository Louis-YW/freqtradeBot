  "content": "According to a lecturer, error is good in the teaching and learning process. When a student make a mistake and he or she realized that instantly and make the correction, that student has learned. And if a lecturer or a teacher made a mistake and a student in the class correct him or her either in the class or outside the classroom for respect that the student does not want to embarrass the teacher in the class, that also means, the student has learned. As the subject or the title implies. Error is the mistake done by users in the forum knowingly or unknowingly. Error Analysis is the breaking down of mistakes done by the users in various places or boards. Error occurred almost every day from newbies to legendary member ranks in the forum. Examples:Typographical errors, Plagiarism errors, Spamming errors, Posting errors, Commenting errors, Sentence errors etc. Typographical errors: This is spelling error by users. Users misspelled names and other words. Therefore, I advise users to use words that they are familiar with instead of trying to use jargons to impress others.Plagiarism errors:This is copy and paste errors. Some users copied an article from the net and edit it, paraphrase it and post it here to impress and have credit to their work. But ironically, that is unknown to them there is a fact finding software call plagiarism software and the experts in the forum use it to find out the copied work. Some users did this unknowingly while some did it unaware. Unaware in the sense that, they know that there is plagiarism rule in the forum so what they do is to paraphrase the article and post it here but the experts still detect it.Spamming errors: This is posting on a similar  threads in different places or boards, and also commenting on a similar comments. I saw this in services and Gambling. Some users in the forum do not even know that they are spamming. Posting errors: This is where newbies come in. Newbies at the tender stage are confused where to post, I am also one of them. Even some Members, Full members, Sr. Members, Hero Members and Legendary Members are of victim of this. A topic that is well suited at the speculation or reputation boards were seen in beginners & help or bitcoin discussion boards. Commenting errors:Some users do not read the content of the OP and other comments to acquire more understanding of the topic before making comments but as they just see the subject or the title of the OP, they started commenting and at the end he or she end up with out of point. Therefore, please read some comments before making your commentsSentence errors:This is not really utilized in the forum but it is very important for the smooth and clear communication among users. There are some threads you read that, you would not understand anything. And the reason of any discussion is to understand themselves and make contributions.Capital letter errors:Newbies use capital letters through out their subject, topic or title of the thread. And that is wrong. You can only capitalize the first letters of the title and it is only for the open class items. Which are: nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives. Bitcoin Discussion errors: Some newbies do not even know why they are here. This forum is mainly for bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies but some users abandon that fact and base bounties and campaigns. In fact they have not contributed anything in the forum.Punctuation and paragraphing errors:This is one of the daily errors occurring in the forum. Some users do not know how to punctuate their threads. The errors are too numerous to mention. Even this thread has errors. I am still learning.List yours",

      "body": "This is something I will probably never understand.Sure, we make mistakes.  All of us do.  Probably even the top Merited users of this forum sometimes went off topic, posted without reading all of the replies and made various errors without intending to.  But I think it is pretty evident when someone is making errors simply unintended versus when someone is making errors due to a set of intentions they are trying to hide.We are all humans.  I had moments, even recently, when I was very tired and replied a wall of text to a message I actually did not even read properly.  I thought I did, but I did not.  So I only found out after someone pointed that out to me.  A few sets of words missed and there goes a completely useless reply.But then there are those who are here just for the Signature Campaigns.  Those who are here just for fulfilling their Bounty posting (spamming) requirements.  Those who are not here as users of the forum but more like money seekers.  When you are doing this, you are automatically going to never read threads, never even care about posting in the right places, never reply with something unique or substantial and, at the end of the day, you will be yet another user whose posts are going to be ignored.  Because if I see your username posting crap once, then twice and finally five times, I will remember your name and instinctively skip your posts.With that being said, my personal belief is that some people take this 'forum posting' thing too deeply.  Do you really think people actually cared as much back in 2010?  Do you really think people were posting so much repetitive crap back then?  Go visit any other forum that does not have paid signature campaigns and you will notice there is not as much crap over there, except those who write repetitive threads without using the Search function prior to posting.My advice is to stop taking this thing so deep.  If you do not like this forum and discussing about Cryptocurrencies then there is no reason to put so much effort into turning yourself in the 'perfect user'.  Because if you are interested for real in this website and the subjects discussed here, your answers will come naturally rather than artificially.  I hope you do not take this personally, but this is how I see it.  When you start forcing yourself to read threads, forcing yourself to reply on topic and so on, this is artificial and then my first question to this kind of user is, if you never read, reply off topic, post repetitive crap then why are you here?-Regards,PrivacyG",

      "body": "In other way round, we can as well classify errors to be under these categories:1. Personal error2. Operative error3. Systemic error1. The personal error is said to be caused by the inability of a person to see clear base on visual abnormalities thereby making mistakes that are inevitable during a process of handling something.2. Operative error is said to be an error as a result of an inexperienced person involved in carrying out a particular task or operation, when they lack the experience to how things are been done then making errors become a must and unavoidable, they make mistakes without even knowing neither do they observe.3. Systemic error is the error that is due to the apparatus, device or materials used to have malfunction and thereby causing error to occur, some may be seen while in some cases it is difficult to easily know that error occurred, it might be your mobile device that has a fault, or making an auto prediction of words and replacement, making things could have led to this type of error while the person involved is not at fault. So mate, i will like you to consider these as well as other types of errors base on categories and were all applicable to many users on the forum especially the newbies.",

An example of yesterday's ban is the feeling sound account, which created a bunch of threads here on the forum with other people's content taken from Reddit.I wonder OP, in your opinion, whether this person did not understand that he was doing something bad?",

And these errors can be minimized by proof-reading and editing your post. After some minutes after posting, I normally go back to my post to reread  them to see if there are any errors because you might not discover them while posting the first time. Using grammar software can also be helpful because they can help dictate errors. Another important factor is to give quality time to your post. Ensure you plan and arrange your post especially if you are creating a thread, don't rush. Plagiarism is an unforgivable sin in this forum. Although, members might forget to reference, which is not an excuse,but it is quit easy to avoid plagiarism which is referencing your source. It is even better to over-reference because it is not a crime. Spamming errors, Posting errors and Commenting errors are all caused by impatience, lukewarmness and laziness. When people are not willing to take their time to read and understand a topic before they give their comment, they make these errors. Having multiple accounts in different campaigns can also contribute to these errors. We should also understand that our names are brands and the quality of service or information we give will determine the respect our names would get.",

We're human and, like the Romans said, \"errare humanum est\".Many people here may have been even learning their English from the internet.So it depends greatly on what kind of errors there are and how big they are.Many write \"loosing\" instead of \"losing\", but one can understand their point. On the other hand I've read (a few times) some .. lists of words... (meant to be posts) I've completely failed to understand.Or I've seen people trying to present nicely some advises or a \"how-to\", but it's full of mistakes. This cannot even be compared with spelling mistakes, since it can mislead others into making mistakes.Or I've seen people \"mistakenly\" post links to malicious things.Errors in judgement also do happen, just look into Reputation and start scratching your head  So, there are many types of errors. And you may have captured the most common, but arguably the less important ones (small spelling related errors for example don't matter much, at least not to me; wrong board can easily be reported and handled).And I will go back to what Romans say. \"Errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum.\" Learn from your errors and evolve.

I don't call it an error if you copied a statement somewhere, rephrased it a bit, and posted it here making it appear it is your own. That's not an error. If you confused then with than, it is understandable. If you failed to write a post with perfect grammar, for as long as the sense is there that's all right. But if you spammed, that's not an error.Although you need to double check your posts, sometimes you miss a word or two, but that's all right. But if you have the penchant to just post right away without even rereading it, without even trying to correct punctuations, grammar, capitalizations, overall sentence construction, spelling, even sense, and so on, that's not anymore error. 2. It's unfortunate that sometimes even honest errors here, especially newbie errors, are not properly corrected but rather insulted, ridiculed, or even rebuked angrily. Rather than feeling mentored, guided, and corrected, there are probably newbies here who instead felt discouraged and unwelcome, thereby losing interest, curiosity, and the desire to ask questions, learn, and perhaps contribute.",

But maybe we have to also take into account that this is a free forum (as in free speech). People may have better days and worse days, with better attitude (and answers) and worse. Of course, this won't help the newbies who get too easily disappointed. I know that. Still I feel like this had to be mentioned.",
