Why they did it?Look at the page: https://cirosantilli.com/cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain/ascii-art  - more interesting ASCII pictures.",

As I said, people with too much time have pus texts there and made some transactions. And some wanted some odd advertising too. So what?",

      "body": "It should be added that this has nothing to do with Taproot either. They are using an OP code that existed from very early days of bitcoin called OP_RETURN to insert arbitrary data into the immutable and timestamped bitcoin blockchain.People do things like this sometimes. For example someone once inserted their engagement date into bitcoin blockchain which will remain there forever.The only connection with Taproot is that the block #709632 is the block where this soft-fork was activated at. So you can say it is a \"popular\" block!",
