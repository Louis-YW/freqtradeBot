  "content": "So I am confused, How Much is Bitcoin Address with balance today?, As I know, we can create unlimited Bitcoin addresses using a 12/24 word mnemonic seed and put the balance in multiple of addresses. But not all people spread it to another address, usually sent to the same address if want to save it. I think it's very dangerous and will be a target. everything is gone without a trace.Another question, Is there any method to check Bitcoin address was created and filled in the balance?",

Many people (and casinos) do that.There are 23,589,958 Bitcoin addresses with at least 0.001BTC in them. For 0.01BTC, it's 12,374,540 addresses.35,705,480 addresses have at least 0.0001BTC, and more than a million addresses hold less than 500 sats.",

But, seeing the comments and responses actually shows the level of work that has been done in Bitcoin data management and retrieval. I truly appreciate the inputs of many guys, and I truly encourage more innovations as that is the way to truly unlock the power and beauty of this amazing technology.",

All data presented in this topic comes from Blockchair.It is nice to have seen this topic here. Blockchain is  indeed a public data unlike the centralized system where computations  are done secretly and results brought out manually for people to see and in some cases there are discrepancies in the figures which contradicts the reality. I am hopefully waiting to see innovations that can be able to take cognizance of flagged wallet addresses.",

However, In my cases, I use a bunch of different addresses sometimes with different private keys for Airdrop purposes   . cold wallet only needs one",

I'm not denying there are also many people actively trade Bitcoin, but they do that in centralized exchanges and even though they're active, it has no relation with address since trading is associated to internal system, not blockchain. If they withdraw their coins to other non custodial wallet or other sites, then it will make the address become active.",

I do not know if there is any benefit to this data, but it gives us a general view of the amount of adoption, which does not seem great. The number of 48 million addresses may indicate one way or another because the number of users is in the process of 10 million to 100 million, and the number may be less than that. You need to remove the active addresses, which are usually for platforms or services, and you will find an approximate number of the total number of users.",
