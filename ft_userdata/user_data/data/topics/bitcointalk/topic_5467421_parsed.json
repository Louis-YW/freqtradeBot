  "content": "I have used GREEN, MUUN, BITCOIN.COM etc Over time my fees start to jump to $2-$3+ randomly.. I search and beg for an option to turn this stupid \"privacy\" feature of changing my bitcoin address off.I literally send all my funds to ONE SINGLE ADDRESS yet each bitcoin app I have used INSISTS on changing my funds around causing me headaches and endless fees later.I don't know who thought this made privacy better, but I can literally track and see where all my bitcoins are being funneled to.This has done nothing but caused double to triple the fees everytime I go to send a bitcoin transaction. Sometimes I'm lucky if the amount is small enough it only cost one fee.But when your wallet keeps moving your bitcoins around sometimes it has to pull from multiple wallets and its causing stupid fees!!A SINGLE bitcoin fee is already getting high enough as is!!!!!Please can someone tell me a wallet that doesn't have this discusting sickening \"feature\" that has done nothing but continuously cost me more in fees? My request is simple:I want ONE BITCOIN ADDRESS FOR EVERYTHING ALL FUNDS! If I want my bitcoin address changed, I want to be the one to do it!This is an issue I've been neglecting to confront, everytime doing a google search not finding much on it. Switched bitcoin apps like 5x now with no luck. They all are doing the same thing without the option to disable! It does not matter if I send all bitcoins to just one address.This is such a sick sickening \"feature\" if someone could please assist me I would thank you.To even suggest it increases privacy is just sick to me to, why when I can click and see where my funds are going? Doesn't make sense.Regardless of if I'm somehow mistaken (even though I've done it myself on the blockchain?) I BEG to have this feature disabled oh please!Sorry for some rant but this has stressed me out sooooo much and now the fees are really being felt worse than an ATM!",

What you need to do is to freeze the other addresses with little UTXOs using coin control and then use just one of them. But that will be for just sometime, it is better you consolidate your UTXOs every time the mempool is low to avoid paying higher fees associated with many UTXOs.

If you have a large number of inputs, then you will have to pay a larger fee. In every transaction, you'll have to spend all of the inputs completely, and anything that isn't spent is used as fees. Hence, you would have to generate a UTXO that contains the change regardless. Your choice of wallet is unlikely to have much of an impact, unless their algorithm is absolutely terrible.A good way to reduce the fee would be to reduce the number of inputs. To do so, you can periodically consolidate them by spending them all at once in a single transaction when the fees are low.",

Let's say you have an address (A) where you want to send your funds.Now let's assume that you send 100k sats today, 150k sats tomorrow and 200k sats the day after tomorrow.In the end you will have 450k sats in address A, but it doesn't work like a total balance. The address isn't part of a UTXO's identity. It explains who will be able to spend the UTXO.Now let's say you want to send to address (B) 250k sats. This will require 2 UTXOs to be combined (100k + 150k) and it doesn't matter whether they come from the same address or from different addresses.I don't know any wallet that can support it nowadays, as they all use the modern standards (HD wallets etc.)The most common option for your request would be to use a legacy address in the form of a paper wallet.

Sure you can ignore my opinion but it is a very, very bad decision to store all your stash on single BTC address. Doing such way you  will gradually  destroy your privacy to the point when, eventually, your identity will be fully revealed. Besides, keeping all funds on single address means you will spend each time from that address, thus, the relevant public key will be under permanent threat of reverse engineering.",

(because of so many \"change\" addresses over time!!)ALL from this NONE SENSE BS FEATURE THAT ISNT EVEN ACTUALLY INCREASING PRIVACY! NOT WHEN I CAN SEE WHERE EVRYTHING IS GOING RIGHT ON THE BLOCKCHAIN!Ughhhhh.. this is so frustrating. I've let this built up over the years.. this is not a good thing bitcoin did. The fees. THE FEES. HOLY crap its gotten so much worse than bank fees like omg..This doesn't make sense!!I'm drowning in fees!!!!Bitcoin is suppose to be about putting YOU IN CONTROL! This is control I feel ripped right from under me.  The horror..    Edit2: Does bitcoin core use change addresses? Otherwise I really have to have someone custom create something that sends the bitcoin back to the original address INSTEAD of a different address every time funds are spent? Or over the years bitcoin dev made this impossible or something?I don't understand.. what the hell changed these past few years??Sorry again for my rant but man I'm really upset about losing this option/feature.. this CONTROL I once had!!!",

If you don't want to believe that: fine by me. But before complaining it helps if you know what you're talking about.TL;DR: Bitcoin transaction fees are based on 2 things: the size (in bytes) and the fee you choose to pay. If your fee is too low, your transaction won't get confirmed any time soon. If you add more different inputs (think about it as a bag of small coins), your transaction gets larger and your fee goes up. That's all there is to it. The address doesn't matter, although the address type does matter. Use Native Segwit for lowest fees.",

Let me assume that three people send bitcoin to the same segwit addresses at different times, the same fee will be paid if three people send bitcoin to three different addresses if you want to spend the three UTXO from the same addresses or different addresses. If you know you have high inputs, you can always consolidate it when you know the mempool is less congested. By consolidating many UTXO counts into one, that will help to save fee anytime you want to make transaction next time.If the transaction fee is very high, and you are using native segwit address that start with bc1q, you can include 3 inputs and 1 output and use ViaBTC free accelerator to accelerate it using the txid. If it is pay-to-taproot, you can include 4 inputs and 1 output and use ViaBTC free accelerator to accelerate the transaction.For coin control, use Electrum, Sparrow or Bluewallet.Transaction to be accelerated on ViaBTC should be at least 10 sat/byte in fee. Those wallets mentioned support RBF which you can use to pump the fee up to 10 sat/vbyte. You can use blockchain explorer to know the fee rate of your transaction in sat/byte (not sat/vbyte).ViaBTC: https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/The blockchain explorer: https://www.blockchain.com/explorerWhile using the free accelerator, do not let the inputs in bc1q address to be more than 3 and the outputs should be 1. For bc1p, inputs should be 4 or less whiles outputs should be 1. Also provided that you are sending to the same address type.You can check the transaction size (not vsize) yourself: https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-transaction-size-calculator/",
