Also you can follow market condition, there is bear and bull market, it is good to invest after a significant bear market.For investment, check the time of bitcoin halving, check the highest and lowest price after and time they both occured. Bitcoin price is also affecting other cryptocurrencies, other cryptocurrencies follow bitcoin price but they are more volatile and riskier.To buy BitcoinFor privacy, use https://bisq.network or https://hodlhodl.com. But the liquidity may be low.You can use instant exchange like Changelley or ChangeNow. But know that while using these type of exchanges, you can be forced to provide ID documents.For other ways but no privacyYou can use common exchanges like Binance or CoinbaseSome sites to buy that may not demand for KYC: https://kycnot.me/After you buy, know that you have to get your coins on noncustodial wallet as the final destination, do not hold on an exchange, you do not have full control of your coin on exchanges, exchanges have the full control, not you. To have full control, use a noncustodial wallet. For small amount, you can use Electrum and be careful of you online security and safety. For large amount, best to get yourself a hardware wallet or you can setup a cold storage wallet if you have the knowledge and experience about how to setup cold wallet appropriately and properly.Open source hardware walletI will advice you to invest in bitcoin. If you invest in altcoin, know that they are riskier.",

      "body": "From a broader perspective;Investing is majorly learnt through research. • Identify an emerging industry or one which you think still has potential for growth. • Study the fundamentals and utilities of the assets around that industry. • Understand how to safely purchase and store the assets, at minimal cost. • Then you can make a purchase.This is of course narrowing everything down. Investments would need more research, knowledge on how best to buy depending on market cycles etc.From a Bitcoin perspective;This is bitcointalk, so I can assume you are interested in acquiring bitcoins.This forum already presents an amazing resource material. Do your research on how it works, how it's valuable, and why is should remain valuable over the coming years.The links provided above would be useful in your journey.",

A big thanks for those people who answer.It depends on what do you want to do the most. Reading or watching.I'm more of a watching person, so when I tried to learn cryptocurrencies, YouTube is where I went. I watched documentaries there because documentaries can give you much information, so I would recommend watching documentaries on YouTube. Don't jump on investing first. I saw the bear market in 2018, but I didn't jump because I know that my knowledge isn't enough at that time and I might lose my money and I continued to learn. Don't invest just because we are in a bear market now. Invest only if you have knowledge.YouTube and Bitcointalk is a big help to me when I'm starting, so I'm recommending both of them .",

Honestly a good learn isn't discuss about the price, but importantly the purpose, how it's work etc.",

For example, you want to invest in bitcoin, you can read or watch a video about what is bitcoin? how does bitcoin work? what is the purpose of bitcoin being created?...Bitcoin is quite popular nowadays, you can find documentation about it anywhere, most conveniently you should go to youtube, it contains most of what you need for a beginner.Also, I recommend you to visit bitcoin's homepage for the best overview of it: https://bitcoin.org/en/ https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paperI want to repeat again, do not rush to invest in any project but focus on investing in knowledge first, once you have knowledge, you will invest more wisely.",

All I can say is that it's better to invest bitcoin nowadays but again you should do some research first before investing and also you can try small amount and if it work then you can add more and more.",
