Bitcoiners for life Got really confused by your title. In any case I think, and correct me if I am wrong with this, you're talking about people who are too hasty when it comes to taking out their investments. To which I will say, it's their money, they can do whatever the hell they want with it. Yes, they lost on a a huge percentage of profits they could've gotten if they just held their coins but for me, profit is profit. Everyone has their own threshold of how much they can lose, not everyone can afford having all their investments zeroed out, so to persecute these people out of the fact that they are \"weak hands\" are just weird to me. Again it's their money, their rules.",

Bitcoiners for lifeThat is Bitcoin's next big thing in line. I mean what would you expect when bitcoin goes up? A race where newbies are having FOMO investments while legends who already had bought bitcoin at the discounted prices will be either hodling or pressing sell button as fast as they could. That's what happens when bitcoin is pumping and people reacting to it. For example, in any type of trading (like commodity based, shares, stocks or crypto for that matter), there are always few type of fixed groups 1. There are FOMO investors2. Group that is buying constantly for DCA methodology3. People who are long term institutional investor believer. They will just keep buying irreseptiov of prices4. Group that would be selling to book profits. ....and that is why there analogy of above cycles.

OP is referring to sudden spike in activities that I have mentioned above. More than that they might be thinking about increased transaction / network congetion that happened during the 2017-18 Bitcoin pump. At that time bitcoin confirmation were taking longer than usual. With low fees it was weeks and even month in some cases. That kinda \"traffic jam\" they might be thinking here.",

What some people don't understand is only a few will rip big from anything involving gaining a lot of money. Be it trading, mining or any other form of business. This is a bitter fact that is hard to swallow.What you should try to focus is on the part where masses haven't yet come in because as soon as there is a gold rush by the masses (FOMO) it will no longer be that profitable.",

The price of bitcoin is also still in the $20k area and it is still very much worth it to enter. entering early means entering as soon as possible, due to rapid price fluctuations so determine where you will enter.Bitcoin is for long-term investment, so don't panic about the decline, it only provides an opportunity for us to continue to add bitcoin assets.",

Bitcoiners for lifeI think the writer was a bit confusing from your tittle but your points are good though when it comes to investment of capital people are very calculative not to incurs excess loss or regrets and at this point I don't blame anybody taking their money because how do you think this saga of bitcoin deepening price will last, guy people's capital is just reducing every second, some even invest with little amount and the capital has vanished over time.There is nothing bad to holds if you're comfortable with that but if you're not you sell off and relax your mind from the deep until probably bitcoin has a head way again. There is nothing like foundation in cryptosystem because you're not the one that build it we only journey along, people who knows the foundations should be the pioneers of the projects, lol, they can lightly tells us our faers. But been patients or not does not guarantees the safety of your trade capital or investment.",

Sorry to say this but you are wrong. He is not referring to the blockchain or traffic of the transaction but what he truly mean is that people will go back again in the market once Bitcoin pumps. Actually, the majority is still here and the ones that quit temporarily are the newbies who don't know yet if what is the potential of Bitcoin. BTC price have dropped but it does not mean that Bitcoin has no strong foundation.A drop in the price is only temporary and normal. Many people doubt BTC in its earlier days but I wouldn't blame those people. If we are on their shoes I think we will also do the same thing or do worse than what they did. What do you expect with them @OP? Bitcoin that time was still new..",

Bitcoiners for lifeForget about the past. What have you learn from it?Will you miss another chance too? This bear run was an opportunity. Those who have bought the DIP and still hodling, will be rewarded in the bull run. And those early and panic sellers will be at the loss and helping those hodlers to buy at low. It also clears out those weak from the market, only keeping the strong hands, thus making the market flow in a steady motion. so eventually we will see a jam but it will clear out soon.",
