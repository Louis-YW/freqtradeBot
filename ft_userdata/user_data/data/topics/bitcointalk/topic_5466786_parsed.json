  "content": "BitCountry - A Hybrid of Traditional and Digital Nations Decentralized State Experiment(part.2)Before we ask for answers, we seek for reasonFirst, there is one movement that most of humanity today owes a debt of gratitude to—socialist movement (I'm not kidding).  Because of its appearance makes the capitalism had to share benefits to their people, so that the technological and economic prosperity after World War II benefited the public (middle-class, olive society, easy life). With the departure of the Soviet Union, capital has nothing to fear, it no need to disguise, harvest starts. So people’s lives get worse and worse, and there is no turning back. (middle-class shrunk, tittytainment, legal drugs, open sex, high living cost...)The meaning of BitCountryRegardless of succeeds or not, BitCountry will be a new opponent of capitalization.  So they have to do what it has been doing for the past 70 years, stop harvest and starts share, to gain public support again. So BitCountry will Let People Live Good Again!BTC & CryptocurrenciesBTC is Currency, there is no need for technological innovation, only needs to be integrated into human beings, more precisely integrated into the labor and production distribution system, try to replace it. (Any comparison of BTC to digital gold is some form of discredit).Cryptocurrencies is tool.WEB3 is a weaponThe only reason why the United States embraces web3 is that peer-to-peer payment technology can break the capital gains of all other countries over the world, because it’s priced in USD. This neither breaks the dollar nor takes away the pricing power of USA, but dimensional reduction attack other countries;Three milestones:1. Quantum: Embrace the quantum world rather than fight against it. Quantum BTC is the answer, not the enemy; encryption will always be decrypted some day. We should invest on a path that human history tells.2.Nuclear: Nuclear is the only way out for BitCountry, including nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, for NATO will take on us one day.3.Establish own decentralized armed organization.",
