I've emailed appealing for the ban but no answer was given.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3518507Reference Link: Amount Scammed: 1100 USDTPayment Method: CryptoPM/Chat Logs: Additional Notes: My id on ole is didi123",

The possible reason could be the man who is managing their official announcement thread is not a part of the team. Could be hired to manage the thread only. But I'm not sure.The man (ole777 representative) trying to bring some answers from the team but it does not have enough details for the OP's ban. here is the update by their official account for some cases.",

Is this going to be a trend from now on every time there is a new accusation? this is the concern of spyrosc200 that you will mark this accusation guilty of arbitrage and syndicate betting with no information given, if the complainant is really guilty then show evidence, a little evidence that will not expose the security of the platform, but at least show us something.Quote from: spyrosc200 on February 06, 2023, 06:38:42 AMMy Ole7.io username is ''spyrosc200'', thank you.Please don't come back with general statements like syndicate betting, arbitrage betting and all those stuff.You know my bets were fair and that i did nothing wrong.",

I think what Carlos tried to say is that he's attending this forum under the capacity of their CM1 2 and only have limited info as the decision is made by the other divisions. Yes, it is extremely not ideal as he's basically just relaying messages from sides to sides, and the working hours is a tad bit adding further complication to the resolution and communication with the platform --if only they employs two staffs to work in two shifts-- but he worked as the official of the platform.",
