  "content": "Bitcoin’s unrelenting selloff puts prices on verge of $20,000 as market shows signs of panicThere’s a growing sense of anxiety about the stability of crypto projects large and small. Tron founder Justin Sun’s roughly month-old stablecoin USDD drifted from its intended dollar peg, at one point dipping below 96 cents, data from CoinGecko show. A tweet from the co-founder of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital fuelled speculation that it had suffered large losses.Bitcoin fell as much as 8.6 per cent on Wednesday to US$20,081.95. The largest token has fallen for nine straight days, the longest losing streak since 2014. Ether was on the cusp of breaking the US$1,000 mark after a 10 per cent plunge.A market that started sliding late last year on expectations of tighter monetary policy is now showing signs of widespread panic, after last month’s collapse of the Terra blockchain and the recent decision by crypto lender Celsius Network Ltd. to halt withdrawals. Even long-term holders who have avoided selling until now are coming under pressure.Adding to the market’s nerves, the founder of Three Arrows Capital, an influential hedge fund that has been liquidating crypto holdings, posted a vague tweet. “We are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out,” former Credit Suisse Group AG trader Zhu Su tweeted from his verified account, without providing further details.The crypto market now stands at a fraction of its heights in late 2021, when Bitcoin traded at a heady US$65,000 and traders poured cash into speculative investments of all stripes. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies is US$925 billion, down from US$3 trillion in November, according to CoinGecko.With prices continuing to dive, there are more predictions that losses will accelerate if key levels are broken.If these levels break, US$20,000 Bitcoin and US$1,000 Ether, we can expect massive sell pressure in the spot markets as dealers hedge themselves.https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-unrelenting-selloff-puts-prices-verge-20000-market-signs-panic",

Price for while now seems stable at $20k +/- !0% and I think there are a lot of people making a lot of money on trading in that sphere keeping it in that range. With no MAJOR news either good or bad there really is no reason for it to move from that range other then pure speculation for the time being. Which is good, since people like stable. Yes they like massive price increases more so they can make money but for now stable seems to be working.-Dave",

(under32eth threshold) cant solo stake.they will pool stake by depositing their little coin into an exchangewhere by the exchange (one PC) regularly signs a block at penny costs for their PC due to having alot of collective stake to have lot of oppertunities.and so then dividing that coin over a few million customers to give them small decimals of 'passive income'which costs the users NOTHING. where by it cost exchanges pennies and costs its customers nothing. everyone would be willing to sell very very cheaply and still profitethereum while its PoW has a underlying cost of atleast $500 per eth right now. so yea the speculative amount above it is why its at $1k right now and speculated to a high of $4k(2x-8x speculation above value cost)but when it begins to cost only a few pennies and a few dollars. the speculation would only be 2x-8x of the underlying cost. meaning still pennies/dollarsyou wont see ethereum at a $8k bubble speculative price with an underlying value cost of under a few dollars. that would be a hyper bubble.",

Definitely remember when TP and handwash were priced well above what was supposed to be \"true value\". I hate to think of it in the Bitcoin sense but I guess all that demand -- buying Bitcoin now because it's still cheaper than making it yourself -- means we're actually at a slightly higher-than-true-value price (in current climate).Nevertheless, also as DaveF notes, there's a lot of people highly suited to this kind of sideways trading. Think there was a record short yesterday prior to the price slip but bettors made their quick 5% gains and then price went right back up.It's not so much an unrelenting selloff as a standstill between desire to keep profiting from tight ranges, and unwilling demand.",

I am not saying that it is \"guaranteed\" to make us money, but it isn't a bad situation neither.This results with some sort of a problem where people see that it could make them a profit, but they are not sure about it at all and that’s why they hesitate to get in. I say, get in no matter what and if you are wrong then you are wrong and it's fine, why would you be worried about being wrong when all we are not sure about right now is the date of it, either you get richer in a week or in a year, but you will.",

So what more pressures can we endure? others argued that we may have reach the bottom already at $17.5 but there are some who thinks that we can still go lower than that. So yeah, bitcoin is still very cheap and at a discounted price, and due to what is going on right now, i.e. the war, recession, inflation, it will really take a toll on all market. But I think BTC has a high chance of recovery in the next coming years maybe getting into the $100k range.",

This price is cheap and below $20k even cheaper, so it looks like the price won't last long below $20k if we go back down. We have had the Celsius bankruptcy filing recently and it doesn't seem to have affected the price much. I think subsequent bankruptcies that might come won't affect it much either. There would have to be catastrophic news of some other kind for us to go down to $15k or beyond.",
