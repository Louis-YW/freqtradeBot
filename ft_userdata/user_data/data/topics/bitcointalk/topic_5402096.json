  "content": "Late last year, Twitter announced that they will be introducing a tip on Twitter beta to allow everyone to receive payment on Twitter using the strike APP, however, it was not available in all locations and also as a custodial wallet, it did not go well for people. Twitter has now enabled the ability to receive bitcoin using an address for which you have the private key (third party addresses), there is no commission or cost for using this service. Any of your followers and friends from Twitter space can send you bitcoin at any moment by copying the address from your profile's Tip icon, the address is yours, and you have complete control over the private key to that wallet address.To use bitcoin tip, you need to set up the wallet address you want to be receiving your payment. To enable Bitcoin Tip, go to your profile:Click on Edit profile >>>> ¬†Select the Tip right below on your screen >>>> Enter your bitcoin address where you want your payments to be received, and save it.Then, toggle Allow Tips to make the Icon visible on your profile, and you're set to go. Anyone who clicks on that symbol and copies the wallet address can now send you bitcoin.View of My profile before I enable TIP featureThis is the view before the Bitcoin Tip was enabled.View of My profile when I enable Tip featureThe view after the Bitcoin Tip is enabled, when you see the money Icon on Twitter profiles, it means they have the ability to receive money and you may tip them if you like.Other options for receiving money on Twitter include Ethereum, Chipper, Patreon, Paga, and Barter. Apart from Ethereum, these are third-party remittance, there are risks associated with receiving money from centralized platforms, we have witnessed donations seized by these companies, I don't encourage anyone to try them.Observations==========- You can insert any type of Bitcoin address to receive payment and it has a way to detect some characters that are not related to bitcoin address, so when you insert wrong characters, it will return \"Invalid character. Please try again\"- Bitcoin Tip is only available on IOS and Android, the web version is not available for now.",

      "body": "I lost interest in this platform a long time ago, and now it is even less interesting to me because it changed its owner, about whom I have no positive opinion. I wonder what the fate of that option is if it is a publicly known fact that the new owner still believes that Bitcoin transactions are bad for the environment. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if the new owner removes Bitcoin and adds his favorite cryptocurrency instead - woof-woofüê∂",

The Tips option is only available on the Android application. not on windows/web browser. and this is not the only option that differs between different platforms Android, iOS, Windows...Also, I remember when I tried this, it was necessary to do two or more \"spaces\" through the account as far as I remember.",

      "body": "If am not wrong, the first time they introduced this feature it was possible to send tips only via the lightning network but now you can send on-chain transactions, right? Is it still possible to use the lightning network?I didn't try this new feature yet and not sure if it's available in my country but based on your description, it doesn't look like a tipping system anymore but more of a way to add a bitcoin address to your profile information (just like name, location, website...). As I said, I didn't try it yet so I might be wrong!",

It will actually increase the adoption of Bitcoin with this new development, which will probably skyrocket Bitcoin to another All-Time-High..

We accept different cryptocurrencies for donations. BTC wallet here, ETH wallet here, wallet here and many more wallet address\". I wonder if it will be easy to do just like the tip system of yolodice when it was still up and running where you just click on the profile you wanted to give tip and then just type the amount and send.",
