  "content": "Hey guysI have installed MintMe node based on core-geth, node is working fine and fully synced the blockchain database.The problem is it keep sync new blocks very fast and when run the miner command, the miner is deactivated due to sync. and this is nonstop sync of new blocks.Anyway to fix it? core-geth only use 5% of my CPU power and core-geth should allow mining side-by-side with sync as long as there is free CPU power for miner to use.Alternatively, I need help to setup the RPC so I can use another mining software not the build-in miner.Also need the RPC setup to allow other computersÂ  to make mining in this node.#support #core-geth",
