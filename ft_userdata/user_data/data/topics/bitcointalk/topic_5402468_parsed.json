Also it is not practical for anyone to move to complete crypto without the need of banking. Some exceptions can happen but largely it's not really a convenient mode of payment.

Each of them have their own method of operations and exclusively independent of each other. They all share something similar, they’re both known  for financial services. No matter how exclusively they operate, one must definitely pose threat at a particular point in time. Cooperating with each other is not something that might be possible now or can ever be possible because of how volatile the crypto market is and also the traditional banking system been decentralized.",

It is unlikely that we will see the closure of banks in the next few years. Most likely, centralized finance and decentralized finance will develop and exist in parallel. Even if there is a direct threat to the banking system, governments are more likely to start restrictions for cryptocurrency than to destroy banking institutions. This is not beneficial to big capitals, and of course, no one will give full power to decentralized finance, where there is no state control. Therefore, replacing banks with DeFi is more of a fantasy.",

Banks won't be obsolete, just see how the exchanges have been pausing withdrawals because of the continuous drop in prices of bitcoin.",

This time if you know the fact if people were using their traditional bank as a way to transfer their money into the crypto market. That means if the traditional bank is possible to cooperate with the crypto. Remember the reserved funds that used to backed the stable token was also still on the traditional bank as well.

This is a way to a healthy compilation against cryptocurrencies.This is what they are worried about, not about the change of conventional banks to crypto, but more about financial effects that cannot be controlled by the state, so far there is no regulation that can regulate all of that, even in crypto there has never been such a thing as inflation, financial freedom can destroy a system and I think this is the big problemQuote from: crzy on June 13, 2022, 09:42:27 PMBanks will stay, they might cooperate later on especially now that many are into blockchain which helps them in many ways.
