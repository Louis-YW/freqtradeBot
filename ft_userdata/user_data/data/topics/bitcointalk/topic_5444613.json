Despite we have other currencies it doesn't means they can't operates independently without bitcoin and we know too well that is the first digital currency that gives birth to other currencies through the formation of bitcoin all other coin where created out of it. I don't think if there were no bitcoin if other would like exist for that we give respect and maximum regards to bitcoin because is the way maker for other cryptocurrency.",

Toxicity is something we can find almost in any community on internet and the Bitcoin/ altcoin community is not an exception. Let us be reasonable and do not spread hatred without reason, regardless of our portfolios.",

Just because bitcoin remains supreme in market cap doesn't mean all other coins are useless or irrelevant. I'll have you know that after 2019, bitcoin hadn't made any significant impact in the redefinition of the cryptocurrency industry besides the occasional bull runs it initiates. DeFi, NFTs, and many more have come from altcoins and we can't just sideline how impactful these ventures have become not only to the profitability of bitcoin but with its social media traction as well. Quote me on this, Bitcoin maximalists/purists who see bitcoin as the end-all-be-all of cryptocurrencies and currencies at the same time will be the death of this industry. Their delusion and their capacity to gatekeep bitcoin will hamper with the progress of this industry. They'd literally bar people who see great potential in the industry with their actions. So is the redditor right? Yes.",

For some people, Bitcoin is not only the first cryptocurrency, but this is the most trusted, worthies, and also the most valuable cryptocurrency compared to others. I do really agree with this. Bitcoin is the best and none can compete with Bitcoin in some terms. there may be many altcoins that have various benefits, concepts, and also leading technologies than Bitcoin. But, they are not able to compete in terms of value, market cap, trust, and reputation. Because not all altcoins are able to survive in any condition. However, I also don't think that all altcoins are trash. There are still some worthy altcoins, but not much.",

Obviously not, at most we need a hundred of those coins, and I am being extremely generous as we need way less than that, meaning that 99.57% of the altcoins that exist are useless, which explains the extreme disdain some maximalists have for altcoins.",
