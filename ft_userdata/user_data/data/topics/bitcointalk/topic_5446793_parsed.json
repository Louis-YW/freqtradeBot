      "body": "Hello. Thank you for your interest.Currently, all Whatsminer models above and including m21s are supported. And all models younger than Antminer s17. 19 the line is currently at the stage of changes, due to the large difference in responses depending on the firmware.No, the program code is closed, the application is distributed only through Google Play and the Ru Store (for Russia). If you are offered to download an apk file from another resource, most likely it will be a fake or fraud.",

      "body": "whatsminer has nice tools.it covers m20 and up.it is free.very hard to say use anything but it.If you have whatsminers.Also a lot depends on how many pieces of gear you have.Under 10 units You don’t earn a lot.If you have 10 s19xps it is only about 100 a day.You can check 2 times a day for issues.When you wake up and when you go to bed.I have around 100 pieces of gear to check.I am not using a phone to check.Many have 1000 pieces to check they won’t use a phone.most likely a decent android tablet is better as screen size works well as compared to a phone.So if play store puts it on a tablet it could sell.but as I said i use other methods which are safe and free.",

      "body": "I haven't visited the forum for a long time, I haven't had time to work on the application. And the distribution of the application shows that those interested are mainly in Russia.Let's answer each point.1. At the time of the start of development, I decided not to implement all the miner management functions in the application. That is, you cannot change pools, disable/enable miners, or do anything else. All information about the application is collected exclusively through the API.2. The data collected in the app represents the approximate location for displaying targeted ads. No other data is collected. Location data is transmitted to me solely to determine the target audience.3. I totally agree about viruses. Yes, users will be treated with distrust in most cases. However, I already have a dozen rave reviews in which the app has helped and added convenience. The application is distributed free of charge, provided that ads are placed in the application. The right to use or not remains solely with the user.4. I wonder what proven open source apps exist for the phone. Comparing a PC and a mobile app should not be done when it comes to mobility. All types of access from a phone to a PC are \"crutches\".5. I do not understand what kind of payment is being discussed in the topic if the user does not pay for anything.6. I developed this app because the convenience of quickly checking the farm status was a priority for me. Due to the sufficient remoteness of the objects, when an event comes from the server, it turned out to be most convenient for me to enable a vpn connection to the farm and check devices from my phone. If something can be fixed remotely, that's what was done. And you could do it while sitting in the car.7. Currently, there are more than 700 active users. The average rating is 4.6. I consider this a good result for myself.And really, thank You for your attention. It is important for me to hear the opinion of users. Even distrust of the application. Only time can prove that the application is completely harmless.",
