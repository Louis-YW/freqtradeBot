  "content": "This is one of the reasons it can be said it is not your coin when it is not your key, see what Coinbase just want to do. By December 5, Coinbase will not support four coins again, the coins are Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, Stellar Lumens and Ripple. The reason for not supporting the coins again is because of low usage. https://www.finanzen.ch/nachrichten/aktien/coinbase-wallet-will-stop-supporting-bch-etc-xlm-and-xrp-citing-low-usage-11949889That means if Coinbase users are not using bitcoin like before, Coinbase do not care, but that can no happen to bitcoin as it is the strongest coin with the highest utility but just saying that Coinbase and other custodial companies only care more about the profit they are making. Coinbase did not say that people are no more using the coins, they said low uage. Which means small transactions and small profit from withdrawal.Edit: I have just noticed it is not Coinbase exchange but Coinbase wallet which users has the private keys.",

      "body": "Coinbase is a profit making company, so delisting few coins which is just occupying space is a good thing for the organization in as much as they are informing there customers about the action in other for them to move out their funds to other wallet. Binance has also made a bold step by delisting btcst which I believe the reason for this was because of the price instability which is a kind of risky to their customers.",

      "body": "Why would they remove Bitcoin from their list? it doesn't matter how strong Bitcoin is, the reason why Coinbase exists it's because Bitcoin exists it was only made for Bitcoin. The thing is they always do this to not support some coins obviously to take advantage and make a profit or to avoid bankruptcy.Remember that when there is fork coins exist on Bitcoin they do not support those coins until the price of Bitcoin drops a lot before they decided to support it which is obvious they already made a profit before they send them back to their user's wallet.So do not trust exchanges keeping your coins from exchanges are very risky having ledger device will the best choice these days.",

I don't see there's a Bitcoin belong their list, you might mean it's Bitcoin cash (BCH).BCH, ETC, XLM, and XRP, are the coins they stop supporting, but I think XRP is still useful when it comes to sending funds because it has a very low fee compared to other altcoins.  The rest deserve to be delisted. It might Coinbase choose a coin that frequently uses by their users, they earn profit through transferring fund and the reason of stop supporting them because their company didn't earn from this coin.",

XRP is a total shitcoin that was already promising great adoption and acceptance by banks in 2014 and 7 years later they're still a shitcoin with no acceptance. Why do I even bother... I don't use coinbase anyway.",

But at the end of this, no one should keep their assets to any online wallet like CB.",

I know with many investor try three until five years later holding with their assets in exchange market but when returning back actually delisting in exchange like Coinbase stop supporting with BCH, ETC, XLM and XRP.I agree with opinion from @BitMaxz, never hold and trust our cryptocurrency assets holding in exchange market, beside many time altcoin delisting actually worry with exchange suddenly stop working like FTX collapse and much investor money have run away.",
