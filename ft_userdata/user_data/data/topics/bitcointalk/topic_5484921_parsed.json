No current situation suggests that rising fees would make it impossible for regular people to transact, this would be a problem for several decades down the line when mining rewards is majorly transaction fees and miners need to charge an amount that would cover their cost of mining.There are several solutions that exists to fix the fees problem and more would be implemented down the road. One of them is off chain transations, this should become more popular and attract more users, taking much of the load off on-chain transactions.",

Mining is the decentralization mechanism. My implication is that, if only big players have sufficient capital to bribe miners with transaction fees, then the peer-to-peer aspect of the network could be effectively undermined (no pun intended). I recall this same thing happened in 2017, so it appears to be a recurring issue.

This work-around doesn't seem to lead us down a sustainable path...I bet you it won't work. Mining requires hash rate to confirm transactions and create new Bitcoins. This hash rate is usually higher depending on the computation power of the computer you are using. Because the faster the miner's node setup can find hashes that that fit in the block, the faster you can proceed to computing the next hash problem.

We should be able to do better than to tell people not to use Bitcoin when others are using Bitcoin too, moving money is the whole point of the network.I have used ViaBTC in the past, but honestly, it's just a work-around...the core issue remains unaddressed.Quote from: Mia Chloe on February 12, 2024, 06:21:12 PMQuote from: moonie on February 12, 2024, 06:10:17 PM\"Some large exchanges have mining pools for faster confirmation\"This is exactly the type of centralization I'm voicing concern about.

Selfish mining already grants a disproportionate advantage to miners controlling just 25% of hash-rate (they can make up to 1/3 of blocks). Imagine what happens when the exchanges and miners band together; you've just taken the scenic route to recreating the problems with our existing banking system.",
