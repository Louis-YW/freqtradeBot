If you are not convinced, you may want to run (an) electrum on testnet with free testnet coins and try that out.",

Option B: Go on \"Addresses\" tab (if there's no such tab, View -> Show Addresses), right click on the specified address, click on \"Spend From\", and now try sending spending some money. It'll use your specified address' outputs.",

      "body": "The beauty of bitcoin and Electrum (since that is what you are using) is that you can create multiple wallets and they are free. It's not like a bank account where there are costs to open one and monthly charges to maintain it. If your Electrum wallet A is used for all kinds of activities including your work with the mentioned companies, just create a new wallet and use it only for transactions with that company. That way you don't have to bother freezing addresses, and ensuring you spend coins from the correct one. You should still disable change addresses like nc50lc mentioned to ensure no coins spill over to other addresses. You mentioned companies (plural). If you use a different address for each company, just repeat the previous step several times and create wallets for company X, company Y, etc.",

That way, they know who paid them simply by checking which address was paid.",
