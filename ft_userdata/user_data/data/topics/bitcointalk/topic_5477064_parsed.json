      "body": "Regarding the cryptocurrency ban in Nigeria, there's no written law stating that citizens are not to be caught using Bitcoin, nor has any law been passed stating that citizens caught using Bitcoin should be penalized. That's to say, if any Nigerian arm force catches you with Bitcoin on your phone, there is no law that warrants them penalizing you. The cryptocurrency ban case in Nigeria is that there should be no bank transaction relating to cryptocurrency; otherwise,  your bank account will be blocked. But, OP, do you know that Bitcoin is your private property? And you should not go about flaunting your Bitcoin asset in public. Even cryptocurrency traders don't trade while they are walking on the road, so the question is: what are you checking in your Bitcoin wallet on the road?There's a saying that \"prevention is better than cure\". If you know you are doing something that can cause complications for you, taking the best precautions is a wise practice.Have a nice day.",

But however, wisdom is profitable to direct. You know how our security operatives behave so you need to be smart and sharp to avoid any thing that would attract them to you. Avoid operating of phones in the public places if it has to do with bitcoin or this platform. If it Is a necessity, then locate the nearest secured spot to attend to your matters otherwise you will end up getting yourself into trouble because this olokpa men dem no get joy o.

They were practically closing the accounts of people that transact in Bitcoin and placing restrictions on some. However, the new administration of Tinubu did follow that direction and have even lifted all restrictions placed on crypto related accounts by the previous administration.  Consequently,  Nigeria is a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency friendly country as of today,  hence the growing interest in Bitcoin in various quarters of the country.",

Ensure that anything related to bitcoin and crypto isn't available at a glance on your phone or devices. Once caught by these corrupt officers, it would be your words against theirs. In my experience (I have had an encounter with them), it's probably best not to give them a reason to look further.If you live in an area when such officers can't access or are not allowed to, then you should be good to go. Otherwise just stick to the good 'ol prevention is better than cure practice.",
