  "content": "Hi guys, Passing by to start the discussion regarding RON staking as I couldn't find it in my previous search.If you're into blockchain gaming and NFTs, you already heard about Ronin, a blockchain platform that's designed specifically for these use cases and we cannot deny that they had the advantage of being one of the first movers on that matter.Ronin has its own native token, RON, which you can stake to help secure the network and earn rewards. Here's a quick summary of the staking rewards schedule:* Staking rewards are distributed monthly.* The more RON you stake, the higher your staking tier and the more rewards you can earn.* The rewards are calculated based on the total amount of RON staked by all users, so the more people participate, the higher the rewards for everyone.I got that info from: https://roninblockchain.substack.com/p/ron-staking-rewards-scheduleAs we can see, there are more interest flowing to RON blockchain right now, as per this post : https://twitter.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1640134878757830664/photo/1I could not find any info regarding the expected APR, but it would be nice to know it to compare with other options (such as RON/ETH liquidity mining and etc)Any thoughts?",
