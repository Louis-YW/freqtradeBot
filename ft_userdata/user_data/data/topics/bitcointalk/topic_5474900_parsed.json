Right now, I’m having difficulty to decide what play next since I don’t find anymore any slot games that appealing me.I have an insane beginners luck that’s why I want to play slot games that I totally don’t know but gives me the vibes that it will gonna pay.So here’s the deal, Suggest me a slot game that you really like then I will tip you if I hit big on it. I’m always sharing my achievements on new things that I’m playing so you can expect that I will remember you once I really hit big time. By definition of Big time is x1000 and above since I’m only playing using minimum bet range.",
