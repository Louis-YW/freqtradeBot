And yes, I edit it just to test the forum's features, it's been a while I didn't post anything on a forum, and especially here. Chill out dude, I have done no harm up until now  Yes, I may have plan to be paid for my signals later, but I'll share them for free for now, so calm down  you'll see by yourself if I'm a fraud or guenuine, both with my signals' validity, and the evolution of my ftmo demo account.",

Doesn't look odd at all, but whatever.Usually, all of those people who come to announce to provide free signals have the intention to start a premium paid signal service, once they hit a few successful signals. Usually, these people will give you 4 -5 signals per day, and even if one or two signals get hit, they will create so much hype and force you to join their premium service. Therefore I usually avoid these unknown signal groups.",

Doesn't look odd at all, but whatever.Anyone that says he wants to give free signal will end up demanding money from people, that is why none of them want to provide any signal on this forum, because they want people do pay money and if they request for that directly on this forum, they will be rejected, also because anyone can provide signal, they do not care if the signal go wrong or not, if that happens on this forum, people will easily know how wrong signals can also be. I always advice newbies to avoid both free and paying signals, the best is to learn trading from scratch.",

I read on their ftmo.com/en/why-ftmo-challenge/ page, wherein I see \"One-time fee only (no recurrent charges or other fees),\" so I assume that we need to pay to use their services.The subscription fee is about €155.00, which is too high. Besides that, the trade is for stock, not crypto, while we are in the crypto forum.",

I'm aware after these 5 years of struggle to find a way to get profitable that trading may be difficult, so if I can help the community by any means. Then, just for information, it's been 4 months now that I'm profitable, so I guess it's not so anymore about \"luck\". And I understand the critics about being profitable and not having funds. But It's easy to judge. With a different point of view, you can think about a job lost, unemployement, etc... For now, really, I'm here to help  people can consider my free signals or move on,everyone does as he wants",
