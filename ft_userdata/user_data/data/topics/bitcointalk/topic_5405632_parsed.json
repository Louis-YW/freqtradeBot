Regardless though, very sad news & I hope his family will be OK. This kind of news is not good & I hope the perpetrator is caught & hit with the full force of the law.As seen in the video, the shooting was carried out at close range and the perpetrator was immediately arrested on the spot by several security officers. I don't understand how the security guards were so caught off guard at the time of the shooting. To be honest it was a crime that had to be dealt with very hard because it seemed like it was something planned.In my opinion, there is no correlation between the shooting incident and bitcoin even though the Japan stock market is down. The impact may only be on a national scale but only about stocks, not about bitcoin. For now the bitcoin price is even on the rise from the day before, which is a good thing as $22.5K is hit again today.",

And at times all this happen due some of the characters the exhibit when they are in office. Maybe he has wrong people that contribute for coup elimination of his live, Japan is very big technology country to find out what kills this man should not take them time to found out.",

Does this incident have any impact over the cryptocurrency market.The incident is such a painful one and nobody expected it to happen not even the former prime minister of Japan. Right now he is gone maybe because he was not guarded properly by the security operatives. This shows that a lot of things are still lacking in Japan despite its technological advancements. Probably the person who did the shooting had made his plans in such a way that the gun can not be traced.OP, you didn't show any proof backing the claim that the entire stocks in Japan fell after the news of Shinzo Abe's death broke out and I doubt if this is possible because neither Shinzo Abe is the current Prime Minister of Japan nor is he an important crypto influencer or crypto enthusiast, I think his death can only affect those under his political ally it has nothing to do with the crypto market.",

The Political Economy is very bad in the country. That is, the sharing formula is not egalitarian so the angry youths are not happy in anytime or day. They are angry whenever they see a Politician. Because Politicians are the causes of their suffering.2. Opponents. As a leader, definitely you must steps on toes. So those you have offended are always looking for your downfall at all time. FinallyIn any country if a Politician uses security to guide him or herself, meaning the sharing formula is unequal in the country, so with that the Politicians use the security apparatus to prevent from the hungry angry masses to attack them (Politicians). The number one supersedes the number two in all Societies.",

So I will say that there will be no effect whatsoever, it's more on the political side of Japan though.",

It is a sad story in a very peaceful country.I agree as consequence of peaceful country, security protection there looks like not too well. Very little security guards, too close contacts with the crowd and response is manual, not with gun aims at the attacker and control him immediately.QuoteJapan being a crypto friendly country it has got more real-time usage of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Sorry if I am missing anything.When I read your topic title, I guess you meant about unexpected death which causes losing access of private key, then wallet, then Bitcoin. In fact, it is not what you want to discuss in your topic. It means your topic title is bad and misleading.Topic title style guideMake your topic title, posts more attractive",
