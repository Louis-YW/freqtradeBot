Moreover, what efforts need to be made within the crypto community to address potential vulnerabilities ?At current times we should not worry much about Quantum computing because it's not available to public yet and it will take a lot of time to be available to public. The real concern is the current issues that we are facing as Bitcoin adopters and that's because of the BRC-20 protocol or ordinals. I know that in future we may find a way to tackle the quantum computing because the quantum computers won't be available to public because of the commercial factor. The companies don't want to ruin their current computing empires that they have built after huge effort and that's the main reason behind delaying of Quantum computers.Just relax and don't worry for now because Quantum computers aren't available yet and when they become available then surely developers will develop new algorithms and encryption modes which will be enough to stop those quantum computers.",

But let's have it, if quantum computing really going to break Bitcoin's security, let it be and we'll see how it is going to break it because I've been hearing about it. Like someone who just came across a topic on it while browsing then becomes interested to this topic. Honestly, I'm tired of hearing about it while Bitcoin is thriving and getting close to the one ideal adoption of it from many countries of being a legal tender. Here goes topics like this, the devs are there and don't think that Bitcoin won't even have that upgrade just as how enthusiasts with quantum computers breaking bitcoin's network.",

This is not a threat because if something like that would happen, bitcoin developers would have done something about it which will be able to protect bitcoin from quantum computing. This is not what should be bothering us for now because no computer that can be able to do that which has been created.From what I understand it would only be able to brute force a private key from a public key, not from a public address (in any reasonable amount of time). So the roughly 2 million bitcoin still sitting in addresses from like 2009/2010/2011 that were sent to public key rather than public address WILL be stolen by quantum computers eventually. All other Bitcoin are safe (as long as you aren't reusing addresses).Though I think 2030 is way too soon. Quantum computers are still in their infancy. Maybe by 2040 it'll be at the point where it'll be a serious threat to those ~2 million bitcoin.The main problem, assuming my information is correct, is that either we let those couple million bitcoin get stolen (about half of them being Satoshi's bitcoin horde), or we hard fork to remove the pay to public key transactions from being valid blockchain transactions, thus cutting out about 2 million bitcoin from the supply. Community is generally against hard forks in order to keep bitcoin immutable and never have any problems of people being cut off from the network, but if its the only option to keep 2 million bitcoin from being stolen I think it would have to be done.Besides that problem I don't think there is a serious threat to Bitcoin from quantum computing. Updates can be done to make the network quantum resistant in any ways it is not currently.",

Things are quite messy there haha.",

But the funny thing is that more than 10 years have passed, I still haven't seen any impact of quantum computers on bitcoin, while bitcoin is increasingly popular and valuable. So, I thought, this is just a bullshit joke by bitcoin haters trying to spread to get bitcoin enthusiasts to give up on bitcoin. So you should stop caring about that nonsense and focus on accumulating bitcoins, how many bitcoins do you already have that you have to worry about?",

You're right to point out that one of the biggest concerns is the threat to the current cryptographic algorithms used to protect Bitcoin transactions. Quantum computers are significantly more powerful than traditional computers and are capable of breaking current encryption methods in a fraction of the time. This could allow hackers to gain access to private keys and potentially steal or double-spend Bitcoin.To address these potential vulnerabilities, there are a few potential solutions. One is to develop new quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. Another is to move to a quantum-resistant",

If that happens one day, we could just move the goalpost further and make it very hard for quantum computers to end up failing.It's nowhere near anytime soon anyway, so there is really no need to worry about it, but the moment it becomes a viable threat, we would just make sure that it reaches to a point where it would not be possible for even quantum computers to crack into. Many keep saying \"but it would be so easy for quantum computers to crack since they are infinitely faster\" but they do not realize that there are unlimited amount of numbers and words you can combine, hence making it a moot point that you would have a strong computer.",
