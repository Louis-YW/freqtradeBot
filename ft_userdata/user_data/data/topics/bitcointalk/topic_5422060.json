  "content": "3 day auction!!  Up for auction is a beautiful, ungraded 2014 Cryptolator Copper 1oz “Bitcoin Unchained”, #335 (Unfunded), with COA, and the original blue leather case in near perfect condition since it’s always been in the original bag in storage.This is one of those coins that should grade very well, so I did not take it out of the capsule for pictures, but can do so if someone desires. (This coin is made by the famous NWTM, which has since gone out of business, but they did produce some of the highest grading coins in the past, like Smoothie’s Silver Monero series etc).
