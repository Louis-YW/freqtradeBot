With the competition in this section, making mistakes like this takes away a lot of points, but the OP has time to fix it and edit the OP once he/she has the copper membership.Another thing I would avoid is \"trusted\" if there is no one trusted in the casino who can vouch for them by leaving positive feedback for deals they have done or positive experiences that convey trustworthiness. That you say of yourself that you are trusted does not mean anything to me, because scammers also say it.",

I registered on your website and I saw promocode and I was thinking if you had any promotion for bitcointalk members who first registered on your platform that would be nice as it would attract more clients and possibly they would give you an honest review about your casino which would enhance further developments on your casino. I noticed your email was first sent to my junk box before I had to verify my authenticity to activate my account. If I may ask do you have an app because while going through the platform I noticed a notification on my screen with a download metaspins instructions or prompt. I also noticed that your customer support chat system is very poor. You kept a bot there and unserious customer care service. I think you need to improve on it.The 1 bonus on my dashboard is what I would need explanations on because I tried clicking on it and not clickable. Lastly, I would suggest you hid to the idea of upgrading your account to a copper member so you can be able to upload your casino here as your first impression matters here.",

I’m using a larger screen handheld device and the picture of homepage is just crop and blurry. This is what it's look like using my device:I suggest to that put the website url on the title or put it on the top part of the thread so that in can be easily seen by viewers here.",

Since the name of your casino is called Hold n Spin, I would expect your casino to have a very good selection of dices and slots. If you have some luck and keep your casino in a good shape long enough, then you could also start a signature campaign or even better: a review campaign, so more people can be aware of your service.Anyways, Good luck!",

Basically it is not something extraordinary, it was really common thing in online crypto casinos but we all know that it is hard to complete the wagering requirement. Most of the time, players lost all the winning from the free spins before completing the wagering requirement.",

BONUSES9.1. HoldSpin reserves the right to remove, add or change any bonus that is available in the account of any Customer and has not been claimed. Any claimed and active bonus will not be removed by HoldSpin under regular circumstances.9.2. Bonuses might have wagering requirements attached to them. These requirements will be appropriately displayed before the Customer decides to use a bonus when wagering requirements are applicable. Withdrawal amounts will be only possible for the real money balance the bonus money balance upon withdrawal will be lost. HoldSpin has the right to choose which game and service contributes what amount to the wagering requirements. The wagering requirements have a minimum of 25 times the amount of bonus and the real money sum contributing to the bonus figure.9.3. Bonuses can be received once per person (Customer), per household, per address, per mobile phone, per shared computer and per shared IP address. Risk-free bets on any games or services do not count toward the wagering requirements. Winnings from free spins are added to the bonus money balance unless otherwise provided in the specific bonus terms attributable to each bonus.9.4. The maximum amount of money to be won from a no deposit free spin bonus and gameplay with mentioned bonus funds is 50 EUR or any other currency equivalent. Any winnings exceeding 50 EUR without making a real money deposit and fulfillment of wagering requirements will be void and will be kept by HoldSpin. Example, a customer receives a no deposit free spins bonus. The free spins get played out and the customer wins 10 EUR. The customer proceeds to play other games with the money, previously won from free spins, and without wagering real money as per wagering requirements, and wins 90 EUR, totalling 100 EUR in the HoldSpin cashier. In this case the customer has exceeded the cap of 50 EUR winnings, 50 EUR will be available for withdrawing and 50 EUR will be kept byHoldSpin.9.5. The maximum bet when having an active bonus is EUR 5 per spin or EUR 0.5 per bet line. HoldSpin reserves the right to void bets and wager turnovers resulting from larger bets made on games and/or services of HoldSpin.9.6. HoldSpin reserves the right to impose various restrictions to different countries where Customers may reside regarding bonuses for reasons we deem appropriate. We further reserve the right to offer specific bonuses to individual customers or customer groups and their termination, change or other alteration without explanation and/or compensations in any form.9.7. If a player or a group of players are abusing casino bonuses HoldSpin has the right to confiscate any wins thereof and to close the players account(s). Abusive behaviour towards bonuses and/or bonus abuse means:i) A Player places bets and/or wagers amounting to the maximum allowed per bonus terms to raise the variance in order increase the balanceii) Player lowers the bet and/or wager size after a big win and changes the game to one with a lower volatilityiii) Player makes deposits to cap out the bonus amount but not more. Applicable to match bonuses of 50% and aboveAfter the account has been flagged as bonus abusing it is forbidden to use any other bonuses and/or participate in promotions at HoldSpin.",
