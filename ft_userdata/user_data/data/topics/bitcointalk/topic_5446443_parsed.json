I think Mirror Protocol and FTX used to have this feature where a token would track the price action of your stock ?Given the ties to the Terra Ecosystem and FTX of course, I'd stay away from these indefinitely. But is there any other decentralizedprotocol on the blockchain that offers this ? I think Amazon, Nvidia, Google and Apple were the big ones, so quite possibly there'sa solution out there. Something like Injective Protocol maybe ?P.S. I think several centralized exchanges offer access to stock markets but I rather use a DEX.",

      "body": "It's called tokenized stock. Some centralized exchange offer tokenized stocks but they only act as intermediaries, for example, FTX was offering it via some other company(broker firm) that handle those stocks. Bittrex was also offering it, but now, it seems they suspend it.I don't know if there are decentralized exchange solutions, but generally, in the end, it will certainly require a centralized entity. I also don't think it is plausible, except if it works just like Mirror Protocol, where it is just a mirrored price and you have nothing to do with the actual stock, not tokenized or owning a parts/fraction of the shares.",

      "body": "Let's say that it can be done tecnically for the sake of argument. There's still no way that the SEC and other regulators would allow such company stocks to be traded on true decentralized platforms since they do not or can't regulate on a protocol level. They may get away for the time being but SEC will surely trace anyone who would attempt to do so and file tons of lawsuits.",

Even when those sites do, they are not speaking the whole truthThey are not \"stocks\", they are called synthetics, meaning that they represent the value of the stock. When you buy synthetics, you are not owning a stock, you won't have any rights that come with it. Just the promise of the value you will get by buying / selling it.",

Injective Protocol does offer a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) services, such as asset trading, derivatives, and synthetic asset creation, but I don't believe that it offers the ability to track the price action of stocks. You may want to look into decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap, 0x, and 1inch, as they may offer some limited support for tracking the price action of stocks",

From my understanding, it's not the actual stock that you are trading but some IOU that most trading platforms recently have done and like what Robinhood does as well. I would be amazed if there's a DEX that does that but I wonder how reliable it would be and if it's true that they have ties with the actual stocks to trade it at the end of the day.",

As for other decentralized protocols on the blockchain that offer this, I'm not entirely sure. I think it's possible that some of the big players like Amazon, Nvidia, Google, and Apple might have a solution out there, but it's hard to say for sure. Injective Protocol is certainly one possibility, but again, I can't say with certainty whether or not they offer this specific feature.  And I agree with you that using a DEX is probably the way to go, rather than relying on a centralized exchange.",
