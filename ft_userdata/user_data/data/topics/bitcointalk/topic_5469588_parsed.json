  "content": "For those who don't know me, I work as a warehouse operative (working class person). I don't aspire to succeed much as an employee, but rather strive to be creative as an individual person. The Bitcoin history book is what I devote significant amounts of time to, aiming to create something special for the community (completed book will be on Amazon in SEPTEMBER 2024!!!).  It is the main avenue through which I am exercising my intelligence and diligence. I know most people in the community would rather hodl their crypto wealth, but isn't it wise to support community effort. All I seek is donations to aid my effort to create a detailed BTC history book. Please show generosity I once knew the community was renowned for in the early years. I look forward to your messages and feedback. I won't give up the task. UPDATE 30/06/2024I have almost completed pages 50 to 273 (covering 2008 to 2022 BTC history) amounting to 224 pages. The 300 A4 book (paperback & hardback) will be released in September 2024!UPDATE 06/05/2024Happy to announce that 2017-2020 history chapters almost finished:UPDATE 01/04/2024As promised, here is the PDF document showing chapters 2008/09 to 2016 (still have the summary pages to complete):https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M8z4M4oV4WC_aIGWkn-tO_T7Nkllj47C/view?usp=sharingPlease leave comments, feedback and suggestions for improvement in this thread.  The current thread for the book is:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5475400.0I will strive to finish the chapters for 2017 to 30th June 2024 (nearly 50% complete) by this summer.  Please show generosity and donate to help me complete the Bitcoin History 2008-2024 book by 12th September 2024:$BTC bc1qktyzg2atx5paka2x64pxdwg54u7m2yn3cu2qxy$LTC ltc1qz8jqkhy264q3mdjkjzsve7er25qdnmmvxt96lr$ETH 0x125288bAf499e26259f8E2aC6FC5fE1491aBa9c2$DOGE DRj7PWEz5zxHc5ptkTBapKjCrxQU75CB6q$XRP r9LbXGJ9HCdwvAhKWJJLihSd8612xHybv7With sufficient help, I know the book will be completed by September 2024.  Thank you in advance for your support and feedback.UPDATE 03/03/2024:Nearly completed Bitcoin history book chapters documenting 2018 & 2019 milestones:UPDATE 07/02/2024:I've completed history chapters covering 2008 to 2017 (pages 44 to 187 - 144 pages). 2017 Chapter:I will complete 2018 and 2019 before the end of February 2024. Who is still interested?UPDATE 07/01/2024:There is an opportunity for 10 people to have their own personal page in the book!For 0.01 BTC, on a first come first serve basis, one person is allowed to purchase just one page.  I invite you to write about your journey with Bitcoin (your participation, best memories, successes, failures etc.). Feel free to include photos. I have opened the book up for these 10 pages to gain community insights and experience.If interested, please contact me. The price has been set relatively high to deter too many entries.  UPDATE 26/12/2023:As a way to help me complete 'The Bitcoin History Book 2008-2024' by September 2024, I seek community support.  If you you would like your full name (or alias) in the book (will be listed on page 6 onwards), please private message me your name and donate at least $5 (crypto equivalent) towards my efforts.  Donation addresses are in the OP. Thank you in advance. P.S. With sufficient support, I am the type of person who knuckles down and is totally determined.  Please trust me!UPDATE 04/12/2023:For of all, thank you to all those who have commented on this thread including useful feedback.  It is motivating and helps me to assess progress.  I have nearly completed the first draft of 8 chapters covering 2008-2016 (see draft preview, some pages removed) immediately below.  The Bitcoin yearly history chapters begin on page 44 after introductory and other BTC related To be honest, I am slightly baffled about the lack of generosity from the community.  Countless time and energy has been put into it so far, and I am determined to write draft pages for 2017-end June 2024 next year.  I'm far from a greedy person (live in a small terrace house with terrible heating and an abomination of a garden) who continuously loves to learn and work hard.  Moreover, I turn down overtime at work in favour of writing this book.  If you can, please donate:$BTC bc1qktyzg2atx5paka2x64pxdwg54u7m2yn3cu2qxy$LTC ltc1qz8jqkhy264q3mdjkjzsve7er25qdnmmvxt96lr$ETH 0x125288bAf499e26259f8E2aC6FC5fE1491aBa9c2$DOGE DRj7PWEz5zxHc5ptkTBapKjCrxQU75CB6q$XRP r9LbXGJ9HCdwvAhKWJJLihSd8612xHybv7With sufficient help, I know the book will be completed by September 2024.  Thank you in advance for your support and feedback.

Below is a link showing a preview of what has already (history chapters begin on page 44)Besides the above, a preliminary front cover for the book as been designed:Please SUPPORT $BTC bc1qktyzg2atx5paka2x64pxdwg54u7m2yn3cu2qxy$LTC ltc1qz8jqkhy264q3mdjkjzsve7er25qdnmmvxt96lr$ETH 0x125288bAf499e26259f8E2aC6FC5fE1491aBa9c2$DOGE DRj7PWEz5zxHc5ptkTBapKjCrxQU75CB6q$XRP r9LbXGJ9HCdwvAhKWJJLihSd8612xHybv7Some members of Bitcointalk may remember my previous posts here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5469588.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5441233.0If you like (or impressed by) the progress made so far, please comment below by leaving constructive feedback.  I've been part of the Bitcoin/crypto community for over 10 years.  Distributed ledger technology has never left my radar since I discovered Bitcoin back in March 2013.  The Bitcoin History Book 2008-2024 will be my contribution to legacy, as well as newbie, members of the community.Please contact me if you would like to support the book via donations, sponsorships or otherwise.  I will continue to strive towards completing the book by September 2024.Thank you for reading (don't forget to click on the Google Drive link in order to read the current book interior).  It is a draft at the moment!",

But, from what I've seen, I think the book's layout could be improved. In some parts it seems somewhat confusing. So, I would suggest, if possible, taking a less orange approach (I really like this color), and having a \"cleaner\", simpler timeline that makes reading easier. This is because, currently, you don't see the difference between the points you want to highlight and the rest.Therefore, I think I could try to improve this page layout a little, it would certainly make things even more interesting.",
