  "content": "Alik BakhshiOlaf Scholz's unforgivable blunder         The European Union will discuss the termination of the issuance of visas for Russians. The Baltic countries have already closed the border for tourists from Russia. However, not all European leaders are unanimous on this issue. So, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is against the ban on issuing visas for Russian citizens, arguing that Europe should provide an opportunity for Russians who do not agree with Putin's policy to leave the country. If this happens, then hope for democratic progress in the minds of Russian society can be abandoned for a long time.(1) None of those who left will repeat Navalny's bold and conscious act, who returned and thereby defied his killer. Putin will be extremely happy and infinitely grateful to Olaf Scholz for such a decision by the European Union. There will be no need to organize the expulsion of the dissatisfied, and this is the color of the nation, by “philosophical ships”, as the Communists did in 1922, thereby decapitating Russia and making it possible for Comrade to come to power. Stalin, who made an obedient herd of mankurts out of the people.1. The strategic mistake of the West and Europe in particular. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/73812.html   08/19/2022",

Germany is the country that helps finance the war by being the largest buyer of Russian gas and oil in Europe. They should be ashamed of themselves and their government.Quote from: BADecker on August 19, 2022, 02:13:58 AMRussia is simply playing a game.

They are using their top weapons. Ka-50, Orlan drones, SU 35 fighters, spetsnaz units, tigr light transports... These are their newest and most advanced attack units. Are you saying those generals happened to die in Ukraine because Russia wanted to lose the war and let Ukraine gain the upper hand?",

I wouldn't know, I doubt anyone does. Seems a bit unreasonable to categorically deny every Russian a European visa under the premise they're a Putin stooge. I'm unsure if this is what the EU is proposing, or whether they're proposing an extreme vetting. My research into this issue is bare. I'm okay with the latter -- in fact I think any country should employee extreme vetting when handing out visas.",

Not only that, all pro-Russian supporters must be deported from the NATO countries.NATO needs to prepare for war with Russia. Any nuclear fallout on the territory of Ukraine will be an attack on neighboring NATO countriesand will invoke Article 5.Russians who want to leave Russia can go to Georgia, Kazakhstan, UAE, Africa, or South America and ask for political asylum there.   Alas, Georgia has closed entry for Russians, and I think that's right. Let them create an internal opposition if they don't like Putin's policy, and don't throw it off at other peoples.",
