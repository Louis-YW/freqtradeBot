Well, we should not believe everything we read online, particularly those that are not coming from reputable news outlets.That said, everyone knows that CBDC is the latest initiative, it's nonnegotiable over time except if the country or region wants to take the backseat. And the main purpose is to reduce the dominance of cryptocurrencies and enhance control, tracking and accountability.",

You are being tracked now! You can just read about it if you google how FATF operates. Why do you think we have KYCs if not for control and tracking? AML needs tracking, FATF Travel rule needs tracking. Nothing new in this video is revealed. In fact CBDCs have most likely more privacy then current system. Governments can still track them even if they are ZK tech but it means that nothing but essential info will get revealed.Nothing has yet been decided and there are more then one opinion in the world how this thing should be donehttps://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/02/bank-of-england-developing-a-cbdc-that-will-respect-privacyhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/cbdcs-should-protect-privacy-not-be-a-surveillance-tool-former-cftc-chairThere are ton of research on privacy-preserving central bank digital currency.

      "body": "CBDC a side view, Op add \"controlling\" in the title of this post. I was reading the Quotes and I found many funny and angry reactions on the tweet as \"Lizards are coming for you\", \"They should be eliminated from the Power\" \"they want the Civilians to be the Slaves\" etc etc..I can assure the Digital Euro or any other CBDC will not at all affect the crypto market even in the reaction it will boost our journey because now everyone understands that financial freedom is everything. They really don't know the reaction outcomes if they know so why they are trying to tease people what's the motive behind such shit policies.another side is, Governments should not be allowed to control the medium of exchange within a country (Money). Because in the name of development, they create destruction. \"Wake to Reality\" was checking a caption on some memes and #EattheRich haha. That's the point elites can do anything for their own privileges and civilians can.",

      "body": "I smile broadly when some of the forum participants begin to \"bring to the masses\" heresy, that everyone is switching to crypto, they say CBDC will be for everyone and everywhere, crypto has won, there is no centralization and state control. I have already written many times CBDC - this is a tool for really total control and influence on people through the state and technology. Until recently, fiat was a completely safe means of payment, although not the most convenient, and I agree with my own set of shortcomings. And now, to the \"joy\" of some enthusiasts in the CBDC arena! A curtain. And now for some bitter truth about CBDC.CBDC allows:- Totally control not only your transactions, but also extremely easy to track your interactions with other people.- every CBDC cent/penny/.... is a completely state-controlled entity.- while you do not fully dispose of this essence. Your \"CBDC bills\" can be flagged (you won't know it) and if you commit an offense - ALL your funds will be BLOCKED, in an instantThis technology still has a lot of \"interesting functionality\" that will work specifically for the state, and for the state.In a word - we rejoice early. From such \"joy\" to \"burning tears\" - a very small gap",

      "body": "I mean, that's the very basic notion behind CBDCs, to control, track, and surveil people and their transactions, and to also combat cryptocurrencies in relevance. For anyone who's none the wiser when it comes to cryptocurrency, this may come as a surprise, but everyone with half a mind to realize that a coin coming from a centralized authority will be used to track and control people remotely has been made aware of its detriments a pretty long time ago. Still, despite this sounding like old news to many, this is still quite concerning. With bitcoin there was a high chance of it not becoming as relevant as it is today, but CBDCs are made to be relevant right from the get-go, and this is a planned attack to make cryptocurrencies obsolete ultimately.",

If they don't then that's a huge problem, because things like these could really happen without them realizing. A good prank, but certainly a dangerous one considering how fast the government operates. This is a dangerous game that they're playing and there's a high possibility that something is already cooking after the incident (if ever it's true).",

There's too much incentive to restrict privacy from law abiding citizens and it's directly against their interest that CBDC be anything about giving more privacy and control to citizens.
