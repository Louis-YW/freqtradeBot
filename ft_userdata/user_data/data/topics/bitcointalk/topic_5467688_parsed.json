Especially if you use BNB for trading fee and using BUSD trading pair in the derivative market. Note that BUSD will be delisted on Binance by early next year.On Bybit if you are using the spot trading, BTC/USDC trading fee is $0:Other USDC pair on Bybit are of $0 fee. Or maybe the ones that I know, but I do see $0 with USDC trading pairs on Bybit",

From bybit to Binance if you are not a high ranking VIP level member or using their tokens to reduce the fees. Quote from: Michael0410 on September 22, 2023, 08:57:30 AMIs there any good crypto platform that doesn't charge fees? The good news is that MEXC currently has the lowest trading fees perhaps due to some promotion which is definitely temporary, make full use of it before the offer ends.Spot ---> Maker: 0.000%    Taker: 0.000%Futures ---> Maker: 0.000%   Taker: 0.010%",

You can get recommendations on the list of reputable cryptocurrency exchanges here but what you can't scale through is the fee in making your transactions, there may be only little difference between them which is something not much to realize as big margin, the reason that this exchanges are for business also and they need money to maintain their own investment as well through the charges they take as fee on any transactions we perform through them, try Binance, that's my own recommendation for you.",

Pray everyone.Goodluck on your journey. Here's another tip for you. Try to avoid trading periods where the overall trading activity across the industry is high. When it's that high, exchanges usually bump up their fees to deter users from trading at that time. Do that and you should be good to go on any exchange.",

Currently, using 1 min. 5 min. would be better?I am not going to dictate on which time frame you use, mate, because all of us have different strategies for different coins. In scalp trading sometimes I use 1 minute, other times 3 minutes, 5 mins or 15 minsBut my risk reward ratio is at least more than 1.5 to avoid the trading fees eating up my potential profits.Quote2.) I am using Levarage 10x at the moment. What do you suggest? Like 1x leverag.Again, this also varies depending on how volatile the perpetual contract is. My prime focus is on the risk reward ratio gauged mostly after looking at the potential resistance and support levelsQuote from: Michael0410 on September 22, 2023, 05:45:58 PM3.) Instead of using Markets orders, it would be better to use \"Limit\" (including order price)?You can use limit orders when taking profit. In scalp trading, it's hard to use a limit order when entering a position because every second matters. So, for entry and stop loss, you can use market orders.",

If you buy or sell the coins with USDT or BTC pair, then they don’t ask for conversion fees. I am not sure about ByBit, but I have used Binance, and they don’t charge for spot Trading. If you are asking about something different OP, then mention the details where you are asked for the charges.",

Instead of using Markets orders, it would be better to use \"Limit\" (including order price)?This is not a question that you should ask. The better time for scalping is when you are making profit already . It can be 5 minutes, it can be 15 minutes or any minute. What I do not like about scalping is because traders are enticed to leverage and later if the market do not go towards the trader's opened position, it can lead to a significant loss if stop loss is not used, and stop loss is not perfect.I will always suggest 1xYou can use any order type that you like. But using limit order to close the position is better for low fee.",

You can also add 3 min time frame for scalping. And I think it's a personal reference to which of them is better win rate.Quote2.) I am using Levarage 10x at the moment. What do you suggest? Like 1x leverag.If you're SL is always getting by the price you have to adjust the size of your SL by reducing the leverage size.Quote3.)

However, if you're a scalper market orders would be the best to use",

Basically you provide liquidity and that’s why your fees are lower.",
