      "body": "I agree about being a Christian and you should be dwelling into Christian music because it uplifts your soul. About listening to music, I feel nostalgic when I hear music from the past and it reminds me of my youth and childhood. I can't stop but to reminisce those moments when life was too simple and easy going. I guess just like everyone else who has a way to escape reality, music is one of it and I feel like I'm going back in the past by listening to those songs including those that are uplifting my spirit too.",

      "body": "Well I like to listen to Classical music when I am working. I just feel it makes my brain work better, but not that it makes me any more smarter. Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach are to name a few. I use to believe in the 'mozart effect'. But now I do not think it is a real thing. This types of music just help me.",

I rest my caseTrue, I think we are drawn to listen to a particular genre of music depending on our state of emotion. If you're sad, most people just listen to even sadder songs (oh how I remember those Emo days in college LMAO). If you're at a party or just in an overall good mood, pretty sure no one would play music that's very depressing; It'll be upbeat music plus some head nodding or occasional dancing.  It's like music is a way to express your feelings, an extension of what you currently feel.For me, when I'm angry, I like to blast heavy metal or just rock songs; anything that'll drown out other noise.   \\m/",

I rest my caseYes, I also like listening to music. The music I like is Jazz, koplo and others. Listening to music can improve spirits. Especially when we're not in a good mood, playing music that makes us happy will slowly improve our mood. Listening to music can also relieve stress, music can also be a distraction and explore emotions. Plus, music can also be a means of meditation and helps the mind stay focused.",

I rest my caseMusic have a significant role to play in our lives. Some times we are the product of what we listenes to. Some music are demonically possessed and when you keep on playing them you find yourself been trapped with that music, the music doesn't make sense or has nothing to add to your life, but your love for the music is unconditional. Christians now no longer listen to Godly music. If you play a gospel music they'll next it. but if it's a worldly music dey can sing to the end that is to tell you that there is something spiritual about music.",

      "body": "For me, music calms my nerves down and it's one of my greatest antidotes to a stressful day. Of course, like most people, I have my genres of music and it is what fills up my phone space so I don't do random music that much.What I do most of the time is that depending on my mode, I can decide to listen to a particular artist for the day and I just go to my boom play and I search for the name of the artist and play his album and the vibs just goes on from there. Because I was brought up in a religious background, I don't listen to hip hop that much although I still know most of the songs I enjoy classical and country songs because they lift my soul whenever I listen to them. Talking about a particular kind of music affect effect on me isn't strange to me because based on my belief system most don'tdon't I avn the ones that uplift my soul.",

But when it comes to gospel music, I'm very selective and I listen to them when I just need a cool music.",
