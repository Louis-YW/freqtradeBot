  "content": "I need help, yesterday I tried sending bitcoin from my trust wallet to exchange but the network fee was very low, so I tried to use blue wallet which I have already imported my trust wallet seed phrase to bump the network fee of the transaction to enable the transaction go quick. But from the details of the transaction I noticed that recipients address is different from the initial address I used beginning of the transaction and I don't really know how the recipient address managed to change from the address I used at first. Till this time the transaction is still unconfirmed,  I'm looking for a way to cancel the transaction,  is it possible to cancel unconfirmed transaction?I tried to see if I could cancel it with electrum wallet but not possible.",

An option like cancelling a transaction was also shown in BlueWallet for my imported wallet.",

Check your device, i know most clipboard malware infected are desktop users particularly windows, androids and ios are rarely to get this malwares but chances are still there.",

As far as I know, trustwallet doesn't flag transactions as RBF and you shouldn't see \"bump fee\" and \"Cancel transaction\" on electrum. I don't think this has changed in the newer versions of trustwallet.Quote from: Orpichukwu on November 14, 2023, 03:36:12 PMIf you are sure that the transaction is not yet confirmed, you can replace the transaction using the same blue wallet with another transaction. You can copy the right address this time and try sending the coin out this time with a much higher fee, which could make it go faster, and the first one will be cancelled.Bluewallet doesn't allow you to the change the receiving address to any address you want when replacing the transaction with a new one.If the transaction has been flagged as RBF, bluewallet allows you to bump the fee or cancel transaction. With bumping the fee, you make the replacement transaction to the same receiving address, but with a higher fee. With canceling the transaction, you make the replacement transaction to your own address and with a higher fee.

If you imported your seed phrase in bluewallet and then made a transaction, your transaction was RBF enabled. If you make a transaction using trustwallet and then import your seed phrase in bluewallet, your transaction wouldn't be RBF enabled. There is no way to enable RBF after signing the transaction.",

If you are running your own node, you can easily broadcast such transaction. If you don't run your own node, you should try different servers on electrum or use different transaction broadcasters until one of them successfully broadcast your replacement transaction. There are many nodes that have enabled full RBF and will accept the replacement transaction even if the original one has not been flagged as RBF. Therefore, there's a good chance that the replacement transaction is included in the blockchain.",

How low is the transaction fee, exactly?Use Electrum for this;Because your only chance here is if it'll get dropped from the majority of the node's mempool together with the selected server's mempool.With that, it'll be displayed as \"local\" which you can remove manually in the right-click menu.That'll only happen if the txn's fee rate is actually \"very low\" and the average mempool size became high.Once that happen, immediately remove it and spend the same input to the correct address or your own address and set a generous transaction fee that can get mined right in the next block.Time is crucial because once it gets reaccepted by non-fullbrf nodes that dropped it due to decreasing average mempool size, your new transaction might not propagate to reach the miners.",

And since you've copied your seed phrase into 3 different wallets already, it's probably better to create a new wallet and move your funds there.",

Are you saying the transaction you see on block explorer has been made to the correct address? Anyways, avoid using trustwallet. It's close source and there is no way to know how the keys are generated. And as suggested by LoyceV above, create a new wallet and move all your fund to that.",
