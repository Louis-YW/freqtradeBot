  "content": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-critic-lagarde-son-lost-crypto\"European Central Bank (ECB) president and prominent Bitcoin critic Christine Lagarde has shared a family story about unsuccessful cryptocurrency investments, according to a report from Reuters.Lagarde told students at a town hall in Frankfurt on Nov. 24 that her son lost “almost all” of his investments in crypto assets despite persistent warnings, Reuters reported.“He ignored me royally, which is his privilege,” Lagarde reportedly declared, adding that he lost “almost all the money he had invested.”The ECB chief didn’t disclose the sum her son lost, noting that he claimed it wasn’t “a lot,” but only “about 60%” of his crypto investments. “So when I then had another talk with him about it, he reluctantly accepted that I was right,” Lagarde reportedly stated, adding:“I have, as you can tell, a very low opinion of cryptos [...] People are free to invest their money where they want, people are free to speculate as much as they want, (but) people should not be free to participate in criminally sanctioned trade and businesses.” \"https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1728111238134263961___This is funny news, but can the son of such an official go bankrupt?This article is not about losses and not about Christine Lagarde's son, but about the fact that cryptocurrencies need to be regulated even more, because this market is very dangerous, even if such investors lose money there.",

It does not really mean that Christine Lagarde's son had actually invested in cryptos and made losses. Christine was never in favor of cryptocurrency. So I am not surprised to hear such things from her. A lot of people invest in cryptos. Is everyone making losses? No! If you buy crap in the name of cryptocurrency, you will obviously loose money. If this story is true, I am sure Christine's son had invested in some memecoins which eventually pulled the plug. Shit happens! That does not mean cryptocurrency investment is bad.",

When CBDCs begin to operate en masse, it will be much easier for governments to fight cryptocurrencies. I agree that a lot of new cryptocurrency investors lose their investments not only because they buy tokens at high prices. This market has been developing for many years due to the influx of capital from inexperienced investors. But in principle, in any market, experienced investors make money at the expense of new hamsters.",
