  "content": "I know alot of us might have experienced this issue although there are al ot of causes actually ¬†but I'm just here to talk about the main cause ¬†which ¬†probably happens most times when you experience a delayed Btc transaction. ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Block size: Block in btc¬† contains sets of transctions made by users , this transactions ¬†depends ¬†on each others so don't even think about cheating ¬†it won't ¬†work ¬†lol. Miners gets the job done by solving the mathematical ¬†misery behind users pending transactions to mine a block ¬†and we all know that blocks makes up a blockchain Now let's go back to our delayed transactions. In relation to Block size, pending transactions might has filled up a block therefore, causing ¬†delay in your pending transaction for some time befor it get solved on the block. Now do research on other causes, however, you can be ¬†less worried when you ¬†a delayed transactions ¬†of your Sats or Btcs",

I checked the mempool last week and I saw the mempool getting decongested down to 2 sat/vbyte and I make 2 sat/vbyte transaction and it took less than 30 minutes to 1 hour to confirm. If the mempool is not congested, low fee transactions can be confirmed.",

You are very correct Charles.I had an 48 hour delay once. It was my first time I had experienced that using Electrum wallet. Usually I don't check the fee and it's corresponding priority fee on memepool.space. But when this happened, I reached out to one of our guys here. He directed me on how to bump the fee on the wallet. I did and increased the transaction fee to the highest priority corresponding with on memepool.space. I did and within 30mins I got my Bitcoin on my exchange wallet.",

E no be like some months ago when ordinals been bombard the Bitcoin network, come make the fees dey very high. The ordinals craze don reduce and now person fit pay 2 sat/vbyte or even 1 sat/vbyte, but sometimes the dey network dey experience some congestion. I don pay 25 sat/vbyte for a transaction about 3 weeks ago. I bin set am for 15 sat/vbyte, after like one hour, no miner been pick the transaction and I no get patience to wait any longer, so I come bump the transaction.",
