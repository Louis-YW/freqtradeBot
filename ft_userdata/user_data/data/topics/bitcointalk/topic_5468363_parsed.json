For example, this and last September (2022) has seen big volatility but in ranging conditions.- When there is a trend, aggressively following it with small stop-losses.What I face as an issue is that by seeking high-volatility, the script enters at mostly tops and bottoms of trends.To counter that, I use a 1:1 Take-Profit to Stop-Loss ratio so that the last losing trade would not do any damage.The script uses Perry Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average, ATR and ADX to seek trends and catch volatile moves.Please, give it a look and I would love to see suggestions on how to improve it. https://www.tradingview.com/script/3czV5ifO-SOFEX-Strong-Volatility-Trend-Follower-Backtesting/",
