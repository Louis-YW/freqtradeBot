It's more about decentralizing the web and we all know that many people supports decentralization. It is different to the usual web that we now which are centralized and had a lot of restrictions. Plus web 3 is too early so there are more innovations that can come on their way which can attract more users.Many cryptos are still decentralized up to this date but it was only the eth that have transferred to pos last time which makes the coin more centralized.

It's true that it is too early, I don't expect transitioning from centralized to decentralized becoming so easy. Projects are starting to realize the flaws and obstacle of becoming decentralized and see the less-decentralized way to become their safe haven for now until they found a way to become fully decentralized again. I've remember those fully decentralized exchange before and I know there are such disadvantage that's why people stop using it but I'm sure in the future there will be a decentralized exchange again. It's just that the way they implement it has flaws.",

Do you still think Web 3.0 have a future even though smart contract platforms are becoming less-decentralized? Decentralization doens't matter a lot in determining the future of WEB 3.0. As long as the blockchain can still operated with high scalability to support the operation for WEB 3.0 and it will still alive. The main focus of WEB 3.0 to build a connection between owner to its assets through used ownership just like when someone owned NFT. It's pretty much the same like blockchain if web 3.0 can be considered as a new thing that is still in experimental by so many developers. The true potential from web 3.0 is still being dig by so many parties. The future will always there. Quote from: Abiky on November 02, 2022, 02:00:38 AMWill crypto projects have to pay a heavy price to obtain decentralization when governments are as aggressive as ever towards crypto/Blockchain tech? Sometimes you need something to be true decentralized or centralized according the situation that faced before. The government may not aggresive toward the blockchain but mostly of main concerns by the government is always related with potentially of blockchain being used as a money laundering purpose. The government pays more attention to the centralized entities like CEX or any other centralized service rather than decentralization of blockchain itself.",

Unfortunately, most dApps' interfaces are hosted on centralized servers, making censorship-resistance a distant dream. Some would say that doesn't matter since smart contracts still live on the Blockchain. But when the network's consensus becomes concentrated on the hands of a few, then it would be easy enough to censor transactions linked to such smart contracts. It's only been 7 years since ETH's inception, so I'd say Web 3.0 is still in its infancy. Maybe there's still hope for this new trend after all? Just my thoughts",

On the one hand, as we saw with Eth and switch, censorship has overrun the space and decentralization is becoming more like a mith. On the other hand, it can also be used for applications that can be developed under decentralized networks rather than using the Eth network. Unfortunately, the web3 space is being mainly developed under the Eth network which in a sense is just paving the way for CBDCs to come into stage.",

Web3.0 is a huge concept and doesn't necessarily even require eth to blossom.

Thank you very much. Web 3.0 is another tool to hype the crowd.I don't believe that a project, a website that is developed by a centralized team can be actually decentralized. Even their team try to use Web 4.0, Web 5.0 or Web n.0, if it is owned and controlled by a centralized team, forget about decentralization of that one as well as be prepared for centralized censorship.The level of centralization and centralized censorship will be depended on core approach of each developer team and each co-founder team. We only can wait to see their works to assess their centralization and censorship.Think about that similar to currencies that are launched by governments and central banks. From fiat currencies to CBDCs, do we believe that CBDCs are more decentralized than fiat currencies?",

However web3 are too young right now but it's on the run. Personally think that in web3 is all about ownership of their personal data. And it link to decentralize for sure to keep assets safe. The new generation are getting smart than another one. So i do believe the revolution of Web3 & Decentralize are the near future.
