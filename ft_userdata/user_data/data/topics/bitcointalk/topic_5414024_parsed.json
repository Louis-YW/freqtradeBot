  "content": "Hey all!So I'm the founder of PNNV.com - you can read all about it in the original thread. Since PREEV was a simple BTC converter, my idea is to create cool features that people could also use as an alternative for CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.So I have made a few significant updates. - You can now search any token as long as it listed on CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko.- You can see the price on the TAB.As I'm running the project from my pocket and only spending and not making any money, I would need help from the community in bug searching and UI improvements.Thank you if you could take a minute to review my website.",

I really appreciated the modifications that were done and the dedication you are showing for this project, in addition to listening to our requests in the other topic.I know I have always something to say but I am curious to know why the list of fiat is not complete? I am aware there is almost all major fiat and known ones in there but I assume other people want to see their national currency there for conversion.The other remark is about how pertinent / accurate \"Bitcoin to US Dollar\", in top, is?I mean \"BTC/CRYPTO - FIAT converter\" or \"Cryptocurrencies converter\" or something like that will be more general and more accurate.",
