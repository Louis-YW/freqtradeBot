Because what is going to happen in the future is unknown to everyone. If the future could be known through an app or software then people would not have gained so much knowledge about investment or trading. Always be wary of those people who tell you that they have some app or software that can tell you about the future market, it's a scam. Because no one can tell which direction the market will go.  Market chart observation can be done by taking into account the experience of the candles and the current and past markets to predict which direction the market movement will take. And only experienced people can guess something like that.",

Coinmarketcap give you feature of adding multiple portfolio also. The only problem with Coinmarketcap portfolio adding is that you cannot set coin price manually but It will be set automatically with current price some other users mentioned coinstats which is also amazing one and i am using it. Its notification system is very fast . whenever any changes in btc price or tracked coins happen its give me instant notification alert.",

And only experienced people can guess something like that.I think you wrongly understand the requirement of the OP. He is not looking for an app which tell him about the future's market or predict the price of bitcoin and crypto.  He is looking for an app which he may use to track his portfolio. For example, he buy some coins and sell some coins in loss and profit. He needs an app though which the app automatically track his portfolio and at the same time tell if he is in Net profit or Net loss.There are many app for this purpose, for example Coinmarketcap , blockfolio ,CoinTracking are some commonly used for this purpose. He can try them all and see which interface suits him the best.",

I don't have this app but looking at Ledger live, it displays you your 24-hour, a week, a month, a year and even ALL of gains and losses since you've started using it. But one requirement of it is to have yourself a Ledger wallet, whether it's the old S or the new X. Either of the two will work as any of them is required for you to have a Ledger live app.",

It's better if you use an application Binance has provided, and it's safer than a third-party one.But if it's just to check the market's state, including the prices of the coins we have, you can use Coinmarketcap, CoinGecko, or Blockfolio. And I guess you can also link it to your trading account, although I don't recommend it.",
