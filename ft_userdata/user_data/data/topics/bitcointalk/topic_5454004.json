If you are thinking so, invest in Bitcoin now looks to be not a good investment decision. I can not give you financial advice for future, as I myself don't know about future, but if you think about Bitcoin future like this, don't invest in it.QuoteA good gift any parent can give to their children for their future is to enlighten their children about bitcoins so they have some knowledge about it at an early age and buy some for the children even before they can begin to get for themselves. What do you think?You can do something for your children by yourself. Work, spend less money for your expenses and have more savings which can be used to buy some bitcoins as inheritance for your children.",

It's now left for them to decide if they like to be part of the technology or they want to let it slide but you as a parent you have done your part and giving them that knowledge.",

Going by your statement, I feel the best way to do that is to start accumulating bitcoin bit by bit for your kids now why you teach them gradually how the system works. As they grow, their knowledge about bitcoin is getting vast and experience would teach them many things about it. While all these are going on, the little bitcoin you have bought for them keeps appreciating because for sure it would grow bigger than it is now by then they would have something to fall to or maybe an inheritance left for them to inherit.",

What do you think?Bitcoin investment is not for children and teaching your children about Bitcoin you are not doing any good to them. Please allow the children to learn their children things, they already got some mathematical assignments bothering them. When they are of age, they can learn Bitcoin or even any other better technology that will be invoked then. If you don't want your children to lose out of Bitcoin investment, then buy for them and store in a wallet, safety keep for them. When they are of age of handling investments, you hand it over to them, without disturbing them. That will be a better gift than bothering them with the things of bitcoin now.",

OP’s idea of teaching his kids about bitcoin isn’t bad but I would just say the education should be based on financial education and not only bitcoin. The children should know how to save, safeguard their funds and how well to spend each them. I believe knowledge like this will definitely lead some towards bitcoin not necessarily till you tell them about it. Also a parent could just open up a wallet and save some bitcoins in future for the children but all investments shouldn’t be in bitcoin only, there other store of values that it could be diversified to. More so I don’t think our children will miss out like that on bitcoin, because if we look at the halving period, although 98% of bitcoin will be mined around 2030, it will take the year 2140 before mining of it is stopped which way to long for our children not to Benefit from it, but as they say the early bird catches the morning worms.",

I'm confident that in the future, adoption of bitcoin will surpass that of it at the moment, but you shouldn't worry about our children being as successful in the cryptocurrency market right now as we were because I'm confident that they will stand to gain more from it than we did. This is because we all think that the price of bitcoin will increase from where it is at the moment and that there may be additional ways to use it and other cryptocurrencies in the future.

What do you think?Our children will have different futures, so I don't believe it's a good idea to teach them about bitcoin. This is because we can't force anyone to work in the bitcoin industry against their will, and I don't believe that a child can learn everything there is to know about bitcoin. Instead, I believe that they must first learn how to manage their finances and other essential skills. As you may already be aware, purchasing bitcoin for a child will not be a simple process. If you take family responsibility seriously and consider purchasing some bitcoin for your child, I believe that is a mistake you should not do, especially if your earning potential is low.",
