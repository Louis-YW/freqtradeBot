Op flesh and blood didn't reveal this thread to you AFAIK this came at the right time. I had my own fair share of this scam event gratefully the food Lord salvage me from falling into it based on wisdom.Sometime in August it happened that my mom had to come spend a week in my place, I still recall that faithful day was Saturday when her phone rang and she picked, the next the caller started with a cry that her daughter has had an accident and they rushed her to UPTH and as food Samaritans they have deposited  #50k out of #200k the doctor said should be deposited before they can attended to her and that the condition is critical as she's losing more blood with time and can die at any moment.Guess what! My mom screamed and started crying too. Now guess what the scammer said; that he will send my mom the account number so she can do transfer for the remaining deposit of #150k so the doctors can start treatment immediately. I immediately stepped into the phone conversation took the phone from mom spoke to the scammer that what really happened he then explained again, I told him alright we have heard and we will be on our way to the hospital but the scammer still insisted that we transfer the money before coming to the hospital so by the time we might get to the hospital the doctor would have started treating my kids sister. I said okay and ended the call.What I did was to use my own phone and dialed my sister's line her phone rang she picked greeted me and we discussed for a minute and I had to also put the phone on speaker so my mom could hear he voice and calm her mind too contrary to what the scammers had called to tell her.To cut long story short, I called back the scammers and warned them to stop such costly play that they can make someone with high BP die of shock with such devastating news, what the stupid scammer rather did was to abuse me and ended the call when he discovered I have uncovered who they really are. So I later blocked their line.  My advise to people out there when you receive similar kinda calls regarding emergencies don't be too quick to react, think outside the box and do your own consultation to verify the truth and how genuine what you're told could be.Pls let beware of scammers they are real in different forms.",

So hence, this should be a very huge lesson to all  both newbies and old members here on this forum not to forget to take precautionary measure this Christmas season whenever they notice a strange number calling.",

With the idea say battery low and the possibility say the phone got off in no time, e con dey reach out to people on the contact o. Dey attach importance to how your name dey saved on the phone.This person go call you, describe the person make you know say, e actually meet up, cook up story of how e enter one chance, con Dey drag bag with these thief people and them con shot am for leg. Say them rush am to hospital and doctor need at least half of the bill as deposit before them go commence treatment and if treatment wasn’t done in 10minutes to stabilize the person, e fit die.Omo, it was a serious matter o but, we still gats stress am. I even ask them to give doctor the phone, cries in the background and all, doctor spoke with me and from en speech, I know say, this is an uneducated idiot. I still flow with am, ask for account details, them send am with the Dr. title attached but, when you check for back, na straight up Binomial nomenclature pop out. I just play around with them till them beg me card and later, them no gree take my calls or call back.E Dey happen, make una try Dey verify with all your sense before you release your money.

Thank you for bringing this up as me self I never dey aware of this kind of scam and them no go ever reach my side, because na bad market them go see. Any person wey them call to tell you something like this, tell the scammer to call you on video call and show you the said sick person on the hospital bed so that you will be sure.",

      "body": "Scammers always believe they are brilliant and are looking for new ways to get money. It's even Christmas, and one fool is somewhere creating and engineering new ways to steal money from people. What strikes me is that they want to enjoy life but don't want to work. Not that we all want to work, but the question now is who will pay your bills if you don't work? You are responsible for yourself. And scammers aren't even scared. How will you put someone in that situation by telling them that their mother requires medical attention? That's bad just because you want to scam the person. Thank God your mother is fine and you weren't a victim, and thanks for sharing such information. That everyone is complaining about money. Like the topic we must confirm now before any action.",

      "body": "If this same scam attempt happens to your friend,  it point to one obvious assumption that the scammer me be from a close friend or someone close to you guys. The best way to handle such acam attempt is to call the person on phone to speak with them,  don't send money to strangers,  we should be smart enough,  in fact, such scam attempts are from within for them to have gotten vital information about your mum to be able to convince you to look for the money show how deep and close the scammer is,  but just as I said always verify any call or text from a family member by calling to hear from them personally by all means possible.",

      "body": "To be sincere, scammers have a high IQ. If not from this story, how can you identify that this is a scam? Hmm, a lot has been happening and is still happening. Scammers are very wise. The only solution to identifying such scams is to just be calm and think wisely. If possible, you should start asking questions about your family or asking for information about who claims to be sick, which I think might help. Though I also have such a scam story, the scammer almost got my head because when he called, he said with a friend of mine have a package to collect that has been ordered from a neighbouring country. And he put my number as an alternative, even though if they didn’t contact him, they could call me. I ask the scammer what the name of my friend is. And he called the name of the friend that we are even sitting with. I just laughed and told him to go and look for a good job or handwork that will sustain and help him feel To my greatest surprise, this scammer insisted that he was not a scammer until I told him,I am together with my friend, that he claimed to do the order. He just got off the phone immediately.So let's be wise and think before you believe in some people, especially in Naija, as everyone just hustles.",
