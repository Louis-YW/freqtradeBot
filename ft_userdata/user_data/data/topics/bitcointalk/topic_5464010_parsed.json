      "body": "We will never know whether the games created by casinos are easy to manipulate, but for some games, we can verify whether the casino is cheating or honest. The developer is not responsible for the manipulation carried out by the casino because it is beyond the developer's responsibility, especially if the game is added to a particular casino. But the developer can take precautions by warning the casino not to cheat or the casino can terminate their cooperation.And if the games are from a software provider, they shouldn't be cheating their clients because this is about the software provider's reputation. If the software provider cheats, they will not be able to grow their business any bigger because many casinos already know they are going to cheat their clients. And the casino also won't want to use the software from that provider because it's equivalent to damaging the casino's reputation.",

Some people still think that games on online casinos are from the casino teams themselves but those games are from software providers, is this valid or not.On one casino site there are quite a lot of types of bets and registered games that are offered to all gamblers and of the many choices of games or bets available, almost the majority are games made by the provider so when a problem occurs we might blame the casino but actually it's not the casino's fault and the team will also fix the game together with the provider used.After all, well-known casinos will not carry out acts of manipulation because honestly and fairly they can get a lot of profit because well-known casinos already have very large customers, providers also provide profit money to casinos so why do we still think that well-known casinos do manipulation.Actually there are games that are original to the casino, but there are only a few choices, not many, and even then I think they are better than the games provided by the provider.",

The games offered on casino platforms are often provided by third-party software providers rather than being developed by the casinos themselves. However, it depends on which games we are talking about. Many casino platforms also offer so-called \"In-house\" games, which are developed by their own development teams.Quote from: Outhue on August 21, 2023, 07:57:11 AMThe question I have in mind is, aren't the developers the ones that should be responsible for any manipulation in the games or it's still possible for the casino team and members to manipulate the game engines? Just because a game was developed by someone else doesn't mean it can't be manipulated by the casino platform. It's all just software code, after all, right? Besides, there have been proven cases of casino platforms using pirated versions of games from well-known providers.",

Because casinos focus on making money, not building gamesNow, about your question on game manipulation. Isn’t it obvious? Yes, the developers primarily handle the game mechanics. But let me spell it out for you: if a casino wanted to cheat, they’d be doing it in cahoots with the developers or by tampering with the integration of the game. These casinos aren't run by choirboysAnd for your last point: people are ignorant. Games in online casinos largely come from software providers. It's high time folks like you educated themselves instead of peddling misinformation. So, do your homework before you try to be the wise guy in the room",

I don't think there would be some manipulation going on after they got it from the software developer, because everything that's programmed in there were intact just like how they do business with the other casinos. If I were to be a software developer I don't want my brand to be known as a fraud due to an unfair games that I have developed. Therefore, I don't think the developers are to be responsible with casino manipulations or fraud, because the developers gets nothing in return if they do it, not unless if they're paid to deliberately design their game in favor with the certain casino most of the time, but then again it is the casino that wanted it and initiated it in the first place. So, everything will be the casino's responsibility.",

In many cases you never know the names of people who actually developed the casino and the games in there. It's common for visualized games like slots to be made by companies that only do that, but simple math-based games aren't usually outsourced and if they are it's just 1 person that writes the code and you don't even know who that is. Should you be concerned? I don't think so. You don't know who stands behind developing phone apps that you use, and most altcoin teams are just made up names and stock photos.",

But I am not of the opinion that all gambling is safe because some report gambling platforms have manipulated code that folds developers to change ruining fair and honest games.We don't know about the profiles of gambling developers because they are paid according to the order of the casino owners, so the casino owners are to blame if they manipulate the games. However, gamblers must be selective in choosing safe and fair gambling, especially for the top list of trusted casino platforms that have been suggested by the gambling community.",
