Here is a breakdown of the prize money in US dollarsGroup stage - 9 millionRound of !6 - 13 millionQuarter final - 17 millionFourth place - 25 millionThird place - 27 millionSecond place - 30 millionWinner - 42 million. When I looked at these numbers it got me thinking about how much awareness it would create for bitcoin if this money was paid in bitcoin to these teams. Would we ever live in that kind of world?",

But i don't think it is ever possible that the prize money for a global tournament like the the world cup can be paid in BTC. This question is similar to the popular one of 'if BTC will replace fiat', and the answer remains unchanged, BTC is a second option to fiat currency, it is not going to replace it, and the usd for now will remain the world's reserve currency and will serve purposes such as this.",

I doubt it that the FIFA will do something like this but hoping that they won't close the door that they may do this soon and as well as keep on accepting sponsorships that have been part of the crypto industry with their services, although, they're centralized exchanges but we're just extracting that bitcoin is included into those ads.",

The teams can be pretty high-level there too, but I haven't seen it on the level of national teams, which I guess makes sense.In terms of currency, it sounds like a good idea to at least give a choice of currencies to teams, given that the USD will be a foreign currency to almost all of them anyway.And while it could be good publicity and dozens of millions of dollars worth of BTC movement, it's not significant enough to make direct impact on the price. However, if publicized widely, it could boost Bitcoin popularity temporarily and lead to FOMO. Unfortunately, that's far from happening.",

And even if it happened, those teams would immediately cashout the received bitcoins into fiat, so they could avoid the volatility of the currently bearish market which has potential to depreciate the prizes more yet on short term. Also, so much money (163$ million) dropped in bitcoin market at once could lead to panic selling and more dumps in price. At first I thought you were going to ask what awareness a FIFA sponsor like Crypto.com can bring to bitcoin.",

Would we ever live in that kind of world?Football is a very popular sports, so having football rewards paid in Bitcoin will greatly bring awareness to most people especially fans of Football. It will also bring demands to the market because the Football rewarding body will have to buy BTC in order to execute the plan of paying rewards in BTC.But as much as that is an interesting stuff, I doubt Football will change its way and pay the reward in BTC.  Paying in USD is much more easier since they don't have to go to the marketplace and buy BTC.  And thinking that teams converting back their received Bitcoin in USD right after they received it makes the idea a joke.",

That move wouldn't make any sense at all, unless bitcoin completely takes over fiat and chances for that happening are realistically slim to none. I can imagine crypto related World Cup sponsor giving reward to someone in bitcoin though, for example to a winner of Golden Boot. That would be a nice bitcoin promotion.Quote from: fennic on December 11, 2022, 06:55:04 PMBy the way I think that this post should be posted in the games and Gambling section.

We've seen celebrities have to invest in cryptos and it also came with some positive results, one that portrays bitcoin to come with sme good. In our today life's, most of those whom are yet to invest in cryptos do so because they don't believe, because they are scared of loses, what the government have told them or because they wish to see some reputable individual or organisation to be involved with it, take some investment on its page and FIFA would do so much for the crypto industry if they do as proposed in OP.Most sponsorship and advertisements as we have now is yielding some good result for the companies in football. This would do great for cryptocurrencies too.",

Binance could pay Ronaldo in Bitcoin and Crypto.com could pay Lebron James in btc too. I don't know how possible this is or if the players would even agree to it but it would create recognition to bitcoin because these players have large amount of followers and would create more trust in bitcoin if people know they are into it as well.",

The USD is the only currency that can be used for the payment.Bitcoin can not be used because of the critism about bitcoin by the government of some countries, this makes bitcoin not generally accepted by the world yet. Another reason is that the countries involved in the world cup government will not accept bitcoin payment because they will also generate some profits from this fund sent to them when kept in the bank. Using bitcoin will have increased in its awareness and I know that FIFA might use bitcoin soon if the fiat currency loses its value.",

In sports, I've heard of player salaries and contracts being paid in crypto but that's only one to a few players. I can't get the source, but I've read the news around the forum.The world is not that aware of bitcoin yet and for a large organization like FIFA it is difficult to expect it to adopt bitcoin as means of payment. Even if some teams were to adopt this, then it shouldn't have anything to do with FIFA which is a large organisation. In a future we all don't know yet, a new standard could be created and bitcoin adopted as a means of payment. But for now I can't imagine it.Quote from: Alpha Marine on December 12, 2022, 08:27:58 AMBinance could pay Ronaldo in BitcoinBinance tends to use BUSD instead of bitcoin as a means of payment.
