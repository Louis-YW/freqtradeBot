  "content": "The long awaited release is upon us! Along with a complete redesign, there are a slew of new features integrated into the platform.Updates Cookie Points System The Points System is a CookieSale exclusive that lets users on our platform collect points in a designated wallet that can be used throughout our site. The points will be tethered to a USD amount. A ratio of 6:1 will be implemented, meaning for every $6 spent on our site will reward $1 in points. You can gain points via minting a token, contirbuting to a presale, creating a presales, etc. Vice versa, you can use your points for these as well. Users will also be able to purchase a whitelist for a project with their points if they're not whitelisted. Learn more on our Gitbook here.Arbitrum BlockchainWe've added the Arbitrum blockchain to our launchpad. All blockchains are now visible on the launchpad list meaning no need to switch blockchains to few different presales. We'll be launching with BNB, ETH, AVAX, MATIC, and ARB with more to come soon!UI Redesign and Backend Clean upThe frontend has been completely redesigned with a much cleaner and user-friendly interface. We've also significantly upgraded the backend to create arguably the fastest platforms in the space. Project TransparencyProject owners now have more ways to provide information and transparency to potential investors on their presale page. We've added sections on the presale page to share your team with pictures and Telegram/Discord links, upcoming events with links displayed on your presale page (such as AMAs, contests), general updates/calls to action.Automatic WhitelistsAll COOKIE holders of 50k+ tokens will be automatically listed onto presales (excluding Private Sales). These eligible token hodlers will also receive 20% extra Cookie Points when interacting with our site.
