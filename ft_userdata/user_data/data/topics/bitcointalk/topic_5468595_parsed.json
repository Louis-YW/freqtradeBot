Bitcoin is here too stay because it's the future of money I admire your passion for Bitcoin, being persistent with your coins and investments, and not being disappointed during the bear market; that's important, but I'll have to disappoint you regarding the SEC you mentioned. I'm guessing you're referring to the incident against Binance.US a few months ago, which did put a decent dent on the market. However, the lawsuit didn't include Bitcoin; it was after a large number of altcoins and tokens that were labeled as securities, which also included BNB, Ripple, Dash, and plenty of others. Bitcoin was never mentioned as a security or a liability. So yeah, the government is yet to go against Bitcoin, nor does it claim it as a security.",

One of the worst event that led to sudden drop of Bitcoin in 2022 was depegging of TerraUSD and and sudden price drop of Terra Luna due to over supply. That useless coin created fear in the minds of the investors and the rest was done by the so-called influencers who were just there to make money out of the ad revenue from YouTube and promoted fake news about crypto world. Another worse event that caused Bitcoin price to get dump was the failure of Celsius network due to bankruptcy. That company lent a lot of money to investors and suddenly when it went bankrupt the crypto-market has seen another huge dump. The final value drop of Bitcoin was done because of that so-called centralized exchange FTX which caused the Bitcoin value to go below $16k levels. People were very happy with the FTX exchange and they have deposited a lot of their Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies into the wallets of that exchange. When that exchange went bankrupt all of the users lost their money and that caused the worst fear in the crypto market. The Bitcoin enthusiasts found opportunity to accumulate more and more Bitcoin during those events and most of them are still holding their Bitcoin in hope that in 2024-2025 Bitcoin will have another ATH and then some of those enthusiasts may sell few of their Bitcoin and wait for another bull run in order to accumulate more Bitcoin.",

Bitcoin has a four year price cycle as after every bear market, it's design to increase back in valued after Bitcoin halving so if when you invest during the bear season of the market, you can be guaranteed profits in the bullish season. Bitcoin price can't stay bearish forever as the price will always find its way back up after sometime of bearishness. Quoteone of the best gift we can give to our children as inheritance is to accormulate as much Bitcoin as possible, because after now, the value will be priceless. Bitcoin is here too stay because it's the future of moneyWe're at the early stages of Bitcoin adoption and possible seeings the cheaper price one Bitcoin will be worth so now is the best time to accumulate bitcoin not just for ourselves but for our bloodline because in the future when Bitcoin will be more valuable and acceptable, it would be of great regret if we didn't Invest in Bitcoin as we missed out on a life time opportunity of profits, investing in Bitcoin will be giving in the future. Bitcoin is going to be around for a long time and will reward those who'll have patience to invest and hold.",

Certainly one of the best things that we can hand them as inheritance but it's also good if you're able to sell at the peak or high price and then buy them other fulfilling assets like land properties which they don't have to deal with such volatilities. Not really a problem if we hand them over one bitcoin or a few of them as the value grows higher over time. But as we take the risk for now, we don't know if our children will be able to handle the risk that it has. They're unlike us but who knows if they'll be able to show or inherit as well the risk management that we've got.Quote from: Kara3 on September 29, 2023, 09:41:27 PMBitcoin is here too stay because it's the future of money No doubt that it's here to stay and about being the future money, it's like one of the common beliefs that I've had when I was new but it'll change over the period of time and as years pass by. But we're on the same belief that it's certainly here to stay and not just about it as future money but as a great store of value.",

The reason why it fell to $15K was due to the FTX scandal.FTX was #2 largest exchange in terms of volume and the SBF owner was trusted by many individuals, so when it went bust, trust was lost in the community. And hence it had a huge dump to $15K. BTC and ETH held up pretty well. Look at other coins such as SOL which basically lost a significant amount of value. It wasn't a good time for crypto but we all survived.",

And the price will increase in a way that we may not have imagined It is not right to do anything by blindly believing only one should have proper knowledge and a lot of experience in trading or anything else or little knowledge will be dangerous.Although many countries and institutions have banned this currency, its progress has not stopped.Security is very important to Bitcoin as this currency is supposed to be secure and has up to now confirmed this idea.Prices have been falling since 2022, but I think it is oversupplied because of the front Maybe that's why halving is happening and everything is quiet before the big change It is wise to save for the future by looking at the past days of this system rather than judging the future by looking at the current market value as this digital currency will rule the days ahead.According to many, the value of this currency has decreased due to the war in Russia, so I think it is baseless because it did not happen only with Russia, but with the whole world.In conclusion, since Bitcoin is always struggling and will continue to struggle, it is wise to save for the future. The belief that there was in the past, now there will be in the future, and there will be in the near future will be created very soon.",

Bitcoin is an asset as well as a currency. Bitcoin has survived the worst economic conditions thus far, and if we look at the past trends, it is clear that Bitcoin bounced back stronger after a price dip. After this prolonged bear market, people are losing hope, but I think the worst is over, and now we will be going to the moon in a year or so.

Although people must have fear when their investment is going the other way round, as long as it is called an investment, even the price dropping wouldn't have given you any fear, because it is a normal thing in investment.The important thing is that, no matter how Bitcoin reduces, Bitcoin will still increase and when Bitcoin reduces, Bitcoin gives another chance to those that are not yet investors to take part in the investment, but it is for them to either take a bold step to invest or to still be scared and procrastinate.",

We know that its limited supply will make Bitcoin a rare asset and highly appealing for speculation. It's common knowledge that Bitcoin exists with the aim of replacing the centralized financial system, but is that even possible?Bitcoin has its supporters, and the USD has its supporters too. As long as the USD remains more mature, the idea of replacing it with any currency seems improbable. This is closely tied to the sovereignty and power of institutions associated with the USD.It's not a bad idea to consider Bitcoin as a legacy, but personally, I prefer to utilize the majority of my BTC while I still have control over it.",
