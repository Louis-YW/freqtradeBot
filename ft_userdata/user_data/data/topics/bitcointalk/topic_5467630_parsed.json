      "body": "I invite you to be very cautious regarding this project and its team.They make no mention in the project's creation history of their previous project: Impleum (IMPL then IMPLX).The same team created the Impleum blockchain in 2018, which was just a fork of Stratis.Later, they migrated to Blockcore, and they did the same thing.This project was disastrous from start to finish, with almost no communication, promises of dates and integrations that were never fulfilled.They eventually decided to create a new coin, IMPLX, with a migration phase to convert Impleum IMPL coins into IMPLX. During the process, IMPLX coins were pre-mined and participated in staking for years. Despite promises, the coins were NEVER burned.And then, as months passed, no more news from the developers, no responses on Discord and Telegram; the project was simply abandoned.IMPLX was never listed on any exchange.Today, they are launching a new project, Molie, and even with this project, there are some hidden aspects. For example, did you know that the Molie Chat application allows the conversion of IMPLX into MOL? This means that the millions of IMPLX coins that were never burned can be converted into MOL in complete secrecy.https://i.postimg.cc/pdzb3fgg/MOL.pngHowever, this link between Impleum and Molie is not mentioned anywhere, neither in the white paper nor in the project description nor on the official website.In short, there is a lot to say about this team, but I will finish by saying, be very careful with your money, and thoroughly research these people before investing anything with them.You can verify what I am saying by checking the BitcoinTalk project page for Impleum: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3333027.0Also, on the Github profile of the main developer of Impleum and Molie: https://github.com/shtah?tab=overview&from=2018-12-01&to=2018-12-31The Impleum Telegram page is also interesting to track the project's evolution: https://t.me/ImpleumI have saved everything related to this project, so if the website, Telegram, or Discord start disappearing magically, no worries, I have everything saved and can provide all the data concerning Impleum to anyone interested, in the context of legal action or otherwise.",
