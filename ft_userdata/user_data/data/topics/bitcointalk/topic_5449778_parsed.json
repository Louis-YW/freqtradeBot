  "content": "Greetings all.So I have had issues with my Inno T3+ 57TH. At first, I thought it was a PSU issue so I have had a new one sent to me. The issue is still the same, here is what happens upon powering it up:Power onPSU fans spin/make noiseAll 4 Miner fans start spinning for 5 seconds.All 4 Miner fans stopThis process then just repeatsI have checked the hash boards for any damage or signs of anything, but nothing.I have reseated all the cables, but still nothing.The control board shows no lights for the ETH cable or any other lights.This miner also will not show up on my browser to share logs!I'm now thinking it may be a fan issue if the miner can refuse to start if one is malfunctioning. Is this even possible as all 4 fans start to spin?My thinking is more toward the control board, this also shows no signs of damage. Any assistance will be highly appreciated!Thanks, guys. Hope you can help!",

Thanks friend!If you can't access the IP and can't detect the IP of the control board then possible that your control board is shorted or dead.If you have a multimeter to check the power terminal of this control board you can know if the controller is shorted or not.You can also check if the power from the supply to the controller is giving enough power or it might have no connection due to weak solder.",

      "body": "GM friend.So I removed all connections from the hash boards to control board, I also removed all the fans left on the ETH cable and PSU cables to the control board.The control board shows no sign of life still, I think we have found the issue!You say to check the soldering on the control board... do you mean the soldering underneath the sockets for the PSU plugs on the control board?Thanks!",

It would be easy to determine if there is power on the control board while it's connected to PSU.Or if you don't want to much hassle then replace the control board.",

      "body": "Good morning,What cable are you using for the power supply?Personally until today use a C 19 3 × 1.5 mm² 16 A power cable, however it has started to blacken and burn the electrical outlet. By educating me more deeply, by telling me that it needed 3 × 2.0 mm² of 20 A, unfortunately all the searches done on Google or even chatGPT, impossible to find one of its diameters there.Hence my question, what cable are you using?",
