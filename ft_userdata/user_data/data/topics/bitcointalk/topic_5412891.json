The budget for getting the parts needed to build the ATM is $200. Below are the items needed to set up a bill collector Bitcoin ATM.     i) ESP32 WT32-SC01 £20    ii) DG600F(S) Multi Coin Acceptor £30    iii) NV10USB+ bill acceptor (Seems to be plenty 2nd hand ones on ebay) £70    iv) Box (\"aluminum medicine box\" on amazon £30), (\"Amazon Basic Home Safe\", for more secure solution £70)    v) Screw Terminal block £1    vi) 12v power supply, best to get one with terminal block adapter (12v battery also works well, for unplugged version) £8        vii) 12v to 5v step down converter with USB £5    viii) Male/female GPIO jumpers £5Images of the parts CONSTRUCTIONWT32-SC01 PinmapTHE WIRING FOR COIN ACCEPTORThe Coin-acceptor can be purchased pre programmed with your currencies, in any case, he shared a youtube video that guides on how to train the coin acceptor. Bill Acceptor WiringIt is required for the bill acceptor be configured to your currencies and set to S10 mode, its common to buy it preconfigured. However, if you have to program, the author specified you purchase this Wire and download the Validator manager software he also provided a guide on how do it yourself. NOTE: When using the guide-PDF don't mind the programming cards they are old fashioned, focus on the host cable. Mounting in BoxFor the Aluminim Storage Box solution, holes can be cut with a sharp knife (clearly not secure, but fine for somewhere you can keep an eye on the ATM or for demoes).For the Home Safe solution, holes can be cut with angle grinder and a very thin cutter. (If you have not used an angle grinder before, don't be scared, they're cheap, easy enought to use, and very useful. Just take your time and wear safetly equipment.)He specifically use CT1 sealent/adhesive (or similar) for mounting screen, although the screen has screw points, which should prob be used for added security.Installing arduino + Libraries Install the Arduino IDE, https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/SoftwareInstall the ESP32 hardwarehttps://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#installation-instructionsHow to install Arduino ESP32https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.htmlTUTORIAL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbyYb9Yiu_kWatch tutorial careful if you need help copying the libraries folder, to your \"/Arduino/libraries\" folder (usually in OS \"Home\" directory) from this project. FULL DETAILS - https://github.com/arcbtc/fossaWHERE THE ATM CAN BE USED?It'll be of good use in a store that accepts bitcoin and as-well replace a tip pot - using the coin acceptor or bill acceptor. Can the ATM dispense FIAT?The Author assured me that it can dispense Fiat but with the use of other gizmos like acceptors with hoppersWill add to this thread any info he shares with me on DM (if he does)",

I read an article in some trade magazine early this year (it's amazing what you read in Dr's waiting rooms with no phone) but it was about vending machine bill acceptors and there is a difference between the $50 ones and the $250 ones and the $3000 ones in terms of counterfeit detection and scanning. More or less as you can guess, the $50 ones are more likely to accept counterfeit bills then then $250 ones and the $250 ones although good can still be tricked more easily then the $3000 ones.Seems kind of obvious, but until I read about it I never thought about it.It is / was apparently a BIG issue in sparsely populated places in the US where people have unattended gas pumps that take cash but were using the cheap bill collectors.People would come in and put in $1000s of cash fill up drums of gas in the back of pickups / box trucks / vans and then drive off. The station owners were out 100s and 100s of gallons of fuel and had a stack of $20 / $50 / $100 bills that you could look at and see that they were fake. Would like to say that I am over 50, been driving for 35+ years and have only seen 1 gas station that took cash though an automated thing. And that was in Las Vegas on the strip, but I guess they really do exist in a lot of places.-Dave",

I'm not sure it can be called \"operate offline\" when it needs internet connection through WiFi. Anyway, my point is WiFi usually less reliable than LAN cable or decent satellite connection.I agree: adding Ethernet to the project seems like a great idea.There are ways to do so, since it has Ethernet MAC built-in! This project explains what is needed to add Ethernet to a simple 'ESP32-Bit' dev board, but steps will be very similar for the WT32-SC01.https://sautter.com/blog/ethernet-on-esp32-using-lan8720/Quote from: ETFbitcoin on September 10, 2022, 12:02:28 PMI agree, although there's exception if you're owner of place/store which accept cryptocurrency or you attend to cryptocurrency meeting/conference.Yeah, inside your own store (even restaurant) sounds cool, as well!It would also be fun e.g. to encourage people to throw their change (coins and / or bills, also depends on geographical location) into such a machine and get some sats via Lightning.",
