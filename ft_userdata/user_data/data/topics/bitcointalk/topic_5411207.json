  "content": "I was a member of fortunejack website for years but recently they made some changes and they are becoming very strict with their KYC policy.After trying to withdraw 10 mBTC to different casino I had to wait for hours and I received email asking me to complete kyc if I want to withdraw my coins.I tried talking with Ampera Tornike but they ignore all my posts and messages in forum, and I talked with them before about some issues.Support is acting like bots and they say team randomly decides to ask people for kyc without any explanations.I know they can do whatever they want and it's justified by their terms, but ignoring and not talking with people is really low from them.Situation is worse because they started to freeze accounts from people that had verified account with passed verification:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5411165.0It's strange that this is happening in the same time so I suggest everyone to stay away from fortunejack website.With or without passing kyc you are at big risk of getting your account frozen, terminated and coins seized confiscated.I don't know where Tornike is but this new Ampera guy is a joke (it's the same guy)!If nothing changes this could ruin their reputation in forum.",

Not only \"Fortune Jack\", In any CASINO they always ask some \"KYC\". You can check their Term & Condition, it's a bullshit if they not asking a \"KYC\" unless you're playing with on-chain gambling (Dice or lottery with a smart contract)Why need to talk with other support or their team? Is clear what you need is to complete the \"KYC\", If you asking the reason they can tell you or without tell you the reason why getting a \"KYC\".However, based on my speculation/experience <<< It's just speculation.- Most people who are get \"KYC\" is from Sportbet Player or there has some abused promotion/multi-account by referring your own account. But, If you not doing abused player at-all most the reason sportbet player always have a high chance getting \"KYC\" comparing a normal gambling user like Livegames.",

Notably, most company T&C are similar and as such, an idea of the formal and the desire to play on a particular platform makes one care less of the T&C one is agreeing to. As much as it could be in there right to demand, I suppose the support should be available to communicate with its customers and clarify repeated issues.Quote from: notblox1 on August 25, 2022, 04:17:42 PMI tried talking with Ampera Tornike but they ignore all my posts and messages in forum, and I talked with them before about some issues.Support is acting like bots and they say team randomly decides to ask people for kyc without any explanations.Haven't seen this for a second time, I think it should be a matter of urgency for Fortunejack.com as it could tarnish there image on the forum. I've always known Fortunejack.com to come with a good reputation and I know this isn't something there support can't handle.Random selection of users might be in line with there policy but, this is disturbing as well as, KYC is not very welcoming amongst crypto enthusiast whom are concerned of there privacy.It would have been more better should they find users to exhibit some shady behaviour or possibly in some hack attempts rather than randomise the process as OP claims. Not like, that's what Fortunejack.com is doing anyway as, I'm not completely knowledgeable on these claims.Support should be active and sort out these issues.",

This is not 2014 or 2015 where services were not strict with KYC requirements.You've summed it all up here. There is an unstoppable trend, which I have commented on in other threads and that is to more KYC. There are still casinos that do not ask for KYC under any condition but most may require it. Information of Crypto Casinos License and KYC requirementsIn this future list, the casinos that do not require KYC in any way will practically disappear (there are almost none left) and the ones that say Yes (if needed) will become mostly Yes.Quote from: JeromeTash on August 25, 2022, 08:44:00 PMIt's fucked, but that's the trend these days.And the trend that will continue in the future. Casinos were very important in the history of Bitcoin and remain so. They also represented an important privacy space that has been shrinking and will continue to shrink.",

Did you send a PM to Tornike/ampera to ask if the email was the final word on the matter.In my opinion the common sense approach from not only FortuneJack but all casinos would be to allow users to withdraw but putting them on alert that future withdrawals would only take place if KYC was passed. That would allow members to withdraw the full amount and not go back to them if they did not want to provide KYC and that would be the fair way forward.Quote from: notblox1 on August 26, 2022, 09:22:01 AMThis is new email I received today:",
