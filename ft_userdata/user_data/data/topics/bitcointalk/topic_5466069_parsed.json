What I see in these threads is that it is a pity that there is no one left from the early years, from 2009-2012. From 2013 onwards I do remember seeing some accounts still active on the forum, but from the early years I think only theymos and I don't know if there are any others.",

      "body": "I do not know the exact answer, as I registered here in 2021. But some old members of this forum might give you the correct answer. But, after reading the threads you provided, I can at least say Yes, these threads might provide the idea of a trust system to the moderators of the forum.I found it surprising that the trust system was not there from the start, as it must have been so difficult for the members to trade with each other back then. As of today, after reviewing the trust system of the member, we can deduce that either we should trade with him or not. This indicates that the forum is still growing, and there is plenty of room for it to grow and spread its legs.",

I think there are some other users from that 2009-2012 era still active on this forum. I'm not sure about all those members but Flexystar and OgNasty are among the members from that era and they are still active on the forum. I'm not sure that how many of the old members are still active on this forum, but I'm quite sure that many of those members might visit the forum every once in a while.",
