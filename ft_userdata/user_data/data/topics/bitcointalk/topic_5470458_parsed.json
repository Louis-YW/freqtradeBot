  "content": "One of the reasons why I don't take much of the information the media feeds people during war very seriously is the high rate of propaganda that is spread.I followed up extensively on the the Russia-Ukrainnn war and because I wanted real facts I had to watch the news from different channels. When you watch the news/ information coming from the channels supporting Russia, you see how different it is from the information/ news you get from channels supporting Ukraine. This shows how majority of people have been misled because they constantly listen to information from a particular angle and there sense of judgement become disrupted because due to constant blackmail that is coursed from politically motivated media.And today the news of isreal Palestinian war is flying around so many headlines with people spreading so many fake information around the different social media platforms.As your support who you choose to support for reasons best known to you or received from channels available at your region, don't forget that most media can be very political and might feed people with wrong information just to gain pity or continue in there outrageous act.Be guided.",

The reason why they don't get peace is, their money system is tied into the control of the warmongers. If Trump succeeds enough, the people might just recognize this, and change their money system methods to NOT be under control of the warmongers.BREAKING: Learn Why Anti-Trump Judges Are Planning To Default/Find Trump Guilty Ahead Of Trialhttps://www.infowars.com/posts/breaking-learn-why-anti-trump-judges-are-planning-to-default-find-trump-guilty-ahead-of-trial/[WATCH THE VIDEO!]...",

      "body": "The most common example that comes to my mind regarding exploiting the media to carry out mass brainwashing operations by publishing false news and falsifying facts, including historical facts, is what the United States and Western countries that support the Zionist entity are doing to convince their people of the necessity of supporting Israel and that Israel is the wall of resistance. The latter faces brutal forces that want to harm them.There is no other explanation for this suspicious silence of these peoples regarding the amount of spending that their governments make for the sake of Israel. Brainwashing has succeeded even with those who join humanitarian organizations and support human rights, making them justify their double standards to evaluate what is happening from an absolutely biased angle.",

Still, every Hamas clown is not updated, that the propaganda is busted: QuoteHamas immediately blamed Tuesday’s explosion at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City on Israel and claimed more than 500 people were killed in a heinous, targeted war crime.But after an investigation and widespread protests in the Arab world, the Israel Defense Forces determined that the terror group’s Islamic Jihad arm was actually behind the disaster and had exaggerated the death toll in its attempts to frame it as an Israeli attack. ...The IDF also released aerial footage of the hospital compound filmed Wednesday morning which does not show any of the impact that would have been caused by an Israeli missile.It instead illustrates a lack of a large crater in the parking lot where the explosion occurred.We now have video of the scene showing the explosion is from the parking lot and the buildings are in tact. There is no crater, no building demolished. This is inconsistent with the type of bomb many were suggesting yesterday.Looks like the hospital wasn't even damaged much (if at all). https://nypost.com/2023/10/18/all-of-the-evidence-that-shows-hamas-was-responsible-for-hospital-explosion/The OSINT community confirmed this. So, yes, Hamas in king in propaganda: 1. Near a hopsital, Hamas tries to fire a rocket on israeli territory2. Rocket misfires and hits parking lot near own hospital3. Hamas claims Isreal did this and Hamas claims 500 people died, but no proof for it4. Pro-Hamas pawns like Kavelj22 on Bitcointalk are brainwashed and believe any Hamas propaganda instead of looking out for sufficient PROOF5. The lie from Hamas is spreading everywhere6. ProfitHamas is really king in propaganda...",
