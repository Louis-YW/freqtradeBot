He was a legend and demi-god of football and would be greatly missed. He scored 757  goals in 831 matches and he was a player that was selfless and patriotic that he was ever willing to play for Brazil even with an injury. Pele was active on social media and always used the platform to encourage, mentor, motivate and congratulate young players. His contribution to football is quite indelible because the world has not yet produced a player of his level. Regardless of the exploits of Messi and Ronaldo, Pele remains the greatest. He was also fortunate to live a very long and fulfilled life because most players of his age have died a long time ago. I extend my condolence to Brazil and his immediate family. I pray God would give them the strength to bear this great loss.Adieu the world's greatest.",

It is understandable to feel a sense of sadness and loss when a public figure or someone we admire passes away. He was an amazing player and a great man. Pele's influence extended beyond the football as well. He was a role model and ambassador for the sport, and he used his platform to promote social causes and charitable causes. He will certainly be missed by the football community and beyond. RIP",

While his health has been deteriorating, having fought cancer for the past year, it’s still a shock to hear that he has passed on. Pele is a legend in the world of football. With his impressive dribbling skills on the pitch and his record goal numbers, he brought a new and fun perspective to football. He will surely be missed but would never be forgotten as his legendary career lives on in our hearts and mind. I only wish I got to see him play. RIP Pele the greatest!",

I could remember anytime we are arguing about who is the best between Messi and C.Rinaldo based on their achievement before the world came to pass,after all argument we will finally give the respect to Pele,due to the fact the he has won three world cups.The world will not have a legend like him anymore because,these days there are too many young upcoming stars who are doing very great. Pele is a very popular man even more popular than some countries president,since football is the most popular sport in the world which don't need any resources before you start playing,just a small space and anything that can be used as football.Pele of Brazil,football will miss you.
