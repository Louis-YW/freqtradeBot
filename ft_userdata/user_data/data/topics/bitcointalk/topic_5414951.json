Data depicts that around 90% of the deposits on exchanges have been from whales.Last three months? It falled to $17600 which was a very great resistance support.All I can say now is to advice people to just buy and hold, there would likely not be much further fall below $17500, even if bitcoin price would get to that price. My advice for people that have bought before is that they should never sell in loss, they should wait because the bulls will come after the bears.  The bears of today are the bulls of tomorrow while more people will fomo and oin also.",

Whenever there is a rise or fall the 'news' tries to peg it to some particular reason that will be good for their channel, blog, article, etc, even if they have little proof that it was a reason for the price movement. Sometime ago every fall was said to be caused by Elon Musk, lol, market crashes no longer happen simultaneously with some of his fud talks, so people no longer write about him.Quote from: Avantika jaiswal on September 26, 2022, 10:45:06 AMBut I want to more about Bitcoin Stability so thats why I share this here.Bitcoin is volatile, for now. Weak hands start dumping when there is a crash, and they make it worse as time goes on, it is good anyway, winter periods like this helps to take out weak hands from the network, and in the long run with real bitcoiners, bitcoin may be more stable.Quote from: Avantika jaiswal on September 26, 2022, 10:45:06 AMPlease forgive me if I send anything wrong here.You didn't, no apologies necessary.",

We don’t need to stress out about the specific reason because the real reason why the price keeps dumping is everyone is fear and selling there Bitcoin. The price will never crash no matter is the bad news if all Bitcoin holder will never be affected by the news but since most Bitcoin traders is easy to sway, The result is very obvious and easy to manipulate.",

Without this happening there will be no buying and selling, traders that feels uncomfortable with the market are selling off their bitcoin to the whales while the whales makes the biggest decision in the market one thing for sure is that whenever the market is dip automatically it affects the following altcoin market making unbearable for them rise, therefore we can say bitcoin is the mover of the market.",

So far, the simplest explanation is that the halving is usually followed by a bull run, followed by a correction, and a bear market. 2+ years after the last halving, we are in the middle of a bear market, and now the only question is how much the price was affected by the pandemic, the war and, consequently, inflation?Quote from: philipma1957 on September 26, 2022, 02:48:31 PMEth going pos is a complete and total disaster for all crypto coinsas it directly attacks POW which is the only reason to have cryptocurrency It doesn't have to be like that, because even though a lot of people are now being tried to use the \"merge\" effect to attack POW, maybe it's only a matter of time when it turns out that POS is actually negative for that token and people realize that POW makes sense and that story about the effect on the environment is completely unfounded. For me personally, POS can be translated as \"proof of stupidity\", and Vitalik and his followers should not be considered too intelligent if they agreed to destroy in the long term everything they have built for years.",

The advice I always give is that you should try as much as possible to avoid any news that can prompt fear and make your doubt your decision to keep hodling. Your decision to hodl should be your decision to hodl and you shouldn't care much about the news.",

This is why it's regarded as an extremely volatile crypto.Key point here is that BTC continues to move forward in the long run regardless of its ups and downs. Facts!",

Buying now as it goes down just ties up your assets. The markets are going to really get bad, Brandon has F'd us big time. So as these markets tank the thing we wish bitcoin was, isn't a store of value or protection from inflation.  It's going to go down more, sell now and contribute to the down and then buy back in when your comfortable. Holding and hoping is wasting future profits. IF your in the long term awesome, buy it and set a calendar date to go look it. Watching it short term while planning long will drive you insane.Previous performance dictates future actions. \"Believing\" \"hoping\" \"wishing\" are not economic words to use.Think about selling now and jumping back in 30% lower and how much money that is down the road when it at ATH.I'm out long ago as I hit my numbers.

This will help investors to accumulate more Btc or for new investors to enter the market at a good entry price point. Bitcoin always works that way. If you have doubts on whether or not Bitcoin would still recover, then pleaser refer to the 2018 bearish moment and see how much Bitcoin have recovered in contrast with the latest ATH.",
