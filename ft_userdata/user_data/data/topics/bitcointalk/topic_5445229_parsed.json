  "content": "I am trying DESPERATELY to find a spreadsheet that calculates my gains/losses for my tax return! Please help!CoinTracker seemed like the best option but it has a glaring fault which is that it calculates the \"gains\" of the TRANSACTION FEES and doesn't give a crap about the actual TRADES! Does anyone know how to edit out the transaction fees from a .CSV file so I can spoonfeed CoinTracker with only the relevant information since it seems too stupid to actually do its job?Alternatively, does anyone have a spreadsheet which calculates FIFO gains/losses if I input the data? It must be able to be opened in LibreOffice because I use LInux! Thanks.",
