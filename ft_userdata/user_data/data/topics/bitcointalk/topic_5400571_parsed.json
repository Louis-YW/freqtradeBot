It appears that he has been removed from being a moderator and P&S does not currently have an active mod. I have noticed that BADecker often posts things that add little value to the conversation in P&S, and is not even a reply to a tangent that is off topic. I think a lot of his posts can be summed up as \"yes\" or \"no\" or something very similar.",

I hope he’s okay, I will try and ping him on the outlets we’re connected on..just to get an all good reply would be enough for me.

No dedicated moderator, theoretically global moderators, and patrollers (well and, admins) are the only ones that'll see reports there. The latter obviously only posts made by newbies that have been reported, which doesn't happen often. Probably does need a moderator, although I do believe it'll be a difficult job finding someone who's impartial enough, that they don't just delete things that seem like utter crap because they don't agree with the users opinion, but also get rid of the stuff that is just low quality. I think off topic replies probably do need to be either split to a separate thread or removed, as I have found that it tends to happen a lot.

And then there are people like BADecker and Tash who just post low quality and off topic trash which contributes absolutely nothing to any thread.We delete off topic posts and posts which add nothing in other boards. Why not P&S?I do agree somewhat, there's definitely a few cases of pretty straight forward off topic replies, or just genuinely low quality posts. Although, I do think you need someone in the P&S section that probably doesn't care all too much about politics, otherwise personal beliefs, and views can get in the way. So, maybe looking at reporters list there, determining who has accurate reports, and then whether or not they've shown any particular strong views. Normally you probably want a moderator that's somewhat involved in that community/section, but I think P&S might be where that differs from the norm. I don't know the answer really, that's theymos' headache fortunately for us, but I do tend to agree that the section probably does need a little bit more scrutiny, which I do believe theymos knows hence him creating that thread a while back for elections. I don't see the reports there, but I can just imagine the amount when users are debating, and then trying to get the other person's post removed. So, you've got that pressure from the general forum users to clean up the section, and then you've got to sift through the bad reports, which I'd have a guess it's higher than the average section.",

Do the same type of reports you make get handled in other forum boards? There is not much to report on an off-topic post - I can try to describe why a post is off topic but the mod still needs to look into the thread and understand the context, they aren't just gonna take my word for it, are they? Anyway, I tried everything, from \"off topic - not about XYZ, personal attack, link spam, etc\" to just \"off topic\", doesn't seem to make a difference. I know someone is looking at those reports because if I report \"multipost\" it gets merged quickly. Not sure why \"off topic\" doesn't get even a Bad.Quote from: Pmalek on May 29, 2022, 09:01:35 AMShare a few of those links here...I didn't want to get into details because that may derail this thread as well.Anyway, here is a thread where one user is sharing their experience in a... uhm... significant contemporary event.

None of that is reason to ban him, though.But his repeated and blatant disregard for the few rules we have is.
