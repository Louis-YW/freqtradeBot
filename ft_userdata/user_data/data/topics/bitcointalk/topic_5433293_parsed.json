Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has 3 investors including ARK Investment Management and Rothschild Investment Corporation . Google(C)The Gemini exchange made savings for clients at 8% per annum, and loaned clients' money to Genesis at a rumored 12% per annum.Grayscale is one of the greatest scams of 2022. His clients do not own the cryptocurrency, the clients own the shares of this company, which has 30 billion.This is my opinion, but tell me where is the Grayscale cryptocurrency? May the assets be pledged. And when Grayscale fails to pay its obligations in the 2nd quarter of 2023, then this company will be in big trouble. I can be wrong, but if I am right, then the market situation will be even worse. Goldman Sachs and other whales will buy all the assets of the cheap, and then there will be a new stage of growth.",

Given enough time and effort they might be able to make enough money to cover the losses and pay everyone back.Also, might be able to work on better negotiations with the people they owe. i.e. we give you 75% now and you walk or we can try to pay you back but we can't guaranty how much of it or any particular time frame. Enough people might take the buyout that it gives them even more time and money to get things done.I have see things like this work in other financial things and see it implode impressively. Lets see how this one turns out.-Dave",

They might be worried about another major downturn and want to have cash on hand to ride it out.NOT saying that this is what is happening here, but more and more you see businesses hoarding more and more cash *just in case*.There were a lot of viable business out there that could not survive the 2008 market crash and others that went out during Covid. There were profitable and doing well, but needed that cash to keep flowing. Without that they just did not have the liquidity to keep it going. So now they hoard. There are a bunch of downsides to doing that too. Once again, not saying that is what is happening here, just that it does happen.-Dave",
