Unless you just want us to make random guesses.Also, when talking about markets, you shouldn't use \"inflation\" and \"depreciate\" when talking about price increases/decreases because those can mean something else altogether.",

I believe you saw the new display BTC price displayed yesterday to reach $35k again show that a lot of things will happen next year that will make those that invested in BTC to get prepare to achieve their goal from this business. Based on the sign the market is showing in this season show, that bear season is going gradually in the market which it will surely disappear before the end of this month for the bull run to continue till 2025 to allow both short hodlers and long hodlers to take a good profits from their business.",

In addition, historically, the more we continue at $30,000, the more It was more difficult to break this barrier. This is what this chart confirms. Despite the rise in the price of Bitcoin, not many people made sales, which means that those who have Bitcoin are still waiting for a much higher price to sell what they have.The price will maintain the current situation and may rise to reach 40,000.",

Inflation and depreciation can indeed happen to Bitcoin, but the timing may be off from what you said because from what I think now Bitcoin is just about time to increase more sharply after this year ends.",

I feel we just have to play around as per market sentiment logically because usually this is how bull market begins but there is alway what if it doesn't go as per the prediction or previous cycles and what if it turns out to be a bull trap because we have seen similar stuffs in the past. I think we need to stay neutral and set up an entry and exit target derived from analysis and be ready to buy in or sell off based on targets but it's not an easy task. We also need to be aware of some imposters claiming to be experts and they just keep waiting for these moments to share their random opinion just to get more views for their channels.",

And maybe in mid-January there will be a slight decline where I think the Bitcoin price will fall back to 30K which I think is an opportunity to accumulate again, and certainly at the next halving the Bitcoin price will reach a new ATH.",

This coin have depreciate to it stop limit, that is where it can not further depreciate again.Are you talking about Inflation and Depreciation, if that's what you're talking about, for me those are two different things, speculatively these two things have never been found in the crypto market, especially Bitcoin, The biggest inflation factor occurs in goods, not Bitcoin, and as far as I know, depreciation refers more to the countdown of assets, whether it's crypto or other currency values, which leads to a decline.So I speculate that next January the increase in cryptocurrencies will be a little slower, even though we know that in the future the halving will occur, but there are other factors that influence this, superpower countries are currently in turmoil and war, that could have a bad impact on Bitcoin's growth, it's different when turmoil occurs in countries that aren't superpowers, I've never seen a halving happen but crypto assets don't move, could it be that this happens......caused by certain factors.From my observations and speculation, for 2024, the crypto market will not be good, but whatever happens now, I hope next January the crypto market can be better than 2021.",

Hopefully it’s in the up direction and not down and hopefully it’s due to the approved etf.Of course it is possible, but only time will tell. Bitcoin is still having trouble breaking the $36k resistance so far even though we have had several attempts at it. $36k is the resistance that will determine whether bitcoin can break $40k in November or we will have to wait longer to get there. November is certainly expected to be better than October, but prices are trending sideways between $34k to $35k.Quote from: adaseb on November 05, 2023, 05:52:48 AMIn December usually not much happens in crypto or some markets because of the holidays.I hope so too, but something different can also be expected. A correction could still occur during November and the end of the year, but people are already optimistic that we will continue this bullishness until the 2024 halving.",

However, just like the rest of us, we have our own wild and educated guess. And I think the best scenario that everyone is hoping is that we want to see the price going into the positive direction, i.e. price around the $40k-$50k that time.Not really sure what you mean by inflation and depreciation, yeah, terms could have the same meaning here, but in crypto we seldom used that term. But in any case, if the majority is looking for a increased at the start of next year, then obviously, we want to make profits short term and in order to do that, we should continue to accumulate at this price and hopefully our prediction will hit to squeeze some profits in January it you are that kind of a trader/speculator.",

The last quarter of the year are obviously the best months of the year since bitcoin will experience more positive position in the market compared to the other months. However, this will also greatly depend on the factors that may affect the market and bitcoin. And since we are expecting two big events early by next year, then most probably we will witness a price correction that will set bitcoin price into another level, or maybe a short price decline before the massive price increase sets to happen.All these will remain assumptions until proven when we cross the bridge by that time.  So let's just wait and see.",
