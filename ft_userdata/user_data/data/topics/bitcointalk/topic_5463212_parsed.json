Most of his posts are related to Bitcoin discussion which making more clear that this user wanted to shill Jambler mixer.Op did a great job and I will recommend keep an eye on this user. It will be interesting to see which signature he wear after become Junior member. If he promote in signature then it will be clear 100% that he is promoter of mixer. So far we can only make expectations from his behaviors and profile backlink .",

Does this shows he instantly learned and got to know everything before going to bitcoin.com to make his withdrawal.
