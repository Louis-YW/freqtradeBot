This is the reason today we are discussing the question mentioned above. If Satoshi is out there, he must be sadden to see what we have done with the bitcoin. Anyway, yes there will be consequences to bitcoin if Binance do something like that. Not just it will fall but market will also cause unprecedented events in the crypto space. Binance alone does 5.5% BTC/USDT per day volume. That’s around $500,000,000 in 24 hours. Definitely it’s gonna have adverse effect.",

      "body": "In the case binance shut down for any reason, we will probably see a (temporary) drop in bitcoin price and a much bigger drop in altcoin's price due to panic selling. Bitcoin will surely recover after a while. Bitcoin has been around since 2009 while binance was launched in 2017. If binance shuts down, bitcoin will be still the most secure decentralized payment system and we will be still able to make peer to peer transaction without relying on any third party. Bitcoin is valuable due to its advantages like decentralization. Bitcoin isn't valuable just because people can trade it on binance. If binance shut down, many of altcoins won't survive, since they have value just because they have been listed on binance. But as I said, I don't think it will have any long term effect on bitcoin.",

Many investigations will go on and people will start complaining about the security of the Bitcoins, hence Bitcoins price will be affected by a lot. But this will only happen for a temporary period, as when the demand will increase again, the price will come back to normal. Currently to get less impact from these type of scams, don’t store your coins in exchanges when you are not selling or buying.",

As I personally believe Binance more than any exchange and that case might be with you. So I was saying that If Binance flee away like FTX than what will happen. As Binance currently holds more than 60 billions of dollars and that's to much money. And I cannot believe if all money might gone than Bitcoin might come to 10000 dollars. Let's hope for good and what are your thoughts in this. I believe that Binance won't become like FTX anytime soon because it is the most trustworthy platform for many users. I am aware that news reporters and some governments are taking steps to control the rapid growth of Binance, but that does not imply that Binance will mistreat its users like FTX did. The thought of Binance shutting down is unimaginable for me. Unfortunately, if that ever occurs, then the crypto industry will lose many users, and millions will abandon cryptos entirely. The value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will decline significantly. Binance currently holds the top position as the exchange platform for crypto users. In case of any such disaster in the future, the crypto world will undergo significant changes.",

      "body": "I also think bitcoin will recover and go back to normal after some time. This is because, most people’s doubt/distrust will center around centralized exchanges and not bitcoin. The situation should be pretty easy to understand, you lost your coins because the exchange you’re using fucked up not because bitcoin is at fault. People who just entered the bitcoin market may leave but I'm not expecting those that have been watching bitcoin for years to do so as well - especially those that have witnessed exchange hacks.The silver lining in all of that is we can expect this to create a way bigger distrust against centralized exchanges than it did back then. Although my gut tells me most people will just move to another centralized exchange once things gets comfortable again. I’m expecting a portion of them to slowly test the waters with non-custodial exchanges or true dexes and/or perhaps be cautious with how they use CEXes.",

Currently they are still experiencing some ongoing challenges like the CFTC lawsuit, as well as from Moscowitz Law Firm & Boies Schiller Flexner respectively where it also involves 3 influencers who were being faced with a 1 billion USD class action lawsuit in which BNB was an \"unregistered\" security. If it happens, not only that the market will temporarily tank, but it would heavily affect most of the crypto friendly countries where Binance P2P is their main option for fiat to crypto transactions. As a result, we have limited options on how we can continue the P2P transactions like what Binance do.",

Of course it's not expected, but it's always possible to have a centralized exchange fail eventually so it should be considered a risk.I believe in binance to some extent, especially when it comes to my budget. This means that not 100% trusting a centralized exchange is a wise decision so anyone should be aware that any centralized exchange is not the safest place to store assets.

Even FTX, which is incomparable with Binance, managed to dent the market for a decent amount of time; just imagine what would happen with Binance.Personally, I believe that cryptocurrencies would suffer tremendously, and trust would be lost forever.

As the crypto market turned downish after the ftx exchanger crash, of course Binance will be more affected if something like this happens. However, regardless of the impact, the market will recover over time and Binance place will be replaced by another exchange. I did not talk about how much the price of Bitcoin will come, because no one can say anything with a guarantee about the market.

This like the same other result where exchange collapsed due to some big issues happened to them the market will possibly get affected and heavy rumors will spread which contribute to the decision making to dump their holdings. We know binance is the top exchange exchange as of this moment so most provably it can cause major breakdown to the price of bitcoin and altcoin. We see the same like situation happen so I guess that will be the same condition we might see if we can see it to happen.",

This is correct and sums up the whole problem. The problem is that we are slowly moving towards centralization because we have abandoned the basic principles on which Bitcoin was built.Therefore, personally, I do not hope that Binance will collapse, but its collapse may have something positive in terms of moving away from centralization. Without centralization, there would be no fear now of the collapse of Binance.This is what we have to do, we have to think how We are back to decentralization again.",

Because according to statistics it is the most used finance in developed and developing countries, this exchange is most rusted among developing countries like mine, because we have no option to approve our KYC on many exchanges but we can do that on Binance without any problem, So if a thing goes not good for Binance then all of them will face trouble, and the trading volume will decrease which result in a big dump in BTC.  CZ is a clever person he is an experienced one and knows the tricks to remain under the shadow of agencies while functioning. When SEC accuse CZ and Binance of manipulating the market he firmly replied and mentioned his policies and said we were not expecting it from you, like we have co-operated a lot. This also indicates he could make deals with authorities and other agencies to get things to work out as a lot of going on in Binance right now.
