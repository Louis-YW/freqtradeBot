      "body": "Looks like bitcoin is moving into a different version of investing. Maybe this is similar to the concept of calculating the total financial fiat money which has M1, M2, M3 and M4 specifications. The original amount of fiat money is M1, while the calculation of M2, M3 and M4 is the amount of fiat money + assets that are not fiat money but have financial value. Honestly I'm not an expert, maybe someone can correct it. If a bitcoin ETF is realized then bitcoin M1 is 21,000,000 btc, while bitcoin M2 is 21 million + bitcoin ETF (maybe 21 million too)Although bitcoin ETFs are shadows of bitcoin or not real bitcoin, with the advent of bitcoin ETFs, more and more people can invest in bitcoins, and can even invest in bitcoins without going through a crypto exchange. I think that the more people invest in bitcoin, the higher the price will be, and besides, real bitcoin cannot be replaced.",

As per my understanding these ETFs would bring in regulation around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. There have been attempts in the to get Bitcoin ETF approved but we're declined by the SEC. This time it is being done using big financial institution and hopefully it should get approved this time. Buying Bitcoin through ETF is just like buying Bitcoin. When we buy on an exchange we the transaction happens between the user and the exchange. In case of ETF it will be the user the ETF provider and the exchange. This is my understanding and I may be incorrect.",

It is obvious that if someone buys BTC in large quantities the price will go up.If I understand your correctly, spot ETF bitcoin means an organization will buy bitcoin on your behalf, which can be through the stock market, making more people to be able to buy bitcoin but indirectly. The more people buy spot ETF bitcoin, the more the price of bitcoin will increase. That is great, it is very different from future ETF. It is just like the GBTC from Grayscale, but better because more people prefer spot ETF in stock market.Quote from: Lucius on July 05, 2023, 10:27:10 AMI can also claim that everyone who bought BTC through CEX and keeps it there actually bought nothing but an empty promise that the number representing the amount of BTC they bought is correct, although the numbers on the screen are one thing, and the actual state of the funds is something completely different.Why should someone use CEX to store bitcoin. That is not good and the people doing that are putting their money at risk like what happened to FTX users and users of many other hacked exchanges. Bitcoin ETF will be better, it will help in bitcoin adoption. But I can not go beyond having my coins on noncustodial wallets,Â  having the real bitcoin directly.",

I think that would be closer to real adoption than ETFs.Quote from: _act_ on July 05, 2023, 11:11:39 AMWhy should someone use CEX to store bitcoin.

I hope you realize what happened after SEC announced and published a list of altcoins that are security and how many US exchanges were delisting them to avoid further lawsuits and fines, and not just that, the security concerns that comes with Bitcoin is what these people are trying to protect from their opinion and this is why some retail investors prefer to have Bitcoin ETF rather than just the traditional bitcoin. Over the years, the Security Exchange Commission has given out ETFs to some retail and institutional investors but the reason why this particular one is trending was that Blackrock was the one that apply and they are one of the biggest companies with so much liquidity.Buying Bitcoin doesn't really change the concept and its impact, what drives the price is the person and the kind of institutional investors that want to start Bitcoin ETF, take a look at Blackrock for example, they are worth $104 billion today and in the past, the CEO is well known for bashing Bitcoin but all of sudden, he became interested in Bitcoin, these are the kind of things that drive the price of Bitcoin and we also saw a decline in its price 2 days ago when it was rejected by SEC and they refilled and sent again.
