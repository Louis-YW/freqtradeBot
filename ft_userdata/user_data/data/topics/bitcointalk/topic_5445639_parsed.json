It is a bad and painful thing that we the Nigerians voice can't be heard again, our opinion doesn't matter no more. Whatever they do, i still believe in Nigeria and will be proud of it. One day God almighty will bring us a leader who will listen to our opinion and our votes will count.",

      "body": "The way things are currently going, many people are beginning to lose faith in INEC, and the numbers that were reported for the presidential election were different from the numbers that responded during the governorship election. The numbers have decreased so much that it has had an impact on the results, and it is only a matter of time before people will go to any lengths to ensure that their candidates win. Seriously, INEC is too corrupt to even override the interest of the people.",
