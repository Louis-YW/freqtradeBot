Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency, is an Incredible addition to this history.The barter system didn't use money. From the word, absolutely.Why did “your” history of the evolution of money stop at paper money? What about electronic ones, those used in online banking and bank cards, applepay and so on?What era are we living in? Crypto currencies? Go to the nearest burger shop and try to pay for your purchase with crypto currencies.For some reason, only a few users “downloaded” the incredible “addon addition” to this history.

It was known that people back then had hierarchies of relevance and power, and people are compensated well enough for the work that they put in service of that powerful entity. So while barter was used definitely, it was not the progenitor of commerce and economy. It was money that started it all. But I digress, the point of the topic is how things have gone from simplistic trade mechanisms to the very convoluted economic paradigm that we now have. I say it's for the greater good as more complex means more people are able to enjoy its benefits (at least on paper), especially when we consider bitcoin's existence in this entire ensemble.",

We are leaving in an advance world now where everything is going digital. I will say Bitcoin is the solution to the financial sector, it is interesting to know how progressives the world has evolved to, we now sit from the comfort of out to run business and even do transactions, have auto pilot cars etc…   Bitcoin has made a name for its self and will be hard to suppress, soon it will be going mainstream and it will gain adoption in every country. Some big restaurants and hotels now receive payments with Bitcoin. The decentralized payment method makes it even promising cause not every one likes the idea of the government having tap of their money. Bitcoin will be the new big thing and when finally adopted, it will better the standard of living to an extent. Despite  some government restrictions on Bitcoin, it still as it stands because of  it’s acceptance to the world.",

Bitcoin is a big vision and a form of resistance to the centralized fiat system and criticism of fiat money which is always printed continuously.In my opinion, Bitcoin can be termed as an alternative or 'successor' to the fiat currency in some sense. For instance, Bitcoin has a completely different currency value which place the currency ahead of every other fiat currencies by a large difference gap. When the fiat emanated, it also came with it's own value as different dro that of the former. I can say Bitcoin looks even more spectacular since it value is strong a enough to hold the taste of time (like the gold which is still one of the most valued gemstones - currencies - in the world for centuries). Second of it is that, despite the advent of the fiat currencies (paper money), it didn't take out the former currency away, it instead worked side by side until the world understood the full potentials and bigger advantages of it before they don't the former for the latter. Same thing is being applied here. We will continue to use the fiat currencies until people are able to gain a full understanding of how the system works before they will begin to finally dump the fiat for the digital currency.QuoteBitcoin was not just born, but before the birth of bitcoin there were already groups that criticized the fiat system and wanted a new system that was decentralized and where ownership was in the hands of the community themselves and no one could intervene. This community is called cyberpunk. Bitcoin has high value because bitcoin is a symbol of freedomBitcoin was just born, recently, which is true. But the purpose why it came into existence can be similar to the emanation of the fiat currencies. When people begin to lose interest in the status quo and begin to see an alternative in the new currency, the world will begin to accept the new changes. The truth is, they will continue to work side-by-side until the fiat currency fades away gradually. And yes. Because Bitcoin is a decentralized market has further given a milestone development in the financial sector. Only that the government will try to fight it's existence as they may see it as a generational freedom since everybody is a stakeholder in the value creation of the currency.",

The need for a secure, borderless, decentralized form of money becomes increasingly evident as the world becomes more interconnected and digital. Bitcoin is the future of finance as it is become more mature and gain broader acceptance.Bitcoin indeed has so many advantages over fiat and CBDCs because it is decentralised and promotes privacy but there is still much work to be done to make it a globally acceptable currency. Currently, bitcoin is mostly used as an investment because of its volatility and this has discouraged many people from using it as a currency. Until bitcoin price becomes more stable, I doubt if it will be able to gain wider acceptance as a means of payment of goods and services. Until this stability happens bitcoin will always be an alternative form of payment. But I also believe that Bitcoin is the future of finance because it will become less volatile in the future but I don't know when this will happen.

I don't think there will ever be a quick-fix solution to the use of Bitcoin to engage in criminal activities. Money will always be used for good and evil. The use of money for evil shouldn't be an excuse to stop people from using it for legitimate purposes.",

Bitcoin is the future of finance as it is become more mature and gain broader acceptance.Bitcoin is already getting the mass spread all over the world but the adoption is still limited since not up to five countries have accepted the use for legal transactions. Those that accepts the use have also placed some regulations and restrictions on it which makes it difficult for users to access or enjoy the use of it. After Bitcoin, which was proposed as an alternative to fiat currency, the introduction of CBDC is also paramount to the government to serve as a competition to the decentralized digital currency in which CBDC is centralized. CBDC could be the next successor of fiat but bitcoin still remains the best option for digital currency to be adopted.Quote from: yazher on October 16, 2023, 05:16:15 PM If only people could create detectors to determine those people who are using bitcoins for their illegal activities such as drugs and other illegal kinds of stuff, we might have already seen it happen in the past because there would be no more problems after that.If those detectors are created, won’t it sabotage the essence of decentralization and anonymity?Before bitcoin, they’ve been case of theft in the monetary sector. Those using bitcoin for illegal activity is just to tarnish the name of it. But do you know that funds can still be traced through bitcoin transactions and freeze if legal documents are provided to prove the accused guilty of that. I don’t know how the recovery process will be, which I think is impossible unless there is an identity of personal information linked to the accused that they can easily trace him and make him return the money.",

Another would be problem of bitcoin acceptance is probably the banks, they're not a fan of change and so they're definitely going to try to influence the new generation of politicians.",
