It will also depend on how lucky you actually are in the business. Those who use under the table techniques will always be haunted by bad luck and it will bite them right where it hurts, causing their businesses to crumble. Pretty sure not only successful business does this; also, small businesses trying to survive in a dog-eat-dog world. In gambling, well technically the roots of successful gambling houses even back in the day is tainted with blood, so it's no surprise if they are still doing the same things up until today.",

Most casinos are pretty open about the fact that they make lots of money, and some of them even clearly display odds so that players aren’t misled about the possibilities. I guess their secrets would be things like no clocks and exits that take you through a maze to get out of the casino, but even those are fairly well known.",

Well what we know is that there are successful business who just buy their competition or at least offer them money, and in business parlance this is acquisition or merger.Not sure if this is a dark secret from successful business or entities.I guess everyone who has ambitions might resort to some \"dark secrets\", but maybe it will remain secrets though, unless someone close to them reveal it to the public.",

In gambling as well, you don't have to get into voodoo to become a successful gambler, we all have our different luck, and they come at different times, all that is required is patient and consistency in gambling, and one day, it might be your lucky day and you end up winning a life changing amount of money.I know some people who made quite large sums of money without getting involved in any shady or dark stuff.",

This is business as usual.If someone is smart enough to create a successful business then it is his right to enjoy the benefits.I am not understanding well your point but let me make you a point,Robert Kyosaki the author of \"Rich dad,poor dad\" book tells us a very great \"secret\" in his book,we should borrow money in time of crisis,buy real estate during such time and once the crisis has ended as it will not last forever,sell for a profit,I know it sounds easy like I put it down but it is much more difficult than that.Anyway there is a golden lesson here which is money is made from money you borrow and the best time to borrow is at a crisis.In gambling though there are no dark secrets,the house always wins,you try to be a lucky person from the thousand persons that play in the casino and you hope that you hit a great win,that's it.",

These secrets are hidden from the populace and can only be unveiled to cartels or cult members. While some of these trade secrets are accessible by all and can be discovered in books, the internet, or through mentorship.Currently, most business owners are ruthless and don't care about the impact of their unethical business conducts. They can bribe the government and other organizations to get what they want even to the detriment of the common man. Most businesses don't abide by the law of the land because no agency will sanction them because of their political connections.But this doesn't mean that there is no good business owner that abides by the laws of the land. A well-managed business will always satisfy the needs of its customers and also maximize profit. So many gambling firms are doing well because they have good managers.",

But I don't think it's secret though, it's up in the open and we all know that casino is a booming business because of us gamblers.

This businessman and influencer made great money from being a scam in my opinion. He was able to fool many people by talking about nonsense things such as \"the matrix\" or some people controlling the world. People got obsessed and started doing the same as him and supporting him. He even created a course and started selling it for $49 with a monthly membership. The problem is that thousands of people bought the course, which didn't have any content or meaning. In the end of his story and just lately the police found out about his side hustle of human trafficking.The whole point of this is that every business you start is a risk and a bet. You may win or lose. Some people work hard for success, while others do whatever it takes, even if it involves illegal activities. However, betting was never a way to get successful or rich.",
