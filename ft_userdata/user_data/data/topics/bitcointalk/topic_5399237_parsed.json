  "content": "Blocknewsmedia.com was created as a blog to showcase some of the spaces news sources, and then I wanted to enable folks to create their own non fungible articles (NFA's, think of non fungible token but as articles)Should you be interested in trying it out and creating your own \"NFA\" check it out at blocknewsmedia.us and referring others socially if you would .It uses $matic for fee and is written on the Polygon chain. Metamask works for as the web3 socket for all this.The minting fees are some of the lowest in the industry, compared to like opensea and others.Source code https://github.com/myeportal/BNMI also created and did an airdrop of XRPL tokens $BNM, all visible and blackholed the address so that i could accept xrp for payment in advertising on the .com side, but havent had the time to properly get that set correctly. Also, need to allocate more space on the root, but the .com side you can simply click on the category, and the news feeds are displayed, so even though this current glitch is showing a 404, its fine, just drill down.Simply choose an image, title, category, up to 512 characters, and a name if you choose!I'm looking for folks to really use the system and generate good content onchain, and relay some feedback. I've created a few simple testing few months ago, but covid and busyness in general have limited my dev on this project.There is a small royalty payment, with a very small % fee paid to me for the upfront dev costs, but its miniscule compared to standards ive seen across the industry to date.FYI- you also are able to either transfer (fee inclusive-zero exchange cost), as well as sell your rights of the NFA content. This i would think is a plus for the future, as more and more content will want to be retained by authors and journalists around the globe, instead of handing over creative content to big C's.Look forward to opinions on this project and a continued strive forward to decentralize content online. Thank you for visiting and using in advance*special thanks to lukasknutti for doing the coding for me.BNM",
