I have 10+ years old Reddit account with 2800+ karma, I can post whenever you want. Currently, I do not use Discord (I am not sure why you insist on them here) it's complicated since I am changing all my devices but forgot the Discord password.",

I have 200+ karma and I know that's quite low because I have not been using my reddit account for so long. I want to know more about this task, is this also for the long term? or just a typical one task and get paid job? I tried to message you on discord but I can't.",
