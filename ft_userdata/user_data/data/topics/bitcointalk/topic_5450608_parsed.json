  "content": "I am aware, that this question was repeatedly raised, but since nothing in this regard, unfortunately, is not changing, I want to once again appeal to the administrators with a request to create a separate Ukrainian branch with its child boards, moderators and so on like many other languages/locations have. There are quite a lot of Ukrainian-speaking users on the forum, there is not enough general topic for discussion of issues, it is not active precisely because it is inconvenient to search for information there due to the fact that it is fast flowing. The demand for a separate board has existed for a long time, and there are enough reasons for its creation. I will be grateful to the administrators for considering this issue, and to the other members, especially the Ukrainian-speaking ones, for supporting and spreading this idea.UPD: I am grateful to everyone for suggestions and advice. I understand that creating a separate board is a matter heavily dependent on user activity. From what I see on our local thread, the members are interested in creating one. I will try to involve more users in discussing various issues in the local thread and explain to them the need to be active there in order to realise the desire to get a separate board.",

There’s only few users actively posting on your local thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=236982.5620 and that’s not enough to consider having a local board if your local thread is not yet crowded. Pakistan local board is more active than yours but still they haven’t get the local board that they are requesting. Encourage every user on your thread to become active on discussion like what Nigeria did to have their local board.",

Speaking and supporting of a new board in English in Meta but not cooperating to show activity in Укpaїнcькa (Ukrainian) topic doesn't have sense. I guess if there is a real need of Ukrainian section then you probably should cooperate with others who desire it and to spend some time in developing an existing topic so everyone will see that it is what is really demanded. When everyone will see that there is not just one post a week or a month but multiple posts a day then probably there will be a reason for admin to open a section in Ukrainian. And just supporting here in English will hardly lead to that. IMO.When I look at the Ukrainian topic at the moment there is mostly political content and scammers in there, mostly no bitcoin discussion. I guess it is one of reasons why mostly no one is talking in there.",

While I sympathise with their struggle and I can imagine what they are going through as my country went through similar thing ~30 years ago, no one is forcing anyone to be active in Russian local board. So, if they want their own local board, the least they can do is to actually be active in their local thread and if we learned anything when it comes to creating local boards is that theymos won't create new unless there is a real need for one. ~60 posts written in the last year or so shows that they are not really interested so why should forum staff bother?",

It's normal for Ukrainians to want their own local board. But the issue to be looked at here is how active the local thread is. Before Ukraine, there are very active local threads such as Pakistan and Vietnam. It's pointless to wait for such a board to be opened for Ukraine before they have their own local boards. The Ukrainian thread is not even active as far as I can see. It seems impossible to get your own board unless suddenly hundreds of Ukrainians register on the forum and keep the topic active.",

It's unfair.I don't think that you are looking at things neutrally or objectively if you think that its unfair for Ukrainians not to have their own local board while Nigerians do because getting a local board is much more than about which language has been used.What you forgot to mention is that Nigerians got their local board by being consistently active for several years.

So it's better to keep your local thread active.You should also keep in mind that there are some good and active threads from other countries who want their local board.

I visited the Ukrainian thread and I discovered that it is not very active. I have also seen some countries that have local boards that look like a waste of space in the forum because these boards are practically dormant. I also discovered that the Ukrainian board was even more active last year than this year. I am guessing that the war might have contributed to it because many citizens have been destabilized. Your appeal will be strong if the thread activity increase and you mobilize more support for this request. Wishing you peace in your land and success in your request.

Neutrally said, if language is a main factor to create a local board, Nigerian local board should not be created as I see. I agree with you that two biggest factors are: demand and intensity of local activities. The latter one seems to be weak at the moment but they can improve it.",

Having Ukrainian participating actively in Russia local board eliminates any need to create a Ukraine owned local board. Like what is the possibility that if given the board at this moment that almost all Ukrainians actively participating in Russia board instead of your local thread would wanna resort to using the local board when currently they aren't showing convincing participation in your local thread but rather flooding that of Russia. Have you considered the activeness of Pakistans in their local thread and others compared to that of Ukraine but are yet to have a local child board of theirs.Am not against anyone requesting for a local board but from your statement it's obvious your idea was borne out due to the ongoing war between the two warring countries. And we're hopeful this war is going to end very soon for normalcy to take it's course. But then the war shouldn't be a locus point why you should be demanding a local board of yours. When the timing is ripe am sure @Theymos in his discretion would definitely see to it's ratification.",
