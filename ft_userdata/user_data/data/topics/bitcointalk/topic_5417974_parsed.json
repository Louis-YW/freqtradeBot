  "content": "Alik BakhshiThe fiasco of President Obama        Of all the speakers who spoke from the rostrum of the 70th anniversary session of the UN General Assembly, I would single out three, namely Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu as leaders of states conducting military operations on the territories of other countries and thereby responsible for the political climate on the planet . It is important to note that the speech of each of them contained one noteworthy moment.   So Netanyahu, speaking from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly, did not amuse the audience with a drawing of the Iranian atomic bomb. This time, he began to accuse everyone and everything of all mortal sins against Israel, while forgetting that Israel holds the record for the number of accusatory UN resolutions. Regarding the conflict with the Palestinians, Netanyahu, a known political liar (1), repeated his usual lies about Israel's sincere desire for peace and the implementation of the slogan \"two states for two peoples\", placing all the blame on Mahmoud Abbas, who refuses to continue the record according to the terms of the negotiations. Netanyahu did not say that in all 25 years of fruitless negotiations, Israel practically did not stop the seizure of land through the construction of Jewish settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory (2).     Another ten years of such negotiations, and the issue will be closed due to the absence of an object of negotiations. It is for this outcome that Netanyahu needs constant endless negotiations.   For a quarter of a century of these negotiations, they have not moved a single step towards the final result, that is, the creation of a Palestinian state. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the main factor destabilizing the entire Middle East region. Under the auspices of Washington, Israel, feeling impunity, is pursuing a policy of apartheid against the Palestinian Arabs. The permanent war led to the emergence of al-Qaeda, an organization that set itself the goal of a military struggle for the rights of the Palestinian people. As a result, the war crossed the ocean. The then President of America, George W. Bush, instead of treating the disease itself, that is, to solve the Palestinian issue, began to treat its symptoms. America behaved like an elephant in a china shop: it launched a war in Afghanistan, which was up to the Palestinian problem like a light bulb, then it was Iraq's turn, under the far-fetched pretext of eliminating the chemical weapons allegedly possessed by Saddam Hussein. It must be said that the destruction of Iraq as a state, and you can’t call it otherwise, is the apogee of the stupidity of Bush Jr., who naively decided to bring democracy on the bayonets of marines to a people who do not understand its value. It's like bringing a roasted pig into the house of a believing Jew as a delicacy. Barack Obama had the difficult task of correcting the political mistakes of a man who happened to be in the presidency of America, and even for two whole terms.    Obama set the task of withdrawing American soldiers from the Middle East region, but it was not there, Netanyahu wants to drag America into a new war, now with Iran, using the powerful influence of the Jewish lobby in Congress. The rationale is simple, it is to Israel's advantage that America constantly conducts military operations in the region, leaving in the shadow its quiet strangulation of the Palestinian Arabs.    The most interesting thing is that the confrontation between Iran and Israel is just pure rhetoric. The atomic baton in the hands of Tehran poses a danger primarily not to Israel, as Tel Aviv wants to convince the international community, but to the countries directly surrounding it. The verbal skirmish between Tehran and Tel Aviv is more of a distraction from what is really going on. And the reality is that Iran has no reason to bomb Israel, and even with nuclear weapons, which will not spare the Palestinian Arabs equally with the Jews, whose problems the ayatollahs use for purely propaganda purposes in order to achieve at least some authority in Muslim countries, authority , which they, oddly enough, actually do not have. The Tehran ayatollahs are, first of all, pragmatists to the marrow of their bones, and then confessors. This is confirmed by the fact that Iran, along with Christian Russia, is also an ally of Christian Armenia - the worst enemy of Muslim and, by the way, Shiite Azerbaijan. It is difficult to imagine that Sunnis will begin to fraternize with Shiites if a Palestinian state is created with the help of Iran. And what will Iran get from this? Nothing! And the main thing that undoubtedly understands in Tehran is that an atomic attack on Israel by Iran is tantamount to signing a death warrant for itself. It should be noted here an important fact - the Arab organization Al-Qaeda, which is really an enemy of Israel, has no ties with Iran, on the contrary, it is its opponent, speaking on the side of the Syrian rebels in their war with dictator Bashar al-Assad, whom he supports Tehran together with Moscow. The totalitarian regime of the ayatollahs, as well as sovereign democracy in the person of sovereign Putin, does not need democratic revolutions. More details in my article “Why does Iran need a bomb?” (3).        I would like to draw your attention to the paradox - democracy among the Arabs does not bode well for Israel either. The fact is that for a dictator the main task is to maintain power, everything else, including the return of lost territories, is secondary. Thus, Bashar al-Assad is more willing to “wet” his people than to fight for the Golan annexed by Israel. Strange as it may seem, in a true democracy, a term-limited head of state is much more free to choose the decisions to be made, and even more so those that will have the support of the people. A dictator clinging to power in Damascus is less dangerous for Israel than a popularly elected leader. Therefore, Israel is wary of social developments in the Arab countries.    The second after Netanyahu, it can be said, no less a liar on a global scale, President Putin (4), a revanchist who started to restore the Russian Empire within the borders of the USSR (5), from the UN rostrum calls on the World to put an end to global terrorism. It is necessary, in truth, to have impenetrable impudence, so that, being the first terrorist on the planet (6,7), who perpetrated total terror in Chechnya, to call for an intensification of the fight against Islamists. As it turned out, by Islamists Putin means not ISIS with Hezbollah and not even Iranian obscurantists, who are Putin's great friends, namely, the Syrian opposition that rebelled against the dictatorial regime of Bashar al-Assad. In connection with this approach to the Syrian problem, Putin in his speech accused the democratic countries of trying to overthrow the legitimate power of the dictator. Dictator Putin, I'm sorry, a permanent sovereign, could not have had any other approach, if, according to Putin's own definition, the political system in Russia is represented by a new hitherto unknown sovereign democracy. This explains why Russia has the totalitarian regimes of Iran and Syria among its allies.    Putin circumvented Russia's violation of the Budapest Memorandum, according to which Russia pledged to be the guarantor of Ukraine's territorial integrity. It is not clear how Western leaders, after such political lies, continue to negotiate in the hope of reaching an agreement with the Kremlin liar, who uses their credulity and decency.    The Kremlin's revanchist ambitions, made clear by the attacks on Georgia and Ukraine, mirror Putin's plans to rebuild the Russian empire. The actions of Putin's Russia during the annexation of Crimea and territorial claims to eastern Ukraine under the pretext that Russians live compactly there exactly repeat the actions of Hitler's Germany during the annexation of the Sudetenland, where the German population was 90%. It should be noted that today's military hysteria organized by Putin in Russia is very reminiscent of the situation in Nazi Germany on the eve of World War II. The Russian president has not bothered to explain Russia's aggression in Ukraine, which suggests that there is still more to come, given Putin's view that the Ukrainian people as such do not exist. It seems that during his service in the KGB in eastern Germany, the spirit of Hitler moved into Putin, so to speak, reincarnation is evident. What Putin is creating in Russia is national socialism with a clear component of it - militarism, and this is nothing but fascism. The common problem of the West in “friend” Putin is the result of a misunderstanding of what the Russian people are and what Russia is (. The political blindness of Bush Jr. and Obama's timid \"reset\" that he hoped to bring Russia back under Yeltsin did nothing. Russia has returned to its hypostasis.         The speech of the President of the United States of America was excellent. Listeners had the good fortune to experience Obama's oratorical talent. He did not read from the sheet like Putin and Netanyahu, his speech was interesting and voluminous. In enumerating military conflicts and explaining in detail America's role and involvement in them, Obama did not mention the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which is more than half a century old and in which America is most directly involved. It is unlikely that Obama has forgotten what he has been doing since his first day in the White House. I believe that the reason is not in forgetfulness, but in the unwillingness to expose to the audience their helplessness in solving the problem, which was a headache for previous presidents. If Netanyahu and Putin are known liars, then you can’t say the same about Obama, however, if you deliberately avoid discussing your participation in what you yourself are involved in, namely, in one of the main conflicts in the Middle East, then this is tantamount to hiding the political crimes to cover up Israel, with its apartheid against the Palestinian people, and having a record number of accusatory UN resolutions, can be attributed to political deception in the form of a policy of double standards. Because of Israel, the United States of America is forced to pursue a policy of double standards. Calling \"friend Putin\", a man who has covered the Chechen people in blood, and waging war against the dictator Assad literally for the same thing, is an example of classical hypocrisy.       To be sure, America became the America we know because of democracy, as Obama reminded the audience. Democracy in the countries of Europe made it possible to eliminate the former, seemingly insoluble problems between European states, which ultimately allowed the creation of the EU and other countries can follow this example. However, not every nation, by virtue of its mentality, can accept democratic conditions of life, so the experience with democracy in Russia failed. The Russian people cannot successfully exist in a democratic society due to their inability to actively engage in rational economic and political activities, and the inevitable appearance against this background of oligarchs, let’s say, of non-Russian nationality, leads the country to impoverishment and, as a result, the final collapse of the empire, which is contrary to the great-power worldview Russian people.  Thus, Russia as an empire and a democratic country is nonsense! Having tasted democracy, Russia again returned to totalitarianism, as the only possible option to preserve the empire, outside of which the Russian people would be lost.   Of all the peoples of the former Soviet Union who were lucky to be freed from Moscow, only Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians and Georgians were able to gain democracy. In the Turkic republics, where nepotism is traditionally above the law, democracy has resulted in its profanation, covering up totalitarian regimes. In this regard, it is at least unreasonable to reproach new states, such as Azerbaijan or Uzbekistan, with insufficient democracy, as it sometimes comes from the leaders of Western democracy. By the way, in this matter, too, the West sins with a double standard; something I have not heard that the West was in a claim to the monarchy in the oil-producing Arab countries. On the contrary, these countries are strategic allies of Western democracy.   No words, democracy is good, but we must take into account that not all peoples are at the same level of civilization. Until the people themselves decide to move to a democratic form of government, it is useless to accuse dictators, or forcefully introduce democracy, as happened in Iraq. Remember the example of democracy in Turkey, where democracy was not presented from outside. The Turkish people left the history of the Ottoman Empire and independently moved to a democratic state system. It is time for Western politicians to understand that the main Evil on the planet is behind the walls of the Kremlin, and the first task is to prevent the return of the liberated peoples to the bosom of the Russian Empire. The mere fact that Putin gathered around him the dregs of civilization in the person of Tehran obscurantists, the bloody Syrian dictator and the Armenian Dashnak Nazis with the chimerical idea of creating a “Great Armenia from sea to sea” speaks of what modern Russia is like. With the collapse of the USSR and the collapse of the communist ideology, Russia did not change its essence as the Empire of Evil, and if President Ronald Reagan managed to bring it to its knees, then all subsequent presidents, including Barack Obama, turned out to be political impotent, passively watching how \"friend Putin\" curtails the beginnings of Yeltsin's democracy, opening the floodgates to Great Russian chauvinism, which swept the whole country in imperial frenzy. The monster gained strength, which did not take long to turn into aggression against Georgia and Ukraine. Putin skillfully took advantage of Obama's political blindness and his complete ignorance of the Russian mentality. Putin's success in his aggressive plans was also facilitated by the advantage of the authoritarian regime over democracy in the speed of decisions.        Everything that was achieved by Reagan is practically reduced to zero. Ronald Reagan, after the downed Korean Boeing by the Russians, boldly and accurately called Russia the Empire of Evil, emphasizing that the West and Russia have completely different moral values. Yes, today America clearly lacks the second Ronald Reagan, he certainly was not afraid to call Putin for who he is, namely, a liar, and not only did not shake hands with Putin, as Obama did, and in general would refuse to meet with a liar. Doesn't Obama really understand that negotiating anything with a person who doesn't have a single truthful word behind him is the last thing.    In the confrontation between Putin and Obama, Putin certainly looks like the winner. He is carrying out his plans, in contrast to Obama, who, in foreign policy matters, did not succeed in realizing much of what he promised. In the famous Cairo speech, Obama, the first American president, gave a truthful assessment of the Arab-Israeli conflict and indicated that the solution to the problem is seen as the creation of two states for two peoples. There are no words, the Cairo speech is beautiful in every respect, but it is only a speech that was not followed by any effective measures. In two terms as president, Obama lacked the courage and courage to fight the Jewish lobby to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is one of the main destabilizing factors in the Middle East region. Obama did not manage to move this inveterate conflict one iota, and the fact that Obama passed it over in silence at the 70th session of the UN General Assembly is an indirect recognition of the impotence to end the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is tantamount to the political fiasco of the 44th President of the United States of America .      1. liar in demand for the state of Israel. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/10937.html 2.
