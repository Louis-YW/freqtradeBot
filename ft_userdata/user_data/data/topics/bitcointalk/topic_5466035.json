If you find an account that is plagiarizing, then it may be banned, and accordingly all alternative accounts will be banned.Otherwise, all we can do is make a negative trust (which I will add to them if you found high-rank accounts)",

In the meantime, the best thing to do is to tag all alt accounts - you can even tag them even if you haven't used DT. If you have feedback that proves accurate - someone will probably add you to their trust list. So don't just hope DT does it â€“ do something if you believe there is strong evidence in your favor.",

Just asking though.This tempted me to check how long you are in the forum. Well obviously you are not here for enough time and don't know much about the code of conduct of the forum. Yes, scam, and things like ponzi, mlm, bad business, nothing are moderated by the forum officials. You must read forum rules before starting an argument of why and why not. The reason is known to all of us for years.

Is really hard to fight them off this area since they know they can catch some novice or victims.The thing is Mods can't always know 100% if something being promoted is a scam, Take whirlwind promo as an example here on the forum, If the mods knew there was going to be an exit scam by them then their account(s) would've been nuked, banned long before it happened but sadly it didn't happen. (Considering scams are moderated)Secondly with Ponzi schemes most of them these days are being put in a grey zone taking the example of some sort of Online mining. Again the Mods can't be certain or verify if it's a scam till it's too late and damage has been done.That's the reason in my opinion why scams aren't moderated on the forum.",
