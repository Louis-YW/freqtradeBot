And then some of the Wolverine pics.So it's going to be very difficult for the company to just pay those hackers though. Because they don't have the bargaining power, and even if they pay the ransom there is no assurance that the hackers are not going to leak the information as well.And no one deserves his data to be leaked to the public and being used by this cyber criminals.",

I notice that too. The fact that Bitcoin is the major request that hackers demand is still surprising, I would have love to ask why but who will I ask? You and I are just here discussing and non of is the hacker so nobody would be able to answer that question.The way bloggers and news sites releases news concerning Bitcoin makes it sound as if Bitcoin was the crime itself instead of the actual scenario. Rhysiada hackers got of Insomniac and demands Bitcoin as payment if it was just $2 million dollar cash that was requested it would have not sound so big but since it's Bitcoin the media will take it so serious like Bitcoin was the crime.

Just as the media does not usually help because when the price was lower they criticized Bukele for buying bitcoin for El Salvador and now they are silent. I am referring to the main mass media.I think the market is way past valuing in the \"black money\" and the \"bitcoin is for criminals\" news. At this point, this kind of news is only to keep retail investors out, to miss out on the wealth opportunity. That's their own doing and MSM probably make them say/do so much worse than not getting in Bitcoin.Quote from: Nwada001 on December 13, 2023, 07:10:58 AMYour thread title is also as misleading as what we see on news sites: \"Hackers claim $2 million in bitcoin\" is different from hackers demanding $2 million in bitcoin. Your topic title made me see the entire situation, like the hackers already got their hands on the bitcoin, which makes me almost want to ask if there were some bitcoin wallets linked to the game data that were stolen.Essentially, they have made at least 50 BTC. Someone will bid for at least 50 BTC, the data is worth a lot more...or, Isomniac will pay the ransom. Either way, 50BTC minimum for the group.Quote from: Nwada001 on December 13, 2023, 07:10:58 AMBut why do hackers always go for bitcoin as demand?

Why is it always bitcoin? Making the news and headlines look like bitcoin is always used for illegal things, and all of that as if it's the only coin that could be used by criminals and it won't be traced.Hackers probably want to make it easier for the ransom payer. Many exchanges have already dropped Monero and other privacy coins in a bid against \"money laundering\" (rather a bid against privacy). Companies can access and distribute Bitcoin much easier. It probably could even come under the balance sheet liability/insurances as well at this stage, given it is a commodity (don't quote me on the latter though just a logical thought with little base).Quote from: kryptqnick on December 13, 2023, 10:34:29 AMIt's a huge company, and while I'm not big on gaming, I've played some of their games.

Yes,Â  bitcoin has nothing to do with this thing, but the thing is, people or hackers like the group mentioned taking advantage of the advanced technology of bitcoin to ensure that no one could track them. They used bitcoin to hide where the money goes or who's going to receive it. This indicates that the hackers are knowledgeable about bitcoin, and that's why they are using it for their own good. That's exactly why bitcoin or cryptocurrency is still hard to accept by the government, as no one owns it and no one could manipulate it. That's why many people are using it for crimes. I'm not against bitcoin; in fact, I'm a long-time investor in this coin, but yeah, let's not ignore the fact that bitcoin is being used in multiple crimes.",
