The dead cannot work to earn, nor can they invest to earn, so health should be our priority. QuoteI have being unhealthy for a while but to read and make a research of coin I should invest ,Apart from Bitcoin, If you're researching a coin to invest in, then it's not Bitcoin you're investing in, but your topic is only specific to Bitcoin. Quotein summary without a good health you will not think out of good project to invest.If you can't think of a good project to invest in, that is because you have interest mostly in alt coins and are confused about which one to invest in, but on your topic, you are only specific about Bitcoin.",

Whenever we invest it's said that our health condition is safe or we have some reserved funds that could cater for expenses whenever we encountered any health issues or family challenges as no one will put all his money into investment and expect the investment to yield while his health is at stake.There's always a popular saying that said \"Health is Wealth\" and whenever we are no long in a good health it's assumed that our wealth can not be enjoyed due to lack of sound or I'll health.",

I'm sorry to hear that. Doing your own research is energy-consuming, but Bitcoin simplifies everything: consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (buying a fixed amount every month) and then hold on to it. Don't frequently check the price or obsess over the news. Educate yourself and avoid the stress of news, FOMO, FUD, etc. To sum up: BTC is arguably healthier than most alts.I hope you recover soon.Best wishes",

Although without good health, both Bitcoin and Altcoin investment cannot be possible, I don't think thinking about Bitcoin is actually needful before investing.",

      "body": "So how is Bitcoin health? Because there's those who panic when the charts are reading red and are forced to take hasty decisions. I might not be medically inclined but at least I know that being in a state of constant panic isn't good for the body and since it's not compulsory that everyone should go into it, its best they look for something else. Except you mean you shouldn't be fainthearted when it comes to Bitcoin investment then I'd agree with you because of the risks involved but if we are talking about general wellness, it's important to be in good health because in that way you can enjoy the proceeds of your investment.It's also important to be in the right frame of mind when making your research on what coin to invest in as you won't be moved by the short term profits it promises or be moved by FOMO but rather you'd take your time to choose which you wish you prefer to have in your portfolio.",

But someone who invests I think knows about this and you just can't invest into Bitcoin when you're unhealthy because before you put your money into an investment, you'll think first about your medications, medicines and anything that you need to sustain your health. But if someone invests and is deteriorating with his health, that's not an ideal thing because I've seen people that have said the same thing that they're trying to invest in Bitcoin and they're thinking of it as their possible source to sustain their medications but it's not that appropriate at all.",

If you have illness,before doing crypto investment or trading with Bitcoin then it would really be just that sensible that you should really be not forgetting with those treatment if ever.     You wont really be that so dumb on to be that careless or being not mindful when it comes to your health. Investment/business should really be just that second in priority.    Health is indeed wealth!2. If you have sacrificed too much of your time and your health because of lacking of sleep and eating nutritious just because you do give priority into your trade or investment then this is something   that wont really be that recommendable on doing so.Money making or profits be made would really be totally pointless or useless if your body is really that sick.Those amounts you have earned would really be just that ending up on spending on hospitalization or medicines which we dont really like to happen.",

If you break down,  investment and trading will mean less to you.  Only a person who is fit physical,  emotionally and mentally can invest.

It's not wrong for someone to choose to invest in Bitcoin while they're in good health, but that doesn't mean their health should revolve solely around Bitcoin. There are plenty of other beneficial and productive pursuits besides Bitcoin investment, some of which are even more supportive of your health, such as sports or work.I understand, Bitcoin is the heart of the cryptocurrency world. But making Bitcoin the beating heart of your life is going a bit too far. Placing excessive hope in Bitcoin without realizing the multitude of other opportunities that exist beyond it is unwise. Going all-in on Bitcoin is far from a prudent choice.Furthermore, what is your endgame when you're in good health? Is it only Bitcoin that defines your sense of well being?",
