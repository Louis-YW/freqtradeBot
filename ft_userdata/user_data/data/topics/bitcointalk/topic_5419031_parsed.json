I know that we don't have any sources about this thing, but for me casino's are not that stupid do to this kind of thing.They can still make a lot of money without being resorting to this kind of algorithm, just saying.",

I don't think an online casino will restrict a player from winning big based on the country where he is playing from,that is why it's online so that the casino can be accessed from any part of the world. If a casino wants to restrict, they will restrict the gamblers from a particular country not the funds to be won. Though the casinos are always making profit because of the house hedge.Winning big can can't scare a casino from restricting a certain amount to gamblers from a particular country with their algorithm, casinos that are operating legally knows that they are to pay their tax to the government, and as a gambler when you win big,if the government knows ,there is nothing that can be done about it,if gambling is legalize in that country. It is only if gambling is not legalize in your country that it can be a great problem. It is only the illegal casinos that can restrict gamblers to a particular winning,because the are scams.",

Every country have their peculiar laws on gambling and money laundering and registered casinos are expected to obey or respect these rules. Also every casino must have their terms and conditions that must be open to current customers or prospective ones. If a gambler is comfortable with these terms and conditions, he would gladly use the casino firm. But if the casino has some secret techniques by which they use to control payout, then it is very wrong. As long as they are not violating the laws of the land, there is no need to be afraid of the countries law enforcement agencies.Winning big in a casino is a well-known source of wealth globally, the local authority shouldn't be surprise when someone suddenly becomes a millionaire.",

It seems to me that what you are saying is a nonsense that you have pulled out of your hat without any basis. Precisely if you went to the Scam Accusations board you would see that what usually happens when someone wins big is that they ask for KYC, to make sure they are not playing from a country not allowed with VPN or something, and then there are players who had not read the ToS previously who open a thread on that board with the case.The reality is much simpler than the conspiracy you raise.",

It wouldn't even be a legal dispute imo since they'd have proof of transactions so if ever they'd be put as a scapegoat, they can perfectly leave the case all fine, and might even ask for reparations. Casinos are only afraid of the laws of casino that pertain to \"gambling\" related regulations, outside of that, especially considering if it was online casinos, I don't think they'd ever fear anything, except maybe an especially lucky person that can bankrupt them",

So if I am understanding it correctly you are saying that they are messing with the RTP as some slot providers allows the casino to do that,and in order for people coming from such countries based on location they to change automatically the RTP,this can be done with ease from any casino operator.If it is legal or not I cannot say as the casino is the business owner and if they don't advertise any fixed RTP then it is legal but I find it difficult that nowadays casinos to come to this \"last resort\" for such users,most likely they play fair to everyone,it is up to the winner then to deal with local authorities.",

Well, if you're an audited person that pays taxes to the government for winning money on casinos, isn't this an unfair one? This is a gross income too. Is this even universal even to an online casino that they issue limit to the winners on what they can pay because they win a huge amount?",

If a country is not within the casino's list of blacklisted countries then what's the point of limiting their slots? On the contrary, the casino would even try their best to promote their platform in whatever ways possible just to gain more players and bets. They would even spend a big amount for sponsorships and partnerships. Why would the casino be dragged into legal disputes if it has the license and the registration?",

The casinos wouldn't be problematic wherever their players are from. If a player is rightful and have won with huge wins, they'll just have to give it away and allow it to be cashed out if there's no problem found.It's the sole duty of the player to think about how he's going to take it wherever he's from. It's already out of the casinos jurisdiction if the player will face some taxation based on his winnings. The only thing that casino is concerned about are the countries that they're prohibiting to gain access on them. But there are some that still allows it through the usage of VPN.",

Doesn't the problem or dispute that occur in the gambling Slot Machine Algorithm system depend on a particular location or area.According to my understanding, the local government will investigate gambling activities in large scale winnings depending on how the casino operates in a particular area illegal or legal, for me winning big or small certain casinos will not lose, of course there is a reason.To be sure I refer to the source below.QuoteAn example of how the Slot Machine Algorithm works. Which means that in the algorithm, you are given a defeat before you win or vice versa.From this quote it can be concluded that no matter how a player wins or loses in slots, I don't think they, the casino can lose, although there will be disputes that will occur between players and casinos, even if the government is involved in it, because the way the algorithm works is very clear.",

I don't think this being done by casinos to discriminate against some people from certain countries. This is my own opinion and I can't proof it, but so far I haven't read or heard about the issue before. If it were true than this wold would be a big scandal that could potentially ruin a casino. I would stay away from the casino if I knew that some IP adresses are getting worse winning chances. How could you ever trust again the casino if games are decided on a player basis? And still this sounds like a huge operation where the casino could not keep quite. For example one angry employee could just leak the whole situation and ruin the business model. The risk seems not worth it in my opinion, because the casino is already making enough money with their traditional games. There is no real need to lower wining chances or gamblers. And in the end it's the gamblers duty to explain to the government where he made the money and to make sure he pays his taxes.",

Restrictions on the other hand is another thing because local governments would instantly block online gambling site, so if it is accessible, and with the use of blockchain technology, players could still play.",

It is possible but highly unlikely. If casinos pay a player from a country a big money he has won and the authorities have an issue with it, the major penalty will be to their citizen who may have broken a law. I don't think it is totally possible for online casino's to restrict people from certain locations. It is possible that these casino's can be accessed via a strong Virtual Private Network, and since the payout is mostly in cryptocurrency, anonymity can still be ensured by strategically withdrawing the money from the casino's in bits that do not prompt for KYC verification. Some times these individuals have strategies to outsmart the casinos, and the authorities in those countries cannot blame the casino for not being able to detect or pay attention to finding out the location of someone.",

The more you deposit, you can gamble with a big amount, resulting in a big win.Another possibility is to limit the maximum amount you can bet on each game so that even if you win the highest percentage, your total winnings are under a certain threshold.",
