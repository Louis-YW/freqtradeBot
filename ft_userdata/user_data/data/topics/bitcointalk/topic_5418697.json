You're better off doing something else whereas you can have far more control over the process and the result (business/gig/work/etc). With things like crypto or markets in general, you can make great picks, but short-term volatility can mess you up.",

Although we have so many aspect that could earn you money in the crypto space but it requires enough knowledge. Crypto isn't for the lazy ones. He can invest if he's ready to learn and utilize his/ her time for it. Going into crypto trading after learning it's various skills can help in settling daily needs but this is somehow risky if one doesn't have good knowledge about it. Cryptocurrency is interesting and profitable if done right.",

You can do invest short term in Bitcoin and crypto, but you wouldn't always make profit to be used for your daily expense. IMO short term investment is similar like trading where 95% will lose their money and only 5% people who make money. It's better if you find a job in your real life rather than trading when you're still new about trading.",

Read through this topic \"Educating people on Bitcoin for free\" and the responses, you will learn better from it to advice your friend well. To meet basic needs your friend needs to try to improve his income, either by learning a profitable skill or becoming an employee to a company. Trying to invest in bitcoin when he cannot meet his daily needs yet can easily get him into a state of depression if the price of bitcoin falls.",

The whole thing is of course completely different, but various scammers use people like your friend and you and promise them 100% or 500% monthly if they invest their money with them. The old rule says \"if it's too good to be true, it's a lie.\"Briefly and clearly tell your friend that the answer is NO, and not to accept any offers from social networks or so-called friends who might convince him otherwise. He can get a free lunch from you or another true friend, and everything else is just an expensive scam.",

He feels investing in bitcoin is like a small scale business where you make some profit for daily survival. If he is searching for a business that would give him daily income, maybe he should consider starting a firewood business to assist homes that are experiencing power cuts or high cost of gas. Cooking gas in my country have soared to almost 80% high and people are searching for other source of fuel.If he really wants to invest in bitcoin he must have the virtues of patience and courage. Your friend must be willing to Hodl bitcoin for a long time because the bullish market season is unpredictable.Quote from: maydna on October 29, 2022, 02:29:00 PMIt is possible to do that, but if it is to fulfil his daily needs, he needs to learn to analyze the ups and downs of the market so that he can buy and sell bitcoins for profit.

OP's friend wants an investment that he can derive funds that would sustain him daily. There is a possibility that he might loose even half of his investment in one day.",

Bitcoin is a very risky investment, you can make a lot of money from it but you can also lose it all if you don't have enough experience in the market. Day trading can also be considered a short term investment, but to make money by trading you need a lot of knowledge and experience that a beginner will never be able to do. Tell your friend that he needs a steady job before he wants to invest in bitcoin, and absolutely do not use borrowed money to invest in bitcoin, it will bring his life to a standstill.",

It is possible to invest in Bitcoin for short-term period but don't expect to have a high profit.  Though it is better to do day-trade than make a short-term investment in Bitcoin because at the current condition of the Bitcoin market, it is somehow hard to see Bitcoin surging in a short span of time.  I think it will take several months before we can see a decent profit in the Bitcoin market.  He can try altcoins but the risk involved in investing in new altcoin project is huge.Quote from: Bazzu on October 29, 2022, 02:17:02 AMwhich is to meet daily needs, and I am confused to answer because I am still a beginner in bitcoin and crypto. and I want to ask everyone about it?Better to find a job or set up a small business (like a food stall or sari-sari store) in order to meet daily needs.  Bitcoin investment at the current market condition will take time before you can make a profit and is not suitable for meeting everyday needs.  Until your friend is an experienced day trader, I think the thought of investing in Bitcoin for daily needs will fail.",
