After all, safeguarding privacy is an inherent entitlement of every individual and should not be overlooked. Given the nature of the blockchain network, it is possible for almost anyone to trace the flow of your funds or even access the overall balance of your wallet. We perceive this as an intolerable breach of privacy, prompting us to develop [banned mixer] as a solution to tackle this concern.With www.[banned mixer] you can safely mix your bitcoins with lowest possible fee and maximum privacy.Clearnet: https://www.[banned mixer]Tor Mirror: http://[banned mixer]What is [banned mixer]?[banned mixer] is a Bitcoin Mixer / BTC Tumbler. Our transfer algorithm selects independent investors and trading platforms, and breaks down your funds in a manner that completely removes a link between input and output transactions. We neither require registration nor store logs. Once the mixing is done and transaction confirmed, the data on processed transactions is deleted. For each mixing request, we issue a digitally signed letter of guarantee, which confirms our obligations to the client.While mixing BTC, [banned mixer] does not shuffle available funds in one or multiple pots, but exchanges incoming bitcoins with coins purchased from investors / cryptocurrency platforms.Can I trust you with my Bitcoins?All users are protected by the platform against accidental errors or deliberate actions, we take protective measures against errors and malicious acts. For every incoming order, we provide a PGP-signed letter of guarantee that confirms the obligations we assume.

The purpose of a mixer should be breaking all possible connections of the output coins that the clients are sending to mix. But unfortunately one of the most used mixer broke that trust and everyone is more careful about choosing their mixer now than before.Welcome to the forum.

The platform runs a scoring procedure for each incoming coin so to check its reliability and purchase it for its reserves. The service liaises with crypto stock exchanges and controls the money inflow around the clock – if the algorithm detects a shortfall it blasts notification messages to investors and quickly tops up the reserves. Coins with dark history are never let in. Money that has passed the scoring goes to transit (intermediary) wallets (there is a dedicated wallet for each investor) and is used to make clients’ transactions untraceable. The algorithm carries out multi-layered cleansing that achieves a clean track record for your coins. Aforementioned investors are independent traders with accounts at crypto stock exchanges who sell their output transactions to us.",

For now enjoy the light.2 - We recommend Nord because it is outside of the Five-, Nine-, 14 Eyes alliances. but use what you want.3 - Good idea, thanks for the appreciation. You can also send an email.4 - Yes, the minimum is 0.003 BTC. May change in the future.5 - No trial at the moment, It may be implemented.Now looks like this: Support 24x7: support@[banned mixer], thormixer@protonmail.com, Profil Message or Ann ThreadCheers.",

Coins with dark history are never let in.A mixer that promotes the taint BS and tells you Bitcoin isn't fungible? That's a first the second after Wasabi!Allow me to quote myself on the subject of \"taint\":Quote from: LoyceV on June 09, 2022, 08:39:08 AMI've seen several posts lately from people willing to treat Bitcoin as non-fungible because they believe some coins are \"tainted\".I'd say this is a severe threat to Bitcoin, and I wouldn't be surprised if governments use this because they can't stop Bitcoin in any other way. If people believe Bitcoin is \"tainted\", they won't accept it anymore. \"We\" should really inform people not to fall for this.Nobody would reject a dollar bill because it has previously been used in a crime, despite the fact that 85 to 90% contains traces of cocaine. Claiming Bitcoin isn't fungible is just plain stupid.",
