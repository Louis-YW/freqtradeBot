Some are seeing it as an opportunity during unforeseen events and some are seeing it as a helping hand for strengthening their economy. No problem in that! But with increasing intervention from government and the inflow of corporate government money into this, might affect the decentralized nature of Bitcoin in a big way. These entities can even get into mining if they want. Bitcoin should not become a puppet for the governments.",

If not, Bitcoin would just be an easier way to move money around their pockets.It's more than that, around $300-$400 billion debt by South Africa, so it's hard to see them paying it with Bitcoin unless they become the top holder of Bitcoin.Even at the current rate, the top country is US and it's holding is around $20 billion. I would understand if they will hold some just like El Salvador or Bhutan and not sell for the next couple of halving to realized a good profit.So it's absurd to say that it will pay their debt, buy we welcome any country that see Bitcoin as national reserved next to Gold.",
