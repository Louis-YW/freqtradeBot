  "content": "It's been a while ever since I made a charitable donation that portrays the awareness of Bitcoin in my locality, so just as we began the month of February 2024, which also popularly known to be the month of love (i.e Saint Valentine), whereby people go about sharing gifts to family, friends and total strangers, a thought have been ringing in my head ever since to go spread some love, but due to  procrastination I was never able to execute my plan, not until few days ago when I finally started planning and could finally execute my plan two days ago (i.e 29th Feb) been the last day of the month of February 2024, by heading to a nearby government primary school to go share notebooks to it's pupils within my locality as could be seen in the pictures provided below with a small percentage of the little Bitcoin I have been privilege to earn/accumulate through signature campaign here on this forum since last year and of recent  (i.e Shuffle & Mega) organize by a reputable personality Sir \"Little Mouse\". Hence, the idea about sharing books to school pupils came to my mind, and we all know how important books happens to be an essential learning material which all pupils need to have for effective learning, but sometimes due to current economic hardship in my country, not all parents are able to afford a complete set of notebooks for all their kids for learning, of which with this little act of kindness of mine, I'm sure it did actually went a long way helping these kids have a semi complete set of learning materials worth having for effective learning. So while thinking about how to share/donate these notebooks, an idea came to my mind, to not just only donate  notebook, but to do it in a Bitcoin way, and by that I mean instead of just buying ordinary notebooks and donate, I decided to add a little graphic design on the front cover of each of those notebooks with a basic Bitcoin Questions and Answers so as to enable these pupils whenever they have a look at it will be able to have a picturial view of what Bitcoin is all about, and know  some basic questions about Bitcoin, such as \"What is Bitcoin?, Who invented Bitcoin? And What year was Bitcoin invented?\", e.t.c As some pictures of the edited copies of the notebooks with the Basic Bitcoin Questions and Answers could all be seen below.                  Aims & Objective of the projectThere are two basic aims and objectives I had in mind when starting this project namely;1. To spread love with a small percentage of the little Bitcoin I have been privilege to accumulate here on this forum, because just as February happens to be a month of love and Armsgiving, I thought it would be too bad of me if February passed me by without me sharing arms to those in need of it the most.2. To spread the awareness of Bitcoin in a pictorial form (i.e Through the Question and Answers designed on the front cover of each of the notebooks donated), because just as we all know that a picture is more than a thousand words, I then decided to this time to create awareness in a picturial form, by donating books, pen, pencil and drinks to school pupils, as it all could be seen in the pictures down below.        Appreciation & ConclusionFirst, I wish to thank Satoshi Nakamoto for inventing Bitcoin, which is the reason why we are all gathered here on this forum, and secondly, I wish to thank the management of the forum, the casino operators and campaign managers for giving us the privilege to be able to earn here on this forum, and including myself who today im able to use a few percentage of my earning to touch lives, and I feel very grateful, as all these would never have been possible without the good works of our reputable and hardworking campaign managers \"Little Mouse, Hhampuz and Royse777\". It's was indeed a pleasure working with you all.",

Hopefully, this type of action will have a positive impact on children in two ways: the using this material for learning, and because early knowledge of what bitcoin is will hopefully help them to have a better life in the future.Congratulations on carrying out such a good initiative.",

I appreciate you, for extending your generosity to this government school pupils to enhance their learning, because book is very important for anyone who is in school. It is a thing of joy to see that you can contribute the little that you have a assist people. You are promoting bitcoin in your own grand style, even though these pupil are still very young to know their left from their right. However, the awareness of bitcoin will be useful to their teachers and from there, you might see one of the teachers that will pick interest. The logo of bitcoin on the book is something that these pupil will not forget when they see it in some other places.Great work OP.",

Not everyone have a free mind like OP. If you said the photos were edited what about the drinks? Were the drinks also edited?Quote Plus those don't look like kids in a school setting ( they are on flip flops and not on socks ) what school accepts that?   IMO there are schools in most remote villages and I would say if you want to do charity services you don't have to do it to people who already have every means to afford what you want to give to them. You only have to give out things to people who you know can't afford it. The primary school I attended was a very local one and we enjoyed going because the teachers in the school can teach very well. You can't judge a book by it cover bro.",

      "body": "Good work OP. I am more interested in the books and other items you gave to these children. From the picture it is clear that they are from poor households that might not afford those gifts you gave to them. I doubt if any of them will be able to learn much about Bitcoin because these children are bothered with other basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter. However, just knowing that Bitcoin is a currency is enough, some of them might take an interest in the currency in the future.

Plus those don't look like kids in a school setting ( they are on flip flops and not on socks ) what school accepts that? I looked closely at the pictures in the books and didn't think that the customized books were different from the ones the children were holding. So you need to show more proof to authenticate your observation. Your view that those kids are not in school showed that you have little or no knowledge of the happenings in most developing nations. These children are even well-dressed because in some schools most of them can't afford bathroom slippers. I can verify that this is a typical school setting in the rural area of Africa. Regarding merit fishing, your view is also subjective because you can only guess his objective. Maybe he has other reasons for posting this selflessness on the forum. Maybe he wants to showcase how he is spreading Bitcoin education through giving and this can also spur other members to engage in the good work. Giving merit I not by force, if you suspect that a post is for merit fishing, don't give any.",

This is not the first time people are announcing their contribution to the Bitcoin community and I do not see anything wrong with it. If Op do not bring it here, how do we know that some children in a rural community in Africa are already aware of Bitcoin and the customized books will further spread Bitcoin to their homes? Do you know that many people are being motivated to do more to their communities through this post? If you are not comfortable with the post, the best you can do is pass and follow other topics. Let's encourage people to do more to humanity because that is the very essence of our living.",
