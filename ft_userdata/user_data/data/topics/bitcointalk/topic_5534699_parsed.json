It is very important to verify Bitcoin strength in hardest times that are reflected by Lowest Price each year.The trend is more bullish and has less up and down like with Yearly Highest (Max) Price chart.",

This chart looks to have pattern of cycle while the first chart is more parabolic.That's what I meant by plotting two charts attached in OP.",

That way, it’s easier to see the differences at a glance. Normally, when looking at graphs, we expect to compare at least two sets of data and having them in the same picture would make it much easier to analyze.",

However, since you have already included it, and since I’m bullish this year and expecting another major Bitcoin bull run, my conservative prediction is that Bitcoin will hit $300K. If that happens, the yearly low of $78K (300k x 26 based on computation below) might already be in, meaning what we’ve seen this year could be the bottom.2024 - 108086 - high less 2024 38598 = total over high+ low = 26",

However, since you have already included it, and since I’m bullish this year and expecting another major Bitcoin bull run, my conservative prediction is that Bitcoin will hit $300KI know and we all know that 2025 year has not completed yet, and different people can think differently about Bitcoin trend and price within this year. Nobody know what are Highest and Lowest prices in 2025, before its last day.I only add 2025 year for a raw comparison but it's clearly that we will have better one on 1 January 2026 with full price data in 2025.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on March 09, 2025, 10:32:03 AMGood thread to put into perspective what we are talking about. I see a lot of pessimistic people on the forum but just as there have been throughout bitcoin's history when the price was going down. I still think, as freedomgo and Negotiation, that 2025 is going to be bullish.I think so too but make sure you have your withdrawal plans if you don't plan to hold your bitcoin for one or two more cycles.Are you ready for the Bitcoin bull market? What's your plan? Some ideas for you",

Bitcoin lowest price usually becomes lower to the previous low before it will record new lower low.So it means that the current is possible to stay there then next year will lower low or it can be this year.Nevertheless, it’s good to see that Bitcoin yearly low is increasing and most notably the previous high of Bitcoin. It means that once a resistance now turn into strong support. Nice thread.",

And the year after a significant event in the bitcoin space price of Bitcoin tend to suffer loss until another event takes place which is usually the bull run. There is no assurance of price recovering if we closely interpret this chart carefully without sentiments.",

Looks like you'll be updating your chart soon as Bitcoin is heading toward the bottom. As of this writing, BTC is trading around the $80K level, getting dangerously close to the yearly low. If this turns into a bear market, we might be stuck in it for a while, just like in previous cycles. I’m starting to worry that we won’t see a new ATH this year.",
