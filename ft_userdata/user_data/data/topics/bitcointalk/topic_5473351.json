  "content": "Inspired by Learn Bitcoin's comprehensive guide on PGP, I've decided to create a tutorial on installing Kali NetHunter on Android device (Rootless).Using this Android users will gain the ability to utilize PGP encryption on their devices with NetHunter. Hence completing the trilogy of guides on PGP across Windows, Linux and Android platform.This tutorial is made on Android 11, but it should also work seamlessly on Android 12, 13 and 14. Minimum installation requirements:1. Minimum 15–20 GB of storage (Depends on the version you choose)2. Knowledge of Command Prompt and Terminal apps3. A working brain➥ Step 1: Install Termux app from github/F-droid (Use VPN, in case of slow download).Quote➥ Step 2: Open termux and enter the following command to update packageCode:pkg update -yQuote➥ Step 3: When prompted for an action press Y and <Enter> so you install the package maintainer’s version (6 times)Quote➥ Step 4: Allow storage permissionCode:termux-setup-storageQuote➥ Step 5: Install wgetCode:pkg install wgetQuote➥ Step 6: Download NetHunter installation fileCode:wget -O install-nethunter-termux https://offs.ec/2MceZWrQuote➥ Step 7: Change permission to execute the fileCode:chmod +x install-nethunter-termuxQuote➥ Step 8: Execute the fileCode:./install-nethunter-termuxQuote➥ Step 9: Enter the image you wanna install. You can choose full, minimal, nano. I will go for no 1.Quote➥ Step 10: Press N when asked for delete rootfs (The installation will take a while, 15-30 minutes depending on your internet speed).QuoteAfter step 10, you will have to fix dbus-x11 error. Users are most likely to get this error after the first installation. To fix this problem you just have to change the DNS server and update some package.Fix dbus-x11 error➥ Step 11: Run the following commandCode:nh -rQuote➥ Step 12: Open the file /etc/resolve.conf Code:nano  /etc/resolve.confQuote➥ Step 13: Edit the ip address to 8.8.8.8, Then Press ctrl + x and enter Y to saveQuote➥ Step 14: Run apt update and apt install dbusCode:apt updateapt install dbus-x11 -yQuoteNow that we have fixed the error, we can continue further....➥ Step 15: Enter NetHunter and Set the password for Kex VNC (press N to entering a view-only password)Quote➥ Step 16: Note down the port number, you will need it in step 19.Quote➥ Step 17: Download Nethunter app and install it.➥ Step 18: Open the NetHunter app and search for Kex, install it and open it.Quote➥ Step 19: Enter the port number, username as kali, and your password from step 16 and press connect.Quote➥ Step 20: Voila!!! Now you have Rootless Kali NetHunter GUI on your Android device.Quote➥ Related Tutorials:▶ [Eng: Tutorial] PGP Signature - Encrypt/Decrypt message (Linux Only)▶ [Eng: Tutorial] PGP Signature - Encrypt/Decrypt message - Fingerprint -mdayonliner- English▶ PGP Tutorial Bangla - Windows- Learn Bitcoin - Bangla➥ Reference used:https://www.youtube.com/davidbombalhttps://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/nethunter-rootless/https://store.nethunter.com/https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/236",

So maybe some users will get disappointment with those Desktop environments under Android.It is not recommended to use this mid range smart phone. I did not have any problems using this, even though I installed the full version. Those who don't want everything but the basics of Linux can install the minimal or nano version. It's only 150 MB. There are other distros that might be compatible with your device. QuoteFor me there is no need to use those tools under GUI environments.

Those who wants to use Linux on their smartphones, they can follow it. And if you were a hacker or someone who likes to exploit different software or vulnerabilities, this tool might come in handy because of its rich inbuild tool collection.Quote from: BitMaxz on November 08, 2023, 11:12:33 PMJust wow, I was looking for something like this before that support phone and I like the GUI but have you tried to install any Bitcoin wallet on the GUI?Or it has limited app and software support?I have dex on my Samsung phone connected to my smart TV with a keyboard it looks like a mini PC but it only supports the APK app.So I just want to know if this can be cast or connected to a smart TV that works like a small PC with a mouse and keyboard and if it supports other software like Electrum appimage.I just want it to try and I hope this won't brick my phone.Technically, it should support everything, but I don't think our phones have that kind of capability to run those massive softowers. But yes, it should work. I haven't tested it. I was out of storage, just the system took 17GB of my space.No, your phone would not brick. It's not connected to your main OS.

I wanted to try that, but apparently I dont have a second device at this moment. Yes, they will replace the entire OS. Currently, I am a custom ROM user, meaning I flash these custom OS with my everyday needs. I have flashed over 50+ different custom roms and numerous custom kernels so far. It was fun, actually. At this moment, I am using CRDROID, based on Pixel OS.Cheers",

It's very specific though, the link is just for verifying file signature of Electrum binaries.But it's generally the basic steps so it'll work in other binaries as well with the necessary modifications of course.For message encryption, here are the steps (since I can't find any for Termux to link):After installing GnuPG as described in the first reply, create a new text file somewhere in Termux directory, for example in \"Termux/Storage\".Edit that text file to write the message that you want to encrypt, save.Open Termux and enter the command: gpg -a -r <recipient> --encrypt ~/storage/<filename.txt>(the recipient can be the email, uid or fingerprint, without the \"<>\", you can get it from your key-list: -k)Then, a \"<filename.txt>.asc\" file will be created in the same directory containing the signed message.",

To be honest, without a mouse and keyboard, you'll be crying, as navigation on Kali GUI was quite hard for me, as smartphones have smaller display. I had to zoom in and zoom out to go from place to place. Accidental touch would occur from time to time.DVlog, I haven't personally used any crypto related software on my Kali NetHunter.
