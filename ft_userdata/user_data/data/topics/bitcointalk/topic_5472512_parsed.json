Also, The developer has backdoor access, so if your license is not regular, you will probably have complications with it at some point or even delete the script.Only the software developer can do updates I can only configure the front end and about complications and delete how can he all I know is Codecanyon is checking all the scripts for exploits before presenting to the marketplace.I have one script where the developer is nowhere to be found but the script is doing great QuoteOtherwise, hidden is quite old and offers a lot of outdated tools, the metrics of which are largely not used for any purpose. Especially not for SEO. Some of the tools don't even give results, and there are other free alternatives for the same. This does not give you any advantage over similar competitors.And those tools that do the function they promise, offer very poor quality results.I have to believe old users of the script because they are the ones who have tested the script and so far based on my test and all the other tools on Seo is working perfectly, and the competition every niche has competition as a webmaster you should've comfortable with it, as long as you can walk the extra mile QuoteThe good thing is that the developer is working on developing the script, so there is a feeling that someday it will be adjusted to be in line with current standards.Also, as far as I know, no one has managed to add a tool made by another developer. It's locked.The developer has already sold a large number of licenses, so it will be quite difficult for you to reach your audienceEven if the seller sold over 5k or 10k as long as the script worked as promised I'm ok with it, in fact, one of my parameters in buying a script is the number of sales and feedback and so far based on what I see, and research this script delivers and it's up to the user to work on the script to maximize its exposure QuoteOtherwise, there are several much better scripts, even for WP in the same price range. I have a regular license, so I'm talking to you based on personal experienceActually, before buying this script, I had another one that was based on WP but this script is better than the WP script, I can concentrate on configuring instead of adding plugins which will have an impact on the load and changing themes which will takes so much of my time, everything on this script is drag and drop I'm surprised on the installation took me five minutes to install and even a newbie with little knowledge of coding can run this script.Probably one of the easiest scripts I've stumbleQuoteTo sum it up briefly, this script is almost as if you drove a tractor into a Formula 1 race. Tell me how come have you bought this script before?The only problem I have with the script is the URL of the results, which will not show up in the browser.",

I'm happy with the domain name. I have the keywords where I want to rank in my domain name, but I have to index the site first, ranking in keywords is still a long shot it's still too early for me to lay out a plan, and the site is in the configuring and testing phase.Thanks for dropping by buddy and will implement your recommendation.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on November 02, 2023, 08:02:44 AMUI is beautiful and clean, and I hope that the ads are not annoying, but the tools provided by this script are old and there are better alternatives to them now.
