The point to this is to not give scammers this opportunity, close the loop holes. For exchange you don't leave your coins with the exchange this is why the huge sum of estimated $10 billion was lost in FTZ scam. Another is to invest major in bitcoin because some investors want to buy cheap unit of coins , accumulation of satoshi is more secured.",

Most of the systems that failed were centralised or backed by centralised funds.For \"decentralised\" mechanisms like luna, high growth generally stems from high risk. The stablecoin was backed by the depth and the order book of luna. The mechanism was still safe for a few days after it was broken so vigilance would've stopped you from making a loss greater than ~5-30% as.i remember it.",

What do you think are the required steps to prevent these incidences from occurring in future ? Or are these unavoidable ? I think I agree that one of the main reasons why most of these crypto companies are failing is because of greed. Another important cause of all these challenges is lack of risk management and financial management knowledge. Most of these exchanges use people's deposit to fund risky businesses without considering the financial implications. They are just young CEOs that lacks basic forms of financial intelligence. I also agree that there should be a kind of regulations that would help ensure that these centralized businesses operate based on stipulated standards or guidelines so that clients can be protected from loss of funds. There should be a sort of insurance structure that can facilitate the recovery of funds and prompt payments of depositors. But using decentralized exchanges and P2P transactions options still remains the best alternative.",

In my opinion, if investing in Altcoins is very difficult to guarantee that you will survive the incident you experienced as you mentioned above, logically humans will make themselves happy and save themselves first before other people. Most likely the projects they run fail, they always save themselves first.The way to anticipate this is not to invest in Altcoins.I suggest you only invest in bitcoins for your safety. If you don't trust a DEX or CEX to store your Bitcoins, you can use a hardware wallet to make it even more secure.",

I believe everyone is aware that leaving money on a centralized exchange is very risky but they have chosen to ignore it and make a profit instead. I know that there are a lot of people who have lost money investing in these platforms but why are there still so many people unaffected? so don't just blame the developer but curb our greed. There have been a lot of previous lessons like Mt.Gox but most people will forget very quickly and keep diving into them looking for profit. So in my opinion there is no way to fix it.",

In my opinion, the Binance platform dealt it the final blow by offering savings from FTT for sale at a value of more than $500 million, despite the fact that an offer was made by the FTX platform to buy that amount at a value of $22 per token, which is the current price at the time, in order to avoid the collapse of the price, but it refused. And put it up for sale to increase the state of panic and the price of the token to only $2. This led to a complete collapse of the currency, followed by a complete collapse of the platform. Binance's greed is a manifestation of corruption that is far more dangerous than temporal greed.",

You will find manipulative, opportunistic and down right dirty people in all walks of life. These are the sort of people who will try to take advantage of the naive or uneducated, in order to take a short cut to wealth. The only way to protect yourself is by making the odd mistake, ideally on a small scale, then learning from them - but understanding that it is definitely not easy to become rich for 99.99% of people. To some degree it is an unavoidable dilemma, as there is a small group that for whatever reason will not learn and end up falling for the same things in slightly different formats again and again. The best defense is forever questioning why and learning more.",

What do you think are the required steps to prevent these incidences from occurring in future ? Or are these unavoidable ? Define greed. Who is not greedy? The miner trying to earn some profit? The trader trying to earn some profit? The developer trying to earn some profit? The investors trying to earn some profit? Govern officials trying to earn some profit? Small investors jumping in without understanding the basics of even bitcoin and driven by baseless propaganda? Was that not greed from people who don't understand anything and just ask in social media what to invest on? Now that it did not make them a millionaire someone else is greedy? They were being used as scapegoat to destroy whatever good is left in crypto. A fool and his money is soon parted. Not only that a fool is a liability on everybody else in the society including those who tried to give him good advise and only got insult or harm in return. These fools would have lost their money anywhere they would have invested why blame crypto market or bitcoin alone?   Hint: it is not greed that brought the system down it is something else but I would not like to point it out as that makes me unpopular and someone who can't see it himself will never understand that. I can only give hints with the hope if they get it themselves they will bot abuse me and will be helpful to them and me as well. There is no point discussing with people that are brainwashed in a certain way that is so visible by their use of words like greed, profiteering, etc. This is economic forum talk in terms of economics. If you are talking about economic greed then your post does not make any sense as it is contradictory as you cannot ban or legislate away economic greed without removing people's right to property and that is why I am saying this has a may be unconscious or unintended narrow political tunnel vision. You lined up the events right. But what was the fundamental economical problem with all of these platforms? Do you have the courage to admit that? You know it if you understand bitcoin. Think clearly without political and religious bias. Biases are your enemy as a decision maker. You should be free from all biases as much as possible to be a good decision maker. Think only in terms of economics, maths and stats. You will get the stone cold right answer. I will not provide the answer. You must work to free your mind of irrational biases. The last hint is it is not bitcoin's fault but bitcoin is being blamed because all of these salesy, marketing folks knew it is only bitcoin that can shore up their shit coins. Ultimately why \"people\" bought these? Somebody held a gun at their head to buy any of these shit coins? If not why are they behaving like crybabies? Finally what is the harm if \"People\" lose trust in crypto in general and move to other alternatives? People were not interested in bitcoin say 7 years back. Did that stop us from making money in bitcoin and crypto? It is advantageous if people do not buy good technology and we get the opportunity to buy it cheap for longer period in time. The later people will return to bitcoin or crypto the better it is for early responsible investors. This is basic Warren Buffet advice and he is right here. Your \"People\" has no opinion of their own. A few carefully placed articles and few advertisements with big tit beautiful hosts will again bring them back to crypto or whatever. How else they invested in these shit coins? They will anyway lose their money on whatever else they invest without understanding the basics be it financial markets, real estate, business, whatever unless they are lucky enough to win a lottery ticket and do not come back for more. What is your charge against the entrepreneurs? Their ideas were flawed? They themselves also lost money. Why did not \"people\" understand that? Many of us did and avoided all of these shit coins as media were touting them. There are many more left that will meet the same end. Until then someone may make money in those coins but that is just winning lottery. I am not going to touch them. Some may not have started as shit but adopted shitty ideas for any touchy feely cause that can motivate \"people\". The fish that took the bait has no responsibility for its demise? If you believe in a cause then go volunteer for that cause do not go through 5 pass throughs. Your time is the costliest donation to a cause. Everything else is advertisement or tax dodging or something even worse. I would just add ---- It is the intention of big old money that \"people\" lose trust in crypto in general and move to other alternatives. Bitcoin and crypto is the only asset where intelligent retail is ahead of Big Old money. They will use all arrows in their quiver to nail retail. Examples, regulation, using dumb retail to go against intelligent retail, media, advertisements, touchy feely ideas that will make people emotional. Just study Warren Buffet's statement about crypto in last year or so. I gave him credit where he is right. But ultimately he is not a nice man. You have to differentiate image building and subtle advertisements from reality. Many big banks and financial institutions doing the same. Why is sec denying convertibility of some bitcoin ETF? Who are they protecting? Small investors or their rich old connected buddies? Think. Make a habit of thinking.",
