They had issued multiple formal statements around this. You can refer to this PDF file below, https://www.bb.org.bd/mediaroom/circulars/fepd/sep152022fepd24e.pdfThis one seems relatively new but if you find their list of circulars, you will find old files as well. Their stance has always been negative around cryptocurrency and it has not changed unfortunately.",

We can see why the government will never accept crypto currencies as it will just make the people strong, and government do not want that to happen.Sadly, the Cryptocurrency laws are made by the governments, which are usually not much popular among the citizens and general public.",

In addition, cryptocurrency transactions are contrary to financial regulation and state law. In September 2014, the Central Bank of Bangladesh reported that two crypto-traders could be sentenced to long prison terms under a strict money-laundering law.Looking at the regulatory and legislative framework, one can conclude that cryptocurrency is completely banned in Bangladesh and this is not a recommendation. It's just that for some reason this particular article says these are recommendations.",

Whenever you have something new and potentially disruptive to the current system, embracing it and regulating would require a significant legislative effort, which less-developed countries are either unwilling to do, or just lack competent people with the right expertise.On the flip side, a complete ban on cryptocurrencies would also require some effort, i.e. in defining what cryptocurrencies actually are (i.e. would the ban cover any form of trading any digital goods/tokens?). So often times they end up with some weird half-bans when they just instruct banks not to support any crypto-related transfers etc.",

The government might restrict it's agencies from dealing with these virtual coins but the citizens are not restricted from buying or selling them. There are many exchanges operating in Bangladesh and I am sure they have the licences to operate issued by the government. Since it is not a criminal offence to use cryptocurrencies according to the law, the government is just trying to regulate it's use and not necessarily criminalizing it.Most of these government officials just base their decisions on hearsays or rumours. They are not willing to study and understand the Bitcoin space, they just copy and replicate policies they get from most these international lending organizations. If they are openhearted to learn about this innovation, they will be able to comprehend that Bitcoin has the potential of freeing them from the financial oppression and colonialisation of developed nations.",

If one assumes these statistics actually reflect the current state of affairs, then there are a number of \"illegal transactions\" involving more than 8k BTC made by Bangladeshis. This means that there is a loophole in the bitcoin trading ban.1. https://fiatmarketcap.com",

Of course, no one will dispute that there are ways to buy BTC without the authorities finding out, but the extent to which this happens in a particular country is just speculation.",
