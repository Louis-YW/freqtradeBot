  "content": "My View for the bitcoin Market or Price on Bull and Bear for the investorsThe Bear MarketI have been thinking of this since. Those who have been in the bitcoin investment from the beginning or from 2013 to date that have seen the highest (ATH) bull market will take this as bear market and also those who joined the league in the early 2022 will also take this market as a bear one because as of then bitcoin price was reading $41k to $42k and that was my early stage in the journey so I am also at the category of seen this market as the bear market. They are also happy for this bear market because they are using it to accumulate more bitcoin to their portfolio. So they too are not affect much in the bear market, because most of them sold parts of their bitcoin in the bull market in the year 2021. So they are using this period to buy more and hodle for the next bill market again.The Bull MarketThose who bought bitcoin last year when bitcoin was $15k,$16k,$17k,$18k and $19k sees this Bear Market as a Bull Market. Because they invested in bitcoin when the price was far below to the present price. And I don't think they are also joining the first set of people or investors to cry for the bear market. As for me they are not in market but for bull market until when the market go below their capital, then they have also joined the bear market as for now they are in bull. ConclusionThe two bitcoin markets or prices favor everyone because those who join early have benefited before and now they are gathering again. And those who join in the middle of last year, are also enjoying the benefits now. And those who join this year have small negative impact but not much but probably they are also still at the positive side. Those who invested in the bear are now happy while those who invested in the bull are not oka now but since they could not do otherwise, they are gathering more to their portfolios What do you say about this?",

It is bull market when bitcoin increased from $15500 to $30000. Do not think that after halving is only bull market.Quote from: Agbe on August 27, 2023, 09:42:26 PMAnd those who join this year have small negative impact but not much but probably they are also still at the positive side. Do you know that bitcoin was at $16000 this year in January? Bitcoin stayed at $30000 for a long time this year though.Quote from: Agbe on August 27, 2023, 09:42:26 PMThose who invested in the bear are now happy while those who invested in the bull are not oka now but since they could not do otherwise, they are gathering more to their portfoliosSome people invested at low price and they continue to DCA. Some people invested at high price and continue to DCA. Some people might invested at low price but still looking to buy more. Some people may invest at high price and think not to buy more. People are different, people think differently.",

Hope am getting that right?Possibly yeah, that could be the case for most because, you are making profit and that counts as bull for them but then again, when you aren’t making profit and price seems to have fallen below where you bought at, it goes to count as bear for you.Still, the bear and bull market has got a large part of its determination in connection with the ATH and how long price tends to dwell within a region, either far or close to the ATH or around the dip. Hope I did keep that simply enough but, your idea isn’t overly said though but, it wouldn’t have a place for those who DCA as, they wouldn’t have to consider price on particulate coin purchase but as a whole of there hodlings.",

This gets connected with all forms of growth happening around as well as the employment opportunities created. The real bull market can be experienced based on the money circulation happening around. When it is bullish it is possible to see good volume of money invested by the people and when it is bearish people tend to stay on the safer side and investments won't be much.

This is why, people have their own versions of bull and bearish season.But whatever the market is in, one should know how to take advantage of the opportunity that presents to him.Because if someone is waiting for the bearish season to buy a specific alt, that period may not come at all.",

They believed in decentralization and acted! Now they profit. Mid-year joiners' late vision yielded good profits. But to those who joined this year out of FOMO or hype? So their inexperience may hurt, but there's hope. Better learning, adaptation, and strategy are needed.Every investor, regardless of entrance point or expertise, has a unique perspective. Remember, bitcoin is more than an investment. It's a revolutionary idea with value beyond chart numbers. How do I say? Invest prudently, educate, and believe in bitcoin's potential. This game is about long-term vision, not bull or bear.",

Those who bought in 2013 if they have held at least part of their investment until today have benefited enormously, and those who bought in this cycle at $69K and sold when the downturn came will be pulling their hair out in the next bull market. Today there are a lot of Bitcoin haters who bought at the peak of some previous cycle, sold in panic shortly thereafter, and deep down want Bitcoin to go to 0 so as not to acknowledge their mistake. It would be better for him to recognize his mistake and buy back Bitcoin for the very long term.",

Like Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy are Bitcoin maximalist and supporter. Peter Schiff is a famous Bitcoin hater.With Bitcoin haters, you must be careful and suspicious because they can accumulate bitcoin silently while they don't say anything good, bullish about Bitcoin.Bullish?The bullish case for Bitcoin, on Amazon",

Bitcoin price has dropped from 30k to 25k but this can be seen as a mere part of corrupted bitcoin. And the rise in Bitcoin price from 16K to 30K is not what we call a direct bull market. But we can usually accumulate bitcoins by holding because of the opportunities that await us at the present time. Bitcoin price (30k-25k) has come from highs to lows, if we can hold at this time then it will definitely be worthwhile to accumulate bitcoins.",

Someone's portfolio being able to increase because of an improvement of market price does not mean that they are automatically in the bull run market. It is just a mere correction that gave them a profit as the market does not move in only one direction. So when there is bull run, it is always obvious to everyone that the market has gone green. It will not only be applicable to bitcoin but altcoins too.",

It is only those who out of FOMO that bought at ATH that wouldn't be profitable. It is only on the bearish market that what OP stated comes to play. During the bearish market, that is when your entry price determines if you are in profit or loss. Those who was privilege to buy below the price of bitcoin at the bearish market will say that they are in profit. Then those who bought above the price that bitcoin is in a bearish market will say that they are at loss. Bitcoin investment needs patient and long term hodling for you to worry less about the price. We are in the bearish market no matter the correction in the price of bitcoin and DCA should be done.",
