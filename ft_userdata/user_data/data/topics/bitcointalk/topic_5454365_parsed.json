Investing in Bitcoin with long strategy spanning 3 years is a good and prudent approach, provided you have sufficient source of incomes to finance your monthly installments of loan. However as we are all well aware of that all financial markets are volatile and in particular Bitcoin which can potentially fall to the extent of 80%, as shown in its historical trends. Therefore , success of your plan will largely depend on your ability to continue funding your loan installments and Bitcoin market market movement in line with your expectation within next 3 years. It would be wise to carefully consider all risk factors before making investment decision.",

I think that’s your first hiccup. Borrowing money from the bank for investment purposes which could or could not give you a good profits after a while is not ideal. The interest accrued would be accumulating while you wait for the profit from your investments that may never come. In this scenario, one thing’s for sure, the money owed to the bank would have to be paid irrespective of you having a profit or not. If you want to hold all of your money in bitcoin, good for you. But knowing amongst your daily expenses, you might have to use fiat to pay for whatever, why hold all your money in bitcoin. Personally, I wouldn’t put the whole of my money on one particular asset.

There are risks involved especially in Bitcoin but also with gold and other assets; nothing is assured. For a very volatile asset, it would be wrong to expect huge and instant profit. Also, it would depend on the amount you would be invest; higher risk leads to high returns but would also mean bigger risk if ever things won't go as expected. Taking a loan would be a good idea but it does depend to where would you use it  As far as I have known, it would be better to use it with properties in particular with field of leasing in order to generate profit continuously unlike with other assets which would require you to wait for a better market behavior.",

Because it's your money in the first place. And maybe to others, they will say that your way is not good, but even so, if you borrow money to buy Bitcoin and other cryptos there is no problem as long as it does not cause problems for you.It's hard to get a loan but you don't have a source from which you can get the money to pay off the loan, right, but if you have a job and a business that you're busy with, I don't see a problem with that as long as you can manage it properly, go ahead. just the important thing is that you know the consequences of the decision you will make.",

Because no one will know how the world conditions, the economy, technological developments and also global market conditions will be in the coming year, although good planning is really needed for everyone who wants to rise to be rich in their life.

Shitcoins have no future, the best outcome is a pump in short term where you should get out of them immediately if that pump happened. And better yet not enter until the pump starts.Secondly the economy is in a very weird situation starting from last year and will continue being in this state for the foreseeable future. This means this type of investment (taking loan and investing in cryptocurrencies) is extremely high risk specially since the altcoin market will be dumped hard multiple times in times like this.Finally the loan itself is the worst idea ever because the governments that are struggling to keep the inflation low are and will continue increasing interest rates and that eats up into that little possible profit you were hoping to make.As they say never invest what you can't afford to lose.",

But even a bitcoin maximalist Woolf advise you to have some funds in fiat because of daily expenses and unplanned expenses too. Going to bitcoin to every time when one needs funds to spend doesn’t seems right to me because there are days and even weeks where bitcoin would be dumping due to its volatility mostly during the bearish period and it is bad to sell at this particular period because of the losses it incurs.

Many people have experienced the losses of buying Bitcoin through credit. Are you sure about this, you should think again. Not all your plans are likely to work as they are. This is true for all of us. You still managed to come up with a plan. Now reconsider your plan and listen to the topics mentioned in the comments. This is my humble suggestion to you.Of course, not all comments may be correct, but you can review and analyze within the framework of your own logic.

If you want to borrow to invest in a volatile market, what is your shock absorber when you are not making profit?  If you talk of getting a loan , do you also talk of interest rate on the loan depending on where you got the loan. Of course it is difficult to get loan from family to invest in cryptocurrency because most families believe the loan will not be profitable in the business, that the money will disappear in the market. If you are getting a third party loan or through the bank then you can be sure to add 10%-11% interest on the loan. Add such interest up and know what percentage margin in profit that you are expecting before repayment. Take the advise that you have not made a real visibility study on your 3 years plan if you want to rely on loan for it, you are better with saving up the money than going for loan.",

But how does the loan system work? I mean with interest every year that you are sure to bear and what kind of guarantee is it to maintain the borrower's trust? As far as I know, having a loan for 3 years is a very risky loan and the guarantee level is definitely not easy.
