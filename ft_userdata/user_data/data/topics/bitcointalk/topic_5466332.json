Some people don't calculate well because of somethings that is not necessary, so what I want us to understand is that investment is better than drinking and smoking There is this saying that goes \"if you don't smoke, you may drink and if you don't drink, then you may womanized''. I'm not sure you why you never included the rest because every man has what he loves to kill his time with, it's what they love doing and all of them involve money. If you smoke expensive cigarettes, by the time you calculate all of that, you will be calculation million naira at the end of the year, same for expensive drinks, womanizing to keep up with expensive lifestyle and impress and gambling. But to those who does all of this, they don't complain or see it as waste of money, they even have more on investment than you think.Life is too short not too catch fun, I am sure you also see rich men buy expensive drinks for each other, they don't see it as waste but as a symbol of rich class life, an ordinary can not afford to do that but if they have the means, they will do the same, hence why they settle for small drinks like Heineken, Budweiser, High life and other brands to enjoy the little they have with their friends.",

Not everyone knows how to trade and manage investments. If they don’t know how to do that, they will end up losing all what they have invested. Bitcoin investment could be a reliable alternative, but not everyone can still manage that without having fear in them of losing the money to market volatility.",

An addicted smoker will take a very long time before he stops smoking, this is if he wants to stop because the money that they use to buy cigarettes is cheap and sometimes people buy for them, because smokers care for his fellow smokers. It is not easy to stop something that you are addicted to like smokong,drinking,drugs and womanising. On the other hand not all smokers' are not investing or don't have an investment. There are many wealthy people that has investment everywhere that are smoking and drinking. It is just a pity that you only see the smokers that don't have an investment. You should also know that bitcoin investment is not for all but only for people who can take the risk to invest because they believe in it. Let's not criticize because we have one or two close relations that smokes or drinks knowingly or unknow to us.",

Some people don't calculate well because of somethings that is not necessary, so what I want us to understand is that investment is better than drinking and smoking  Well your point was well stated as smoking is hazardous to the health, and gambling is not 100% a good  investment to people who lack knowledge of a proper risk management methods. Smoking Marijuana  per say is been prescribed by doctors in some countries as a remedy in correcting some health issues. For instance smoking has been proven to reduce the split of cancer cells,  and it has also been said that it also helps in reducing the rate of depression amongst young folks. I usually observe the level of confidence I feel from people  who just finished taking mariduana lol... I view gambling  as a very good means of making  quick and legal money as it has been approved in many countries. The chance of losing your money in gambling  is very high and the chance of winning is slim of which I know, but i will not say gambling is bad because i have seen some family who was struggling financially  suddenly gain quick financial elevations and are able to compete  in financial market and business to met a good leaving standard.  My advice in  gambling is to invest what you could afford to lose and apply a good risk management technique and you're good to go and smokers are liable to die young.",

They will even see it as bad idea.In this case a gambler may even change to start invest the money they are using to gamble, because they have patient, example those that are playing bet, they can booked games for a month and be wait for so long and see if they will win, but a smoker cannot even miss a day without testing a cigarette, unless God is ready to change them.
