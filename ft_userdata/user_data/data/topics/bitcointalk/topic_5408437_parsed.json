Bitcoin is alternative to fiat and fiat payment networks, not to stock market or the whole financial system.If only Bitcoin could not follow the s&p 500 anymore  I'd really like that, but for now we're stuck in this situation where dollar goes up - bitcoin and stocks go down. Some wall street company decides it doesn't like bitcoin anymore and we go down. Te SEC, which shouldn't have anything to do with bitcoin, does something and bitcoin reacts.",

It is now at a stage in which it is able to create surprisingly real results.Some of the best systems at the moment are Google’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2.This is one of the examples created by Imagen, using only text as an input (teddy bear swimming butterfly):They are getting better and better every few months.
