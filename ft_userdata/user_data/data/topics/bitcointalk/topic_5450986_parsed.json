But if you're aiming for nonstop profits in this cuckoo crypto cosmos, you gotta be gutsy and welcome the wild. Who knows, maybe your next fat payday comes from investing in the hot new altcoin - or betting your life's moolah on rock-paper-scissors with a chimp.Okay, that last one might be a tad extra. But the takeaway? To rock the crypto trading scene, think outside the box and gamble. And hey, maybe you'll be the one chortling your way to the bank - or at least your piggy bank. So, inhale deeply, hug the chaos, and remember: change is the only constant in crypto trading. And that's the thrilling - and horrifying - crux of it all. But c'mon, life's all about taking a leap, right? As the legendary philosopher Shia LaBeouf (or was it Nike?) proclaimed, \"Just do it.",

Somewhat despite of the unpredictability but we do have ways which we could at least sustainor survive somehow. Just continue on what you are doing on where if there are really some errors then you would be needing to adjust, its just like that on which you should really go with the flow and not reallymake yourself that impulsive. If you are really that type who do easily get that getting panic or what then you should really learn on how to control off your emotions.",

You can never expect to have consistent profits all the time, trading has its own share of inevitable losses. Even how good or pro you are, you will never win over the market all the time. However, if you only trade on the amount you are ready to lose, then that would be better especially for a beginner. Trading only serves as a side hustle, it can or can’t be profitable no matter how you predicted it right.",

You really need to find some other things for you to release that tension and stress from trading. I doubt if we can actually maintain from profiting when we’re in real trading. The market is not always safe to trade, so there are really instances that you are force to stop and just focus on long term hodling on your chosen investment. But if what you mean is to reduce your risk or losing, you can always do that by knowing when to trade and what potential coins to trade. Maintaining profitability is actually good, but you can’t actually expect it to be happening from an uncertain and unpredictable market.",

But it takes a lot of risks and skills to do that. Even pros in trading cannot guarantee bigger capital results into bigger profits.

That way, a trader can determine when he enters and exits the market, including which coin to trade.Increasing capital is not necessary because it still requires self-control; besides, increasing capital can trigger the use of all capital or all-in in trading. That is why I prefer to use the same capital in trading and only increase my capital if my profits have multiplied.Don't be too eager to chase big profits in one trade and rather make regular profits.

The market is unpredictable which means that the price of a particular cryptocurrency can fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably and how can you find accurate research, which means, you can't maintain profitability in crypto trading.So IMO, you can't maintain it, just accept the reality that every now and then there's a high chance that your capital either small or big might easily to wipe out.  Crypto trading requires discipline, patience, and a long-term perspective to gain profit.",

This should be followed because if you go with the  trend you will earn profit if you go against the trend you will always be in loss.Because the big whales are controlling the market and you can never control the market. You have to go with them.you should always choose good and best cryptocurrency for trading.Never choose coins that pump once in years.Try to enter the coins that have more volatility,But special attention should be paid to the timing of where to take the entry.",

If you want to maintain your constant profit, let's trade less. Hang out more and trade less, it will reduce your failed trades.Quote2) Conduct market research: For you to maintain constant profits in your crypto trading, you need to be active in carrying out your personal research daily to know the season we are in the market either bulling season which is the best season every traders want to be swimming in profits making all the time or bearing season which is the season Many traders use to hold their coins very well not to miss their profits.Trading and holding are different. Holding is more related to a market season, bear or bull. Trading is available in both market seasons as bull or bear, market has its waves which give you chances to trade.Quote3) Increase your capital: if you want to maintain profits in your crypto trading, you need to work hard to increase your capital so that it will help you to buy huge amount of coins that will help you to maintain your regular profits in the market.I disagree.Increasing your capital will bring more pressure that can increase your bad decision, more mistakes then profit will turn to loss. Don't increase your capital for trading, try to maintain it the same. If you double your capital from trading, withdraw 50% of it like your saving. Continue with your initial capital, again and again. Even if after 10 rounds, you suddenly lost your initial capital, you still have your savings which is x9 of your initial capital. Good enough.",

It's a really dumb idea to \"increase capital\" because in the first place, like any trading, you set your targets, set your limits, most important is your starting capital.If you think you need $100, then start with that, don't start with less and \"top up\" later.If you're topping up capital as a trader, you should really start realizing you're behaving like a gambler, who deposits more and more as he loses.Besides with leverage why does anyone need a big capital?",

Like my daily profit, the target is not that big, It's around $2 to $4 dollars daily if possible and i have around $300 in capital if that's not enough then i will collect some more but i am afraid if i didn't start to earn my target on daily bases I will lose my capital too, to meet daily expenses. The point is, your aforementioned points are not enough to make me able to get my daily target, Why? i have no or less technical analysis but i daily observe the market and new cycles and always try to understand why such big (green) or small (red) candles are created. Which indicates i have good skills in fundamental analysis. i would love to hear from you more if you could help me out in achieving my target, i can easily achieve my target in future trading but i don't prefer it and don't like it, so, it narrow downed trading options.
