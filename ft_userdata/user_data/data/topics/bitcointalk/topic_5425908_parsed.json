You can search more on google for the same. They have not been developed to that dangerous level, current AI robots also only stop at assisting humans in difficult or life-threatening situations. They are not as scary as the characters in the fantasy movies created by Marvel, I don't think there will be a real life version of Ultron.But with the current development of AI, what I am more worried about is that they will gradually replace people in working environments, and people will gradually lose their jobs and positions in society. That's the flip side of technology becoming so modern.",

But more in a self aware scifi way. And i have hard time believing that he understands AI tech well enough to have any sort of meaningful opinion about this. And yes i know he owns cutting edge ai tech firms. But i still wouldn't give his views too much weight. He isn't the engineer building them nor he could.Ai in the sense of this tech makes sense a lot. There has been many shootings by police and frankly i would be more afraid of a human police then ai police. Even in a case where ai makes an error it would be fraction of errors humans do when they wield a gun adrenaline running in their system while they need to make judgements in a fraction of a second. Naturally they want to stay alive so they rather shoot first.",

At least humans are careful when they are handling a crime situation because they would be held responsible for their actions, but robots can malfunction and cause grave danger. Humans can creatively handle a situation based on the circumstances surrounding the events but robots are programmed to act similarly regardless of the peculiarity of the situation.Robots can be deployed to handle dangerous situations such as hostage-taking or kidnapping by armed criminals. We have had issues where police had to wait for hours outside a school building because it was very dangerous to enter the school premises while a gunman kept shooting innocent school children. A robot with a clear order to eliminate the gunman would have disarmed the gunman.But sending robots to handle protests or trivial issues might turn out disastrous. I don't see robots as the future of policing, they might complement the efforts of humans in the nearest future.",

We could even have Ukraine robots battling it out with Russian robots... for all those folks who enjoy wars.Wouldn't that be a wonderful life?",

Strap a bunch of C4 to a remote controlled vehicle, then bring it close to the suspect and detonate. Sure, there might be a little clean up required afterwards but it did kill the guy.Next, they might strap gatling guns to these robots so it won't make such a mess. A small taste as to what law enforcement might look like in the future. Then when these devices get AI software installed, that's when the real fun begins.",

And it is an answer that many nations and individual people understand.If you are going to be the boss of your nation, you absolutely MUST give your people freedom to a great extent. You at least have to give them enough freedom so that THEY think they are free. If you do this, they will support you forever. If you don't, you will fail... even if you seem to be successful with your people.",

But the people have been trained by movies and the courts to not use it very much. The answer is the 12-person jury.In the US, the 12-person jury can decide anything they want regarding any case that they are the JUDGES for. The can contradict almost any law that exists, and interpret or re-interpret what any law means right down to the Constitution, itself. The important part is that their decision only works with the current case.For example. If you drive 125 MPH in a 25 zone, get arrested, and take it to trial, the jury (if you require one) could let you off scott free if you can convince them to do so. But they won't let you convince them, because they don't want some joker driving past their house at 125 MPH.Common people in a jury have sense. And every, Every, EVERY supposed wrongdoing can be brought before a jury for adjudication. The fear of potential jury action is what has made the US so successful within. But the courts have supposedly shot the knowledge of jury action down in the eyes of the people, so that few average people use it any longer.Police killer robots in America is something that will be struck down by the populace, through juries, if not on the general principle of \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
