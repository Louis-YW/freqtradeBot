  "content": "I still have an armory wallet. Otherwise I would not bother.dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of armory: armory depends on python-qt4; however:  Package python-qt4 is not installed. armory depends on python-twisted; however:  Package python-twisted is not installed.Please advice, any help appreciated. OMG. I just saw in another thread \"Aside from the above, make absolutely sure that \"prune block storage to\" setting is disabled\"I need the full BTC DB and can't use prune? I have to download 435 GB?I should have never used armory in the first place. This is a nightmare. How can I extract the keys if I can't get amory to run and convert it to a regular bitcoin wallet?qt4,  435GB, I feel dizzy. Armory 0.96.5,  released 2018. I want to cry.  What Ubuntu version would I have to install to get armory back to work?And if I download 10GB a day it would still take 2 months to have the blockchain.",

You are looking at 2 different things here:- Blockchain size:You have to have a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is a design choice for Armory, it's a full wallet.- Qt4:That, along with py2, have been deprecated a long time ago, no modern OS support this stuff anymore. In the dev branch, there's a version that runs on py3/qt5 but it's not very user friendly. Assuming you do not want to download chain, you have 2 approaches to accessing your funds:1. export the private keys to Electrum2. build the dev branch from source. I'll then provide you with a remote supernode from which you can query your balance data. That will allow you to create transactions to move your funds out. This is a more involved process than the first option and will require more effort on your end than the first option. I'll try to handhold you along the way however. Up to you.",
