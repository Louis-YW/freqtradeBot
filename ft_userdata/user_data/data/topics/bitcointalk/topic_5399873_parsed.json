With such an interest rate, it is probably another Ponzi scheme.Just use the option at the bottom of the page and move this post to \"Investor-based games\", because from what I understood from your description, this service will be more relevant to that section - link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=207.0",

This sounds like a Ponzi scheme or scam site. How would this company make profit or cover their running cost? What are they investing your money on and how much returns would they get from the investment? Please watch before you leap because you might end up loosing your hard earned money. This 28% profit offer is to attract greedy investor that have been blindfolded by this offer. This platform might pay the first few investors so that they can refer other people and immediately the get enough investors the site would just closeup.",

Didn't you realize this is a ponzi scheme?",

The minimum amount to invest in that website is too big for me, and I am too afraid to lose that. Even if some people are willing to risk their money by investing on that site, I still do not recommend them to do that. It is better to use $1000 to buy bitcoin and hold it for some time. That will guarantee you to make a big profit in the future. But all in all, you have your own decision.",
