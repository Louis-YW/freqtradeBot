Second, you're saying centralized exchange is good to make people know how crypto actually works and make them know are then more than wallet, but why you're saying P2P at the end? P2P and centralized exchange are work in a different way.Third, altcoins are centralized and they don't mind follow the regulations or licenses. But, Bitcoin is used without need to touch government or licenses, those countries aren't asking a permissions to Satoshi for accept, tax, or ban Bitcoin, they just do whatever they want. Bitcoin doesn't need to get licensed or regulated, it's only need the government will not doing anything to Bitcoin adoption.",

It represents the government since it’s a medium to regulate all the Bitcoin holders that will use this service. Other exchange that goes crap is an evidence that they are not the Bitcoin representative since Bitcoin can’t be take down. Maybe we can consider that centralize exchange are the leach on crypto sucking profit on the Bitcoin popularity.",

Here no third party exist and it’s mostly preferred by crypto-currency enthusiast.To have a broader picture of what exchanges are about decentralized and centralized read through this post.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2906237.msg29885570#msg29885570In addition there are dangers to exchanges that’s why it’s well recommended to never leave your funds on any exchange at all, some exchange bosses gambles with the funds of users as it was in the FTX case, also  Exchanges has been under continuous attacks by hackers and scammers.https://www.wired.com/story/hack-binance-cryptocurrency-exchange/",

If you want to hold the coins, then wallets and specifically cold wallets are best for these types of things. If you store or save your coins in any exchange, then the chances of losing your coins will increase, as in any exchange, you don’t have complete access on your coins. There is always someone who can access to your coins if the exchange gets hacked. Yes crypto exchanges no doubt made purchasing and selling Bitcoins or cryptos easier, but holding the coins there for long term is still not safe.",

Many of the people are just into the crypto space to make profits which is not the sole purpose of bitcoin only. Let’s take license from the government as a study. Been regulated by the government is similar to handing over people’s data to the government when ever it is needed. Also the custodianship of ones fund exhibit by centralized exchanges is one of the biggest challenges I go against them because they assure investors that their funds are save and gullible people store it on them. Should this funds be lost on it due to the exchange bankruptcy or either been hacked, it will actually have a negative impact on cryptocurrency adoption than its positivity. Let’s just simply say that this exchanges are just like our banks",

Our world revolves around fiat. Most people don't get paid in crypto and merchants for the most part don't support it as a payment method so exchanges are kind of like a bridge where we could get crypto or convert them to fiat so we can buy things.I'd say most people will at least dabble into it couple/several times.Quote from: crypticj on May 01, 2023, 07:29:28 AMI think the best way is to use the exchange to buy crypto or like a P2P platform, but hold all crypto on the wallet, preferably a cold one.Yes, that is the general advice.Quote from: crypticj on May 01, 2023, 07:29:28 AMBut what do you think about it?I know that many people hate centralized platforms so I want to hear your thoughts.In our forum, yes, many people are at least hostile about it but this is only with CEXs that are custodial - they hold your funds in their wallet you have no access to.In general tho, I'd say most people don't care.",

This whole thing of having someone represent Bitcoin ended badly years ago with the Bitcoin Foundations' failures and scandals, so why stick to something like this?Exchanges should represent only their business and their company, nothing else.Quote from: crypticj on May 01, 2023, 07:29:28 AMIn my opinion, exchanges are great for people who want to try buying crypto and don't want to dig into a ditails.

It would had been great if they collectively enlightened their customers but they won't because of the fear of losing liquidity on their exchange platforms which goes to show how they care more about their profits than the wellbeing of their customers which is why centralized exchanges aren't to be trusted.",
