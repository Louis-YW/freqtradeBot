A correction was a common thing after the merge already happened but you must also remember if the upcoming update will give ethereum hardcap supply and so the impact must be for long term.",

Right now holding Ethereum is a gamble because just like you, Many traders is just speculating whatever you are thinking and this the reason why the price is unpredictable right now. There’s a chance that Ethereum will really dump after the merge including the crypto market because that hype news start this minor crypto recovery. Everything might fall apart or there will be a massive fomo buy after the merger finish.",

Don't you think bitcoin will always be sitting at the bottom to see that happened? I meant yeah you can predict it to happen but ethereum can't leave from impact created by bitcoin. Ethereum was doing a big update but i shall remind you that if that will give short term impact.  The fact that if people must also aware if ethereum will not reach new ATH if bitcoin will not reach new ATH first. Bitcoin first and then ethereum. I never see ethereum could decouple from bitcoin even when there was a huge update like burn or merge",

Having said that, if you are asking this sort of question, do not expect too much from it, users would only tell you what they think, whether verified or not, and more often than not, people will tell you exactly what they have done, for example, those that have sold will advise you to sell, whilst those that haven't sold, will tell you not to; so it is up to you mate, DYOR.",

I do not believe that its price is going to crash after the merge. But as we always have naysayers in the market, we may see a little impact temporarily but that will give me another awesome opportunity to do DCA and bring down the buying price.So no selling for me! There are only two coins in the market that we can trust. Bitcoin and ETH. Rest all are shitcoins.",

It is definitely true that the first effects of the news that the merge will happen soon have already worn of again in terms of the price. Back then when the news became pulbic that the merge is coming quicker than expected the prices rose up quickly from 1700$ to 2000$ per ETH. Now we are down to levels below 1500$ again though as the overall market conditions are just still not good.If the merge will be successful then i think the price will at least not drop and as time passes the price of ETH should slowly but surely climb again.",

Sell ethereum if you don't want to keep it for long and now might be the best time to get rid of this asset, which could become cheaper due to the merger. It is better to evaluate advice not as recommendations for action, because no one can know for sure how ethereum will react to upcoming events.

However, the third wheel suggests that all the miners in the world will wait until this happens and they would love to see ETH go up a little more and as soon as this happens then they might sell out as much as they could to recover their profits. Since with changed algorithm they wont be much useful and compensation does not seem to be viable option here since it’s not like ETH would be able to give dividend or something. Best choice is to wait until we close to the timelines of merger and be quick to go on crazy sell after this happens.",
