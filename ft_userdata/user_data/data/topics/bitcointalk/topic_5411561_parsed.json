  "content": "This is one of potentially a series of posts I'll be making for Bitcointalk on the crypto casino industry, how I see things playing out, and where we go from here.TL;DR - if you want to go up against the king, you should probably be better than them in some way.Full disclaimer ahead of time: my team and I are in the process of building a crypto casino. Most of us are relatively new entrants to this particular space; our expertise lies in crypto, influencers and sportsbooks which all have aspects of similarity but I fully acknowledge there are some industry specific details that I may be overlooking.For the past few months, I’ve been keeping a very close eye on crypto casinos. Very rarely will a new platform or feature come out that we didn’t have some idea of ahead of time, and I could probably name every single platform worth knowing and their full feature set with my eyes closed. Through this obsession, it’s become extremely apparent that differentiation is a massive missing piece in the crypto casino puzzle. To give context as to why this is occurring, this is an industry where taking risks can be difficult. A lot of people will comment on regulation within the space, but there are still frameworks that need to be abided by - these frameworks affect what products you can offer, who you can offer to, and various details around accepting funds. As well as that, a lot of the times you really don’t need to differentiate to produce decent revenue. Gamdom and Duelbits are good examples of this. It’s hard to point to any degree of actual differentiation, yet they’re still making a considerable amount of money (from what we’ve observed).To some degree, benefit of the doubt can be awarded to a few competitors who are trying various things but retain similarity to Stake. Rollbit seem like they’re trying to pivot more to short-dated, highly leveraged crypto derivatives, and their NFT jackpot and Rollbot schemes are interesting at the very least. BC.Game do a lot, they’re targeting a very specific audience and seem to be doing very well at that.In saying that, some things cannot be excused. An easy example is Punt.com - I’m not going to rip into them too hard, but calling that anything other than a carbon copy of Stake is insane. Punt has claimed to have guidance from their ‘close friend’ Eddie at Stake, but to some extent I doubt the validity of that. Another example is Slotella; all you need to do is look at their logo.Stake does a lot of things well, and they’re not the biggest in the market for no reason. Making ‘provably fair’ the standard for house games, the design of their gamecards (props to whoever came up with that Stunna), a simple but thoughtful interface. Stake have built a very good basis for inspiration that I can’t fault people for modelling their own sites off - however if it’s anything but inspiration, there’s really not a tonne of respect you can give. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I don’t know if many of you were trading on BitMEX back in the glory days of 100x leverage, but this is not an uncommon thing to occur in a super fast-moving industry. BitMEX were one of the first to really do crypto derivatives properly, and as a result they very quickly became the king within that space - platforms were popping up left and right trying to do what BitMEX did, some even blatantly stealing entire pages full of MEX’s copy on how the derivatives were structured. Unfortunately for them, BitMEX *invented* these products; any competitor that was a mere copy (Deribit, ByBit, Bitmax) struggled to gain footing on the scale that MEX was. Why would someone leave BitMEX for a shittier alternative?As you can see today, BitMEX has well and truly fallen off. The issue is that through all of the platforms that popped up, one team launched an exchange that seemed to tick a lot of the boxes that BitMEX couldn’t. FTX. Backed by some of the biggest names in the space, with some of the smartest people working on it, with a product that was made very precisely around the actual behaviours of a trader. At face value though, it seemed like they had a platform that could be slotted in the exact same basket as all the others. BitMEX retained complacency, FTX continued building to what it is today, the rest is history.Whilst this might seem to be a totally unrelated story about companies within a different sector, the same principles can be applied to the crypto casino industry. You have one, massive incumbent who innovated a lot of what we see today (Stake); multiple competitors who hold a small but notionally considerable percentage of the market (Duelbits, Gamdom, Roobet, etc); a rapidly evolving space with huge potential upside. The only thing that’s missing is the competitor that will finally give Stake a run for its money. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------At the end of the day, real competition is good for the space. Whilst it might be hard to imagine for those of you who have been gambling and posting here since 2016 or earlier, we are still extremely early in terms of the evolution of this industry. Exciting things are happening within tech, crypto and the internet as a whole, and it seems like that hasn't fully converted to gambling just yet - a big reason is due to the lack of actual competition. Competition forces companies to either change or risk being left behind. Those that build, keep up and grow; those that copy slowly die out. We'll soon see which is which.2023 is the year of S______.com.",

      "body": "In the end, a casino is simply a casino. What makes it stand out is mainly the games it offers and the bonuses provided. But still, they share many of the game providers, rakeback structure, etc. After all, players want the best bang for their buck, not just winning what they wagered. So saying X is the best, and such is pretty much subjective because they excel in different areas. Casino A could be holding frequent giveaways, casino B could be generous with affiliate commissions, just saying.Those that want to pioneer in something new need to risk their funds. If all is fine and dandy, good but what happens when the market goes south like now? Many NFTs have lost their ATH value. Rollbit's fortunate they have the financial strength to commit, but for the rest, they might not. Some do try to reinvent the wheel but without sustainable income, they ultimately collapse. If players are ripping the site from left to right, it's all useless.",

      "body": "Moreover, there will always be room for competition in every field/market, of which the gambling casino industry is not left out, because in as much as most new casinos now copy the features and style of old existing casinos, there will always be only one who offers the satisfactory delivery to it's targeted customers/gamblers at every moment. And the users knows that and they are going to stick to such casino. Because one thing that will make a casino stand out in the midst of others is it's ability to update according to the request of it's gamblers, give them what they want, how they want it and when they want it on time. So i am personally not against copycat",

This shows again how popular our forum is for crypto users. You are right that there has been a rise of crypto casinos over the years and the market has become very competitive. There are basically two ways for a new casino to acquire marketshares. The first one is by offering something new that other casinos don't offer, this could be new games, better service or other feature. The second way is by offering better terms than existing casinos. If there are higher bonuses or higher chances of winning for the gamblers than it will attract a lot new customers. In both cases its important to run a marketing campaign to inform potential customers of the advantages of your casino. The forum can play a big role to promote a new website and new gambling games. Good luck with your casino and I hope you will keep us updated on the progress. If you need any help there are a lot of freelance workers offering their services here on the forum, with many already worked in the gambling industry before.",

      "body": "Thank you for your interesting post but I didn't really understand your point. Do you think those copycats are a good thing or a bad one for the players/customers at the end?If Stake doesn't respect its customers or scams them, it will get a bad reputation and people will fly away to its close competitors. But if it takes care to remain honest, respectful, transparent and professional toward its customers, there is no point for them to leave it for a copycat casino offering the same features and the same games/markets with less bonuses and promotions or smaller odds and RTP, while they have maybe an already high ranked account with interesting bonuses there.  Regarding Bitmex, Arthur Hayes already admitted he didn't invent the main product of Bitmex, the Inverse futures (aka crypto futures).QuoteWe live in a US Dollar global currency regime. That is equally true for the crypto capital markets. While Bitcoin is the reserve asset of crypto, it is most commonly valued against the USD. To be truly intellectually honest we should value Bitcoin against the representation of the energy it takes to produce blocks every 10 minutes (e.g., Bitcoin vs. Joules, kwH, a barrel of oil, etc.) but we don’t— and the most common way to obtain Bitcoin is not to tender energy, but fiat currency.Bitcoin miners need fiat to pay electricity bills, and speculators bring fiat to obtain Bitcoin. Both sides meet on the exchange, and magic happens. The big issue is that spot exchanges rely on banking partners to allow fiat into and out of the exchange. Without a reliable bank, the exchange cannot conduct its business.When ICBIT started the Bitcoin derivatives markets, it made a crucially important decision to settle margin, profit, and loss in Bitcoin only. This is unusual, as most FX derivatives – in order to have a linear payoff curve – will settle in the unit of the foreign currency.EUR/USDHome Currency = EURForeign Currency = USDIf I buy 1 EUR at EUR/USD = 1, and then sell 1 EUR at EUR/USD = 2, I make 1 USD. It’s very easy to conceptually understand. I post margin in USD, I receive my profit in USD. Wham, bam, thank you ma’am.Instead, ICBIT used an inverse structure where the contract settled in units of the home currency. For BTC/USD the home currency is BTC, and this means the contract behaves in a non-linear fashion.Bitcoin Contract Value = 1 / PP is the price of BTC/USDhttps://blog.bitmex.com/all-aboard/",

For me as a player, it is both good and bad. It is good because it is easier for me to explore the new site because I'm familiar with the older site and maybe I do not need to ask many thing first if the new site is like 90% or more similar to the older site. It is bad because it will be boring to see some different sites but looks almost the same and it may confuse me in the future. It is possible that I may play in the wrong place because of the similarity. All in all, copying other casino 90-100% is not really good because most people will think that the site is not having much efforts to have their own style.",

But it will all vary depends on how the casino perform and how they put some efforts on marketing, then putting active guys to solve problem which is main concern by almost all of us since this one could give them one step to success.",

Businesses are made to create profit after all and the most stable way to do so is to basically copy the general guidelines that earlier businesses with the same model have set. You'd only have to improve the reputation with simple marketing stuff to actually attract customers. A unique identity is really hard to create, especially in casinos where their luck-based games are the main feature, and seeing that most of those types of games are just a reskin of the same old ones, you won't really get anything \"new\" out of that. I do love the idea of Rollbit and the NFT feature, but I'd consider it as a marketing feature instead of the core \"luck-based\" requirement that casinos have. It makes them unique in that their reward system is a lot more intricate with it, but it's only limited to the rewards part.",
