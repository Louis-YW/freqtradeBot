How can you doubt and say it is a failure? If you bought bitcoin for $69k and now your assets are losing 80%, then it's your failure, not bitcoin's failure. If you haven't sold your bitcoin you still have a chance to succeed with bitcoin hold it don't sell till profit.",

But to answer the question if it is a failed project, it depends on your view point. If you view it as a mode of payment, then this technology still is so young because many countries are still not supporting the usage of this currency. But on investors' viewpoint, it is successful for having a 'continuous' growth in its price over years which makes it still a good option as an asset even if its market value is too volatile. As more countries adapt to this technology, we would more likely see growth on how this currency will be acknoledged by more people.",

Afaik Satoshi already made Bitcoin a success when he made it as a p2p system with no 3rd party involved, anything after that is mostly improvements, bug fixes, etc afaik. It didn't have any change to its core idea, which is p2p. Additionally, what is the \"current\" situation? Is it about the price? I don't think the price being high or low matters, the system behind would still work (and if you lost your investment due to that, well that's kind of your fault as an investor).

If it was adoption, well, if you were to compare it from the start, pretty sure it's progressed rather well.",

It always depends on the parameters you are using while judging it's success or failure. Also it's not essential that an innovative product will always achieve its desired goal using the same path it was initially thought out. It's a very different thing! Bitcoin is a huge success! Yes probably we are not using it in a way it was intended by Mr. nakamoto, but that doesn't mean it has failed.",

I still believe there is a strong community behind Bitcoin that will protect it at all costs. This means that the future development for Bitcoin doesnt have any plans to turn it into a POS network, which would be the end of Bitcoin as we know it. As said, I find this very hard to happen, so Bitcoin will keep representing Satoshi's main idea for long.",

If you meant to ask if it was successful as a p2p system that could act as an alternative to fiat payment channels, it still too early to say that. The cryptocurrency bitcoin has been here for a short while compared to thousands of years of fiat usage and utility. So to say that the bitcoin has failed this early is a little bit unfair for the coin in a sense. Anyhow, I do believe the potential is still there, not only for profit but for revolutionizing the way people look at money. Bitcoin, when treated and used right may also be used to incite democracy and give the power back to the general public instead of the elite 1%. We are seeing some of these effects now and as long as bitcoin keeps on, we would see more of it in the future.",
