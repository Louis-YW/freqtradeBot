  "content": "Hello everyone and welcome to Funarcade’s seeding event for Multiplayer Baccarat and Crash games. Props to everyone who came before and propagated this method.    We have generated a chain of 10,000,000 SHA256 hashes for each game. Each hash is the hash of the hexadecimal representation of the previous hash. The last hash for each chain is:  Baccarat: ecda5ee831114c94c3f3502a8e4486839865ac17a19d4852cb25a37436ea77cdCrash: 4cbac65f734bc42707bdd7a8a58aabd3ce16e27b26914cb5c0a1e1842dc4cc78formula for generating game results:Baccarat:Code:A hash is generated for each round of play, by combining the client and server seeds with the game and round numbers. The first 48 digits of the hash are taken and separated into 6 parts of 8 digits each. Each part represents a card on the table, from a minimum of 4 cards to a maximum of 6.Example:ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015adCard 1: ba7816bfCard 2: 8f01cfeaCard 3: 414140deCard 4: 5dae2223Card 5: b00361a3Card 6: 96177a9cThe digits of each part are then randomized, and this formula: floor(result* 52) is then used to arrive at a result from 0 - 51.// Index of 0 to 51: ♥A to ♠Kconst CARDS = [0 - 12: ♥A, ♥2, ♥3 ♥4, ♥5, ♥6, ♥7 ♥8, ♥9, ♥10, ♥J ♥Q, ♥K,13 - 25: ♦A, ♦2, ♦3, ♦4, ♦5, ♦6, ♦7, ♦8, ♦9, ♦10, ♦J, ♦Q, ♦K,26 - 39: ♣A, ♣2, ♣3, ♣4, ♣5, ♣6, ♣7, ♣8, ♣9, ♣10, ♣J, ♣Q, ♣K,39 - 51: ♠A, ♠2, ♠3, ♠4, ♠5, ♠6, ♠7, ♠8, ♠9, ♠10, ♠J, ♠Q, ♠K];// Game event translationconst card = CARDS[Math.floor(float * 52)];Card Order:Player's first two cards are Cards 1 and 2.Banker's first two cards are Cards 3 and 4.If only the Player or Banker draws a third card, it will be Card 5.If both Player and Banker draw a third card, they will be Cards 5 and 6 respectively.Card 6 is always the Banker's third card (if drawn).Crash:Code:const gameHash = hashChain.pop()const hmac = createHmac('sha256', gameHash);// blockHash is the hash of bitcoin block insert chosen block here, and also the resulting hash.hmac.update(blockHash);const hex = hmac.digest('hex').substr(0, 8);const int = parseInt(hex, 16);// 0.01 will result in 1% house edge with a lowest crashpoint of 1const crashpoint = Math.max(1, (2 ** 32 / (int + 1)) * (1 - 0.01))Blockhash to be used as client seed will be Bitcoin Block 810108, which has not yet been mined at the time of posting. Following the established method, we are using the hash of a future bitcoin block as a client seed so players can be certain that we did not pick one in the house's favor. If someone could quote this post so it is all set in stone, i'd appreciate it. thank you.",

Welcome to our little forum, Funarcade.  I took a peek at your site and really dig the vibe you've got going on.  Lean and clean with a retro-future type of look.  But we need more information about your services.  I suggest that you create an announcement thread with detailed explanations. This will help the community notice your casino better. Consider upgrading to a copper membership to add pictures and enhance your posts. This will make your threads more visually appealing and attractive.",

This will make your threads more visually appealing and attractive.Hey Decodx!That's a good idea, i'll do just that. We are introducing a community-first economic model, where up to 90% of profits get distributed back to everyone involved in the progress of the site - players, token holders, bankroll providers. We do go into that in our docs, but I realise not everyone will want to deep-dive that as it can be quite a read. Thanks for taking a look at our site, glad to hear you liked it  . The site is temporarily down for a security overhaul, but i'll make a detailed post in the forum once we are back up.",
