Is there anything I can do or I just wait?    -  You know as long as your not selling it, even if you bought it at a high price in the market before, you will still get it back. How? the only thing you can really do to recover and still make money there is to hold and wait for the Bull run to return.I'm sure that when the value of Bitcoin in the market starts to rally, DOT is one of the things that Bitcoin can pull up in the market price, and there is also a high possibility of returning to that ATH. Just be patient and there's no other way to do it than to increase its value again in the market, as long as you don't sell it.",

Is there anything I can do or I just wait?The way to save it is to wait. If you sell at the current price, you will automatically be at a loss point that reaches approximately 19USD per 1 Polkadot.Before you decide to put all your money into DOT, you should first analyze what coins you want to buy because IMO putting all your money into one type of coin is not good except for Bitcoin.Again, the way to save your money is to wait until the price of Polkadot/DOT returns to the purchase price.If you still have other money, look at other coins that have the opportunity to increase and buy. The profit that will be obtained can cover the loss due to the decline in DOT price.I look at the price chart, XRP is still on the rise.",

Is there anything I can do or I just wait?I can relate to this. I was once also a holder of Polkadot (DOT) I even joined most of their para chain auction sale before.I can also say that there are really no excuses if we are in the bear market, even with how quality cryptocurrency project is, when the bear market comes, it will be bloody.My advice is you can hold because selling with that kind of loss, it's already huge. But we will not know when it will or how much price will it be if just in case we will be in bull market and peak on the market.",

      "body": "What kind of options are acceptable for you? If you can take a riskier approach I guess you can DCA to lower your average entry or DCA into Bitcoin or other major altcoins based on the speculation that the next bull run would give you enough return to cover your loss. You can also trade other assets other than crypto assuming you have access to them. Keep in mind those are still risky moves, you need to accept the risk and understand that it might expose you further to another loss of capital. If you don't have the capacity to do that, then I don't think it is a smart choice to do.At the end of the day nobody is a certified financial advisor and no one knows your exact situation, so just take our posts with a big grain of salt.",

And mind you, even if I'm a investor, we seldom give financial advises here.So the best thing to do is to really is maybe just wait as you have said. It might be long though as the next bull run is projected to be in 2024-2025 and hopefully you can break even by that time.And maybe this is a expensive lesson for you, and that you should invest majority of your portfolio to BTC.",

Did you acquire many coins that put your financial state in a tough situation? If none of these apply, then I'd simply hold your coins and wait for a recovery. Polkadot's ATH was at approximately $50, which means that it has a decent potential for a recovery. Although you have purchased exactly in the middle, the current price is possibly the lowest it could be at the time, as it was unfortunately affected by the SEC lawsuit.My advice, simply hold and if you're up to invest any further, I'd use the DCA technique that other users suggested. In that way, you'll lower your average purchase price, while it's a great opportunity now that it's affordable.",

But since the deeds have already been done I think next time before you hold any coin you must first have a good knowledge and when to act because altcoins are gamble and nothing more,  today their price is at the moon and next day their could possibly drop to zero.",
