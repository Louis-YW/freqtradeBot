  "content": "The last quarter of the month of February 2023 has been filled with so many market behaviours and uncertainties, bitcoin made every attempt to hold on to the 25,000 prices but each time it reaches that milestone it gets to pull back. This has happened several within the last one two weeks and this action has called for more speculation from spectators on what direction the price will go, just as there have been financial instability in the global economy will Bitcoin follow the same pattern as the traditional economy or will it break out in the face of uncertainties to move beyond the 25k BTC price.",

We are entering a weekend where normal things can happen during the sales phase which is more dominant if we observe.maybe the closing price this february will be around the $24k level because some of the big orders I see are at $21k or $22k so that could trigger a strong push for traders to see higher prices when the pump comes. this was a pretty good entry rally after two rejections in the $25k area.",

I don't expect the price to always go up without a correction, and it's very difficult. After all, fluctuations like this are always normal in the market although many people wish the $25K was held for a longer period. But in my opinion, dip only gives good hope for traders when they want to enter for long-term goals.",

You should not be too greedy when you want bitcoin to only increase continuously and without correction. Bitcoin's price drop is obvious and many people are waiting for it to correct to a good price to buy, while you feel uncomfortable.",

Look. Forget about the noise and take advantage of these moments to accumulate. People look back and think, 'I wish I could have bought at $1,000 or $100!'. In the same way people will look back tomorrow and think I wish I could have bought around $20,000. Better to focus on this perspective than on whether it takes longer or shorter to break $25,000.",

Again, there's no telling when it could go over $25k and we can only wait and hope it will happen soon so we can start to see the value of our investment grow.

If ever bitcoin breaks $25k and pass that price, the tendency of it to reach another top is high. That's what the speculations that I've been reading thus, it will be falling behind and more likely be back under $20k once again. The situation now is necessary to happen and it's still part of the accumulation period that the market is setting before a quick skyrocketing becomes on set.Also, we'll never know where the market is leading until the end of the year but we've got some patterns left prior to halving.",

Perhaps it was the price that many speculators have set, so when we reach it, automatically sell for them. And after that, there are no buyers or the buyers are outnumbered by the sellers.And I think the resistance should be in the round numbers like the next one which is $30k.Although we have some not good news coming from the FEDs, that's why the price is again below $24k. But hopefully next month we will see at least the price hovering to $25k and maintain it. So we just need to have patience.",
