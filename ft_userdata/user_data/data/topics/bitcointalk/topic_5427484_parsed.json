It's just a word of mouth marketing and others just riding the hype, nothing really is decentralized when it comes to website operation. Not unless the website hosting server is fully decentralized too.Web3 asking KYC? Yeah, how ironic, right? But of course for the sake of hype, let's just let them and give chance on how they can change the traditional online casino. But i still withhold of sites asking KYC first on the registration especially for a new site. Not unless you win huge $xx,xxx amount and that is the time they will ask for verification, fair enough.**Move this to gambling discussion, to avoid getting trashed and complain later on.",

Don't be confused between Web3 and Web 3.0  they are fundamentally different[1].  As stated by that article, \"web3 is blockchain based whereas web 3.0 is semantic web which means it is a common framework that allows user to reuse and share data across different enterprises, applications, and communities.\"In addition, blockchain based doesn't necessary need to be decentralized.  There are centralized blockchain so it wouldn't be a surprised if some Gambling Casino platform that claim to be web3 integrated asks for KYC.[1] https://productcoalition.com/web3-versus-web-3-0-the-basic-concepts-and-differences-e25f7f05ca33",

You can only experience a full Web3 experience on casino that doesn’t have a license which is ironic that people preferred casino with license yet they want full privacy with there game. Web3 casino allows user to connect there web3 wallet on the website without the need on registering an account through email. They have also some house games that runs through the blockchain which they are using to categorized them as web3 already.There’s expect a fully decentralized casino that has license to operate at the same time because AML policy is always attached on the license. This important details should be always remember.",

And if web3.0 uses an online casino and it is licensed, then they are obliged to comply with the requirements of regulators and then all decentralization ends.",

We may think that web 3.0 doesn't require KYC but we also can't do anything about it if the casinos keep asking us to do KYC.And if you don't want to do KYC, you can look for other casinos that don't implement KYC. Maybe it's a misunderstanding of people in interpreting web 3.0 or is it to attract more users and say that their casino is a decentralized casino or is it just a new trend in the gambling business.",

Maybe its better for people to research first the pros and cons before they get hype for the word because this word is use for scamming because many newbie think that there are great things coming on Web 3.0.",

Our crypto philosophy is deeply rooted in blockchain, so we absolutely understand crypto users' concerns over privacy since we, too, are crypto users. In the meanwhile, we do agree that \"web 3 casino\" is merely a buzzword that misleads abuser about the true technological foundations of the casino, which is sadly always a centralized operation (due to the present limitations of blockchain technologies at large). That's why we don't use such terms in any of our branding and marketing endeavors.",

Well, in business, any thing to bring in or win more customers over to the company is always a go and it's welcomed.I am not surprised though, things like this are not new, casinos can claim to be what they aren't just for the sole purpose of attracting customers, and I do not blame them, this is an industry where everyone is trying to stay anonymous but still want to get involved in businesses that does not require customers to be anonymous due to some reasons best known to them.And to keep the business going, they have to make the customer feel that they(the business) is actually what they(the customers) want, so if it takes the casino claiming to be a web 3.0 casinos where as they aren't, it is still a business strategy.",
