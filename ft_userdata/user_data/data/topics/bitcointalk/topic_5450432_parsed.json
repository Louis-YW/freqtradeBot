I don't know if these questions already asked..1) My question is, can I also use this same trustwallet and import to Electrum downloaded to my personal laptop?2) If Yes, then is my funds secured since the key phrase were generated from trustwallet?3) If something happened to trustwallet entirely would my imported funds to Electrum be affected, please I really need to know about all this since i am not a fan of Electrum just trying to see if i could get used to another wallet aside Trustwallet app.Please if this question doesn't belong here kindly point out where it should be it will be a thing of joy to me moving it over there.Thank you.",

Importing the wallet on Electrum using BIP39 is already answered.My question is, since you want to get rid of the old wallet then why would you bother to import it on Electrum? Importing it on Electrum does not mean it lost from Trustwallet. You are using the same wallet but with a different software. It does not cost you to create a new wallet and keep the new seed safe then transfer the coins to the new wallet created with Electrum.",

Your funds will be just fine.This is incorrect.Trust wallet is closed source. We have absolutely no idea how secure seed phrases generated by Trust wallet are. They could all be generated in a pre-determined way known to some programmer at Trust wallet. They could be storing every generated seed phrase on a centralized server. They could be transmitting seed phrases across the internet. We simply don't know. You should assume that any seed phrase generated by a closed source piece of software is compromised. OP should generate a brand new seed phrase on better wallet software and send his coins across.Quote from: MainIbem on April 28, 2023, 12:53:38 AMWell I have thought of doing that but i don't know how he or she may feels when sending personal messages for change of addressicopress is a very reasonable person.
