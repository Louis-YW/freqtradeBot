  "content": "Hi all ! My team and I made mining software CryptochemistCryptochemist is basically a GUI for mining bitcoin, litecoin, and various other altcoins that makes it easy for you to work with pools.It supports AMD and NVIDIA GPUs as well as CPU mining. You can choose between merged mining and single mining - the program includes several mining pools to choose from.Cryprochemist automatically applies the SSE2, AVX and AVX2 instructions when available.Peculiarities :bitcoin, litecoin, dogeecoin, altcoins, cpuminer, cpuminer 64, bitcoin, bitcoin miner, cpu miner, cudaminer, cgminer.Supports Stratum and sha256 mining protocolTested on WindowsAt the moment we provide software for a period of 14 days for free, for review and test, please note that after the software will be available only for money.Who is interested write to PM",

Mining BITCOIN is done exclusively with dedicated BITCOIN mining hardware based on ASICs - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit . You CAN NOT meaningfully mine bitcoin today with CPU, GPU or even FPGAs. Bitcoin difficulty adapts to match the amount of mining done on the network and has reached levels trillions of times too high to mine meaningfully with PCs, laptops, tablets, phones, webpages, javascript, GPUs, and even generalised SHA hardware. You will not find software in this section to help you mine bitcoin in this absurdly inefficient manner in this subforum. It would cost you thousands of dollars in electricity per year to earn only a few cents in bitcoin. Even if you combined all the computers in the world, including all known supercomputer, you would not even approach 0.1% of the bitcoin hashrate today. Any discussion outside of ASIC related mining, except in the interests of academia, will be moved to the altcoin mining section. There isn't any point attempting to mine bitcoin with CPU or GPU even in the interests of learning as it shares almost nothing with how bitcoin is mined with ASICs and will not teach you anything.TL/DR Summary: - You CANNOT meaningfully mine bitcoin with your PC or laptop no matter how powerful it is. - You CANNOT meaningfully mine bitcoin with your tablet or phone no matter how powerful it is. - Mining apps for your phone or tablet that claim to mine bitcoin are almost certainly scams. - You CANNOT find software here to mine bitcoin with your PC by itself. - You MIGHT be able to do one of the above with altcoins, but such discussion goes into the altcoin mining section. - You CANNOT find or post software here to mine on other peoples' PC without their permission.I could advise you to post your topic in the Altcoin Mining section of the forum, you will have more interest from the members there",

      "body": "OP your software sounds like complete garbage.  You dont mine pretty much any of the coins you listed by cpu or gpu..they are asic’ed.  You come off as a complete noob because stating to mine those coins by cpu/gpu is completely pointless.  If you know…you know why your software offer is completely worthless.  If you dont then you know nothing about mining. Previous post laid it out but in your ignorance you have posted it here….what a pathetic attempt.Oh and mining software should never limit what pool you use.  EVER.  If it does its garbage.",

      "body": "Have you come up with a new NiceHash?Usually such software is free, the service takes commissions for its services. This can be the same, but miners are more accustomed to paying 1% on the pool and paying 1% commissions from the mined coins to the miner's development. But you will have to work really hard to convince miners to use your service.",
