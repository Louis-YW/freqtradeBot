You can try gamdom.com. Your referrals sign up under you and you earn usd based on their wagered amount. I'm not sure what the % is. Your people also get 15% rakeback to start for the 1st 7 days. I'm not sure if it all adds up to higher or lower than what you currently get, but can't hurt to get people playing under you on more sites.",

If my understanding is correct FortuneJack has the highest referral commission which is 60% Then it is Stake that offers the second highest commission which is around 50%. Bitcasino is offering up to 45% as written on their affiliate page and the same is being offered by winz.io.For Fortune Jack, you can visit this page for more details: https://fortunejackpartners.com/For Bitcasino you can visit this link for more details: https://bitcasino.io/affiliate-program  For winz.io you can visit this link for more details: https://winz.team/",

Would be highly appreciated. All the suggestions provided by other members are pretty good. Based on my personal experience, I've noticed that newer platforms tend to offer slightly better terms to their affiliates. They're trying to attract new players and build their name in the community, so they tend to be more generous. However, be cautious and ensure that the casino you choose is reputable. You'll often find that the most appealing affiliate terms come from shady platforms that may not have your best interests at heart. Just make sure to check out the terms and conditions of each platform and review the specific details of their affiliate programs.As for the welcome bonus for your referrals, I'm not sure if such a specific bonus exists. After all, how can the casino predict in advance that your referrals will be high rollers?",

You may try Rollbit as well, it may not that great as 35% but it's good to have 10% than never but I think Rollbit will remain in this industry for a longer time and that's the best one. It can level up to 20% if you partner with them afaik on their Partnership program. I know there are lots of casinos to choose from and may have even greater percentage but in this thriving industry having just one source isn't sometimes the best. Keep your reach large in area.",

Some casino get the affiliate commision on the total amount lose by other user and some casino like Stake counts the total wager for affiliate earnings including winning bets. So the affiliate structure should be considered to find a suitable replacement on what OP asking. I’m not familiar with BC.Game Affiliate structure but Stake and Bitcasino has a very good affiliate structure which I believe that can use by the OP to replace his old affiliate program since I'm sure that he can easily climb higher tier due to his strong affiliate network to get the maximum tier for the affiliate program.",
