Should i postponed my invest or not? I post this in speculation sector cause we can only predict!  And I'll go with the most predicted resultAltcoin market has been suffering huge dump due to the bitcoin. You shall always remember this buy at the red and sell at the green. Never try to buy at green if you don't wanna face loss for your investment. It's right decision to get some coins during the bearish trend like this. Altcoin may able to recover later. So many predictions said bitcoin will be suffering another dump before it will able to break 31k resistance. I have been buying some altcoins but remember to spread it into the various price to decrease the risk to be dumped even lower. It surprises me how bitcoin gets dumped 8% in minutes. It will be stupid enough if you were buying at the top and sell at the bottom. Use your sense. Buy at the dump is always profitable once the market gonna recover soon. Dump is a common thing in the crypto and it will never dump forever.",

However, if you really believe, you just need to choose a good and popular coin, then hold on to it in the long term. you can start now. but, if you are still in doubt, you can analyze how the chart is moving at the moment, but I think it will always change.",

We usually got intimidated by the price movement and eventually change our minds but that is normal, we can't change the volatility of the market. The best thing to do is to trust those coins that you think will pump during the bull season and give you a profit. Because if you let your emotions control your mind, the more you become stressful thinking about your investment plan and ended up with nothing.",

I know that it is going to take a while and it will not be that simple but you are going to make a great profit from it for sure. This should mean that you are going to make some return that would be lovely and should be used without a doubt.I think it should be another important thing to see that we are going to see the bull run soon enough, and we should be making a profit when the time comes so in order for that to happen we need to get them now. It is already low, the market is in the red, which means that green is right around the corner so buying right now will be great.",

I'm confident to say that bear market is the perfect time to buy altcoins. If you are concern about getting the maximum possible profit that you can get, you can try doing DCA on the token you like. Majority of the top coins will rise and become relevant to the next bull market. I personally slowly collecting coins in my wallet and I plan to sell it on the bull market since I know I can profit from it. If you plan on getting short term profit, this is the time you need to do charting.",

Also, Arb and cro both will increase further in future from the current price but if the bull market comes back then the price will be easy to increase. However op altcoins is trying to build a mountain of investment and he wants to buy when the bull market comes. Otherwise you research and chart which would be the best investment. Our preferred coins are different so not all coins will be right for you to buy so invest in the one that is within your capital range.",

This is usually the time the best time to buy when the community or people are really that somewhat in fear.",

Should i postponed my invest or not?I think it is the right time to collect more altcoins, we rarely experience a huge dump like this. We almost end the second year of bearish season, in 2024 is likely the beginning of bullish season because we will have BTC halving. So, I think you will regret it if you postponed to buy altcoins. The prices of altcoins will follow Bitcoin, they are dropping because BTC price decreased a lot now. But they may skyrocket in the next few months due to the hype of BTC halving.",

So you can buy small amount now and then some amount at below 25k too.So the best possible solution is to try coin accumulation via DCA, because here is nothing to worry and due to such solutions it will reduce your losses and you will not miss any critical opportunity to buy some bunch of coins,",
