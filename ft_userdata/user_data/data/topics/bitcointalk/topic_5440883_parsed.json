  "content": "I got some old old Tethers which are on the old school OMNI chain which was originally used by Tether before it swapped over to ERC20 and Tron. Was wondering if there is anyway to recover these USDT because all the exchanges that I used before to deposit/withdraw Omni Tether no longer accept USDT deposits. The balance is not large enough to send to tether.io and claim by a US bank wire. Anyone know any KYC-free exchange or some other method to swap these tethers or are they gone forever?",

I am not sure about their terms and KYC policies, perhaps you could check them out and read up information before using them.",

But the fees are a little bit high. You will get $987.99 Per thousand. https://changenow.io/currencies/tether-omni/tether-trc20?amount=1000 Seems good as well. It will charge a minimum of $4 per thousand dollars. Now it's up to you which one you want to use.",

I don't even think I got a warning from my exchange when they removed the deposit functions a year or two back. Its crazy how out of hundred exchanges or so, only 4 are the only ones that still support it. I guess it was due to the long wait times for confirmation while on ERC20 or TRC20 you got it instantely pretty much.",

You're WelcomeQuoteI don't even think I got a warning from my exchange when they removed the deposit functions a year or two back. Huh? They are on exchanges? Broh! Never hold your coins on an exchange.  QuoteIts crazy how out of hundred exchanges or so, only 4 are the only ones that still support it. Only four of them are listed on the BestChange website. There are a lot of more available exchanges which still support Omni USDT. You just have to search for it and find it. You have to be careful when you search for it. You may get scammed by fake exchanges. Whatever exchanges I suggested, Please do your own research before you make any transaction there.",

I have about $10 and I searched a lot for a platform, but I couldn't find it.Approximately, the minimum amount you can transfer is $200, so if the amount is less than that, you need to either forget it or look for a friend who has the same problem.",

But now we have multiple chain TRC20 is the cheapest i think",

      "body": "In my opinion, it seems like you are in a tricky situation with your old Tethers on the OMNI chain. Since most exchanges have moved on to support ERC20 and Tron-based USDT, it might be challenging to find a KYC-free exchange that still accepts OMNI Tether deposits. For alternative, you try finding someone interested in buying your OMNI Tethers through a peer-to-peer trading platform or a cryptocurrency forum. This method might involve some risk, so make sure to use a trusted escrow service or a reputable platform to facilitate the transaction.",
