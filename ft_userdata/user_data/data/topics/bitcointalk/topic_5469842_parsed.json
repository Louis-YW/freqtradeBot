The only game I do not know how to play among the ones that you mentioned is poker and it is the only one that I can not go for. I can go for the rest and other games. There is nothing hard about those games and everything are luck. But I prefer casino games than sport that have low odd to casino games.",

So what you said is actually right most people don't know where to channel their skills or attention rather being diversifying in most of the games to see whether they could hit winning one day as they said gambling is a game of luck.",

I believe that once they discover a game that piques their interest and offers rewards, that's when they'll dedicate their time to mastering the finer aspects of games like blackjack, poker, or sports betting.Just as with acquiring any other skill, one needs to explore, find what sparks their interest, and then work on becoming proficient at it.",

Yes you can say that you are playing and you are putting the odds in your favor by losing intentionally...but that is just a fallacy. In rare circumstances will this actually help you, it's nothing but belief. Even in poker, faking your skill level by losing will only get you so far and the facade can only be kept up for so long before smarter players realize what you are doing.",

Talking about winning and losing strategies depends on the person's goal of gambling, whether it's for money. or just looking for entertainment and having fun.I personally always enjoy any game but sometimes more in sports betting although sometimes I play some casino games and poker but it's all to fill my free time waiting for the sporting event in question, so I think we all have different views on that, I gambling doesn't think about making a strategy to win, gambling is just for entertainment, winning is a bonus for me",

There are a lot of professionals in this gambling game and they are not fooling around, they are good at what they do and they study it very well to analyze every possible situation they will bump into. It requires strategy, knowing the game, reading your opponent, and loads of experience to be a pro in that game. And yes I believe jumping from one game to another without knowledge about it is suicide, we are just giving away our money without even thinking ahead. Sports betting has the same concept, without knowledge about the game we are like blind men betting for a team or a player that we know nothing about.",

It seems to me that the mathematical chances will be the same even if he plays dice for 10 hours or different gambling games every hour (it is clear that the casino advantage is slightly different everywhere, but the general meaning does not change) for 10 hours.The most important thing is to have fun, there is no winning strategy (even in poker).",

I believe playing different games will not gonna affect win/lose percentage of a person since the result of each bet on different games is independent to each other. I think the only repercussions on playing multiple games is that the players mind might not be properly manage bankroll since he has different games to think but if the player can play one at time these games then I don’t see any difference playing one game alone or differently games but one at a time since all of them is just based on luck.",

There are numerous games to choose from, but for serious gamblers, it's essential to narrow their focus to a select few that fall into the category of skill-based games. Poker, for instance, is an excellent choice in this regard. When you're committed to making money through gambling, the pressure can be high, but the potential for success is real. In contrast to gambling purely for enjoyment, where winning is a bonus, here you're aiming to achieve specific financial goals.",

You can't be a gambler you will want to master everything and expect to win something reasonable, most likely you will not win anything because you will only be chasing after a win while a loss will be chasing you back to back, there is no reason to master all gambling games except if you are doing that to increase casinos revenue daily, weekly and monthly.All my life has always been Basketball and football, the reason is that bookies have the right information I need to use to predict out of next matches, but I'm always mindful of the sportsbooks I use because of the lower line, that's very important one as bookies use that to spread their target for players to lose their stakes. So, anytime I played, If the week is full of weak matches, I do only Football and when there is too much loss, I picked the few ones from Football and add reasonable Basket balls to increase the odd a little bit but I do my assignment before the inclusion of Basket ball matches.",

If gambling industry make so much money while their clients continue to loose so much, then there will be a void, an imbalance that will shrink the system. What I consider as a factor that is fueling the growth of the industry is that while the companies are making money, many people are also winning as winning gamble now is easier than it was before... all thanks to increased options. Before now, there was no option to be on 10 minutes, 5 minutes and even 15 minutes option. There was no bet on the player to score, corner, handicap and many others. So, introduction of more options now male it easier for people to win more and that is how the business is sustained. Without more winners, there will be no new and increasing customers.",

Just play whatever games you love with basic knowledge about the mechanics and bet allocation, except you love crunching numbers and stats, counting cards, etc.",
