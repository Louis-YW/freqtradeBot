Like, ¬†what where you expecting forum members to reply you? Take a minute to think about it, the man sister's life is on the line here and you want him to start contemplating of he should sell or continue holding. There are times where you don't even need to think able something twice before doing it, as long as the safe return of his sister is guaranteed then there is no reason for him not to sell and if you weren't lying what's stopping the kidnappers from demanding crypto directly? This is ridiculous, I feel you just made up this story the same way you have been making others.",

Do you really need to think about what to do? The more time you are spending thinking about whether or not to sell the Bitcoin and save your daughter's life, the more you are endangering the life of that innocent girl. (just an illustration).¬†Situations like that don't even require a second thought; sell off and solve the problem. That's the most important part of saving: for our savings to save us in the future in times of need. If you keep on calculating whether or not you are to stake your savings over saving the girl's life, you might end up regretting your actions for the rest of your life.¬†Your question is just so unreasonable. The answer is yes, sell and save the kidnap victim. You can save up with time.",

The US simply ignores them. Thanks to this position, they know that there is no point in committing crimes, because the US government will not give a ransom. As for the case that you described above, you need to call the police, because they will kidnap every time. Nothing will stop criminals from doing it again. And I would advise your friend to better monitor security, perhaps hire a security guard for his family members.",

Do you think holding bitcoin is more important than the life of the kids?Just listen to me, holding Bitcoin is important for everyone but more important is the life of our near and dear ones. You may sell the bitcoin and you may work hard, earn money and buy bitcoin again but kids, if anything happens to them, they won't return back.

Or perhaps if this guy has another means to pay up the ransom as soon as he can without selling his Bitcoin, then he should go on and get money from the other means, but with what you said already, even the Bitcoin he is holding cannot cover the ransom, so he will need to sell the Bitcoin and still take out a loan to complete the transaction.OP, if this story is not false, just as other members are strongly suspecting it is, then I have just one piece of advice that can work, which is, let him take a loan and use his Bitcoin as collateral.You said he introduced you to Bitcoin, and here you are in the forum, so possibly he is also a member of this forum. He can get a loan here and use his Bitcoin as collateral, or he can still get another of his Bitcoin colleagues to help him with the loan and use the Bitcoin he owns as collateral.QuoteEverybody is confuse.Why?
