I have been looking for creative ways to secure the barcode to not leave specified premises without the payment confirmed.'Note: USE OF IOT DEVICES ARE ALLOWEDHowever, are there any other creative ways to confirm the transaction? IOT devices should be cheap enough for industrial use.USE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY TO CONFIRM THE PAYMENT IS WHAT THE WHOLE CONCEPT IS ABOUT without getting the customer to steal the barcode out of the permitted premises range.Help is appreciated. thanks",

You'd just get someone to scan their vouchers with an app that can sign them when they want to spend them.In your database you just have to store whatever is on the voucher and its identifier. If you want these vouchers to be non transferable, you could get the customer to scan their public key on the PoS system too and store that with the database information.This can probably be done with PoS systems capable of scanning barcodes anyway - you might run low on people wanting to use the system for a while though.",

I'd advise at least GUID as QR code for the job, if the scanners can handle that.I'm not sure where you need cryptography for this though, since it's your own database.",

What do you mean by a fake payment? If you're talking about possible double spends, all you would need to do is check via your database, and the blockchain. Then you'd verify that the transaction has confirmations, and depending on your threat level decide how many confirmations are needed for it to be considered a valid payment. All you'd need to do is tie the barcode scanner into your system, and then record the data to the database, and then use that data, and compare it to the blockchain. Unless, I'm misunderstanding what you mean?",

Maybe just one-way hash functions if you want to protect your data from hacking attempts. Cryptography is used in a decentralized system to protect against unauthorized modification of data and prevent double spending. It is a security mechanism that ensures the validity of information and transactions in the blockchain network.If I understand your problem correctly, to verify the legitimacy of the payment, you can simply check your database to ensure that the transaction is recorded there. And since you are the only one authorized to confirm payments and write data to your database, you do not need cryptography.",

Here is a solution:Every item has a RFID. An app on the customer's phone scans the item and pays for it. The payment is recorded in a database. When the customer walks out, the tag is scanned again and the database is queried  to determine if has been purchased. There is no need for a smart tag. The scanners do all the work. The tag doesn't have to be removed. In fact, you probably want to make it difficult to remove.However, Amazon is already way ahead of you. They have stores where you just walk in, take what you want, and then leave. The store's cameras identify you and everything you take, and then charge your credit card.",

If the payment is made for the product, then the product/tag should be smart enough to detect whether or not it was a successful transaction.This means that the data is yours, as everybody said before, it's a closed system that doesn't need cryptography.And since you accept only fiat too, this becomes off-topic here.Plus, there are no fake payments: there are people paying for what they get and people who steal (no matter if they steal 1 and pay for the rest and so on, that's just a distraction from the logic).So you have to identify when a product that's not paid for leaves the shop. As simple as that.For this you need RFID and uniquely identified items, not cryptography.For this, when an item is scanned, you may mark it \"scanned\" and link it to the future invoice and when the invoice is paid, all the linked items you mark as \"paid\". An item is free to leave only if it's paid.Simple logic. Where would cryptography help? Why do you want to add extra layers of complexity for something that can be done in a simple way?And you said you want to avoid RFID. If you avoid that, you will want a way to find out a product has left the perimeter, sometimes being concealed between other products? How else could you do this???!? Cameras can partly help, maybe. Cryptography is .. not for this, it's completely useless in the equation.Quote from: odolvlobo on December 03, 2022, 08:31:20 PMThe tag doesn't have to be removed. In fact, you probably want to make it difficult to remove.There are already clothes shops where the RFID is embedded and you may not even find it easily.Quote from: odolvlobo on December 03, 2022, 08:31:20 PMHowever, Amazon is already way ahead of you.
