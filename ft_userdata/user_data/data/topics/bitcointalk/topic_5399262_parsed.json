I guess, when you say golf, one name that we always connect is Tiger Woods. That's how popular he is. But just like you said, age and other factors will contribute to giving such odds to him. He is not always at his prime in this sports. Just like Pacquiao in boxing. They won't hold the title forever. Let us accept the fact that younger blood will replace them sooner or later.",

Anyhow, after that he suffered another devastating injury so I doubt that he can make a great comeback and win another masters. So I think it's jus about right what are the odds for him this year. It's a long shot, but I wouldn't bet on him though, seems to be that he is already no longer in his prime obviously and golf looks very simple but it is very taxing to the body.",

I have great doubts that his dominance is commensurate with other sports, since the number of players who completely devote their lives to golf is much less than chess players, football players, basketball players, etc. I think that if you come up with some kind of universal ELO coefficient for different sports, then Woods will not even be in the hundreds of top athletes.",

The Bata Reyes is good to see that others legends are known, an activity(B8-B9) in which one can also be quite long-lived. His story is incredible and is little known.

The odds might not look good for him but it's not the lowest based on what i've seen from the outright markets. Yes, in effect the matter is that these odds are for a tournament Majors.I think he is not retiring because he is looking for the record for most wins in the Majors, number one is Jack Nicklaus who has 18 Major championships.Quote from: swogerino on May 19, 2022, 07:05:59 AMQuote from: famososMuertos on May 18, 2022, 09:47:30 PM...//...::I would bet on him based on the odds,I know it will be difficult now for him knowing his age and condition but he is the best golf player or was the best golf player in the world.Most probably the bookies know more than use when it comes to publishing odds but there are certain times when they make errors as they are humans just like us,it would be nice if we for once take profit from some bookie error when we know that they profit from our errors daily.I don't think the physical condition will impact him a lot so why not give a shot when the odds are good.It is a dilemma because if someone on this planet can go against the odds it is Tiger Woods, the bookmakers practically assure that he will not win, although last year another legend Phil Mickelson won with odds 5 times higher than Tiger Woods this year.The odds then this year are better for Tiger Woods, who in comparison should be worse than they were for Phil Mickelson, who although he is also a guy already in the twilight of his career, remains more active.The odds and his formula are always a questionable point, I think that in this case they are rigging a bit with reality, so depending on where you look the odds can be higher, there is a casino that offers odds of 600/1 they are more real with the current situation.We'll see how it turns out, of course I bet on TW but that's why I would have liked a fairer odds against him It is very difficult for such an unexpected comeback to happen twice, the first already happened in 2019.",

He was an exceptional player in his peak years and should always be admired for that, however he has had some troubles in his personal life since that time and arguably fallen below his prime. He will be a very strong player versus any average golfer but there are a steady stream of top quality golfers coming through the pipeline each year who will be looking to leave their own mark on history, following in the footsteps of this legend. If you are a gambler, then it feels like there are many other better potential candidates who would deserve a bet before defaulting to him.",

If they feel that they still have it, they would probably still compete no matter what. Also, it's like giving the rising stars a chance to prove their skills and their talents against seasoned veterans of the field. Tiger Woods is still a very capable golfer on his own accord, and even though I have only watched a couple tournaments of him, I believe that his years of expertise and his expertise on golfing can still earn him trophies and tournament wins.",

But again, this is golf we are talking about? I cannot imagine a 20 year old would have much of an advantage over a 30 year old in swinging his golf club. Its not really that intense of a sport, if it can even be called a sport...I do not know much about Tiger Woods but unless he has gathered some debilitating injuries over the years which put him at a large disadvantage or he is nearing 70, then I doubt his skill will have dropped all that much.",
