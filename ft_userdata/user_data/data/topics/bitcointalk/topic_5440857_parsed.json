      "body": "I guess my question to you would be why on earth would it even be worth what it's trading for today?  It's all pure speculation that Elon Musk is going to do some major thing with Dogecoin and that will propel the value upward.  What could he really do though?  As far as I know there are only a handful of places that even accept DOGE.  If Elon pushed it too hard or accepted it for Tesla vehicles, he'd probably end up owning the entire DOGE market.  I think it's a funny meme coin and maybe if you are a hardcore Twitter user you plunk down a few hundred bucks to own some to play with on Twitter if that ever happens.  I don't see much serious investment headed that way though.  At least until it has a reason to exist.",

A meme token with a huge total supply will never hit that, even if we saw adoption? It will be hard to hit that because you cannot force everyone to buy and use DOGE, we are dreaming too much here better to be realistic despite of the hype for this meme token, Elon can only hype this one because can’t totally dictate the price",

No, Dogecoin doesn't deserve it, not only because it is a meme coin but also because it was not useful in the market like BTC and ETH. Besides, it only becomes popular because of Elon Musk which it drags people to invest and make it hype for a very short period of time. And look at it now, it is only $0.08 and even reaching $0.1 is quite not easy.",

The current market cap is $11B so you do all the division and calculate how much it's needing for it to think of reaching $1.$10 is a crazy speculation and thinking, although this is a wild ride in the crypto market but I don't want people to have that hope because it's very unlikely to see it come.",

There’s always a hype with DOGE online but its not enough to pump a meme token like this. You can trade with DOGE but don’t expect that it will hit the price of $1 because you’ll just wasting your time waiting for that moment.",

But as soon as he left Doge, everything crumble down and so is the price.And for the manipulation that the OP describe, it's not that easy as it sounds. And it's better if Doge will grow naturally, instead of this manipulation and artificial inflation.

DOGE is an inflationary coin that has no significant use-case at all. Ethereum is an inflationary coin, but it is a smart contract platform that's why many are using it. DOGE on the other hand, has no use case aside from it being a tipping coin. Now will DOGE hit a dollar? Possible, but what are the chances of it? Very low knowing that it's supply is unlimited with limited to no use-case at all, I doubt that it will reach a dollar.Why DOGE OP? Isn't it because of your username? Are you at a loss right now holding DOGE?",

Many people is promoting and posting. however, the price of doge is under $1. i think the main reason is that most of them did not even understand the definition of Currency and the Most basic function of a currency: 1.store value 2.medium of exchange.BTC is capped @ 20million. thus BTC can serve as a medium to store value🔥, while Doge with a inflation rate each year. the bigger quantity is suitable for daily transaction and daily use⚡. currently, the basic fee is only 0.01 doge/kb, the speed improved very much. but the price still near $0.1 recently. not even mention those $1, $8 claims. just a dream. To make doge break $1 or $8. the only way is to promote it to be adopted by stores worldwide. Just use it!. this is the only intrinsic value of doge. tipping is a past as every doge make sense.if you have chance go to China. you will be surprised that everyone use Alipay/Wechat to pay everything. buy food, car, apartment etc. about 10 years ago, 90%😲 of Chinese mainly use bank card, POS to pay big and cash for daily life. now, 95%+👀 Chinese people only take a phone to do everything. this is adoption. If i was the owner of the top 1 holder with about 30 billion doge. I would spend/spread 5-10 billion doge to promote it worldwide for adoption. it is easy to make 100x return and the price of doge will be more stable. This is the only way to make doge valuable. otherwise, it has no other competitive advantages. then your 30 billion only is a number and hard for you to cash out at a Good price. IF doge wanna break $1 or $10, the wide adoption is the only way. posting on twitter is foolish.without wide adoption, it will never hit $8, even hard for $1 in a short time. it is only a picture.  if you doge wanna break $1 or hit $10 in reasonable timethen do, Quote1. To promote doge to be adopted worldwide > posting twitter2. The big boss need take action to promote (donate Big to charity, college, contest, etc) if not, many other tokens will dillute the market making your ~30billion doge @ lower value😨.different ideas welcomed 😉Top holders aren't going to just donate it out, those people will only tend to sell off it anyway lowering the price.  It isn't going up because anyone who was dumb enough to buy and hold doge has done so already, smart folks already got rid of it.  Demand can never outpace endless supply so inevitably it will continue to go down in value over the long term just like fiat.",
