  "content": "This is to be used as reference for flag,Disclaimer: Still a fan of Bitsler but I just do not agree with this, hopefully the wise community here can Support or Oppose.If you think this flag is without merit please feel free to oppose, otherwise your support will be appreciated.So I am a player of bitsler, I also contribute by reporting errors and typos, bugs(mostly just display ones), suggestions and recommendations.So last month I came to discover a presumably unintentional privacy violation of Bitsler, I told Gabriel(one of their admin) about it.Come today, I checked and the error is still happening. So with the help of a friend in what I should do, I decided to follow the procedure listed here:https://help.bitsler.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012865773-How-to-report-a-bug-Quote from: myself via emailHello,   This will serve as my formal application for the bounty you offer for finding error and/or bug.What I found was you're possible exposure to consequences for violation of privacy of users. Since you guys havethe feature where players can hide their username from the public list of bets, players would expect you to makesure their username is not seen by public in the \"All Bets\" list. For most of the games, it is working just fine,except for Blast.Attached here is a youtube link for a video of me making a bet in blast after making sure I opted-in hiding my username from the publicbets list. (snipped youtube link. ..)They have promptly replied, summary : I asked for the reward, BTC to be sent to my Wallet they refused. Gave me a gold chest instead which in my own experience of opening VipChests would be $2.50 worth of whatever currency it will draw, so I said I'd rather have the promised BTC as wisely advised by a friend.They declined, and I disagree with them in this matter so I seek your wise and fair opinion. If I am at wrong here, let me know. Thank you very dearly.link of the flag = https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3002edit:They casually made an agreement via :https://web.archive.org/web/diff/20210411153548/20220707091203/https://help.bitsler.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012865773-How-to-report-a-bug-",

(Less reward for reporting it)Given that privacy is a very hot topic, they have exposure. Example, I don't want them to list my bets in public coz I don't want anybody from the observer of that public list to be able to know if I'm a big player or not. Well I'm not, and I wanted to keep that private(which I believe I did when I enabled the hide-my-bet-from-public feature) here https://www.bitsler.com/en/settings/privacy .Quote from: examplens on July 07, 2022, 11:16:53 AMwhat I like least about the whole thing, is in one part of the conversation, you seem like you are begging for BTC. I begged/asked them to honor the BTC reward which I believe I am entitled to. Quote from: examplens on July 07, 2022, 11:16:53 AMI mean, you talk about the giveaway without clearly indicating value,Its not a giveaway. and the value is determined by them, so I can't know that in advance would I? Quote from: examplens on July 07, 2022, 11:16:53 AM but you still need him,Yes I need him/them to close it so I can move on to other important things.

Yes I was the first one. That's the reason they gave me a Vip Gold Chest as the reward.The email chain contains where I said to Emily, Yes I was the one who reported it, and she replied to talk to Gabriel directly about it. Which I declined and said I wish to have the reward in BTC and sent to my wallet directly. here is a screenshot of my informal report to Gabriel:from telegramQuote from: DireWolfM14 on July 07, 2022, 12:47:52 PMReporting bug is noble thing to do, and offering a bounty is also a noble thing to do, but making a stink about what the reward is, or how it's delivered isn't a good look, in my opinion.Yep. I would have preferred to settle it in private. But since we agreed to disagree about their bounty this time, I seek expert opinion. The amount in the Chest is $2.5 in xrp (7xrp+ which is still there untouched I even told them that I tried sending it back to Emily but tip restriction. . . .)(https://www.bitsler.com/chest/466712) which was why I'd prefer BTC sent to my wallet directly. (coins.ph issue that may be resolved with btc tx with description(from my wallet, I can send to coins.ph address with message what it is for .  .  . .I could continue explaining but this is not directly relevant to the topic at hand.)",

The admin(Gabriel) just acknowledged your report and forwarded it to the technical devs which is the common action of support. We need to see here a solid evidence that you indeed report it first or some acknowledgment from the admin. Sending you a VIP chest is not a solid proof to prove point since they have a rule to sent only BTC to first reporter.I am not sure but with the tone in the conversation, I thought that I, being first-to-report has been established.Quote from: Eternad on July 07, 2022, 01:33:37 PMI hope you can get what you deserve for your bug finding work since this is not an easy job. On the contrary it was very easy, I just made a bet, felt something was not right. And figured out it was my username shown on the public bet.I considered it not a job but an occasional gig(For a lot of instances I would find myself in the website not playing not chatting but checking for errors or something that can be improved. For the longest time I did not use support to report them, I usually just dm NwoBitcoin our very engaged community manager or Gabriel, but recently I was told to refer to support for bounties/bugs/display errors/, so I did)It is not as fun as before where I get the occasional surprises from nwo and Gabriel -- Quote from: examplens on July 07, 2022, 02:20:16 PMwhatever you call it, there is still no pre-determined precise amount set aside for this.

Perhaps it was partly my fault for not following standard submission of report.

The last time I have withdrawn BTC from Bitsler in the February month and the withdrawal fee was quite low. I have provided the information here. I just asked the live support of Bitsler and they have confirmed that BTC withdrawal fee is still dynamic (depends on network condition).Anyway, you should appreciate the amount which you have received from Bitsler team for reporting the issue. They haven't mentioned in the article that the reward will be paid directly to your wallet. They have rewarded you with a gold chest at least. You have received a little amount of XRP from it by using your luck. I don't see any reason for creating this flag. Seems like you are trying to create a pressure on Bitsler team so that they pay you BTC on your wallet.",
