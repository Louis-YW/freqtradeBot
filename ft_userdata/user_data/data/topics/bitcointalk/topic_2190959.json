Except the fact that linux dev's have been working on their OS for many years, while bitcoin dev's might not have a lot of experience in writing OS's. It's all open source, it can all be compiled by you (if you really want to).If you mean, cellphones running straight from the blockchain, i must say i don't see any technical way of booting a device from a decentralised ledger... That would be impractical (to say the least), maybe even impossible.last but not least, a common misconception: Bitcoin != AnonymousAll bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger which can be downloaded, parsed, verified, analysed, tracked,... by anyone that wants to do this. All inputs and outputs of every transaction are known...If you want anonimity while using BTC, you need to use external anonimity services like mixers in order to achieve some anonimity, so don't confuse Tor and VPN with the blockchain.",

The blockchain can offer data safety, but since everybody can have then access to your data, there's a chance that sooner or later will try to decrypt your data for various reasons.Do you want to store the data in the way the blockchain does? Then it will be your blockchain and no more \"Core product\".Also, new blocks come out every some minutes. This may not really be feasible for telephony or chat.However, there's something already done that may be in the direction you seem to want to go, it's called Bitmessage. I guess that same idea can be used/adapted for VoIP too.",

Bitcoin core is a digital successor of the crypto currency that is now traded on all over the world through its legality based on jurisdiction. Bitcoin core is programed to decide which block chain contains valuable transactions.The users of block chain core only accept transactions for that blockchain ,making it the bitcoin blockchain that everyone else that want.",
