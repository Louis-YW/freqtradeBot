I can set the same custom fee rate on my bluewallet as well (on android) as you can see below in the screenshot.There are many wallets (even the non recommended close source wallets) that you can customize the fee, so I too wonder how setting fee to 1 sat/vbyte unique on a wallet that is not recommendable.Quote from: Edwardard on February 13, 2023, 03:50:42 AMAnd Im sure you can do the same on electrum (in a desktop). However it is not recommended to always set such low fees, since your transaction might take a very long time to get confirmed or even get dropped after weeks of waiting.There are many times that 1 sat/vbyte is good because the mempool is not congested and the highest fee priority can be 1 sat/vbyte, higer fee rate at the time is not necessary. You can check the fee rate priority on the mempool on some websites, like:https://mempool.spacehttps://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,24h,weight",

That's not unique in any way nowadays, and other wallets do that as well. Quote from: Sarah Azhari on February 13, 2023, 02:58:27 AMthe default address is native segwit (bc1), we change also address type to be legacy (1), I don't know why the developer don't including nested segwit also (3) as opsi. There are very few reasons to still use legacy addresses. If you are still using a service that only supports deposits and withdrawals to legacy addresses, you should abandon it for your own safety. I think atomic swaps is one use case that still requires legacy addresses. But if it's in connection with an exchange or a casino, they lag behind the trends. Quote from: Edwardard on February 13, 2023, 03:50:42 AMHowever it is not recommended to always set such low fees, since your transaction might take a very long time to get confirmed or even get dropped after weeks of waiting. According to mempool.space, transactions with fee rates below 1.08 sat/vbyte are currenty getting purged. So there is that.",

Why do you choose this app over others like bluewallet, mycelium ?Maybe because the wallet is called HODL Wallet, and that gives some people the impression of some kind of security, considering the concept behind that abbreviation. Not so long ago, we discussed how important the name is when choosing a crypto wallet, so we mentioned the infamous Freewallet, which, despite being a proven scam, still attracts new users. If someone chooses a crypto wallet only by name, I would conclude that he is a person who does not even know the basics and puts himself at great risk, and what is even worse, they can harm others with their advice.",
