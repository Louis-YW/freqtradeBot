I'm writing to raise awareness about a critical security threat that poses a significant risk to iOS users and probably other operating systems. Recently, a new malware called HVNC(Hidden Virtual Network Computer)  designed by some Russian hackers is being sold on the dark web for a staggering $60,000 price for a lifetime access. HVNC is a highly sophisticated malware with powerful phishing capabilities. Once it gains access to a device, it can be utilized to breach crypto wallets, potentially leading to the loss of funds or even complete control of your assets.This dangerous HVNC tool, discovered by cybersecurity firm Guardz, grants hackers full access to Apple systems, making it possible to steal personal information and cryptocurrencies. The creator of this malware is now selling it for around $100,000, and its existence poses a severe threat to our community's security.To protect ourselves, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution when accessing unknown websites, especially the dark web. ## For users of mobile wallets, it is strongly advised to avoid visiting such sites altogether due to the heightened risk of cybercriminals accessing your personal data.##In case you must access these websites, take every precaution possible. Use a secure connection or a \"VPN\" or opt to use a device that is entirely separate from your personal data to mitigate the risk.Remember that the safety of our digital assets and personal information is of utmost importance. Let us all remain vigilant and security-conscious to safeguard ourselves and the Bitcoin community from potential harm.Here's a source for full details: https://cryptonews.net/21394922/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app&utm_campaign=shared",

In the article you posted, it says that the seller has placed $100k in escrow as proof that the malware works as they said it will, the article doesn't state how the escrow was set up, so there is also a possibility that the seller could be a scammer.People are becoming more knowledgeable about cybercrimes, so buying this is even going to be risky for a criminal who can afford it, because you may not be able to recover your money. I don't care if people are scammed when they try to scam other people, but i care about the victims of scams, so it is important to be very careful about malwares and protect your coins and personal data, don't click on links that you are not sure of and double check everything when it is about your coins.",

Based on the article the malware has been offered on a Russian Cyber Forum since April 2023 so its possible that some hackers are already using it if it's effective we will read more reports about this malware but this early we should take our security seriously  QuoteHVNC is a highly sophisticated malware with powerful phishing capabilities.

They may already be using this malware to attack their targeted victims, many crypto users may have already fallen victim. A crypto user always needs to be aware of cybersecurity, as cybercriminals target crypto users most of the time these days. So I think it is very important for crypto users to be careful now because these scammers will try to trap crypto users with this malware, and for this they will promote with various tempting offers so that inexperienced crypto users install this malware on their devices.

Means there was not text in it. Hehe. Moral of the story, A scammer selling a fake took (HVNC) just to scam other scammers. I means he will fills as he will.    Thanks to OP, for sharing such useful information because i love to read about new threats like these because early knowledge of such threats not only save you but also save the data of your loved ones.",

Because the scam accusations section is not as much visited and because it's more a warning than a scam accusation written against someone. DT members won't be able to red tag account.

Well, we have to because that's how we protect ourselves and avoid these malware. And in today's time, it is a basic need to have that basic knowledge about cybersecurity so that a user should always be aware of the potential threats that can go within his/her device.Quote from: Faisal2202 on August 05, 2023, 05:10:40 PMA scammer selling a fake took (HVNC) just to scam other scammers. This is also what I am thinking of. OP mentioned that this software/tool is being sold in the dark web. The potentality of it that it can also be a bluff sale could be done by anyone who's aware of this. And those cool boys that pretends to be hackers or just known this stuff could also make them fall for it. Anyway, going back as a user, whether you're an iOS, android, MAC, windows, linux or any operating systems user. One thing that you need to remember is to never get yourself a link that you're not familiar with and the same goes for downloading apps unknown to you.",
