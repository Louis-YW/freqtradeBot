And on top, Apple, MicroSoft, Google and Amazon.In any case though, not sure if comparison is needed by Bitcoin against this company, I mean the market is very volatile that we can jump several places below/higher. Just wait till the next bull run, for sure we may crack top 10-15, and then goes down hard again in a bear market.",

Now imagine how  the world will take crypto if it can sit any where among the top 5... its going to be something the world can't ignore anymore and I expect panic buying for fear of missing out on the new gold.",

Bitcoin ATH marketcap was at $1.24T - more than current amazon and google marketcap. I don't think that this \"news\" needs to be announced. We just pumped to 20k after dump from 69k to 15k. Its nothing big so far. A rally to 40k would be impressive so far its just a relief rally.",
