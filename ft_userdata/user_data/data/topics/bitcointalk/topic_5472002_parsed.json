Debt is one reasons why many people can't go up and recover because instead of paying the whole amount, they're only paying the interest rates that's staying there for so long. While the loan sharks are taking advantage of the situation and does that.",

It is not easy to debt free with how difficult the economy is many countries, but at the same time it is possible to be debt free if you live a very planned life and make sure that your expenses is not more than what you earn. If you are debt free, it does not mean that you have never borrowed sometime to sort some bills, but what it means to me is that you are credit worthy and always quick to settle a debt whenever you have it. You plan your life well so you do not owe any debt.",

All that matters is source of income, if someone has more than one source of income or multiple of it then there are high chances to level up with the economic challenges and give aids to others because there are people who still give aid because they have invested and diversified their source of income.",

For example, here in Venezuela, people do not have access to debt, banks do not give loans and credit cards are de facto useless, because the maximum debt they permit is very low, just a few USD. So because of that, people here are forced to pay with cash for homes and vehicles. I have personally met people who had to pay homes and cars with bills. In consequence, even though it can be perceived as an disadvantage in some sense, most of the population in this country lives a debt free life.",

I do have a single credit card, but I am careful not to let the balance get out of control.  Living debt-free on a single income is not always easy, but since I am not married anymore, it is manageable.  Sure I have to watch my spending and stick to a budget.  But not owing money to anyone?

They are different ways of seeing life, and in many western cultures it's the latter the most common one.",

Reason because it's not every time you can boost of having physical cash to settle somethings you bought from your customer. It might even be that you have money in your account but can't send to him/her because they don't have bank account. So it will make you take things on credit. But some people has made it obvious that when ever they take a Dept, it becomes a problem for them to pay back without undermining the effect on the third party. No one is above Dept even the economy we are, always take dept from the neighbouring countries.",

It is necessary that your income should exceed or at least be equal to your expenses, then it will be possible to live without debts. But personally, it is very difficult for me to do this because I do not often keep my budget. But in spite of this, there are still people who live absolutely debt-free. But these are most likely people who have an additional source of income or a huge salary that allows them to cover all their expenses. true but a lot of rich people are the ones who often have credit cards or are offered loans the most those are still technically debts that they have to later on pay as they workliving a debt-free life would be hard to attain to but i’m sure there are a few who have done it already and is still doing it this takes so much self-control and intensive planning you’re gonna have to plan your everyday expenses even the unexpected expenses in short it’s extremely difficult to do because life is unexpected and will often hit us with surprises",
