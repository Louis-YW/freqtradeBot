  "content": "Bitcoin Miner, TheCoinDad, has an extensive collection of Bitcoin miners, and has decided to showcase it publicly, creating the world's first Bitcoin Mining Museum.Quote from: https://bitcoinminingmuseum.com/#aboutIt was not until 2021 that he realized he might have the most extensive Bitcoin mining collection in the world and decided to focus on helping preserve the history of Bitcoin mining hardware as much as possible. That is how the Bitcoin Mining Museum was born. His collection now extends to over 80 different Bitcoin mining machines from across the globe. To this day, he is still actively adding to this collection.For the first time ever, the Bitcoin Mining Museum was exhibited at Mining Disrupt 2022 - Miami, Florida.Some of the visitors of the exhibition included Ning Zhang(Avalon 2 designer) and Liu Xiangfu(Avalon co-founder).More information:web: https://bitcoinminingmuseum.comtelegram: @thecoindadtwitter: https://twitter.com/TheCoinDad",

And with such museum like this¬† it makes it looks practical and real.",

Went to through the thread and understood hw they've developed the code for the Mobile device. Maybe adding a Nokia N900 and mentioning the history could make people know it better. In the thread saw about the phone to phone transaction of bitcoin. These days we're going doing it regularly, but the 0.42BTC is mentioned as the first bitcoin transaction done from mobile.",

Their names and specifications? The maximum amount of btc mined at the peak of opportunity?This is a very narrow niche with a small number of devices and a small number of people (among the inhabitants) who are interested in mining precisely from the standpoint of historical interest. It seems to me that this museum will not be universally popular and will most likely cease to exist quite soon, if measured by the standards of such institutions.It is impossible not to be sarcastic on the topic: now there is a place to attach spent old asics to miners.",

Also, as far as I know, there was another bitcoin mining museum in Venezulena and I saw that on the news just a few days or weeks ago so I cannot be sure if this one is truly the world's first Bitcoin Mining Museum or not.",

I guess the exact date of when the \"museum\" was opened should be the basis in determining which actually came first. It seems both museums were opened last year. The one in Venezuela was opened some time in July last year. The one in the OP was also opened in 2021 although I didn't see an exact date for the opening. The more the better of course, but the more firsts the more confusion there is.",
