Gambling may not help addicts but it is helping the economy. Many people are employed directly or indirectly because of the gambling businesses in Nigeria.

People who are not benefiting from gambling are much more than people who are benefiting from it. Although they are paying revenue to the government, but the government fails to understand that the numbers of citizens that are addicted to gambling is much bigger than those that are employed in the business.In some countries, if they see that more people are not benefiting from gambling or anything, they will ban that thing.  Countries like Qatar, Cambodia and many more.Those countries that do not allow gambling, their economy are much appreciated than ours, instead of the government to ban gambling and make Bitcoin legal, they turn it the other way.",

People that are poor have reasons that they are gambling but the rich people are gambling with more money.Quote from: Su-asa on September 21, 2023, 09:26:32 PMWell, if you said so, I don't see how gambling is helping the Nigerian economy, because even the gambling industry does not employ good numbers of citizens. People who are not benefiting from gambling are much more than people who are benefiting from it. Helping economy: both employment and tax payment. There are numerous gambling companies in Nigeria and they are helping the economy. Quote from: Su-asa on September 21, 2023, 09:26:32 PMAlthough they are paying revenue to the government, but the government fails to understand that the numbers of citizens that are addicted to gambling is much bigger than those that are employed in the business.To ban gambling means lack of freedom for some people. In countries that gambling are banned, there are still ways people in those countries are gambling. Example is China that ban gambling, but gamblers in China are far more than people that are gambling in Nigeria. Quote from: Su-asa on September 21, 2023, 09:26:32 PMIn some countries, if they see that more people are not benefiting from gambling or anything, they will ban that thing.  Countries like Qatar, Cambodia and many more.Those countries that do not allow gambling, their economy are much appreciated than ours, instead of the government to ban gambling and make Bitcoin legal, they turn it the other way.Religion is what that make some countries to ban gambling. Qatar are mostly Muslims and Muslims ban gambling in their religion. You can research about Muslim countries and see how they have strict laws against gambling, also are countries that Buddhism is their religion. Buddhism is the religion in Cambodia.",

When you're into gambling no they expect sey e go they favour u always or e go they affect you all the time. Everybody no sey gambling na 50/50 chance, but plenty people they over look the risk wey dey involved to the extent wey them they even carry am as their only source of income which is not suppose to be so. Gambling no dey reliable so I no advice anybodu to relie on am as only place wey u fit make money the best thing na to use am as side hustle",

      "body": "Any gambler gambling strictly and desperately to make profits in the gamble is really out of the minds because gambling platforms are not charity programs to enrich whoever that signs in to the platforms. Periodically the gambling board is projected to generate finances for the site owners and in most cases, it is programed in a vice versa. Systematically is to also have the gamblers little chances to win so they could always retain their interests of staying further on the gambling sites that's why the gamblers could even have those little privileges of winning unless it's one of those live games which can't be manipulated by the game bookmakers.It's certainly not worth celebrating to say gamblers are lot winning in the casino when you don't know you number of people that has lost in the gamble. Gambling site's benefits more than the gamblers and failure for gamblers to debunk those buzzes picturing gambling to be easy routes of making money would always end them up loosing the little funds they've realized during this had times.The strategy doesn't work at all Op. Winning up to #50,000 today and in all of your lost being accumulated you realizes that you've lost more than the #50,000 you just won at at time, who's fooling who? Because some persons would still think they've won some profits but right in, they're still loosing because they're only on the recovery of their losts.Gambling is not a source of income although you can be lucky to win on your first stake and then you can just run away and never bet again. Haha.But with that taste of winning in the first place it'd be hard to stay off after making your first winning.",

So when it comes to sports betting you will see them go extra mile just to make sure they stake. Some people will tell you that the kind of money thy are looking for that no work can pay them within the time space they are looking for the money. Gamblers has this believe that if they don't succeed today, they will tomorrow through the betting. I have one in my street, every weekend he is always playing games with #100 and expecting to win millions of Naira and he keeps losing till date. When I ask him why continue in this habbit, he sad he has this believe that before he die on this Earth that he will win that big money someday. I was shocked by his response and firm believe. Despite the advices he has been given, yet nothing changes. He will play more than 10 slips at the end of the day nothing happens and he will lose all.",

Gambling site employed workers pay task even the so called citizens that gamble benefits as they may win during the process. Two things is always involved in life win loss, there is nothing government can do because this is base on individual choice but government can control it partially with good policy to minimize high level of addiction, by the citizens but I don't think is taking or course anything I the economy because some nation is having more record than our nation but still have better economy than we the whole thing lies in the hand of the government through their policy.",

Generally gambling can be a gate out of poverty and also it can be a gate into poverty. What someone might take serious and to be successful someone else would do same thing abd suck at it. There are people who went into gambling because of their freind, colleague or family member became successful through gambling. They do not understand the level of discipline and tolerance that person has gobe through before being successful.I know life is full of risk but if we should take risk it should be something what risking for. Am supporting the opinion that gambling shouldn't be considered as a career or wirk. There is nothing like a professional gambler.",
