But he had won 8 fights which is not to ignore. If he puts his heart into it, I think he may give a good fight.",

What's more, what he will be fighting against is Tommy, who is just an ordinary fighter.So it's not difficult for Jake to finish the fight with an easy and short victory.For betting, there will definitely be more bettors who place their bets on Jake and this is a good opportunity for us if we want to bet on this fight.",

Maybe they know something the public doesn't as it's hard to keep the rumours of these events from spreading once the ball is rolling and contracts are signed but there's nothing on Jake's or Tommy social media pages and those will be the first places to look for confirmation. The fight is almost a month away which seems quite soon as well. Have they both been in camp?

You don't go into the big fights without building yourself up first just like Jake has been doing. Personally I think this is a pretty well rounded fight and the biggest test for both of them. I don't see a knock-out and my money is on it going the distance. The biggest thing for me is it could end Tommy's boxing career before it's even started if he loses. I'm sure he's getting a life changing amount of money and will just pivot into being a social media star or something so it won't be too much of a loss but that embarrassment of losing to a YouTuber will certainly sting and it will never leave him.",

A win-win situation for Tommy either way, then. Guy's obviously not born to be a boxer unlike his siblings and his father. Has a weak chin, doesn't have that fighter instinct, and punches weak and low for most of the time. If ever, he can use the money that he'll get from this fight (if it pushes through) to start a podcast or create videos for social media and just chase stardom. After all he already has the experience in the entertainment industry and he can just use this fight as a leverage to further just that. I mean, just look at his past opponents. One guy even has 100+ losses with only 10+ wins! How can you even call that a proper and respectable win?",

Bocianski's ratio looks only good when you don't check who he fought. He only fought locally and Tommy was his first fight abroad, so he's not really an experienced fighter. Many of his opponents had very bad stats. It doesn't really mean anything if you win against a guy who's 11-37 or 2-12 and those were the guys he was fighting. They were just there to inflate his score and get him better paid contracts.Jake Paul wants to win against a big name and Fury is a big name, even if it's the weaker little brother.",

One guy even has 100+ losses with only 10+ wins! How can you even call that a proper and respectable win? Well that will just be what they call a journeyman and if you look at the early records of pretty much all pro boxers you will see the same stuff even with the current superstars like Tyson and Wilder etc. They just take easy opponents early on to break fighters in and pad their record to make their 'unbeaten' status look better than it actually is. It's a wise thing to do really as it would be a bit silly for a fighter to start off against people he is unlikely to win against.

First time was a broken rib and some illness related to it and the second time he literally just couldn't get into the US due to his brother's association with the Kinehan Cartel (which I thought was harsh as Tommy has nothing to do wit them). Tommy seems to really want this fight. It will be a life-changing some of money, grow his exposure even more and he seems to think it's an easy fight for him. Jake probably also feels the same and that's why I'm hyped for this fight. It's a challenge for both of them and there's a lot on the line for both of them. If Jake loses then it's no big deal. He will say he wasn't supposed to win against a Pro but if he wins then Fury is going to be embarrassed potentially out of the sport.",
