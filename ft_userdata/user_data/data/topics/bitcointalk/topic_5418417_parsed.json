  "content": "Anyone have read President Nayib Bukele article on the Bitcoin Magazine?I really like how he answered his detractors here specially those who are saying that it's very wrong to invest their money on bitcoin.And about censorship? let me quote,QuoteThey used to own everything, and in a way they still do; the media, the banks, the NGOs, the international organizations, and almost all the governments and corporations in the world.And with that, of course, they also own the armies, the loans, the money supply, the credit ratings, the narrative, the propaganda, the factories, the food supply; they control international trade and international law. But their most powerful weapon is the control of the “truth”.And they are willing to fight, lie, smear, destroy, censor, confiscate, print, and do whatever it takes to maintain and increase their control over the “truth”, and everything, and everyone.https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/stop-drinking-the-elites-kool-aidAnd so at least he has responded to those who have criticized him, the media, the financial watchdog and the West.",

It's hard to tell if they saw the news as potentially negative though (if people hadn't heard of El Salvador before or only heard of it negatively) or if they were actually just trying to hide it.I wonder if this is him still trying to defend his insistence of his country's investment in bitcoin or if it's him trying to attract a certain audience (like we saw with gamestop).The second would probably be a lucrative strategy for them (as it was for gamestop) but I imagine, if it is that, the hedge funds are going to start doing exactly the same thing and try to profit off it too...It's quite impressive they are laying the groundwork for a web3 integrated economy though (as it'd look like they are by sending citizens bitcoin) it should make them much more capable of embracing new technologies and allow their economy to boost as a result (it's probably something other countries will and should do, at least with a CBDC as the fastest growing economies will soon be the most adaptive - or may already be).",

      "body": "That was a brilliant and well reserved responds given by Nayib Bukele the president of El Salvador to the world, because with the statement given below which I found in the article link above, it clearly shows he really understood Bitcoin and had great trust in it before accepting it as a legal tender, which i still believe was a great move despite the fall in the price of Bitcoin. But one thing certain is that media will always want to tell a story, not minding it's authenticity, of which legalizing Bitcoin, a currency that can't be controlled by the government,  it became a target to international communities who needed to have control over it's economy. But with this, it's a clear sign El Salvador Is never ready to play along to the gameQuoteIf El Salvador succeeds, many countries will follow. If El Salvador somehow fails, which we refuse to, no countries will follow.They know this very well and that’s why they are fighting us so hard.Will you play their game?Or will you become aware of the real game?",

They want to ensure that the people don't have the power to determine their financial future. Issues that are against bitcoin would be given very wide publicity, while the benefits or exploits of this unique cryptocurrency are given no or fewer media coverage. International organizations are financed by some powerful governments, which make them protect their interest to the detriment of other nations. We saw IMF and World Bank discouraging El Salvador from making bitcoin a legal tender because it would affect the dominance and gains of their financiers.",

When the government continues to control fiat finances, there needs to be a balance. Therefore, the mindset of a Nayib Bukele has paved the way for state governments who are still hesitant to adopt Bitcoin, more convinced that full control of a country's economic power is an important key in the future.",

I like that Bukele is trying to do something innovative, choosing things other people wouldn't. That's how things are done... or undone  I feel like he's going all in with other people's money and the more he's criticized the more he pushes back with \"bad West\". There are things I like about and in which I agree with him like the fact that the IMF is corrupt to the bone and its threats that Bukele should drop Bitcoin support are annoying and show how much the banksters hate free money. There are also things I don't like playing a victim and acting like the whole world is against him. I'm quite sure that if he manages to hold what he's invested for another year or 2 he's going to come out ahead. We'll see if he can survive the pressure.",

At the same time, only the amount of transaction fees for transfers of funds from salvadorans outside the country to their families annually amounts to about $400 million.Well here are the figures that Bukele cites in the article : \"In 2021, our GDP grew by 10.3%, tourism revenues increased by 52%, employment increased by 7%, new enterprises grew by 12%, exports increased by 17%, energy production increased by 19%, energy exports increased by 3,291%, and domestic revenues increased by 37%, and all this without raising any taxes.

All that stuff about controlling the truth sounds good to ignite anger against 'them' and sympathy toward Bukele himself. While being elected democratically and maintaining a high approval rate, he his also ruling the country in an authoritarian manner, cracking down on opposition. He is a right-wing politician with conservative views not only on same-sex marriage, but also on abortion in any situations (including rape and risk to health of the mother) and euthanasia.So while he is very pro-Bitcoin and is clearly okay with more financial freedom of his citizens, his talk of freedom in the article and him accusing everyone else for controlling the truth aren't completely fair.",
