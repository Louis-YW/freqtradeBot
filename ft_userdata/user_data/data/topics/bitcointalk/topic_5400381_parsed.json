  "content": "Top 15 influencers on Twitter, and what do famous bloggers write about?Twitter is one of the most popular social networks, especially in North America. Twitter has become one of the most important platforms for discussing various crypto projects, probably it is because Google and Facebook banned NFT advertising. At the moment, more than 3 thousand observers of the crypto world are actively functioning here. This study aims to understand who can have a real impact today and enjoy the most significant popularity.Top 15 Individual InfluencersToday, I've tried to single out 15 people who have the most significant influence on the crypto exchange development. Let's take a look:Elon Musk Number of subscribers - 95 million. Elon Musk is one of the most famous entrepreneurs in the world. He communicates with his audience mainly through Twitter. Here, he advertises his projects, such as Starlink, talks about social and humanitarian topics, and often talks about the crypto world. It's no secret that he has had a significant impact on the development of various tokens and coins. For example, last year, Shiba Inu stated that Elon Musk invested a large amount of money in developing this, but the billionaire denied this data on his Twitter. The Shiba Inu price fell by more than 30% during that day. And there are many such results. At the beginning of this year, Elon Musk criticized Twitter's desire to integrate NFT and enter the crypto market, and after that, he bought this social network altogether. That is why many crypto enthusiasts are worried about whether they will be able to use their non-fungible tokens in the form of avatars. He has also been actively arguing with Dmitry Rogozin, which is being actively discussed on the network.Neymar Jr Number of subscribers - 56.8 million. Neymar is one of the best footballers in the world. He actively maintains his page on Twitter, where many users follow him. Most of his posts here are related to professional activities, where he can start polemics with other famous football players. It is no secret that Neymar is actively interested in cryptocurrencies and everything connected with them. So, for example, recently, the news spread worldwide that he bought 2 NFTs for a million dollars from the Bored Ape Yacht (BAYC) collection. It is worth noting that this collection caught the attention of Eminem too. He paid over $450,000 for his monkey.Liam Number of subscribers - 34.6 million. One of the famous group One Direction members is also one of the most critical influencers in the world of cryptocurrencies. In addition to his main activities and speeches on Twitter, he exposes information about events dedicated to NFT and cryptocurrencies, including VeeCon. Here, you can also get a celebrity's opinion about the various collections and artists.Mesut Ozil Number of subscribers - 26.2 million. Another famous football player is passionate about the crypto world. Most of his Twitter page is filled with his professional activities, but he recently announced his desire to issue his cryptocurrency. According to preliminary data, traders will be able to trade this, like bitcoins, and owners of significant assets will be able to count on a personal meeting with a football player.Marshall Mathers Number of subscribers - 22.6 million. When you visit Eminem's Twitter page, it's immediately apparent that he is a crypto enthusiast. Instead of an avatar, he has the same NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht (BAYC) collection, which he bought for $450,000. Eminem's love for the NFT also proved that the artist decided to release his own Shady Con collection. It is a high-quality animation with rap music.Ronaldinho Gaucho Number of subscribers - 20.7 million. Only the lazy professional footballer today is not into NFTs or cryptocurrencies. Of course, most of the Ronaldinho Gaúcho page is filled with football, but there is a small place for the crypto world. In particular, he created his NFT collection, where he portrayed himself in various football looks. It is worth noting that this collection was a massive success with fans.Snoop Dogg Number of subscribers - 20.2 million. From the first glance at Snoop Dogg's Twitter page, it's clear that he's in love with the NFT. It manifests itself not only in the fact that he released his collection of pixelated avatars but also in the fact that he constantly posts various NFTs in his feed, offers to compare them, and looks for unusual solutions. For example, it is immediately apparent that he is now passionate about the Food Fighters Universe. Snoop Dogg sets trends in the world of NFT and surveys attention to the most interesting, in his opinion, projects.Ashton Kutcher Number of subscribers - 17.1. Ashton Kutcher and his wife Mila Kunis have earned over $8 million from their Toon Stoner Cats NFT collection. We see one of these NFTs on the actor's page. In addition, several serial series are being prepared based on this collection. In general, he is passionate about his career and political and social issues.Paris Hilton Number of subscribers - 16.9 million. Paris Hilton was one of the first celebrities interested in the NFT. So, in the summer of 2020, she sold a drawing of her cat for 40 ETH, and then she got excited about the idea of ​​releasing a loud, large, and very pink BFF \"You\" collection. Most of the images here are suitable for use as a Twitter avatar. An example can be found on the celebrity page.TreySongz.eth Number of subscribers - 13.7 million. According to Trey Songz, NFT can be not only in the form of an image but also in the form of music. That is why he released his collection for sale on Binance NFT. On Trey Songz's Twitter, you can find various music collections. He often posts from #MusicNFT. If you are interested in this type of NFT, you will find the most exciting novelties here.Serena Williams Number of subscribers - 10.7 million. Serena Williams is one of the most famous tennis players who believe that the NFT can bring more attention to women's sports. In her opinion, various NFTs can be used to support, promote and finance multiple sports. She also became one of BAYC's fans and got herself this NFT.Thalia Number of subscribers - 9.7 million. Singer Thalia is another bright representative of crypto enthusiasts. You can find various exciting collections on her Twitter, for example, @WixarikaNFT. It can be seen that she is interested in both standard NFTs in the form of images and musical tokens.

The list of well-known footballers who support the NFT also includes David Luiz.

He shares his career achievements and the most exciting projects from the crypto world on Twitter.Steve Aoki Number of subscribers - 8.2 million. More and more musicians are interested in NFT collections, and DJ Steve Aoki is no exception. First of all, he focused on NFT music collections, and on his Twitter, you can easily find the most compelling examples, in his opinion. It is one of the most respected music NFT connoisseurs whose style you can trust.It is an extremely interesting question, the top subscribers are in \"celebrities\" accounts, Sportsmans, Actors, Musicians etc. Did they truly love NFT, as an obvious individuals-interested-in-casual-investments of their interest in NFT is just a common trend and marketing budgets?

Most of them not only openly support the idea of ​​non-fungible tokens but also release their collections. Some of them are high quality and attract users' attention, such as Shady Con (Eminem) or Toon Stoner Cats (Ashton Kutcher). However, some designs are of inferior quality and are only sold because of having a creator. A clear example would be the Snoop Dog collection. The vast majority of celebrity crypto collections are sold on OpeanSea, the most famous platform in the world. In the future, such tokens can be resold for a lot of money, they hope Many influencers make vast amounts of money from advertising integrations about NFT Collections. Practice shows that this is one of the most expensive and effective types of advertising because the recommendation of such people is of great importance to their fans. It leads to the fact that the entire collection is sold out within a few minutes after its release.It must be said that influencers can be individualists and entire communities.

      "body": "sports players used to not be allowed to sell/monetise their own name/likeness(image) as their own property because under contract their team owned their name/image. but now sports players can monetise their own name/image. and so yes NFT has become a tool to tokenise their property.as for the price of their 'investments'.. well this is a sham..they want to promote that NFT are worth hundreds of thousands for one simple fact. when they want to sell their own property. they want top dollar for it.imagine they invested in an NFT for $0.20. and highlighted how they had 100,000 items meaning $20k investment.. other people would not see a single token as worth $20k but see tokens worth only $0.20they have to FAKE value some tokens as being worth hundreds of thousands of dolars each. just to make other tokens appear to be worth more then $0.20its like years ago. faking that a certain british 50pence piece was worth £200 (400x face value) just to try and make all coins of significant rarity try to be 400x face value.they do this by buying one single coin from an account they own using a second account they own. meaning they dont 'lose' £200. as its just paying themselves..but then its seen as a valid purchase for £200 on the market. thus makes idiots think these coins are worth £200. this same game is being played with NFT.many people have 2 accounts or celebrities sponsored by the initial owner to buy(and get secretly refunded) large sum. to make it look like an item is worth many times more its real value cost.everyone in the art world knows that art is not valuable while the artist is still alive especially if that artist is making hundreds of unique pieces a year..art is only valuable after death when there is only 1-10 unique pieces to that artists name.and where that art has circulated and passed hands multiple times to add on a bit of value each time it passes hands. the NFT prices are all fake. so be warned dont buy into something expensive thinking you can sell it for more.. realise you bought it at the over-valued price which the initial creator presented and faked via his initial first sale to himself/someone he sponsored to purchase it at a fake value.",

I also have some ideas, about \"why\": First: those \"celebrities\", musicians, sportsmans etc - they also a \"very rich people with low amount of free time and no specialisation in finance, but in need of set their capitals and handle their investments\"; so some of them could be really intrested into a new methods of investment, better in a cool and simple way, not that boring bonds Second: due to low restrictions and regulators most of them can safely advertise some uncertan (or even shady) products, without any legal restrictions, which helps their agent to increace rates, so by advertising such theme - they just increacing their income. Third: part of NFT-marketing schemes is MLM, the more hype, the more gains, so if they belive that they will increace hype - they will control their incomes (this is a huge advantage advantage over common buyers); it means in those MLM schemes they are a few who in real_control of situation, wich helps them gain even more income; And fourth: everyone becomes older, this is critical even more for sportsman, they have \"limited time' to gain initial subscibers and audience, and then they have to slowly diversify their expertise, to keep audience intrested even after professional carier will be over. And to gain some experience and popularity in finance, or new tech, or investments (and NFT/crypto is combination of those) - is probably a good long-term strategy",

NFT can have the potential of good underlying VALUE. if the PRICE were not set to silly random amounts way above value.imagine games like Call Of Duty.where the game developers develop a sniper gun with perfect accuracy and 'sniped' a player with one shot and had some 'heat seeking'(follow the target) feature that the bullet would follow the target after the trigger was pulled to ensure a hit even if the target moved at the last second to ensure a 'kill'... but where the developers only wanted 5000 players to be able to use it. (only 5000 tokens)where the game would seek proof of ownership via privkey signing to import the gun image/functionality into that players gameplay. this would then make those 5000 NFT tokens valuable to players. as they could not use the gun without having the private key of a gun assigned to them. thus they would pay more for this gun rather then a similar one on the in-game store that had less accuracy and was not limited to 5k playersof course the purchases and price listing would need to be fair and open. and not some silly closed auction of rigging the price to set a stupidly high price to fake value.but a NFT like this would then have value, as it has rarity and functionality, utility for its owner",

(only 5000 tokens)...This is quite an intresting question. I worked in Game Development industry for a while, and at one period of my life I needed to get used to Game Design and Game Balance topics. It could be a real catastrophy - inserting SOMETHING LIMITED into game, it turns a basics of game design rules to very specific line, so every and each time game developers have to insert something rare/limited - they have to think twice. But on the other hand, NFT game developers HAVE to constantly insert a lot of limited staff in game. For example, MCH - all the characters and all the items - have to be limited and unique. So game changes into some way of market, instead of just_game. So traders are intrested in that type of games, but not players.",

However, I think most “art” NFT have little to no underlying value. NFT can have the potential of good underlying VALUE. if the PRICE were not set to silly random amounts way above value.imagine games like Call Of Duty.where the game developers develop a sniper gun with perfect accuracy and 'sniped' a player with one shot and had some 'heat seeking'(follow the target) feature that the bullet would follow the target after the trigger was pulled to ensure a hit even if the target moved at the last second to ensure a 'kill'... but where the developers only wanted 5000 players to be able to use it. (only 5000 tokens)where the game would seek proof of ownership via privkey signing to import the gun image/functionality into that players gameplay. this would then make those 5000 NFT tokens valuable to players. as they could not use the gun without having the private key of a gun assigned to them. thus they would pay more for this gun rather then a similar one on the in-game store that had less accuracy and was not limited to 5k playersof course the purchases and price listing would need to be fair and open. and not some silly closed auction of rigging the price to set a stupidly high price to fake value.but a NFT like this would then have value, as it has rarity and functionality, utility for its ownerSure, a video game item may have some actual value because players would have some use for it. My prior comment was referring to the \"art\" NFTs that are nothing more than hashes of images that can be trivially duplicated, and often, the seller has no legitimate rights to the \"art\". I have posted in other threads that NFTs can also represent ownership of physical items, such as real estate, and this would be another example of when NFTs would have actual value.",

It seems to me that they feel that interest in cryptocurrencies is growing at a tremendous speed today, and they need to become part of this culture to stay afloat! I think it's ok! I think it would be worse if it were the other way around.I prefer to read more reputable communities like Ethereum or Binance.",
