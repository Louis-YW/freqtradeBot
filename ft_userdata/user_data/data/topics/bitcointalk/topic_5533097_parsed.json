It's clear that holding of one asset is not determine by the years if experience but ability to afford the asset or purchase it , even a day old experience person and buy and hold Bitcoin or any other asset provided you have your self custodian wallet to store it and keep your details properly , beaconing on your deep answer it's also Worthy to note that any asset hold Bitcoin or others need be careful on how private information regarding to it's holding is share to avoid scam including losses due to misplace of details of the wallet or account.",

This is also why people are advised against storing their bitcoins in exchanges because there, you do not have total control over your asset.If you wish to own bitcoins, you can buy from exchanges or through P2P.

The famous science fiction writer Roger Zelazny believed that at a certain level of development, technology is already indistinguishable from magic. That is why I like to use magical associations when I talk about bitcoins. For example, you can imagine that bitcoins are gold coins that are stored in a parallel reality and never leave it. However, we, in our reality, have the ability to acquire ownership of them (that is, own them, dispose of them and use them). This is not a legal right of ownership, it is based on the internal rules of bitcoin itself (its algorithm, its program code). In order to acquire ownership of the first cryptocurrency, we need private keys (or seed - a sequence of several English words).  And in order to exercise our right to own, use and dispose of coins (or parts of them), we need the appropriate software, which is called bitcoin wallets.",

The thing is that Bitcoin isn't something you learn a day, Bitcoin is a continues process, it's something you learn new things and the more you use it, the more you understand it, at the end of the day if you spend half your day in this forum, you won't know when you exceed 41 days.Bitcoin isn't stored in private keys, you nned the private keys to spend your Bitcoin that arr locked on your public keys and addresses, you only need a wallet to manage and spend your Bitcoin and there will ever be only 21 million of maximum/Total supply. You don't need Bitcoin ETF in my opinion, what you need is real Bitcoin else you might not need all this knowledge, just buy your ETF and you don't even need all this explanation but if you buy the real Bitcoin, you will want to learn everything about Bitcoin.",

If Bitcoin network is dead, your private keys mean nothing because you can not move your bitcoin to any other wallet/ address.It's different than banks, that can be lively but you don't own any private key, and always have to wait for bank approval on your bank transfers.
