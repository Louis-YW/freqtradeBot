I know this isn't relevant with the forum but I don't have anyone to talk to in order to let it out. Second day of 2023 and everything seems to be going great..a very bad person who has the heart to poison your cat, even though what's wrong with your cat, if you have something wrong, it's also an animal, don't overdo it until you poison it.they also have life, have life, and they are also creations of Allah, so don't judge animals arbitrarily.",

Second day of 2023 and everything seems to be going great..If you are sure it was poisoned (deliberately) you could get the one who poisoned it to give you another one and probably pay for the feeding until it grows up to the one that is said to be dead. People have no right to murder animals that don't deserve to be murderd.",
