  "content": "Hello Guys, Looking for a good , catchy and easy to recollect , domain name for a crypto exchange, which would be available to purchase , The shortlisted name would be given $30 worth of bitcoins .. Suggest as many names you can ...Would be more than happy to announce the shortlisted name here ... Any other query please feel free to ask ... Though $30 might be a small gesture as a token for your effort, but just think it may be a brain stormer for you to come up with something to think out of the box .. uniqueness prevails..",

      "body": "Probably not the answer you want — but probably don't overthink the domain name that much for now. Running an exchange successfully is hard enough in this overly saturated market. Having a great domain is great, but it's only a minor factor in the grand scheme of things.Also take note that if you actually make it successfully in the end, you could just rebrand or change domains to a better one.",

With that example, something like knightex.com or knightexchange.com would be far better options.",

      "body": "first, I don't know how good it is to publicly ask for suggestions for a brand name or to register a \"good\" domain. even if I happened to come across a very good slogan with a free domain, it's possible that I would register it for myself or even someone would grab it before your act. but let's ignore that.you should have some idea in which direction you want the name of your future business to go. I conclude from your request that the name must be related to Crypto and Exchange. now it is very hard to find it and it is free to use.you've already got a suggestion to look for something completely new. binance, celsius, huobi etc... until their appearance, these words were not synonymous with crypto or exchange. I would think in that direction.I would also like it to be one word and up to a maximum of 10 characters (less is better).As ETFbitcoin suggest business name generators, I would suggest a similar tool, which will immediately check your domain available for your chosen name.businessnamegenerator.comFor example \"cryptoadil\" where is cryptoadil.com available to register",
