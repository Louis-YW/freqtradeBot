Create that wallet in a safe environment, such as creating a new, clean, open source operating system next to your operating system, or using an old computer and making sure that you delete the old data and use an open source operating system.As for wallet options, you have Electrum and Sparrow (if you want easier integration with hardware wallets).",

Both of these wallets will be a good way to store your coins since your keys will be stored on your device. You will be required to carefully store the seed phrase so that it does not get to anyone other than you and also so that you can always have access to it if necessary.Perhaps the biggest danger would be if it turns out that developers have access to user keys, as was recently mentioned about the Ledger Nano X. Of course, they were only talking about the possibility of a backdoor for the Nano X model, but this alerted users anyway.",

What is your airgapped device? How is it airgapped?Although you can absolutely combined a hardware wallet with an airgapped device, the benefit from doing so is fairly marginal. If you have a truly airgapped and permanently airgapped computer, then using a software wallet such as Electrum or Sparrow is usually sufficient. If not, then an airgapped hardware wallet such as Passport will be the way to go instead.Quote from: Lida93 on October 02, 2023, 11:05:02 AMWhich Bitcoin wallet to use (by Lauda)  It gives explanation for any of those two wallet you are confused about , in addition to more other bitcoin wallets.I wouldn't recommend that thread anymore. It is three years out of date, and will only get worse as time goes on given Lauda is no longer active. It suggests wallets which no longer exist (such as Jaxx and Bread), it suggests wallets which are no longer recommended (such as Wasabi, Ledger, and Trezor), and it misses out some of the best wallets available (such as Sparrow and Passport).",

We have always worked in wallets online, like I TrustWallet, Metamask wallet, and many more. Although I didn't use the Trezor wallet I had read about it in some articles. And that is quite nice to use it offline. Also nowadays too many hackers are there, so there are a lot of possibilities to be hacked, but the Trezor wallet has a beneficial aspect in that the private key will not be shared with anyone, not on the internet.And more precisely, it doesn't require any customer fee at all, it is free to use. So, I think it would be a great choice to use it. I will also try to use its features.",

And what fee are you talking about? Each device has its own price, and each transaction you make on such a device also has its own fee.If you ever get the chance to use a hardware wallet, I advise you to try to understand some basic things before using it, because regardless of how good a device is, the human is usually the weakest link.",

Do you even read user responses? In your opinion, everything you wrote here completely discourages discussion on this topic. Do you really need help? Or merit?Sorry for my late reply @lovesmayfamilis I had some issues with my network service provider.I am new to the Linux interface however I do have some basic knowledge about software and operating systems so it wasn't very difficult for me to use the Linux OS.However I had a hard time installing the Linux software on my device but I was able to navigate through using some articles and YouTube videos I could not carry out the installation of the Linux software seamlessly I even had to do the installation twice.I used the Linux Ubuntu Os for the PC.For the air gapping I used a HP Compaq 6910p PC I disconnected the networking components but I left the USB components as it was the medium I used to carry out the Linux installation.I made this post because I really needed the help.after the air gapping process I got some contradictions on setting up a wallet. But with the help of these threads;https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html https://bitcoinelectrum.com/creating-a-cold-storage-wallet-in-electrum/I have been able to sort it out by using an electrum wallet on the air gapped device thank you all for the information.",
