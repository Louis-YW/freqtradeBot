I followed the LK-99 hype sometime ago that led to creation of several similarly themed cryptocurrencies. Also followed related events before that.But lately, I’ve found myself tilted more towards AI and seeing new AI coins pop up daily leaves me very excited again. Solidus' AITECH launch yesterday was one of such and I liked the exposure created by its listing on several big CEXs like Bitget, MEXC, etc. Bitget particularly played a huge part in that by initiating a depositors event with a $10k prize pool attached.

How well do you think aitech would perform in the next bull mrkt?No, I don't get moved by trends; I look at potentials and fundamentals, what the project can really do, and what the use case of that coin will be. Those are the kinds of things that I look at on a project and its coins before I venture into any of them. As there are most projects that use the trends happening around them to make a massive profit out of them without really having anything good in mind as to why they are really developing such projects,Another thing is that a project getting listed on an exchange does not completely make them genuine, as the exchanges are just there to make profit when people use their service. They can also still delist an already listed coin or token, and they won't be traded anywhere, so when making your choice of token always look beyond trending and where they are listed.This post appears to me like you promoting an exact project..",

Everything here work on trends, maybe it will be AI and it has been with us after the last bull run.And so with that, in order for them to flourish again, we need that bull run next year. But as a investor, not sure if this is a good project to put my money is. I would rather invest on solid altcoin.",

Hoping to see more of such in the coming days. I just try to take a look at the performance from AI tokens but most of tokens were stagnant. https://coinmarketcap.com/view/ai-big-data/You can see it by yourself. The thing that is happening to the solidus ai tech was just a usual pump and dump. This token was just getting listed recently. You may able to see a pump to happen soon. https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solidus-ai-techThe patter tells me that if the price may be increasing even higher. Early pump chance is coming.

It's caused the pump bitcoin will be triggering all of altcoins include solidus ai to be pumped. If you wanna put your money into the risk and do it with your own risk.",

Those were memecoins based on superconductor hype. They had no purpose what so ever.

Look at any coin/token that's pretending to do anything useful with big data or AI, hype is over. DALL·E 2 released in April 2022, that's when the hype started. and peaked because of chatgpt.

Of course, AI coins can continue to grow and spread further when a full-fledged bull market comes. You can make good money on this hype, This is the result of the changes in the world no doubt. If your review the staff strength of workforce of some companies regards to the number they were in last 10 years to what staff strength they have currently, you will see the past had more work force than the present, that means some of the positions occupied by human labour has been replaced by Al. Therefore, the point is the Al coins has a purpose it is fulfilling and it will continue to increase as long as companies keep chasing out staffs.Quote from: Xal0lex on August 31, 2023, 12:03:34 PMbut I do not recommend holding these tokens for many years, as it is just a hype, and any hype tends to end, and if you do not sell your valuable coins in time, then they will fall in price and you will lose all your income.This is a big mistake that people make, they think that the coin will keep raising but as soon as it went up, it will go down and even further than below the price you bought and soon the coins drops to no value and becomes useless in the wallet. People like hodling for long after reasonable profit but it is better to sell and DCA with your profit.",

So, it's high time for these devs to delve into this kind of project related to AI. However, just like NFTs, ICOs, and other crypto projects along these lines before had all their time and just eventually died down several months after. Though it did not totally disappear but it didn't enough recognition than it was before. I can definitely say, you could go ahead and have these kind of coins these days, but never hold onto it for as it will never be sustainable in the long run, considering the level of competition in the market and the trend.",
