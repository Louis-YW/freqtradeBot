MinerList Realistic Altcoin Profitability CalculatorsI was looking for more realistic ways to calculate Altcoin profitabilities, similar to the Braiins calculator and SmokingHopium.io (these calculators doesn't just spit out a yearly number based on today's profit, but lets you add all types of variables, including difficulty and price change over time).I didn't find anything so I created a few altcoin calculators myself. Some examples:https://www.minerlist.com/coin/kadena/calculatorhttps://www.minerlist.com/coin/ethereum-classic/calculatorhttps://www.minerlist.com/coin/zcash/calculatorAll Feedback is greatly appreciated!",

This would make the mining calculator can calculate the latest profitability with the latest data. I think the site is lack of coin/token can be mined since it's still less than 100 and the mining hardware is still not all listed yet.",

I didn't find anything so I created a few altcoin calculators myself:https://www.minerlist.com/coin/kadena/calculatorhttps://www.minerlist.com/coin/ethereum-classic/calculatorhttps://www.minerlist.com/coin/zcash/calculatorHi,Can you add EPIC? It is mineable mainly by CPU and GPU (ASIC too  but not really worth it)It might take some extra or different configuration in making a calculator because of how it works. But it's easy enough for me to calculate on a basic calculator so should be doable.  You would need to configure at least 2 calculations. One for CPU and one for GPU. You could do ASIC as well and for that just change the .48 multiplier to .04.I just typically do:  my hr / network hr * 1440 *.48 *block reward of 3.778 to find what should be my daily coin rewardsHere's a description of how EPIC Polyphasic PoW works:From the technical whitepaper describing Freeman deterministic polyphasic proof of work mining model:\"... We call this process \"feijoada\", after the traditional bean dish which all Brazillians, ourselves included, eat practically daily. The Feijoada procedure results in a deterministic sequence of ciphers, allowing consensus to be maintained easily. It also allows the policy to be reset every 100 blocks, which should be around 100 minutes given our target emission rate of one block per minute...\"Put another way, it's like a randomized round-robin distribution of blocks per mining Algorithm so that every 100 blocks 48 go to CPU, 48 to GPU, and 4 to ASIC.  It could go in sequence of CPU, CPU, GPU, GPU, ASIC... CPU, GPU, ASIC, CPU, GPU or any sequence but the amount will ultimately add up to an allocation of 48/48/4 CPU/GPU/ASIC until the Community DAO governance decides it should be changed.  In the previous era, the allocation was 60/38/2 CPU/GPU/ASIC.In other words, the mining algorithms 'take turns' throughout the epochs. There are software programs like SRBminer and ttminer that allows your hardware to mine other coins while not on EPIC",
